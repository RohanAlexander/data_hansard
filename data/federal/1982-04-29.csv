6,Mr INNES,POSTAL CHARGES,"Can the Minister for Communications inform the House whether the profit or loss for registered periodicals mail and ordinary mail was identical last year? If not, will he explain why both rates have risen by 12.5 per cent? If there is such an imbalance, does it mean that the user-pays principle has been jettisoned by the Government and users of ordinary mail are subsidising other users? Will the Minister inform the House of the profit and loss position of all types of mail upon which the new increases were based?",12
7,Mr SINCLAIR,POSTAL CHARGES,"I am delighted to see the improved standard of dress of the honourable gentleman. He is certainly lifting somewhat his appearance in this place and we welcome him in his other guise. As to the substance of the honourable gentleman's question, I am sure that many of the trade unions with which he and other members of the Opposition associate will be interested to see his suggestion that there should be an acceleration of the increase in charges for registered newspapers. As the honourable gentleman knows, a wide range of organisations has been given a concession because of their nature. Under the registered publications category that has meant that they have been able to maintain a far wider distribution list than perhaps their sources of funds would otherwise have permitted. Nonetheless, the Government is concerned, and certainly Australia Post is concerned, that under present arrangements registered publications do represent a very significant cost to Australia Post. They are, in fact, being subsidised by other services provided by Australia Post. But traditionally charges in that respect have increased only after six months notice has been given to those who benefit from that categorisation. The reason for the notice is that most are covered by annual or periodic subscriptions and if postal charges were to be increased immediately many of the organisations concerned would find themselves financially unable to continue to service their existing distribution lists. The Government is cognisant of the problems of Australia Post in this regard, but believes that the maintenance of assistance to these organisations is worthwhile. However, Australia Post has raised with me its concern about the level of the cross subsidy and the matter is still under consideration by the urgency in view of the fact that Government. in the private sector is a palFM BROADCASTING: TOWNSVILLE",12
8,Mr DEAN,POSTAL CHARGES,"I ask the Minister for Communications: Has he a telegram from me about the date of the commencement of Australian Broadcasting Commission frequency modulation broadcasting from Townsville? Secondly, can he advise whether a commencement date has been decided upon and, if so, whether transmission will start on that date?",12
9,Mr SINCLAIR,POSTAL CHARGES,"It is quite true that the honourable gentleman has not only sent me a telegram but for quite some time has been pestering me e-ery day at Question Time about when it will be possible to announce a commencement date for the national FM broadcasting station which will be located on Mount Stuart adjacent to the city of Townsville within the honourable gentleman's electorate. I am told that the site is identical to that of the national television transmitter for station ABTQ3 and will operate on a frequency of 101.5 MHz. Certainly, as a result of the honourable gentleman's initiatives the opening date has now been set at 1 June. I understand that shortly thereafter there is to be an official opening to try to encourage the local community to recognise the extended services that will be available from that FM station. The transmission will be stereophonic. Programs will originate in the studios of the ABC's FM headquarters located in Adelaide. They are to be relayed to the Townsville transmitter by land links. I am told that engineering test transmision has been designed to commence shortly before 1 June to try to ensure that all the facilities are in order by that date. It is expected that most areas which are presently receiving a satisfactory television service from ABTQ3 will also receive an FM service, although it is possible that an outdoor receiving aerial may be necessary in some of the reception area. I believe that this extension will provide for the honourable gentleman's area a very worthwhile extension of audio facilities. I am sure that his constituents will be delighted at the result. MINISTERS: INCOME GAINED FROM NA",12
10,Dr KLUGMAN,PERSONAL EXERTION,"I ask the Prime Minister whether he recalls sending a letter to his Ministers in 1976 stating, inter alia: Ministers may not accept retainers or income from personal exertion other than that laid down as their remuneration as Ministers and members of parliament. How is this principle applied in the case of Ministers who are primary producers?",12
11,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PERSONAL EXERTION,I have not undertaken personal exertion work on my farm probably for very many years.,13
12,Mr HAYDEN ,PERSONAL EXERTION,At any time.,13
13,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PERSONAL EXERTION,"The Leader of the Opposition is generous; he said 'at any time'. Other people play golf on Sundays. I look around the farm on Sundays; that is, if I am at home, which not very often. That is not really earning funds through personal exertion. NA",13
14,Mr DOBIE,COMMONWEALTH GAMES,I refer the Prime Minister to the fact that a special meeting has been called for next week in London by the Commonwealth Games authorities to secure a definite commitment from black African Commonwealth members that they will compete in the Brisbane Commonwealth Games in October this year. I ask the right honourable gentleman whether he is in a position to inform the House to what extent the good offices of his Government are being used to achieve the same result; namely the participation of all Commonwealth nations at the Brisbane Commonwealth Games.,13
15,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,COMMONWEALTH GAMES,"Obviously, it is our hope that all Commonwealth countries will participate in the Commonwealth Games. All honourable members of this House know the problems that have arisen over quite a considerable period. The meeting of the Commonwealth Games Federation was originally requested by Nigeria early in February. The Australian Commonwealth Games Association supported the calling of the meeting, as did many other Commonwealth countries and the Commonwealth Secretary-General, Mr Ramphal. I hope very much that the meeting on 5 May will be able to secure a solution to these matters. The honourable gentleman will know the degree to which Australia and Commonwealth countries place importance on the Gleneagles Agreement. I think the honourable gentleman would know the problems that there are around this question and there is no need for me to refer directly to them. There are ways in which I believe the attendance of all Commonwealth countries could be secured. Whether those ways are open to us I am not yet sure. NA",13
16,Mr COHEN,FRUIT AND VEGETABLE JUICES,"Has the attention of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs been drawn to a series of tests done by a team of scientists at Sydney University on 60 commercially available fruit and vegetable juices that revealed these products, with one exception, contained no more nutrients and about the same amount of sugar as ordinary soft drink? Is he aware that millions of Australians drink millions of gallons of fruit and vegetable juice in the belief that it is better for their health? Is this a view promoted by the juice manufacturers? Does this mean that Australians are being seriously misled by such companies? Finally, will he investigate Australian packaging and advertising of fruit juices and also ensure that the one product in the survey that was found to be beneficial to people's health is made known so that the public can purchase it?",13
17,Mr NA BROWN,FRUIT AND VEGETABLE JUICES,"As I understand the situation, the actual sale of fruit juice in Australia, so far as the degree of added sugar is concerned, is a matter which is regulated by State and Territory laws. The basis for that current law is along the lines of a finding of the National Health and Medical Research Council which indicated that, if a product is sold as fruit juice, it should not have more than 4 per cent of added sugar in the substance. However, it appears that, with some products on sale at the moment, there is in fact 10 per cent of added sugar. Of course, that is a matter for State laws and any breaches of those State laws would be a matter for the State authorities. However, the Federal Government does have a responsibility in this matter. There are at least three provisions of the Trade Practices Act which might compendiously be described as sections relating to misleading promotion of goods or substances for sale. In fact the Trade Practices Commission has turned its attention to the sale of fruit juices. I think it was in 1976 that the Trade Practices Commission issued a directive to the business community concerned with the sale of fruit and vegetable juices in which it drew the attention of the business community to the directive of the National Health and Medical Research Council and pointed out that, if fruit and vegetable substances were sold as juices and they contained an excess quantity of sugar, it could be a breach of the Trade Practices Act. That directive was issued by the Trade Practices Commission, I think in 1976, and I presume it was brought to the notice of those sections of the business community which were concerned with the sale of fruit and vegetable juice. However, in view of the specific issue which has arisen now, in the light of the surveyor investigation to which the honourable member referred, the matter has again been referred to the Trade Practices Commission to investigate the report and the research being· done to establish whether there have been breaches of the sections of the Trade Practices Act to which I referred and which relate to misleading advertising. The matter has also been referred to the Commonwealth Department of Health. So I have no doubt that the matters referred to by the honourable member will be specifically examined. NA",13
18,Mr IAN CAMERON,BEEF CARCASS CLASSIFICATION,I ask the Minister for Primary Industry to inform the House of the progress that has been made so far with the introduction of beef carcass classification. I ask this question because of the great interest in tion among beef producers in Maranoa.,14
19,Mr NIXON,BEEF CARCASS CLASSIFICATION,"I do not deny that there is great interest in this question among beef producers in Maranoa. I am sure that is true; but it is also true that producers in other parts of Australia are interested in the same question, not least the producers in Gippsland. There are conflicting views about classification. Some of the producers are very strongly in favour of it, and there are elements In the producer organisations that still have doubts about it. On the processing side of the industry, I think most of the processors have opposed meat classification. I am glad to say that some processors are providing classification services to producers on demand. There is available a system which has not yet been completely evaluated but which has been accepted by those who have tried it as being satisfactory to the producer organisations. There is no doubt that change will come in the meat industry on this front. Nobody can resist it, least of all the processors. They will be faced with classification whether they like it or not. That is my very strong view about it. The Australian Agricultural Council has taken the view that the classification scheme has been evaluated and evaluated successfully from most points of view, but that there has not yet been time for the results of that evaluation to spread throughout the industry and to get widespread acceptance of the industry for it. The Commonwealth Government has provided another $320,000 to the industry to assist in a national evaluation of the scheme so that, if a scheme is to be introduced on a national basis, at least it will be a common scheme right across Australia. I am sure that as the information passes throughout the industry there will be a much greater acceptance of the scheme. I think it is true to say that the pig industry is teaching the beef dustry a lesson when it comes to selling its product. That industry now sells by description on the farm without having to carry the product to the market place with all the bruising and attendant injuries and dangers. There is a lesson to be learned from that practice. I take the view that classification is on the way. NA Mr Barry Jones proceeding to address a question to the Minister for EducationMONICA",14
20,Mr SPEAKER,DISALLOWED QUESTION,The honourable gentleman is not entitled to make that statement. The question is out of order. Mr Barry Jones continuing to address a quesclassification to the Minister for EducationMONICA,14
21,Mr SPEAKER,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"The honourable gentleman is not entitled to impugn another member of the House except by way of a direct motion. Mr Barry Jones-Well, can I withdraw the last past of the question?",14
22,Mr SPEAKER,DISALLOWED QUESTION,I call the honourable member for Barton.,14
23,Mr HAYDEN ,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"I take a point of order. Your ruling seems to me to be an inconsistency. On other occasions you have required that that portion of a question which you have found to be unacceptable in parliamentary terms be deleted or ignored but you have allowed the substance of the question acceptable in parliamentary terms to proceed. I would suggest that in these circumstances, especially as the honourable member for Lalor has accepted your intervention and will withdraw the comment, the remainder of the question be allowed to stand.",14
24,Mr SPEAKER,DISALLOWED QUESTION,The reason I have ruled the question out of order is that on occasions when there has been a breach of Standing Orders by a question but there has been a substantial request for information I have allowed that part of the question to stand which is in order. I have not on this occasion because it must be well known to the honourable member for Lalor that he is not entitled to use a question in order to impugn any individual member of the House. The only way that can be done is in a direct motion. Therefore the question is out of order.,14
25,Mr HAYDEN ,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"Mr Speaker, let me put a contrary view to you. The substance of what the honourable member has raised is very serious and the Minister ought to take the opportunity of either deflecting it by rejecting it or confessing it is correct, as it seems to be on the face of what the inhonourable member says, in which case further action could be taken. But it is very proper for this sortof-MONICA",14
26,Mr SPEAKER,DISALLOWED QUESTION,Order! The honourable member is now arguing the issue of the question and not the Standing Orders.,14
27,Mr HAYDEN ,DISALLOWED QUESTION,It is very proper for this sort of matter to be raised at Question Time so that further action can be determined. It would be-MONICA,15
28,Mr SPEAKER,DISALLOWED QUESTION,The honourable gentleman will resume his seat. Of course the matter can be raised at Question Time but as the question was put in the form it was I will not permit it. I call honourable member for Barton. SYDNEY (KINGSFORD-SMITH) AIRPORT: AIRCRAFT NOISE,15
29,Mr BRADFIELD,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"Is the Minister for Transport aware of a recent Press article in a Sydney newspaper which referred to a supposed 'fresh study on aircraft noise' at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport? Does the report exist and, if so, are the reported contents correct?",15
30,Mr HUNT ,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"I am a ware of that Press report in the Daily Mirror. There is no substance in the report. No such study, either here or overseas, has produced the suggested results. The Government is, however, very concerned about noise in and around airports throughout the country. Indeed, we have set up noise abatement committees around all our capital city airports. I have made it very clear in statements I have made on the question that there will be no relaxation of any curfew unless there is a reduction in the noise level to the surrounding community. Because of the general concern about this matter I have decided to make a reference on aircraft noise to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation. There has not been such an inquiry by this Parliament for some years. In the community interest I think one would be an excellent idea. The Government has also had under srudy the advantages of the new wide bodied aircraft, the new generation aircraft, to ascertain the noise levels that they are generating. They are, of course, less noisy than the existing aircraft on most routes. The question is under study. There is no truth in the report and I would be grateful if the honourable member would convey that message to his constituents. NA NA",15
31,Mr MORRIS,COMMITTEE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and relates to his statement yesterday that he neither supported nor opposed a submission of his Department to the Independent Air Fares Committee. As the submission conflicts with the Minister's action in raising Canberra air fares by some 38 per cent last April, I ask: Who approved and authorised the submission lodged by his Department with the Independent Air Fares Committee? As the Department of the Capital Territory submission also conflicts with the air fare policy that the Minister has espoused on behalf of the Government, was that submission cleared by him or his Department? Finally, since by his own statement yesterthe day he has obviously lost responsibility for domestic aviation policy, who in this Government is responsible for domestic aviation policy?",15
32,Mr HUNT,COMMITTEE,"I was aware that the Department was preparing a submission for the Independent Air Fares Committee investigation into costs allocation. Indeed, all departments and all sections of the community were invited to make submissions to that inquiry. I decided that it would be of advantage to that Committee to have the benefit of the views of the Department of Transport in respect of the way in which the allocation of component costs can be made. The Department has been involved in air fares determinations for many years. I have no objection whatsoever to allowing it to submit its own independent advice to that Committee. NA NA",15
33,Mr CHAPMAN,PEOPLE,I direct a question to the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs. Are wages for young people now too high? Is this factor preventing growth in job opportunities for young people? What will the Government do to ensure that the discipline of market forces applies more effectively to youth wage rates so that economic growth will be reflected in increased jOb opportunities for young people by employers being able to take on more employees rather than by having to pay higher wages?,15
34,Mr NA BROWN,PEOPLE,"It is true that on a number of occasions people interested in this subject have pointed to youth wage rates which, it has been said, are in fact too high and have acted as a disincentive to employers to employ more young people. There is a fair amount of mythology with respect to this subject. There are views on both sides of the argument. Certainly one hears, from one's own experience, of complaints or comments by employers to the effect that they have terminated young people from their employment when wages have been increased on the ground that it is uneconomical to employ them at the rates prevailing. It has also been said that the proportion of the adult wage which is paid to young people these days is itself a disincentive and is discouraging employers from retaining young people on their staff and from employing more young people. I do not reach any positive conclusions about that. What I have done is this: The matter is obviously of concern to the Government as is the whole employment situation of young people. One of the bodies under the responsibility of my Department is the Bureau of Labour Market Research which, as the name implies, investigates regularly, both on the basis of sponsored outside research and internal research within the Bureau, all matters relating to the labour market. It does seem to me that, because of opposing views and arguments about the effect on youth employment of youth wage rates, this is a matter that should properly investigated as a research project. Accordingly, I have directed that the Bureau of Labour Market Research investigate all matters relating to this subject. This will involve a proper research project with respect to youth participation rates; the size of the youth labour force; changes that have taken place in the youth labour force; the connection, if any, which can be identified between the degree of youth employment and unemployment on the one hand and wage rates payable to young people on the other; and other matters, such as the proportion of adult wages paid to young people under current awards and determinations. As I said, some people in the community have advanced very strongly the argument that it is the current wage rate payable to young people which is deterring the employment of more young people. As long as there is the slightest suggestion that that might be the case it is proper that it should be investigated thoroughly so that we have the real facts and not what people imagine to be the facts. The Government can then, through the appropriate tribunals and other appropriate avenues, take whatever action can be taken to increase the employment opportunities for young people. NA NA",15
35,Mr WALLIS,WHYALLA,"Is the Minister for Administrative Services aware of the fragmented nature of a number of Commonwealth departments at Whyalla in South Australia, especially the Department of Social Security? Is he aware also that Whyalla, the second largest city in South Australia and the largest city in the Grey electorate, is the only major provincial city which has no Commonwealth complex housing all Commonwealth departments? Will he give an indication as to when it is proposed to provide such a complex at Whyalla, especially in view of the heavy work load placed on the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service as a result of the Government's policies?",16
36,Mr NEWMAN,WHYALLA,"The plans for building various Commonwealth buildings around the Commonwealth are something that I am giving great attention to at the moment. Of course, some areas have priority over others. I am afraid that the Whyalla area does not have a priority. NA",16
37,Mr FISHER,EXPORT OF CITRUS FRUITS,Will the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Resources inform the House and the Australian citrus industry whether be any progress has been made in gaining access for Australian citrus to the Japanese market?,16
38,Mr ANTHONY,EXPORT OF CITRUS FRUITS,"For a number of years I have been making representations to the Japanese to see whether we can get our oranges into Japan, particularly our washington navels and valencias. Unfortunately, because of the presence in Australia of Queensland and Mediterranean fruit fly, we have never been able to get past its quarantine regulations. We have, of course, been exporting oranges to a good many other countries and now, with much more effective means of fumigation, we have been able to meet the requirements of still other countries. However, I have been notified that yesterday a public hearing in Japan heard Australia's case. Through Japanesp, officials the industry's proposals were put forward, indicating that now we have very effective means of satisfying Japan's quarantine regulations and that we are using chemicals which we believe can be approved under Japanese quarantine laws. If this hearing proves satisfactory I am very hopeful that we will be able to get oranges into Japan for the coming season. However, the inquiry is not the final stage in this issue; the matter will still have to be referred to the Japanese Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. I am hoping that the outcome of the inquiry will mean that we can at last get some of our oranges into the Japanese market. NA",16
39,Mr HAYDEN,PERSONAL INCOME TAX,"Has the Prime Minister noted a letter from Mr Eric Risstrom of the Australian Taxpayers Association to all members of this Parliament setting out estimates of growth in personal income tax receipts for 1982-83 and, in particular, a $5,200m increase in personal income tax receipts in that year? In view of the clear evidence of a serious economic decline in the economy, is it a fact that significant tax cuts would responsibly improve demand and, therefore, economic activity at a time when the Prime Minister is constantly talking of not recession but depression? Therefore, I ask: In view of the huge increase in income tax revenue in the forthcoming fiscal year, will the Prime Minister give a firm commitment now to substantial income tax cuts in the forthcoming Budget?",16
40,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PERSONAL INCOME TAX,"The Leader of the Opposition used the words 'recession' and 'depression'. He needs to know-I am sure he does know-that a definition of depression is a situation in a country where there has been a reduction in output for two or more quarters. I think that is the generally accepted definition of the word 'depression'. Quite contrary to what is happening in a number of other countries, the Australian economy has been and is growing. That needs to be clearly understood. As to the other parts of the honourable gentleman's question, I welcome the economic advice that he offers. INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS: MARITIME NA",17
41,Mr JARMAN,AND STEVEDORING INDUSTRIES,"I address my question to the Minister for Industrial Relations. In view of and following the consideration of industrial relations at the February Premiers Conference, can the Minister inform the House whether there has been any improvement in recent times in the maritime and stevedoring industries in Australian ports?",17
42,Mr VINER,AND STEVEDORING INDUSTRIES,"There had been some improvement until the recent tug-boat dispute with which, regrettably, most ports in Australia are tied up. Although that dispute is one concerning wagesobviously the Commonwealth Steamship Owners Association has its own reasons for opposing the claim that has been made upon it-it is to be regretted that the unions will not take their claim to arbitration to have it settled if they cannot get agreement, instead of resorting to industrial action of a kind which is holding up shipping in Australian ports. I am advised that there is a hearing on the matter before Commissioner Turbet today. I hope that that hearing will produce better results than earlier hearings have. The situation in the ports and the result of the hearing before Commissioner Turbet will be watched very closely. However, I take this opportunity to advise the House that a very important meeting will be held tomorrow in Sydney as a result of an initiative taken at the February Premiers Conference. At that meeting the Premiers expressed concern at the kind of disruption in Australian ports that was experienced almost throughout last year. I referred this question to Ministers for labour at their March meeting. At that meeting I invited all the State Ministers for labour to join with me in calling a conference of employer and union interests. I sent out invitations to both sides of the industry to attend the conference in Sydney tomorrow. It will be the first time that such a wide cross-section of the employer and union interests have come together in a conference to deal specifically with the maritime and waterfront industries. The Australian Council of Trade Unions has agreed to coordinate the attendance of all the unions. Twentytwo unions have been invited. On the employer side, eight major employer organisations are to attend. These include the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour, the Australian Maritime Employers Association, the Commonwealth Steamship Owners Association, the Australian Chamber of Shipping, the Marine and Ports Council of Australia and the Confederation of Australian Industry. One ought not to expect instant answers to the kind of industrial disruption that we have seen in Australian ports. But what I think is important is that we call these parties together and give them an opportunity, at a major conference, to talk about the issues and put forward suggestions which might in the short term provide solutions but certainly in the long term will provide a foundation upon which further consultation between government, employers and the unions can proceed. I should also mention that my colleague the Minister for Transport will be talking with unions and employers today with regard to the report of the Crawford Committee of Revitalisation of the Australian Shipping Industry, and he will be attending the conference tomorrow and reporting to that conference. I think this ought to be regarded as a most constructive move in the area of consultation in this vital industry, the lifeline of Australian international trade. Improvements need to be achieved there, and I am grateful that, at the highest level of employer and union ranks, people have seen the need for this conference and are approaching it constructively. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE: IMPORTS",17
43,Mr KERIN,AND STEVEDORING INDUSTRIES,"Is the Minister for Primary Industry aware of allegations and fears with respect to importation of rice which may not be disease free? What quarantine and hygiene measures are required for such imports, and has the Minister taken any action in this matter? In general, is the Minister aware of increasing protests by primary producers with respect to imports of products ranging from cheese to fish, pineapples, lychees, mangoes, mushrooms, potatoes and nearly every horticultural product? Has the Minister taken any action in these matters?",17
44,Mr NIXON,AND STEVEDORING INDUSTRIES,"Earlier this year I met members of the Queensland Rice Marketing Board and, at the request of the honourable member for Riverina, in March some time. I met representatives of the New South Wales rice industry to discuss the aspects of the rice industry that the honourable member has raised. I think there are two points of concern being expressed by both of those groups. One relates to a concern that there might be growing imports of rice, competing with the long grain rice grown particularly in New Zealand, as a result of a drop in the international price. As far as I am aware, certainly at that point there had been no change in the level of imports of rice over the years. We are keeping that monitored so that we can be properly informed on that aspect of the matter. In respect of the concern about disease, I have this morning received a telex message from New South Wales, from Mr Davidge, expressing concern and making allegations that the quarantine regulations in respect of rice are breaking down. This is a matter for the Minister for Health. Having only just received the telex message this morning, I shall be taking up this matter with the Minister for Health to check whether there has been any breakdown in the quarantine regulations. The honourable member will know that, in respect of all the products that he mentioned, Australia has the strictest quarantine regulations in the world, and I am certainly anxious that they be upheld. NA",18
45,Mr LUSHER,AUSTRALIAN SHIPPING INDUSTRY,I refer the Minister for Transport to the recently available Crawford report on the revitalisation of the Australian shipping industry. Is the Minister taking any action to ensure that that industry becomes more competitive?,18
46,Mr HUNT,AUSTRALIAN SHIPPING INDUSTRY,"This afternoon I shall be presiding over a meeting of the maritime unions and the shipping companies, plus some representatives of export groups, including the Australian Manufacturers Export Council, to initiate the negotiations that will take place between the shipping companies and the unions in respect of the recommendations of the Crawford report on the revitalisation of the Australian shipping industry. The Government has considered the report and has authorised me to commence negotiations with the parties involved. We hope that we will achieve agreement between the shipowners and the unions in respect of more commercial manning levels on vessels. I hope that with the support of Sir John Crawford, who will be involved in those negotiations, we will have a response by mid-July. I am pleased with the degree of good will that is being shown by the maritime industry-by the unions and also by the shipping companies. So I hope that those negotiations will be successful and that we will see a revitalised Australian shipping industry. NA NA",18
47,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,DEALS,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer the honourable gentleman to evidence and reports of allegations of international arms dealings involving a number of countries including Australia and the merchant banking groups of Ward, Knight and Dunn and Nugan Hand. As these alleged deals have involved transfers of foreign currency into and out of Australia, which would normally require Reserve Bank exchange control approval, will the Prime Minister please request the Reserve Bank to review its exchange control approval records to see whether in fact any such transfers took place?

49,Mr BURR,ORGANISED CRIME,"My question also is directed to the Prime Minister. Having regard to the concern that is presently being expressed at the effect of organised crime in Australia, has the Government made any attempt to estimate the quantum of money flowing through the organised criminal economy? If the money circulating in the criminal economy could be assessed for taxation, what effect would it have on the Commonwealth Budget?",18

51,Mr YOUNG,GIFTS TO MINISTERS,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his electorate talk of 12 March 1978 in which he stated that Ministers who receive gifts of more than a token nature must have them valued and are then given the opportunity to purchase them. Can the Prime Minister provide the House with a specific description of gifts he has received, who valued them and whether or not he has purchased those gifts? Can he inform the House whether there are any gifts to him which have not been valued and for which the purchase price has not been paid? If so, can he tell us where these gifts are presently located?",18
52,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,GIFTS TO MINISTERS,"The policy is being applied. At the same time. I hope that the honourable gentleman will understand that there will never at any time be an intention to publish lists of this kind because if a gift has been offered to a Minister or to a Prime Minister it is perfectly plain that we would be publishing who has made that gift available, who has offered it and the value of it. If it is a government-to-government gift it would be utterly offensive to publish in the Parliament that kind of information. I think the honourable gentleman needs to understand that before that policy was introduced a policy of accepting gifts, no matter from where they came, was practised by previous governments. The honourable gentleman should know that it is just not possible to accede to the request he has made having regard to normal and decent relations between governments. NA",19

58,Mr SCHOLES ,PROCUREMENT,"Corio)-by leave-I cannot agree with the assessment of the Minister for Defence ( Mr Killen) of the functions of this Parliament or of its committees. The reason why concern has been expressed about the non-compliance with the statement of the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) relating to answers to committee reports is that this is an extremely sensitive and important area of government activity. It involves very large sums of expenditure. This money can be spent to the benefit of Australian industry and it also can be spent badly because very few checks are made on the decision-making processes. There is very little public information on the decision-making processes and there is oft repeated concern about the processes adopted on a number of occasions when procuring defence force equipment. The defence area is somewhat concerned-I believe a number of Australian industries are also-that the decision-making process is not clear or decisive and is not able to be relied on by Australian industry and by those people who would seek to supply defence equipment. The Minister's response will be of interest to this House and, I believe, of interest to the Australian community, particularly those sections of industry and business which are or which see themselves as being in a position to participate in defence purchases and sales but at the moment believe that they are excluded because of procedures which do not meet the requirements of the Australian market-place and because of serious tardiness on a number of occasions-this was shown in evidence before that Committee-in decision-making processes which would make it easier for Australian industry to participate on an equal basis. I am pleased that the Minister has at last replied to that report. I disagree with that parliamentary committees should not investigate matters as serious and as important-this is a recurring theme-to the Australian economy and to Australia's welfare as the procurement methods by which the Government expends moneys allocated by this Parliament for defence equipment.

The report is not accurate; it is not an accurate account of the question I asked. 'Deferential' is defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary as 'showing respect'. My question called for no loss of respect for Her Majesty the Queen, nor did it deal in any way with the role of the sovereign as enshrined in the Australian Constitution. What I sought was an end to the anachronistic appeals from State courts to the Privy Council in Britain and also reform of the Statute of Westminster of 1931, which makes some State parliaments in some areas subordinate to British legislation.

71,Mr BEAZLEY ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Swan) (10.58)-My grievance today concerns developments at Perth Airport. Specifically, it concerns a master plan about to be publicly revealed. It has been reported that Department of Transport officials have suggested that, of four options recently presented to the public, the master plan will choose one which will develop the airport on the basis of the current runway system; that is, a north-south runway and an east-west runway. Such a recommendation would delay the development of a parallel north-south runway for 20 to 30 years. At that point, when the relocation of the airport should be the principal concern of the Government, that relocation will be obviated by the argument that all problems will be overcome by the construction then of a parallel runway. This recommendation will fly in the face of the opinions of local governedly ment authorities adjacent to the airport. It flies the face of the weight of public opinion on the matter expressed in petitions presented to me to this House, at a public meeting recently held in Guildford and in' correspondence columns of the local Press. It will not be accompanied by certain measures to compensate for the environmental damage caused by that decision. Yet the Department of Transport will justify its ultimate decision in part on the recommendation of a joint committee consisting of representatives of the Department, other Commonwealth departments, State departments and local authorities which reported on developments at Perth Airport in 1979. That committee recommended that were developments to proceed without a parallel runway measures for compensation should be introduced. Further, it made no recommendation for development at the airport beyond the year 2004, leaving open the question of relocation after that date. A master plan that assumes that at that point what will happen will be the development of a parallel runway pre-empts that consideration. It must be remembered that the local authorities, in placing their complaints before the Commonwealth Government, have assumed the retention of the airport. It would have been very easy for local councils such as those of Belmont and Canning to have placed themselves at the head of a popular movement to remove the airport. They have not done that. They have chosen instead to co-operate with the Department of Transport and to seek serious consideration of measures they propose which would lessen the environmental impact of airport developments on their citizens. They quite reasonably expect that the Government will measure these environmental concerns and include them in a calculation of the costs of the various options for development. Given the accommodating attitude of the councils, it is the very least that the Government could do. Put simply, the local residents and councils have sought a parallel runway for two main reasons: Firstly, the numbers of residents affected by aircraft noise will be markedly less than with reliance on existing runway systems; secondly, location of the new international terminal between parallel runways would reduce the impact of required new road systems in residential areas, which will be considerable if a terminal is to be located at the northern end as currently intended. In the public arguments that have occurred to date official figures have been rubbery, to say the least. The assessments of the joint committee published in 1979 have been changed quite markby the Department of Transport as its own in case has been presented. Where they have not been changed they have been presented in a more favourable light. Given some of the distortions that have occurred in the presentation of the Department's case to which I have referred earlier in this House, I am inclined to the more disinterested assessments put forward by the joint committee. For example, in discussing the question of the number of houses to be affected by noise levels under the two options, the Department of Transport argued that if the present runway system were to be retained the number of houses affected by maximum variable noise levels would shrink from 6,000 now to 3,500 by the year 2000; with a new parallel runway the figure would be 2,500 by the year 2000. Two things are wrong with this proposition: Firstly, the assessment of shrinkage is based on the assumption that despite massively increased usage aircraft will be so much quieter by the year 2000 that the number of houses affected will be reduced. There is a tendency to quieter aircraft, which may reduce the number of residences affected. However, they will be affected more often by noise levels if a single runway is used than if usage is split between two runways. Further, the actual noise level reductions from new planes are not quantifiable at this stage. Secondly, the question of what constitutes tolerable noise levels is imprecise at this ment and if a measure is used which calculates a substantial impact vastly greater areas must be included than those which have appeared so far on the maps of noise footprints that have been circulated publicly by the Department of Transport. I prefer the joint committee's figures. They suggest that in the year 2000, 4,023 residences, five schools and one hospital will be affected by the maximum bearable levels of noise if the current runway system is retained-as opposed to 1,563 residences, two schools and one hospital if a new parallel runway is developed. It must be said that this margin of additionally affected houses has been used by Transport Australia to justify a whole new airport in Brisbane. I use those figures merely to justify a new parallel runway at the current Perth Airport. In the matter of aircraft movements we find further divergences. In a letter to me, which was critical of the petition which I presented in this place, the Minister for Transport ( Mr Hunt) argued that the petitioners' assessment that total annual aircraft movement would double over the next 14 years was inaccurate. He said that between 1980 and 1995 the figure would be about 25 per cent. He pointed to a total of 64,118 aircraft movements in 1980 which would increase to an anticipated 87,450 in 1995. That, in fact, is a 33 per cent increase. Let us look again at the joint committee. The committee suggested that by 1980 a total of 62,300-that was actually an underestimate-aircraft movements would be recorded, going to a total of 133,300 by the year 1994. That is more than double. The petitioners were relying on the Department of Transport figures that had been revealed to the joint committee and oresented, as I said, in a more disinterested atm'osphere. Whichever is correct, or if the answer lies somewhere in-between, the real value of the parallel runway is that it will ensure that those suburbs which bear the brunt of traffic movement now, particularly Guildford, Belmont and Cloverdale, will be relieved of some of that burden. The areas affected by a new parallel runway are largely non-residential. It must also be remembered that Transport Australia plans extensions to the eastwest runway in the light of its preferred option. These extensions will enable the runway to carry most of the aircraft currently carried by the north-south runway, ensuring that if there are obstacles on one runway the airport can still be fully utilised. This development would not need to take place with a parallel north-south runway. However if it proceeds it will significantly affect of Belmont, going into Rivervale and Victoria moPark at the western end of that runway, and parts of Hazelmere and Midland at the eastern end. All of these areas are heavily inhabited. The question of road systems is also important. A parallel runway requires the development of a terminal building in the centre of the airport as opposed to the current intention to locate it at the northern end. The noise generated by aircraft taxi-ing over 4 kilometres to the northern site would be unbearable in the middle of the night as well as wasteful of fuel. With a terminal located in the centre, access to it would be directly into the freeway network in the Kewdale industrial area and not among houses in Redcliffe. As the usage increases considerable strains will be placed on current road systems if the changes which I have suggested are not made. The Government has made some concessions on timing to those of us who have been interested in the question. The Government has withheld developments until the production of the master plan. It must be said, however, that this course was recommended anyway by the joint committee, whose views the Department has readily accepted when it has suited it. If the Government does not intend to accept the views of local citizens on the parallel runway, I plead with it to accept other submissions that have been put forward. The joint committee has recommended compensation. A public meeting which was held on the airport question endorsed the suggestion regarding householders affected. Such legislation is already in place in Britain. It has been recommended here by the Australian Law Reform Commission. The Minister says that his Government is still considering it. Could he conclude his consideration and legislate? There is strong local demand for a curfew at the airport. Other airports have them; why not us? Will the Government also keep open the option of relocation after 2004? The Government has not justified its current assumption that the airport will continue in its current location after that date. The Government will not find its justification in the joint committee's study. Will the Government keep pressing the State Government of Western Australia to participate in airfields committee so that regular consultation between local, State and Commonwealth authorities can take place on airport development and the needs of neighbouring residents?",21
72,Mr SHIPTON ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Higgins) (11.9)-Today I want to comment on the reported statements by Sir William Gunn about his plans to revitalise the more beef industry in Australia. I believe that Sir William has in the past done a great job for Australia in the wool industry. However, I think on this occasion some of his comments have the potential to do the beef industry in this country great deal of harm. Some of his ideas should be pursued but others are positively disastrous and dangerous. His proposal to divert meat from the North American market has serious implications for our existing trade with the United States of America. He is right to say that we must develop new markets but I cannot for the life of me see why he wants to give away an important existing market such as the United States. A person in his position should not make comments like this because it can only.give heart to our competitors, United States cattlemen and producers in other countries who have their eyes on the lucrative United States trade. A basic rule of marketing and selling is not to give one's opponents an opportunity to steal one's market. Regrettably, I think that ammunition to our competitors. I do not agree with his comments concerning the abolition of saleyard marketing of cattle. This may be appropriate in some markets in Australia, but certainly it is not applicable to many cattle markets in this country where the types of cattle vary enormously. For instance, it would be totally inappropriate to abolish sale yard sales in Victoria which have a new impetus now that live weight selling has been introduced. I see that Sir William's plan includes a proposal to establish a meat testing and grading authority along the lines of the Australian Wool Testing Authority. This idea might have some potential but I am disappointed that Sir William did not concentrate in his announced plan on more ideas to improve the beef product and its marketing. The beef industry needs measures to improve and create more demand for the product. If merchandising methods are improved, demand will increase and obviously the returns to producers will increase through increased demand. I am concerned about Sir William Gunn's proposal to develop a single selling body to control prices. The industry should be concentrating on increasing demand for its product. This proposal to develop a single selling authority or body is fact putting the cart before the horse. Increasing demand is the only way to increase prices. This is a basic rule of market force economics. Market forces must be allowed to work through increased demand. I consider that the quality of beef served in restaurants and available in butcher shops would be improved by the introduction of a beef grading system. This is a solution that I would put to solve some of the difficulties that the beef industry in Australia is facing today. Australia produces some of the world's best beef but the Ausa tralian consumer is not necessarily reaping the benefits. I would hope that supermarkets, restaurants and butchers would welcome the introduction of a grading system. A grading system, similar to that which has been successful in the United States, should in my view be introduced in Australia. That system allows tenderness, flavour and palatability to be objectively measured. It should be designed to bring to the top grade the most flavoursome and tender meat and it would force processors and distributors to handle meat which automatically ensures these qualities. Above all it would increase demand for beef. Consumers should have the right to choose the quality of the beef meat they are buying and the protection of knowing that they are getting what they are paying for. Under a grading system, as I propose it, predictability of quality is the most imSir William has given portant item. A beef grading system should not be confused with beef classification, which is often talked about. As I see it they are totally different. Classification schemes do not state that one meat carcass is better than or superior to another. Classification concerns only the age, weight, sex and fat cover of beef. I do not consider that the housewife or consumer is at all interested in the age, weight or sex of the animal from which the beef comes. They are interested only in value and quality. The present experimentation of beef classification systems does not affect the quality of the beef carcass, and, in my view, will not increase demand for the beef produced or improve the quality of beef for the consumer. A grading system would take the present luck of the draw out of purchasingbeef. I believe that the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation ought to do more to encourage and promote the consumption of beef in Australia by introducing a voluntary grading system. The grading system might also have the advantage of reducing the risk of substitution. Approximately half of the total beef market in Australia is domestic. I think the Corporation needs to put a greater effort into promoting the beef product in in the home market. I believe that with the introduction of a grading system for the domestic market, consumers in Australia could then make an informed value judgment about the meat they are buying, and all would be better off. In the time remaining I would like to raise a defence procurement item. I propose and advocate the purchase by the Government of mid-air tanker refuelling aircraft for the Royal Australian Air Force. I consider it important for the Air Force to have the capacity to refuel our Fill aircraft and the proposed new F 18A fighter aircraft in mid-air. Such a capacity to refuel in flight would extend the operational range of our fighter aircraft. One lesson of the Falklands Islands dispute is that the British lack .air - up-rior-ty. Australia must never be placed In thiS SituatIOn and I consider it imperative that tankers be acquired. It is interesting to note that one of the factors that the British fleet steaming to the Falklands faces is the fact that the Argentinians have two Lockheed CI30 tanker aircraft which must extend enormously the range of their fighters. The acquisition by the Air Force of two second hand Boeing 707s capable of being refitted as tankers in my view is essential. I believe that such aircraft are available on the world market. I do not think they would be expensive as in the current market they could be obtained for approximately $3m each. After refitting, they could be integrated with the RAAF's existing Boeings. Tankers give an air force a number of advantages. They act as a force multiplier. F?r example, an aircraft may be able to carry eight 500 lb bombs with full fuel on a 1,000 mile mission. However, if an aircraft can take off with half the fuel and 16 bombs and there is a mid-air refuelling capacity, we effectively double its bomb-car.rying capacity. The advantage of extended range IS obvious. I would have thought it is now more important than ever to have this capabili-y, especially now that we have purchased a new aircraft carrier. The purchase of the Invincible, which is to be HMAS Australia, makes it imperative that we extend the range of our fighters to protect it. The capacity to refuel mid-air will the Air Force greater range air support to HMAS Australia. The lack of air support to a carrier such as the Invincible must restrict its activity. Mid-air refuelling tankers would also give the Air Force increased mobility. At present aircraft have to land and refuel and extra bases and air strips need to be manned and used. If mid-air refuelling tankers are involved, the tankers could go with the other aircraft, the fighters and the bombers. They could all take off and land together and there would be less need for ground support. In the event of a fighter or forecast to close because of bad weather, eration would not have to cease if there was the capacity to put a tanker up and mid-air refuel. This is a definite advantage, The operation could continue and an alternative landing air strip could be used because of the extended range of the aircraft. I ask the Minister for Defence ( Mr Killen) urgently to consider this proposal.",22
73,Mrs DARLING ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Lilley)(11.l8)-I would like to bring a problem to the attention of the House and to the community at large, one which has had scant publicity to date and which has left tens of thousands of Australians in hopeless despair. The problem is extensive and prolonged unemployment amongst middle aged and older members of the work force. Over the last few years Australia has witnessed a growing void in the work place-a black hole engulfing workers who have found themselves unemployed but too old to find work and too young to retire. The evidence is that older unemployed workers have become severely disadvantaged in relation to others in the ranks of the unemployed. It is high time the Government undertook a special survey into the needs of these people and perhaps even initiated a support scheme along the lines of the Community Youth Support Scheme for unemployed youths, - hould that be indicated. Jobs are needed, but until a responsible government takes steps to create them the special support needs of the older unemployed must not be neglected. There is a new breed of unemployed worker in Australia and it is up to t-is Government to recognise this fact and change ItS policies accordingly. The nature and extent ?f.-n­ employment in this country and the responsibility of the Federal Government for the situation have already been thoroughly canvassed in this House in recent months by my colleague the honourable member for Wills ( Mr Hawke). He and other members of the Opposition have also pointed to the growing problems being experienced by older unemployed workers. I should now outline the specific problems give being experienced by this group. Stricker and Sheehan in their recent book on hidden unemploymen't in Australia, spelled out most succinctly the problem of displacement of older persons from the work force. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard pages 106 and 107 of their book, in which they argue that this displacement is creating personal and social problems requiring support. Leave granted. The document read asfollowsPart II The incidence of hidden unemployment base being closed CHAPTER 6 an op- DISPLACEMENT OF OLDER PERSONS The virtues and drawbacks of advancing years are matters of interest to every human being, and everyone has views about the effects of ageing on work performance and employability. Some will argue that old-r pe?ple are less vigorous and less adaptable to new work situations and to new technology, others will stress the greater experience and reliability of older workers. What is more, older workes will have more seniority and will the work situation, but they may for just these reasons be more costly to employ than younger workers. Such differences in emphasis being commonplace, there can be no clear a prior presumption about the differential effects on various age groups of a major deterioration be that, because of their greater seniority and experience, older workers maintain their jobs better in a downturn so that the burden of unemployment falls on younger persons. This has to be the case in institutions the universites, where lifetime historical data discussed in Chapter 3 suggest, this seems to have been the case in Australia as a whole in the Depression of the 1930s. It is also true that in the second half of the 1970s recorded unemployment rates tended to decline with age. On the other hand, it may now be the case that, with changing attitudes to age and experience and with greater emphasis on technology and on educational standards, older employees are especially vulnerable when the demand for labour falls away. Indeed the thesis of this chapter is that, when a more comprehensive view of the labour market is taken than is provided by recorded unemployment that older workers have been displaced from employment and moved into unemployment in great numbers over the past five years. Together with teenagers, the brunt of the continuing recession been males and females over 45 years, employment having declined much more sharply for these than for any other age groups. The average duration of recorded unemployment is also much higher for these individuals our view this displacement of ating personal and social problems comparable to those being generated by unemployment among teenagers. That these problems are not more widely recognised is due to the fact that the displacement of older drawal from the workforce into hidden unemployment, rather than being reflected in recorded unemployment. If an unskilled man of 58 years of age loses his job, his propects of finding work in the current environment are bleak. Consequently, after a fruitless period to find some means of support ment rather than to continue actively searching for work in a highly competitive labour market. The evidence to be presented below indicates that this has been happening on a major scale in Australia over the past five years. The phenomenon of displacement The simplest and most dramatic way in which the displacement of older persons can be persons in full-time employment, although the phenomenon is still present if part-time employment is included. The changes which have taken place in the age structure of employment over recent years are quite remarkable. In the seven years to August 1980 full-time male employment grew by 139 500 persons or 6.4 per cent for males 200 or 5.6 per cent for males in the 45-54 years.age bracket and by 70000 or 13.6 per cent for males 55 years and over. Thus in spite of this rise of 139 500 in full-time employment of males aged 20 to 44 years between August 1973 and August 1980, employment of males 45 years and over declined by ItO 900. A similar picture is also apparent for females over this period; full-time employment rose by 16.5 per cent for females aged 20-44 years, but fell by 10.6 per cent and 3.3 per cent for females aged 45-54 years and During the seven years in question, full-time employment of females aged 20 to 44 years increased by 133 800 persons but employment offemales aged 45 years and over fell by 27 100.",24
74,Mrs DARLING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Stricker and Sheehan are generally be more entrenched in suggesting there that not only are the older unemployed now carrying as large a share of this Government's austere economic policies as the young unemployed but also, unlike the young unin the labour market. It may employed, their problems naturally tend to escape detection. This latter fact has spelt disaster for these people thus far. Because this Government tends to measure human problems in terms of such as the public service and tenure is common, and as the statistics and because the older unemployed give up competing in the job market after a period out of disillusionment and despair and thus no longer show up in unemployment statistics, the Government has not responded to their plight in any way. The extent of the disadvantage suffered by jobless older workers relative to their counterparts in other age groups shows up in the Australian Bureau of Statistics data on the duration of unemployment experienced by unemployed workers according to age group. figures alone, it is apparent The most recent monthly figures available are those from a labour force survey which was conthe age group which has borne in the labour market has ducted in January this year. These statistics show that the age of the worker is directly related to the period of unemployment he or she might be expected to endure. For example, during January than for any others. In older persons is probably crethe average duration of unemployment for teenagers was 17 weeks; for the 25 to 35-year-old it was 29 weeks; for the 45 to 54-year-old it was 52 weeks; but for the highest age bracket-that is persons has led to their withthose people 60 to 64 years of age-it was 102 weeks. People do not just disappear from the age of 62 to 64 years because they are getting older and are not yet of pensionable age. Let us think of job search he is likely to try during an enforced early retireabout this situation. The period of unemployment likely to be experienced by a worker should he or she become unemployed for some reason is two years-that is only on average. This shocking pattern of an increased incidence of unemployment as age increases has been showing up in labour force data since at least mid-1981. If we go back to the figures for January 1981, seen is in terms of the data on we find that, whilst those in the 45 to 54-year-old age bracket were unemployed for on average, 56 weeks compared with only 20 weeks for teenagers, those in the 60 to 64-year-old age aged 20-44 years, but fell by 40 bracket were unemployed for the lesser period of 43 weeks. So while prolonged unemployment amongst older workers has been with us for some time, it appears that the level of unemployment among the very oldest members of the work force has reached crisis proportions very recently. In reality the situation is even worse than it is statistically. If we remember Stricker and Sheehan's 55 years and over respectively. stricture that many jobless older workers withdraw from the work force, hence do not show in recorded unemployment figures, we can assume that the above figures greatly understate the extent of the problem. While it is true that the older unemployed face a daunting task in trying to re-enter the work force, another reality is that the number of jobs they can apply for is severely limited. Stricker and Sheehan found that in the seven years to August 1980 the level of full time employment for males aged 20 to 44 years grew by 139,500 persons. On the other hand, for males aged 55 years and older, the level of full time employment fell by 70,000 persons. The authors added that a similar picture was apparent for females in this period. I know this to be true. It is no wonder that jobless older workers remain jobless for up to two years at a time. If the story these figures tell is linked up to the story I have received from officers of the Commonwealth Employment Service office in my electorate, a three-dimensional problem emerges: first, there are not enough jobs to go round; secondly, older workers are being discriminated against by employers on the basis of their age when they do apply for the few jobs going; and, thirdly, possibly tens of thousands of jobless people in this country are languishing at home living on past savings and waiting for the day they turn 65 so they can qualify for the age pension, itself hardly a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. What a legacy it is for people who have come through the Great Depression and the Second World War now to be incarcerated in a time warp of despair! Who exactly are the people being affected and in what way are they being affected? It is clear that age discrimination is a new and potent force in our society. The 1980 report of the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Board states that age restrictions are often used to excess by employersoften based on myths, prejudice and stereotyped ideas-simply to reduce the field of candidates for a job. That is what is happening these days. CES officers confirm this. Employers give a number of reasons for not employing older people, such as: It is too difficult for older employees to qualify for superannuation; older employees may not fit in with the majority of young staff; an older person may carry too much authority to fill a relatively menial position; it is not worth the cost to the of training someone who will leave in a few years; and older people are too set in their ways. It should be evident that myths and prejudice abound in the areas. According to my observations in the electorate and discussions with the CES, groups worse affected appear to be former company executives, counter sales people replaced by machines in selfservice stores and pensioners whose cases have been reviewed and who have been taken off their pensions. These people are coming into my office every day. After they have been on a pension for 10 years-they obviously are too ill to work-the shocking situation is that they have been to the Commonwealth Medical Officer and have been told that they no longer qualify for the 85 per cent disability pension. They are sent to join the queues at the CES. It is disgusting. The group worse affected includes also clerical officers who have not had the data processing training necessary for many of today's clerical jobs and women no longer eligible for the supporting parents benefit or widow's pension because their youngest child is no longer of school age. I make it clear that I am not just talking about those over the age of 60. It is now a fact that anyone over 35 applying for a job can expect to have a dubious eye cast over the age given on his or her letter of application. A great go most honourable members would have if we had to apply for work under such criteria! The 25-30 years age bracket is apparently the optimum in terms of appeal to employers. As our population and hence work force ages, unemployment figures in this country will be even more skewed in the direction of older age groups unless something is done to alter the situation. As I said earlier, there are three dimensions to the problem. These are: Not enough jobs to go around, discrimination in the work place and problems associated with the psychological withdrawal and trauma experienced by workers cast on society's scrap heap. Discrimination always requires attack on a number of fronts. The CES could play an educative role by impressing on employers the special advantages of employing older workers. The press can help too by publicising individual cases of discrimination in the work place. The Human Rights Commission should take up the problem as a matter of urgency. In the long run, it hones down to the Federal Government which must take a leading role. It must allocate funds to devise programs to assist the older unemployed with their particular problems. We could look at something like the Community Youth Support Scheme-for instance, a community older unemployed support scheme. firm But let me make clear what I am suggesting. The problems of the young unemployed have not eased. The continuation of their training and support schemes is essential, inadequate as they are. But now a second spotlight needs to be aimed at the older jobless and a further allocation of funds needs to be made available to ease a problem which in many ways parallels the problems of young unemployed people. In the second place, I would assert that the implication in the question that my colleague, the honourable member for Willis ( Mr Hawke) has put to this Government on several occasions is even more glaring in its basic truth. The question is not what is the cost undertaking job creation programs; rather what the cost of not undertaking these problems? mand Another generation of displaced workers in this country awaits an answer.",25

He pointed out that exorbitant wage increases cost other people's jobs. I know that it is not possible in many areas to wages, but there are areas in the tourist industry Morris). in which if double time or overtime perhaps did not apply many more jobs would be available, whether they be jobs for old or young people. In the grievance debate today I want to comment on the grave difficulties facing grape growers and many wineries. In this instance, I do not inin tend to grieve on behalf of those of us who purchase and like consuming wine. It is very much a buyer's market and has been for some time.

77,Mr GILES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I thank the House. This table appeared in an article in the Bulletin of 27 April. I refer it to honourable members because I regard it as an interesting article. In part, it states: Take a four-litre cask with a discounted retail price of $3.99. On costings done by-It refers to a particular company. . . a retail price of $3.99 means the wine company is selling the product for $3 or of 75 cents a litre. By comparison, the direct cost (including grapes, refrigeration and labour) of making wine is between 30 cents and 40 cents a litre, according to the Australian Wine and Brandy instances, also within Australia, shows that the emphasis for wine sales today is very much at the . top end of the price range. Demand appears to be of falling for products at the cheap end of the is market-the flagon and cask trade. Lack of dein this area is causing the price cutting that we currently see at both the wine making and retail levels. Much of the reason for that is the overof wine in this country. I intend to deal has with those two areas separately. Firstly, I refer to wine making. Wine makers currently forced to cut prices for bulk wines in an attempt to gain what they regard as a fair or better, of the market-and in an economic atmosphere of sales levelling off and a situation in which the number of wine drinkers apparently is declining. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which I have already shown to lower the honourable member for Shortland ( Mr Leave granted. The table read asfollowsTABLE 2 Consumption of alcoholic drinks, including wine, declined Australia over the past 12 months, according to a recent Morgan Gallup Poll. Between October and December last year, about 7,000 men women were shown a list of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages and were asked which of them they had drunk at period some time in the previous seven days. The table compares the answers obtained in 1981 with obtained during the corresponding periods in 1980 and (Percent) Total Men Women 1979 1980 1981 1979 1980 1981 1979 1980 1981 41 42 40 61 63 61 22 22 19 25 28 27 25 27 27 26 29 27 20 23 22 21 24 24 19 22 20 9 10 9 9 10 10 9 10 8 63 67 63 73 76 73 54 57 54 Corporation. To this must be added between 70 cents and $1 for the cask itself, plus marketing and fixed winery costs such as storage and maturation. The result? Many wine companies lose money on cask and flagon wine. That, of course, puts a strong downward thrust on those unfortunate wine grape growers in terms of the price that those companies pay for the raw material, the grapes. I seek leave to incorporate in less-at best, at an average price Hansard table No.1 from the same article. Leave granted. The table read asfollowsIn 1980, the Barossa Valley Grapegrowers Association prepared current grape growing costs for a 15 hectare vineyard. These costs are summarised below. (a) Plant. These costs include tractor, weeder, utility, truck, rotary hoe, disc, cultivator, sprayer, slasher, pneumatic pruner and grape bins-a mixture of new and second hand prices-$37,000.

78,Mr GILES,OPERA TOR LABOR INPUT,"I thank the House, The importance of this table is that it sets out the current plight of grape growers, in this case in the Barossa Valley. on a 15 hectare vineyard with yields ranging. in one example, from IS tonnes per hectare down to 5 tonnes per hectare. The table was prepared by the Barossa Valley Grape Growers Association and has been published elsewhere. Honourable members will note that the net result for the IS tonne yield per hectare farm is $10 per tonne but the net loss on the smaller vineyard is $269 per tonne. That is a substantial loss for the smaller, if not less efficient, wine grape grower in TABLE I that area. It must throw into some question whether the Barossa Valley, which is such an important part of South Australia, will persist in this industry in future unless remedial action is taken. CAPlT AL COSTS That is the first half of the problem in very brief terms. The second half is the effect of the pressure placed on wineries because of a drastically limited number of retail outlets. Takeovers in this field have been rampant. I believe they have exceeded the proper level although any reasonable person will realise, I think, that some rationalisation of the industry may be desirable to achieve economies of scale. The trade is not small. The Retail World magazine values the liquor market at $3.8 billion for the 12 months to December 1980. I find this interesting because it is the first breakdown I have seen of the liquor market. It is made up of OPERATION beer at $2,926m, spirits at $473m and, in third place, wine at $435m. The problem here quite clearly is that firms such as the Myer Emporium Ltd and firms in Sydney such as G. J. Coles and spraying, irrigation, harvest Co. Ltd and many others are starting to dominate the retail purchasing end of the market. When I realised that this trend was starting to occur, last November in this House I moved: That this HouseYield (I) is concerned at the changing structure of ownership and control of the alcoholic beverages industry with 5tjha 15tjha regard to(a) the trend towards monopoly at the retail level; $ $ (b) the trend towards increased foreign participation; 75 225 (c) decreasing producer influence on marketing; and 13,275 39,825 (d) the danger that bulk marketing of wines will 2,100 2,100 damage the sale of quality bottled wines; and 3,800 4,500 6,780 10,170 (2) calls on the Government to consider the introduction 3,860 3,860 of United States of America style anti-trust legislation 150 150 for the alcoholic beverages industry. 700 900 17,390 21,680 At this stage that motion has not been debated. I 232 96 am hopeful that one day it will come on for 33,422 37,712 debate. 446 167 -269 +10 In the few minutes remaining to me I wish to touch briefly on three points. I wish to refer first to an article which appeared a week or two ago and which quoted Professor Desmond Julian as saying that medical science cannot prove that drinking wine instead of beer will lessen the risk of a heart attack. Nevertheless, he pointed out that with the trend away from drinking beer in the Australian society in some instances and the trend towards wine there has been a great decline in the number of Australians killed by heart disease. He is a British medical professor. He compared the situation in Australia with the British scene. Nobody will reason that people who drink more will get fewer heart attacks but the figures show that 97 per cent of those who drink alcolholic beverages today do so in a very moderate fashion. The implication of Professor Desmond Julian's comments is that those moderates who take a glass of wine with a meal-there is no harm in thatappear to suffer less stress which could be responsible, and I put it no higher than that, for the marked decrease in the incidence of heart attacks in Australia today. The second point I wish to deal with is also putting a strong downward pressure on the demand for wine and, no doubt, on the demand for other alcoholic beverages. I refer to the attitude taken two months ago by the New South Wales Government to the taxation of licensed premises. The tax level was increased by 25 per cent. Honourable members will be well aware of the many statements of horror by those with a vested interest in the retailing of wines and spirits. I point to it because it is another factor affecting wine grape growers in Australia today. The last point I wish to touch on is the introduction in the other place of a private member's Bill to tax the advertising of alcoholic beverages. This has been introduced by Senator Chipp on behalf of the Australian Democrats. In introducing it, he pointed out that he could see no direct relationship betweeen advertising and the abuse of New South Wales Victoria Queensland South Australia Western Australia Tasmania Northern Territory Australian Capital Territory Australia n.a.

81,Mr FREE ,OPERA TOR LABOR INPUT,"Macquarie) (11.34) - This morning I want to refer to the need for a new system of voting in elections for the Senate. It is well known that Senate elections attract a much higher rate of informal vote than do elections for the House of Representatives. My purpose this morning is to examine the pattern of informality, to look at its cases and to suggest a remedy. The pattern of informality in recent Senate elections is set out in a table. The table details the percentage of informal vote in the last four House of Representatives and Senate elections-that is, the elections for 1974, 1975, 1977 and 1980. It also gives the number of candidates for the Senate in each State and Territory. I seek leave to incorporate that table in Hansard. Leave granted. The table read asfollowsNA Federal Elections 1974 to 1980 Proportion of Informal Votes to Total Votes and Number of Senate Candidates House of Representatives Senate Informal as Informal as percentage of total votes percentage of total votes Number of candidates 1974 1975 1977 1980 1974 1975 1977 1980 1974 1975 1977 1980 1.66 1.87 2.26 2.36 12.31 9.74 9.59 9.38 73 53 35 33 2.11 1.96 2.85 2.70 11.13 8.11 9.l1 11.15 48 38 29 34 1.38 1.27 1.53 1.76 6.00 8.27 7.96 9.24 25 40 23 33 2.81 2.40 3.38 2.79 11.38 9.95 10.39 7.76 38 37 19 27 2.52 2.30 3.30 2.69 10.39 10.79 8.17 9.92 29 53 19 23 1.77 1.85 2.60 2.64 1l.21 9.88 7.09 7.46 32 28 10 13 2.81 3.25 3.46 4.91 n.a. 7.15 6.49 7.32 n.a. 10 8 10 1.32 1.67 2.38 2.15 n.a. 3.70 3.14 2.77 n.a. 12 8 9 1.92 1.89 2.52 2.45 10.77 8.99 9.00 9.65 245 271 151 182 Research Service from information contained in issues of the 9.6 per cent-almost one vote in every 10 cast for the Senate over that period did not count. There are more striking examples of the pattern of informality in certain States or Territories in particular years over the period surveyed. The most striking example is in New South Wales for the election of the Senate in 1974. That election attracted a record informal vote of 12.31 per cent, the highest over that period. In that year almost one vote in eight in New South Wales did not count. That election also attracted a record number of candidates. In 1974 73 people stood in New South Wales. Of the 30 separate Senate elections surveyed in the States and Territories, the one attracting the lowest informal vote was in the Australian Capital Territory in 1980. There was an informal percentage of 2.77 in that year, with 9 candidates standing. Over that period there were two Senate papers with fewer candidates than nine. There were eight candidates in the Australian Capital Territory in 1977. The informal vote there was 3.14 per cent. There were eight in the Northern Territory in the same year, and that ticket attracted an informal vote of 6.49 per cent. But I believe that these figures suggest a broad but not perfect relationship between the size of the informal vote and the number of candidates standing. There is enough evidence in the table to suggest that as the size of the ballot paper increases so does the chance of clerical error leading to an informal vote. There is clearly a need to reform such a system that prevents a substantial number of electors Electoral Informal Division Votes Banks 8,436 Barton 6,328 Bennelong 6,265 Berowra 4,670 Blaxland 8,741 Bradfield 3,681 Calare 7,193 Chitley 11,003 Cook 5,947 Cowper 7,862 Cunningham 7,963 Darling 7,211 Eden-Monaro 7,854 Evans 5,927 Farrer 7,724 Grayndler 8,054 Gwydir 9.007 Hughes 7,095 Hume 7,184 Hunter 9,596 Kingsford-Smith 7.778 Lang 7,225 Lowe 5.524 Compiled at request by the Statistics Group of the Legislative eturns for the 1974 elections published from casting valid votes. The evidence suggests that that is precisely what the present system does. It robs about one voter in IO because of the requirement that he must number every square on the ticket, even up to the 73 candidates standing in New South Wales in that election in 1974. Such a system is clearly undemocratic if it robs such a large proportion of electors of the chance of casting a valid vote. So we might validly ask: Why has such a system not been changed? It may be because the pattern of informality is not uniform. It is higher in Labor electorates and higher in the country. I have already said that informality is a function of the size of the paper. It is also, at least superficially, a function of Labor allegiance. To examine that proposition I should like to refer to a second table that sets out the informal votes recorded in each of the then 45 electoral divisions in New South Wales for the Senate election held on 18 May 1974. I seek leave to incorporate that table in Hansard. Leave granted.

82,Mr FREE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I thank the House. I have chosen the 1974 Senate election because it attracted the largest informal vote and therefore would be expected to give the largest spread among the individual electorates. The table shows that in the seat of Bradfield, which is the safest Liberal seat in the country, the informal Senate vote was the lowest in New South Wales, at 5.59 per cent, when the average for New South Wales was 12.31 per cent. The informal Senate vote in the seat of Sydney, the safest Labor seat in the country, was 20.54 per cent. The highest in New South Wales, as against 5.59 per cent in Bradfield. So the wastage rate in Sydney was almost four times the wastage rate in Bradfield. The safest Liberal electorate enjoyed the lowest Senate informality; the votes counted more. The safest Labor electorate had the highest Senate informality-one vote in five; over 20 per cent-and therefore the greatest wastage rate. The interesting feature of the figures in this table is that the 43 seats in between those two extremes of Bradfield and Sydney do not grade as one would expect. In other words, as one goes from the safest Liberal seat down to the safest Labor seat, one does not find the informal vote increasing in steps. I have attempted to analyse the figures in a broad fashion by comparing the informality in those individual seats with that State average of 12.31 per cent. Of the 45 seats, 23 fell above the average, and 22 fell below it. In that election Labor won 25 seats. Thirteen of those Labor seats fell above the average, recording higher informal votes than 12.31 per cent, and 12 fell below the average; so it was 13: 12 for the Labor seats. The Liberals won 11 seats in New South Wales in that election. Only one recorded an above average informality; 10 fell below. Clearly, the Liberals enjoyed an advantage there because fewer of their Senate votes were wasted. All nine National Country Party seats were above the average; none was below it. Clearly, therefore, this broad analysis at least indicates that there is a high rate of informality in strong Labor electorates and certainly a high rate of informality in the rural areas. Clearly, that kind of analysis does not tell the full story. To measure properly that relationship between informality and political allegiance one would need to follow up individual ballot papers and work out what the voter's intention would have been if he had not made an error. To my knowledge, no one has done this, but I believe that it should be done. My guess is that a substantial majority of wasted votes are intended Labor votes. If that is so, in narrow political terms it is obviously in the interests of the coalition to retain the present system, this present clerical obstacle race, because it wastes more Labor votes than coalition votes. But I believe this to be true only in narrow terms. In the whole field of electoral law there ought to be a bipartisan approach. After all, we have a system of compulsory voting. If we insist that people go to vote, we should provide a voting system that is simple and gives everyone an equal chance to record a formal vote, a vote that will actually count. We certainly do not have such a system at present for the Senate. What are the solutions? Obviously, we could try to reduce the number of candidates. We could raise the deposit or make the nomination process more difficult to weed out the frivolous candidates. I would oppose such an approach because it seems to be a selective approach to frivolity in that it would weed out the poor candidates but it would certainly leave the rich candidates still there to clutter up ballot papers. My solution would be to remove the requirement that all squares be numbered. I suggest that we should, in Senate elections, retain the party groupings and the elector's option to number all the squares if he wishes, but for the overwhelming majority who simply wish to record a valid vote for a party ticket I suggest that above each group on the Senate ballot paper a single square should be printed and people should have the option of marking a single square, and that should be sufficient to record a formal vote for that particular registered party ticket. There should be just a single mark instead of 73 marks, for example. Such a system would save wasted votes. It would introduce a measure of electoral justice which is sadly lacking in the present system for voting for the Senate. A whole range of other things need to be done in the field of electoral reform. We should have a draw from the hat for positions on the House of Representatives ticket, for example. Party affiliations should be shown on the ballot paper. Guidance on how to vote should be displayed in polling places. We should have civilized hours of voting. We should certainly be looking at public funding and at the disclosure of sources of contributions to parties. But I believe that a most important starting point in the whole area of electoral reform would be to clean up the Senate voting system.",31

84,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE ,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Dawson) (11.48)During the recent parliamentary recess I met cane industry leaders in my electorate over the contemplated suggestion from the Western Australian Government that that State commence a sugar industry on the Ord. The concern of these industry leaders is real. For instance, the Dawson electorate supplies about 43 per cent of the total Australian sugar production and Queensland the bulk of that production. I feel that that concern would be shared by the honourable members in this House from Wide Bay-yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker-from Fisher ( Mr Adermann), from Herbert ( Mr Dean), from Leichhardt ( Mr Thomson) and from Kennedy ( Mr Katter). No one would deny a State-in this case Western Australia-its right to do what it wanted to do within its constitutional power, but it appears to me that if there is a grievance to be made on this subject the appropriate forum is the floor of this House. The sugar industry in New South Wales and Queensland supports tens of thousands of people in the growing, milling, marketing and distribution of sugar. On these primary functions rely many thousands more who service that industry. It has been the most significant industry in decentralising Queensland's growing population. Regulations and controls are self-imposed. These have allowed the industry to expand when conditions have been favourable. This regulation has allowed the industry to prosper and to sustain itself in verse times. It has not sought a subsidy or a grant from any government. It has produced a high quality product, sufficient for Australia's domestic market, and it has competed aggressively in a world market where competition is fierce, where cheaper substitutes are available and where some competitors are heavily subsidised by their governments-for instance, those in the European Economic Community. In order to do this the industry has become very efficient by world standards. It has adopted and developed modern technology at all levels of production in order to maintain its viability. It would be unforgiveable if any government, State or Commonwealth, deliberately set out to destroy an industry that accounts for so much of Queensland's economy and also the economy of this nation. Yet the Western Australian Government seems intent to proceed along such a path. Should that Government proceed with its intention of producing sugar on the Ord it would be a disaster which would be second only to the disaster of constructing the dam on the Ord in the first place. The more recent studies that have been undertaken to justify cane growing on the Ord reached conclusions that need careful examination. Those conclusions were: Firstly, that on present day high production costs, on low world sugar prices and world overproduction, sugar growing, without subsidy, would not be viable on the Ord. I would like to refer honourable members to the answer the Deputy Prime Minister ( Mr Anthony) gave me to a question on this matter earlier this week. Secondly, the area suggested for cane growing has, over a trial period, established results that I understand are misleading. The performances of cane from tonnage per hectare, ratooning and content sugar cane, were the results of harvesting in a one-month period when results on these three criteria would be at an absolute maximum. Yet the study then proceeded to provide for a production of cane and sugar over a period of seven months when these one-month results would be considerably reduced and be of less value. Thirdly, the initial area of 12,000 hectares and a peak of 160,000 tonnes of sugar would be only an initial and, as I said before, uneconomic proposal. To justify viability in the long run, the proposal would call for more land and more peak, and the political demand for these once the project had commenced, would be difficult to refuse. All of this would be detrimental to the Queensland and New South Wales industries. Fourthly, Ord River sugar would require the adtechnology from the long established Queensland industry. In other words, the Queensland industry would be required to pay for its own funeral. Fifthly, I understand that the study suggests that $16 per tonne of cane would produce a profit to the grower. This figure, in the more efficient and cost conscious Queensland industry, would not cover current day costs. It cannot seriously be suggested that $16 would give a return to growers in the more isolated region of the Ord. Sixthly, it has been suggested that in order to provide a return for millers on the Ord, the traditional formula for the distribution of sugar proceeds between growers and millers would be altered in the millers' favour. This would be a recipe for guaranteed losses to the primary cane growing sector. Seventhly, production of ethanol from cane, which is a further suggestion in the study, has no prospects of success unless it is heavily subsidised by some government and until petrol prices exceed 50c a litre. If this is to be the case, I ask: Why not subside the existing Queensland industry that has prospects of expansion of its present peak of about 3 million tonnes to 5 million tonnes of sugar? Finally, the Western Australian proposal suggests sharing the present domestic sugar market and the international sugar quotas between Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales and presumably its share of in-store quota when restrictions apply. This is complete folly unless it is matched by a guaranteed increase in both the domestic markets and international quotas, at least to the extent of the amount Western Australia intends to produce. In view of the Western Australian Government's intention the sugar industry in Queensland has questions which relate to Commonwealth State agreements, constitutional powers and the International Sugar Agreement on this matter of sugar production. These questions are: Under the Commonwealth-State domestic sugar agreement, does any other State have access to the Australian market, apart from its own State's requirements? Secondly, would Western Australia share in the present basic export tonnages, that is, Australia's, under the International Sugar Agreement? Would it share in the present long term contracts? Finally, would Australia be able to sustain an argument against EEC policy on subsidised farm products being dumped on world markets if the Commonwealth or a State subsidised sugar production on the Ord? At another time when sugar markets are expanding, consumption of sugar is increasing and when prices are much higher and there is no need for government subsidisation, the proposal could be more favourably considered, but now is not the time. I feel it is only reasonable that the present Australian industry would want to protect what it has carefully built up over a period of 120 years. The existing industry should not have to sacrifice production, markets and prices to the Western Australian badly timed initiative. I wish to bring up a second matter in this debate. It has some bearing on last week's appalling road toll which I understand in New South Wales alone numbered 22 persons. These Australians died on the weekend of the commemoration and observance of Australia's most sacred day, ANZAC Day. Such an offering is reminiscent of the pagan days when, to appease the gods or to seek a special blessing, sacrifices were called for. On this occasion the public presumably called for a Monday holiday in lieu of the ANZAC Day which fell on a Sunday. This made it a long weekend, a holiday break, and not a day of observance. Statistics will show that long weekend holidays are responsible for the greatest number of deaths that occur on Australian roads. The granting of such holidays in lieu of our national days is not only a guarantee further road carnage but also it prevents the proper observance of the days themselves. The two I particularly refer to are Australia Day and ANZAC Day. The Australia Day holiday this year fell on I February, a date that has no possible lationship with 26 January. The commemoration and observance of ANZAC Day has to be held on the 25th, yet the granting of a holiday for the 26th in lieu made the 25th not a national event but for the majority merely one day of a long weekend for a holiday retreat. Until we declare the actual dates of 26 January and 25 April to be the days for official observance, irrespective of the day of the week on which they fall, there will be no respect for the events or the days and there will be no cultivation of national pride. A visitor to Australia could be forgiven for believing that our national day is Melbourne Cup day, a day on which all of us pay a momentary interest in the running of the Cup. It can be no coincidence that United States national pride stems from the fact that Independence Day is observed on the actual date, 4 July. I see a real need in this country for all people of all ages to take pride in their nation and to demonstrate that pride by the proper observances. The manner in which public holidays are now declared has to be carefully examined with a view to highlighting the day, not downgrading it. The Jaycees organisation in Australia has embarked this year on a project called 'Pride in our nation'. I would hope that all Australians would take this opportunity of reexamining their personal relationships with this country that gives them their traditions, their culture and their freedom irrespective of their nation of birth. I also believe that we would save more people from the senseless deaths of the long weekend road tolls. The days would become living observances, not senseless additions to the members of the dead and the injured.",31
85,Mr FRY ,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Fraser) (11.59)-1 take this opportunity to remind the people of Canberra that on 5 June there will be an election for the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly. This will give the people of Canberra an opportunity to express a view about the way in which Canberra has been administered, the way it has been discriminated against in the most vindictive way by the Government, and also to express a view about the irresponsibility of some of the actions of the Minister for the Capital Territory ( Mr Hodgman).1I have no doubt that view will be expressed very forcibly by the people of Canberra when they vote in the Assembly election on 5 June. Let me give an indication of the Government's standing in Canberra. Although it has increased of its advertising appropriation by something like 237 per cent in money terms or 100 per cent in real terms from $9.7m. in 1978-79 to $23.2m. in the current Budget, most of that advertising has effectively gone into trying to buy votes in State re- elections, the Lowe by-election and the recent Victorian election. Since 1979 the allocation for advertising for House of Assembly elections has gone down 10 per cent in real terms. One must ask whether this reflects a Government view that the fewer people who know abut the election in Canberra on 5 June the better it will be for the Government-it must hope that people will not vote. I think it most important that people do vote. I hope we have a big turnout of people at the election so they can say what they think about the way this Government has treated Canberra. Probably one of the most devastating policies of the Government has been the way it has affected the building industry in Canberra by savegely cutting back on the National Capital Development Commission budget and not building any government houses for three years. Only this year it restarted building. That has resulted in extended waiting times for people who desperately need houses. They now have to wait up to three years. Even those wanting emergency accommodation have to wait five or six months. This has resulted in great hardship for many people in Canberra. The Government has completely disregarded those needs and has continued unmercifully to indulge in what has come to be known in Canberra as 'Canberra bashing'. At the same time, we have seen the Government waste huge sums of money. The Canberra Development Board has spent almost $lm over three years and has achieved practically nothing. A lot of that money has been spent on people gallivanting around overseas, trying to attract industry. They have not attracted one industry or created one job in Canberra, for all that expenditure. Even at this late stage the Canberra Development Board refuses to admit that the National Semiconductor Corporation project is completely dead, although everybody else believes that it was never alive. That corporation has no intention of coming to Canberra. The microchip industry in the United States of America is in a very bad situation, and is on the way down. The corporation itself is in a bad situation. The quality of its uct has been questioned by the Government and is under a cloud. Yet we still send over there people who spend money trying to flog a dead horse and pursue a project that has been dead for a long while. I think the Government should say to the Canberra Development Board: 'Confine your activities to Australia. If you can attract legitimate industry to Canberra, well and good; but stop wasting the public's money gallivanting around all over the world'. We spend millions of dollars maintaining embassies and trade commissions to do precisely the job that the Canberra Development Board has failed so dismally to do. I am not against the Board in principle, but I am - gainst the blatant waste of money by people Junketing around the world and achieving nothing at all. It is time the Minister for the Australian Capital Territory acknowledged that and kept the members of the Board home to do their work here. Another request the Minister has not responded to-I have asked him to do this-is to conduct an inquiry into poverty in Canberra. Many people feel that because we live in a very pleasant physical environment there is no poverty, that everybody is well off and doing well. Nothing could be further from the truth. There are pockets of severe poverty in Canberra. Living costs are very high here and people on low incomes have great difficulty in carrying on. I believe a proper inquiry should be held to identify those pockets of poverty and to make recommendations on what should be done about the situation. The only way we can handle this is through the community development fund, which is established from the proceeds of the Totalisator Agency Board and poker machines. Tremendous demands are placed on that fund. The Government has adopted a deliberate policy of evading its responsibility for welfare payments, stating that all welfare services should be financed from the community development fund. Of course, that fund cannot cope with the demands put on it. As a result, the welfare agencies of Canberra are run down. They are not able to meet the demands placed on their resources. Many community support services have declined because they do not have the resources to carry the load. Child care is in the same situation. The child day care program is under threat because the Government has not increased its vote in real terms for several years. It is discriminated against because it does not get the subsidies that community support services in the States get from the prodState governments in addition to the Commonwealth subsidy. It is left in a desperate situation and it may have to curtail some of its activities. In closing, I refer briefly to the very irresponsible actions of the Minister concerning the ANZAC Day celebrations, for which twice now he has brought in public assemblies ordinances which have not worked and which have cost the public hundreds of thousands of dollars. Last year we saw the brutal and quite unnecessary arrest of many women because the police were placed in a very difficult situation of trying to interpret an impossible ordinance. Last year it was recognised that the ordinance was quite unsatisfactory and could not work. It caused quite a lot of unnecessary violence. This year another ordinance was introduced. Fortunately, the Australian Federal Police Commissioner, to his credit, exercised his discretion very wisely and gave permission for certain people to march. As a result we had a peaceful observance of ANZAC Day. I know you, Mr Deputy Speaker, were there to see that. It was quite dignified and nothing untoward happened. Yet somebody had the audacity to say that it was peaceful only because the women behaved themselves. Nothing could be further from the truth. The women did not misbehave themselves the year before. They did this year what the- wanted to do last year. Had a little bit of discretIOn been used last year the same situation could have prevailed then as prevailed this year, when the women's conduct was very commendable indeed. I think the people who were there to --t-h the ceremony appreciated that. I heard no cntIclsm of it on the day. Because these unnecessary ordinances were brought in the public purse suffered. Sixty-odd people had to be put through the courts. A load was put on the Attorney-General's Depa.rtment in trying to, devise an unworkable ordInance. Work was placed on parliamentary committees, which tried to overcome the deficiencies of the ordinance. On the whole this was all unnecessary and a scandalous waste of money. The situation now is that even the Returned Services League does not want the present ordinance. People generally do not want it and the w<?men do n?t w-nt it. We are still left with an unsatIsfactory sItuatIOn which will have to be resolved. I hope that it will be resolved before the next ANZAC Day. I commend the discretion of those groups which were given permission to march but in fact did not march. The RSL objected to the banner which one group, called Ex-Servicemen for Peace and Disarmament, was to carry. That group agreed to drop the word 'Disarmament' but the RSL still objected. It did not want that group to carry a banner with the words 'Ex-Servicemen for Peace'. I think that is an incredible situation. But, in deference to the RSL those people decided not to march. They may not make the same decision next year. I hope that the Govern-e-t will co-e to grips with this problem. I hope It wdllet,samty prevail and will acknowledge that people s attItudes towards ANZAC Day change with time. Everybody at the ceremony wants to re-ember ANZAC Day with the dignity that the oc-aslOn demands. If they are given the opportumty to observe it that way, I am sure they will do so. But the matter cannot be left up in the air with an ordinance that only narrowly avoided disallowance in the Parliament, which reflects public opinion.",33
86,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,NEW SOUTH WALES,Mr Millar)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,35
87,Mr JULL ,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Bowman) (l2.8)-At a time when much of the attention of Australia is turned towards the Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai, there is a tendency for our Press and foreign affairs watchers to downplay activities in the small country of the Lebanon, only a few hundred miles away. The tragedy is that the Lebanon has been causing much heartbreak for man- thousands of Lebanese now residing in AustralIa. Certainly none of us will forget the .victims of the - ar of the mid-1970s and the good Job the AustralIan Government did in opening the doors to hundreds and hundreds of refugees who fled the Lebanon at that time and who now make their homes in this country. But that war continues. As many as 100,000 casualties in a country of just three and a half million people means that very few fa-ilies livi-g either in the Lebanon or indeed, here In AustralIa have not been affected by the loss of loved ones in this tragic war. The sad thing is that the war is not really of the making of the Lebanese. In fact the Lebanon as one of the cradles of civilisation, has an impr-ssive record of human - ights an- racial and religious tolerence, such as IS found In very few other countries. Indeed, each of the two major religious groups in that country-the Christians and the Moslems-represents roughly 50 per cent of the population. For hundreds ofye-rs they have lived a relatively peaceful eXIstence, developing a country of few natural res?urces to a point where in the 1950s and 1960s I- was the headquarters of the Middle East financIal world, a mecca for European and Eastern tourists and a major trading nation. Beirut, the capital, was indeed one of the - reat cities of the world. It was known as the Pans of the East. Today, after eight years of fighti-g, much of that city is in ruins. The Eastern financIal institutions have moved elsewhere, notably to Bahrain. The port of Beirut is in shambles, much of it being blocked by vessels sunk at the height of the fighting. The infrastructure of that P?rt was literally bombed to pieces. Western BeIrut resembles Berlin at the end of World War II. Eastern Beirut, in a small strip of land reaching beyond Byblos in the north, is co-trolled by' the Christian Falangist forces and enJoys a relatIvely peaceful existence under a most elaborate secUTitysystem. However the rest of the country is literally in chaos. Mor- than 200 separate armies and private militia struggle for control of small sectors of the country, and the carnage goes on and on. In the south of the country Palestinians who settled there following the establishment of Israel lived and worked peacefully from the late 1940s through to the I 960s, at which time the Palestine Liberation Organisation infiltrated and built up forces for many of its activities against Israel. The exit of the Palestinians from Jordan swelled these numbers and a complete army was developed. This is where much of the trouble began. An Arab peacekeeping force did little to stop the fighting between the PLO and Lebanese forces and the Syrian contingent is still a major force there, much to the resentment of the Christian Falangist community especially. In many respects the war is one of occupation, by the PLO on one hand and by the Syrian armed forces on the other. The Lebanese are the meat in the sandwich. At a recent international conference of solidarity with the Lebanon, which I attended, the chairman of the Middle East Subcommittee of this Parliament's Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, the honourable member for Cook ( Mr Dobie), made a statement that seemed really to sum up the situation. He said: Irrespective of what major issues persist throughout Middle East, if the problems of a disunited, wartorn and in many areas a terrorist dominated Lebanon are not solved, then there will be no peace anywhere in the Middle East in our lifetime. Despite United Nations resolutions and calls from various world leaders, nothing really has been achieved in bringing peace to this troubled country. In the Lebanon today the Syrians still snipe and fight Iraqis; the PLO seems to fight everybody and brings terror, death and destruction to much of the land; and leftist groups fight leftist groups. A fragile ceasefire between the PLO and Israel has been broken and the United Nations buffer zone in the south of the country is literally useless. French diplomats are murdered in the streets of the western sector of Beirut, Iraqi embassies are blown sky high, diplomats have to be accompanied everywhere by big security contingents and the noises of bombs, rockets and rifle fire are heard repeatedly. Arms of the most sophisticated types just pour into the country-these are not just small arms but sophisticated tanks and rockets-to the 200-odd private armies that exist there. The sad thing is that the leaders of the various factions in western Beirut, from the President right the way down, see no hope of any real solution to the problems. Only in eastern Beirut, the Christian controlled area, does there seem to be any hope. Here, after very heavy loss of life, great sacrifice and the imposition of a very strict security service, a rebuilding program is under way. Surprisingly, a boom exists, with high rise accommodation, major tourist complexes and industry undergoing a most incredible reconstruction. The population wants for very little and there is certainly a feeling of resurgence of the Lebanese spirit in that eastern sector. The leaders of this group believe that the solution lies in the departure of occupying forces from Lebanese soil. They say that the Syrians must go and the Palestinians must go. In fact, all Lebanese groups agree that the Palestinians must go. I would think that most honourable members of this House would agree that a Palestinian homeland must be found. I would suggest that southern Lebanon is not the place and that the virtual partitioning of the country that now exists really is not the answer. The United Nations and countries such as Australia can make a positive move in trying to force this question if this vexed situation of the Lebanon and the Middle East is to be solved. Israel is certainly concerned about the PLO's activities at its border. The presence of the PLO does not help the stability of that region at all. J ordan may be the answer but until that question is the faced this war will continue. The major nations appear, at the moment, to be doing absolutely nothing. Australia, of course, has representation in Beirut and our diplomatic staff there are in constant danger. They would appear to have very few personal security arrangements at all available to them. Embassy staff are being threatened regularly by members of the leftist and PLO factions and one would hope that the security at the Embassy and the provision of more equipment there would help overcome that security problem. In the western sector there is little or no opportunity for Lebanese from the Christian sector to apply for migration or reunification with their families in Australia. I believe we urgently need to solve that problem, too.",35

89,Mr CONNOLLY ,ACCOUNTS,Bradfield)-On behalf of the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts I present the 197th report of the Committee. Ordered that the report be printed.,36
90,Mr CONNOLLY,ACCOUNTS,"by leave-The Committee's 197th report covers its inquiry into the administration by the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs of the coal export duty. The inquiry resulted from comments in the 1979-80 Auditor-General's report which disclosed unsatisfactory features relating to the collection and administration of the duty-a sum exceeding $90m for that year. Shortly before the Auditor General's examination, the Government enacted changes to the coal export duty legislation which significantly increased the administrative procedures for duty collection. The major affect of these changes was to levy a lower rate of $1 per tonne on open cut coal mined below a vertical depth of 60 metres from the surface, while retaining the higher rate of $3.50 per tonne on exports of all other high grade coking coals. This policy change requires that the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs determine the-ratio of coal in the respective categories in each shipment to assess the duty accurately. This was beyond the technical capability of that Department. The calculations involved required staff experienced in quantity surveying and mining engineering which were not then available. The Committee was advised that while the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs is responsible for duty collection, policy aspects and rate determination are the responsibility of the Department of Trade and Resources. Consequently both departments were examined by the Committee. Submissions were also requested from the New South Wales and Queensland coal authorities. Discussions were held with mining companies and representatives of the New South Wales Combined Colliery Proprietors' Association. The Committee visited coal mining and export operations at Moura, Goonyella and Hay Point in Queensland, and at Appin and Westcliff in New South Wales. These inspections provided the Committee with a detailed appreciation of the problems affecting the coal export industry in Australia. The Committee's inquiry into this issue determined that, given the complexity of the 1979 legisthe lative changes, the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs has improved its procedures for the collection of the duty. However the Committee considers that there should have been greater consultation between the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and the Department of Trade and Resources prior to the introduction of these legislative changes. This consultation was particularly necessary in view of the fact that the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs had indicated that there would be substantial difficulties involved in implementing the new arrangements, particularly in relation to open cut mining below 60 metres. The Committee suggests that further improvements could be made if the Government reviewed the coal export duty legislation to determine whether a simpler method of duty collection exists which would not discourage the use of high cost specialised technology in open cut mines. The Committee was also concerned that there was little evidence of Federal-State government co-operation or coordination in the taxation of the coal export industry. In such a situation it is possible for a trend to develop whereby the industry suffers from a proliferation of taxation systems through the actions of each sector of government trying to maximise its own revenue from coal export receipts while paying insufficient regard to the total tax burden on the industry. Evidence of this trend was given by the New South Wales Combined Colliery Proprietors' Association. Between December 1980 and September 1981 the Association estimated that the 'take' by governments increased by 34.5 per cent for a typical Hunter Valley thermal coal project. The Utah Development Co., which operates coal mines in Queensland, has calculated that the total Federal and State government share of its income in 1981 was 71.6 per cent, an increase of 5.2 per cent in one year. The Public Accounts Committee has aways based its activities on the principle that it does not concern itself with government policy issues, but considers the administrative implications arising frm the implementation of stated policy. However, in the matter of coal export duty the Committee has sympathy with the industry's difficulties in planning ahead in view of the number of changes made in the Government's policy in this area. From January 1976 to May 1979 assurances were given by successive Ministers that the coal export duty would be abolished. Since then, for budgetary and other reasons, the duty has been retained and even extended. In addition, there have been almost annual changes to duty rates since 1975, when the coal export duty was first introduced. These factors, combined with the lack of Federal-State Government co-operation, have had the effect of creating considerable uncertainty within the coal export industry, which already requires a high level of predictability because of its long lead time for development and expansion. The view was put by the industry to the Committee that duty is a discriminatory tax, applying to only one part of the mining industry in Australia. Additionally, it was said that the duty did not take account of world coal prices or differoperating. ent profitability factors affecting individual mines, particularly between producers in Queensland and New South Wales. As a result of these views, the Committee briefly examined alternative systems of taxation which could be applied to the industry, including ad valorem, proportional and progressive profits levies, resource rent taxes, as well as lump sum and royalty bidding schemes. We have not commented on the merits of individual systems, but rather have provided information in our report to encourage further discussion. We also await with interest the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce on the Australian export coal industry. I commend the report to honourable members.",37
91,Mr DUFFY ,ACCOUNTS,"Holt) - by leave-The 197th report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts clearly spells out many unsatisfactory features of the collection and administration of the coal export levy. The Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Connolly), has outlined those administrative problems in some detail. However, I desire to deal briefly with the matter of lack of consultation and cooperation between Federal and State governments, a matter which is of particular concern. It is essential that the problem presented by the making of such unco-ordinated demands on the coal industry be resolved. The Committee recognises that the present system of taxation, which levies duty on a flat rate per tonne, is not necessrevenue arily the most appropriate for the industry. The report refers to a Green Paper of February 1981 on mining policy presented by the Northern Territory Minister for Mines and Energy. That paper, which provided an analysis of various types of mineral taxation used throughout the world, is outlined in appendix D of the report. It is my view that the coal export levy should replaced by a well structured profits-related resource rent tax. Such a tax has many advantages. In particular, it is stable and predictable and would replace a proliferation of State taxes and charges, as well as the Federal Government's present tax, which has changed-without the coal industry being consultedfive times in six years. Given that that industry involves large amounts of capital expenditure and the long time spans associated with new developments, any taxation system imposed on it should be reasonable and predictable. That would be achieved by a profitrelated resource rent tax. Of course, that would involve consultation with the States, in order to rationalise the various tax systems presently The ultimate objective would be to replace existing charges with a profits related tax. It is to be hoped that the States would see reason on this issue, but as a last resort the Commonwealth Government would have to consider reducing general revenue grants to some States by the amount of the tax involved. There is upon both the Commonwealth and State governments a strong obligation to resolve the problems that have been created by a system of taxation on the coal industry, which is presently in a state of chaos.",38
92,Mr BAUME ,ACCOUNTS,"Macarthur)-by leave-I seek the opportunity, very briefly, to commend that conclusion of the 197th report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts which urges that State and Commonwealth governments should enter into discussions with the coal industry and other interested organisations with a view to developing a co-ordinated approach to the fair and equitable taxation of export coal. The House is well aware of the view of many honourable members that the present system of applying to coal exports a levy on a volume basis, unrelated to profits, is having an adverse effect on the profitability of many mines, particularly those in the Illawarra and south-western regions, which are showing substantial losses. Of course, that is only part of the reason for those losses. The prime cause is the coal transport fiasco in New South Wales. However, there is no doubt that State and Commonwealth goverments are competing for from the coal mining industry. It seems unreasonable that these volume-style taxes should be applied irrespective of present profitability. Whether the way to resolve it is to adopt the Australian Labor Party's suggested resource rental tax, which it claims is profit-oriented, is a matter for much more detailed examination. I might add that the two phrases represent contradiction in terms. Either one pays rent for a resource or a tax be on one's profits. However, the Committee's report poses a very serious proposition that I hope the Government would take into account in attempting to resolve the situation in which there is a determined attempt by State and Commonwealth governments, acting together, to kill a goose that has been trying to lay some golden eggs for this nation.",38
93,Mrs KELLY ,ACCOUNTS,"Canberra)-by leave-As one who is a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts I wish to speak briefly in support of a couple of its recommendations. I would like to develop first section 4.5 of its conclusions and recommendations, part of which states: From 1976 to May 1979 the Government had given unequivocal assurances that the duty would be abolished, but since then for budgetary and other reasons the duty has been retained and extended. This has siderable uncertainty with regard to the duty in the coal export industry. That was one finding that emerged conclusively from our extensive inquiry into the export coal levy, because the industry just did not know what exactly was the intention of the Government in regard to the collection of the levy. Since the Budget Speech of 17 August 1976 the Government has stated consistently, that the tax is inappropriate. However, it has continued to levy it. That has produced considerable uncertainty in the industry. However, one of the major problems arose as a result of the decisions in the 1979-80 Budget, and the following decision of 13 November 1979 regarding the further amending of the duty. This presented considerable additional administrative problems of collection, particularly in relation to the imposition on high quality coking coals, extracted from existing open cut mines at a depth greater than 60 metres, a rate of duty of $1 per tonne in recognition of the high cost of specialised technology necessary to extract open cut coals from those depths. The problem arose when two different levies were imposed and the amount of money that the particular companies had to pay had to be determined. This posed a particular problem for the mines in Queensland which members of the Committee observed at first hand. For example, in Queensland the problem was so great that there were three separate areas where open cut, underground and below 60 metres mines exist within the one complex and where coal from all sources is washed at the one preparation plant. Coal does not become dutiable until it reaches the point of exportation. So a mixture of coal can be dutiable at a number of rates. That is what the members of the Committee examined in some detail. Firstly, there was total uncertainty in the industry about the future of the levy and, secondly, it was very hard actually to assess those different types of duty imposed that were based on the level at which a company was mining and the type of mining that was going on. My colleagues also referred to the inequalities in the current duty that is imposed on our coal industry. I hope that members of the Government will take seriously the recommendations that the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts has submitted today in this report. NA",38

Ordered that the reports be printed.",39
95,Mr TAMBLING ,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Northern Territory)-by leave-The first report tabled relating to the construction of facilities for a tactical fighter squadron at the Royal Australian Air Force base at Darwin has electoral significance to me and is of concern to many of my constituents. It is important because the RAAF base at Darwin is an integral part of that community in the areas of defence, civil aviation, industrial matters and the residential situation within the city. The RAAF personnel make up a very significant number of people in the Darwin community. They make a very compounded contribution to both the economic life and the recreational lifestyle of Darwin. The suburban environment of Darwin is enhanced by the RAAF base itself and the fact that many of the defence personnel live off the base. There is a very strong involvement of defence personnel in the sporting, social and recreational activities of the city. The proposed build-up of defence facilities in northern Australia, and particularly on the RAAF base, is very welcome. Not only will the new fighter squadron complement Australia's defence and policy initiatives in northern Australia but also the work that is envisaged will give an ongoing commitment to the building and construction industry of the Northern Territory. At the same time there will be a marked increase in population for Darwin as a result of these initiatives which will advantage the commercial and consumer activities of Darwin and add further to the contribution that the RAAF personnel make-the contribution which all defence personnel make-to social and recreational life. I wish to highlight a couple of concerns which I believe the report deals with. One relates to the noise controls that are necessary but must be retained at acceptable levels, particularly with regard to engine testing, when the new squadron is transferred to Darwin. I think we should guarantee that at all times the noise levels will not impinge on adjoining residential areas to an extent that they will make life uncomfortable for the residents. Similarly, any testing should also be very mindful of the effects on the industrial complex at Winnellie which is adjacent to the RAAF Reports base at Darwin. I would highlight also as a point of concern the need for very careful and sensitive town planning and environmental control. The airport is a central feature of the Darwin city. craft must take off over parts of the city. The Coconut Grove and Nightcliff areas in particular need to be sensitively handled by the town planning authorities and at the same time by defence people. They should be aware of the type of activities that will exist. The final issue I raise as a matter of concern, which I think the Department of Defence should look at most carefully, is the provision of recreational facilities for the additional personnel who will come into live at the RAAF base at Darwin. We must make sure that there is adequate family suport, both in the social area and in the physical facilities, that at all times continues the complementary activities of the defence role in the Northern Territory.",39
96,Mr HUMPHREYS ,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Griffith)-by leave-As a member of the Public Works Committee I was happy to go to Darwin to attend the public hearing which was held in that city. I was very happy to hear the evidence of the Department of Defence and the Department of Housing and Construction. The one matter which disturbed me very seriously was that representatives of the Department of Defence stated in evidence that no environmental impact study was required. It is very interesting to see that the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation is to present a report once this debate is concluded. I am disturbed because a squadron of Mirage jets will be flying into Darwin. Everyone in the House will be well aware of the noise that will be impacted on the people of Darwin by a squadron of Mirage jets. Yet we were told by the Department of Defence that no EIS was required. However, the Department of Defence did undertake, very courteously, to have a Mirage jet fly from Williamtown in New South Wales to the Northern Territory so that the people of Darwin could be subjected to the noise that Mirage jets make when they take off during the day-time and when they run up the engines at the run-up facilities. As the Committee found out, those facilities proved to be totally inadequate. Members of the Committee insisted that the Department of Defence make arrangements for the Mirage jet to take off at night-time also so that people would be well aware of the noise involved in night-time operations. I want to put the message across that I was disturbed, along with other members of the Committee, that the Department of Defence took such a light-hearted view of the matter and did not really consider the noise impact on Darwin which would be forthcoming when the squadron of Mirage jets were to land and take off in that city during the day and night. My criticism of the AirDepartment of Defence is that it should pay more attention to these issues. Noise pollution by aircraft is a very important matter. If the Department does not intend to take a certain stance on this matter the Parliament should take a heavier hand on the Department to ensure that it does so. NA NA",40
97,Mr HODGES ,ENVIRONMENT AND CONSERVATION,"Petrie)-On behalf of the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation, I present the report of the Committee entitled 'Hazardous Chemical Wastes-Storage, Transport and Disposal', together with extracts from the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be printed.",40
98,Mr HODGES,ENVIRONMENT AND CONSERVATION,"by leave-The report which I have just tabled is the first report on the Committee's inquiry into hazardous chemicals and is the 21st report of the Committee since its establishment in 1973. In the course of the inquiry the Committee was so alarmed by hazardous waste disposal practices in some States that it decided to make a separate report on the adequacy of disposal facilities and procedures ahead of the main report. The Committee hopes to table its report on the rest of the inquiry during the Budget sittings. - The consequences of the improper disposal of hazardous wastes have been known for some time and have been dramatically drawn to public attention through disasters overseas such as Love Canal in the United States of America and Lekkerkerk in the Netherlands. These have had serious health consequences such as miscarriages, birth defects and respiratory problems and have cost tens of millions of dollars to clean up. While major disasters such as Love Canal have attracted considerable media attention the Committee is just as concerned about smaller episodes of improper disposal of hazardous waste as these are equally capable of causing damage. Hazardous wastes must be identified and properly managed to protect the community and the environment. It should not be thought that disasters occur only overseas. The report notes that there are many instances in Australia of improper disposal. While New South Wales and Victoria have made considerable progress in providing regulations and facilities for the disposal of hazardous wastes, some other States behave as though these hazards do not exist. In Brisbane the Committee inspected the official liquid waste disposal facility at Willa wong. This facility and the neglect by the authorities responsible for ensuring its safe ation can only be described as appalling. The facility is operated by a private company under contract to the Brisbane City Council. There is little control over the types of wastes disposed of to landfill at Willawong as carriers are not required to disclose the nature of wastes. Highly toxic wastes are land filled under grossly inadequate conditions. Toxic wastes are escaping from the site into nearby creeks-one appropriately called Blunder Creek-which then flow into the Brisbane River. These waterways are now contaminated with persistent toxic chemicals such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and heavy metals. Even if Willa wong were to be closed down today these chemicals would continue to leach from this swampy area. Wastes from the site will need to be contained and some soil may need to be removed. The cost of cleaning up the site and rendering it safe is likely to be many millions of dollars. The Queensland Government and the Brisbane City Council are only now starting to attack the problem with some determination, and it will be a number of years before acceptable alternative facilities can be designed and constructed. The situation at present can be described only as a disaster. Likewise the practices in many other cities are of concern in the serious risks they pose to health and the environment. In contrast the Castlereagh liquid waste facility in Sydney operated by the Metropolitan Waste Disposal Authority is of a high standard although only an interim facility. This facility is backed up by comprehensive regulation of waste transport and storage. In those States lacking adequate disposal facilities there is a general lack of control over hazardous wastes from their generation, storage and transport to their disposal. An overall hazardous waste management strategy is necessary to ensure that these wastes are identified and are handled safely at all stages, and that improper or illegal procedures are eliminated. The Committee has recommended accordingly. Outside of New South Wales and Victoria, basic information is lacking on the types and quantities of hazardous wastes being generated. As such information is the starting point for attacking the problem, the outlook for most States, in the short term, is bleak. Sound technologies are currently available to handle the storage and disposal of most of the hazardous wastes produced in Australia. However, United States surveys have shown that sound technologies available were not being used for 90 per cent of wastes. The cost of cleaning up unsafe disposal sites greatly exceeds the cost of proper disposal, with clean-up costs often being borne by the community rather than by those responsible oper- for the wastes. The Committee has recommended a funding scheme to reduce the burden on the community of such clean-ups. Wastes requiring special disposal methods, such as high temperature incineration, must be stored until proper facilities are available. The Committee is concerned that in the absence of adequate control machinery intractable wastes are being improperly disposed of instead of being held in secure storage. The Committee has recommended that generators of hazardous wastes be required to register these wastes, keep records of quantities generated, stored and disposed of, and make regular returns of this information to regulatory authorities. The Committee further recommends that national standards be developed for recycling, immobilisation and disposal facilities; that all operators involved in the handling of hazardous wastes be licensed; that licensed operations be regularly inspected and public access given to the results of monitoring tests; and that penalties for nonobservance of waste standards and regulations be substantial. High temperature incineration is an area where a national approach is urgently required. The economics are such that a single incinerator would be markedly more cost effective than two or more smaller scale incinerators. Since the Committee's report was finalised the New South Wales Government has announced a proposal for a high temperature incinerator to be built at Wetherill Park in Sydney in conjunction with a treatment and disposal plant for more tractable liquid wastes. The Committee has recommended that the Commonwealth urgently seek the views of the States and the Northern Territory and, if appropriate, seek national access to the Sydney incinerator. The Committee's report is quite critical of aspects of the proposal by the Environment Protection Authority of Victoria to establish a disposal facility at Avalon for intractable wastes, a site considered to be totally unacceptable. Soon after the Committee finalised its report the Victorian Government announced that the proposed facility was to be moved to the Werribee sewerage farm not far away. Since that announcement there has been a change of government in Victoria. Nonetheless, the Committee's criticism of the initial proposal should be borne in mind in the assessment of this or any future proposals. The Committee is concerned that present land use planning schemes allow residential areas to come too close to plants using or storing hazardous chemicals, including waste disposal facilities and vice versa. The Committee has recommended that standards be developed to ensure the safety of closed waste disposal sites and that programs be developed to identify sites of past disposal so that they can be assessed and any necessary remedial action taken. The regulation of hazardous industrial waste is usually seen as a State responsibility, consequently approaches vary widely. An overwhelming problem in the regulation of hazardous chemicals generally is the fragmentation of responsibility between State and Commonwealth governments and between departments within each level of government. Administration of the area has largely developed on an ad hoc basis with little attention being given to ensuring the comprehensiveness and uniformity of regulation. Most of the problems involved are common to all States and Territories. Industry and other community interests have sought some uniformity of standards and regulation across Australia rather than the present unco-ordinated situation. The problem is a national one and requires a coordinated national approach for its most effective resolution. Evidence given to the Committee clearly indicates confusion as to where to go for advice on hazardous chemicals. The regulation of the transport of hazardous wastes is an important element in hazardous waste control. To ensure that loads are delivered to appropriate disposal sites and that the full nature of the waste is disclosed, the Committee has recommended that a docket system be developed for the effective control of waste handling. The present. regulation of radioactive wastes is less than adequate. In New South Wales and Western Australia there have been recent discoveries of radioactive wastes from sand mining operations being improperly disposed of such that houses, schools and shops have been built on top of the wastes. Despite their radioactivity having been known for a long time, the lack of effective control over their disposal has uals being unnecessarily and insidiously exposed for considerable periods. As I have already noted, arrangements within and between the States are fragmented and lack uniformity. At the Commonwealth level the situation is no better. Several Commonwealth departments and authorities approached by the Committee were unaware of their responsibilities concerning hazardous chemicals. In the Australian Capital Territory basic legislation and regulatory machinery is absent. Little information is available on the amount and types of wastes being generated, stored or disposed of in the Australia Capital Territory. The Territory lacks legislation regulating the transport or disposal of hazardous waste. Since the report was finalised the Committee inspected the chemic;:tl waste disposal facility at the West Belconnen tip. The Committee was concerned to discover that chemicals which require high temperature incineration for proper disposal are being buried in drums at the site which drains into, and is not far from, the Murrumbidgee River. It is the leaking of buried drums containing toxic wastes that has contaminated ground and surface water in many instances in the United States. While the quantities involved in the Australian Capital Territory are small, this is no excuse for improper disposal. The Committee has recommended that a hazardous waste management strategy for the Australia Capital Territory be prepared as a matter of urgency and that legislation to regulate effectively the notification, transport and disposal of hazardous wastes in the Australia Capital Teritory be prepared and introduced. The National Advisory Committee on Chemicals, which is made up of representatives of each State, Territory, the Commonwealth, the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Australian Agricultural Council, is also working on the development of a policy-oriented national strategy. This has not been completed. The Secretariat of the Advisory Committee is provided by the Commonwealth. For the reasons set out in the report, the Committee does not believe the Secretariat has sufficient staff to fulfil all of its responsibilities. The whole idea of such a body is to make the best use of a small, specialised staff and avoid costly duplication of work by each of the States, Territories and the Commonwealth, and also to avoid the costs to industry and the community of non-uniform regulation. The costs of failure are high. To skimp on the staffing of that Secretariat is false economy and defeats the purpose of the Advisory Committee. I point out to the House that we are only talking about a small resulted in individnumber of staff. Most areas of responsibility for hazardous waste management fall within the ambit of State governments. The Committee's concern over the lack of effective control of wastes in some States led to its seeking legal opinions as to the limits of the Commonwealth's power in the area. The opinions received point to two important powers through which the Commonwealth could exercise extensive power to regulate hazardous waste management and disposal in Australia; these are, the corporations power and the interstate trade power. The Committee believes that if the introduction of effective State legislation is taking too long the Commonwealth should introduce legislation to have effect until such time as each State has its own legislation in place. The Committee has recommended that if State governments have failed to introduce effective hazardous waste management strategies by 1985 the Commonwealth should legislate to control such wastes to the fullest extent of its power. The report of the Committee is a unanimous one, with members feeling strongly about the inadequacies of the present situation. I thank the other members of the Committee for the time and effort they put into this inquiry. Finally, it is my firm belief that committees of this Parliament are well served by staff, from committee clerks to typists. On this occasion I pay tribute to the Secretary of the inquiry, Allan Kelly, to researcher Jennifer Goodger, and also to the typist Robyn Mack. I commend the report to the House.",40
99,Dr JENKINS ,ENVIRONMENT AND CONSERVATION,"Scullin)-by leave-The development of modern industrial technology and processes has meant a proliferation of chemical substances for use in those processes and as waste products of such processes. Public awareness about these substances and their hazards was low for many years. The community raised questions only when tragic events, notably the Love Canal episode, occurred overseas. Such episodes overseas promoted the production of a great deal of significant legislation. I think the United States America had cause to examine thoroughly what was going on there and started a satisfactory system of regulation. When I was in Washington I was fortunate enough to discuss some of these processes with some of the people involved. I think one of the innovative schemes was the super fund that was established to clear up hazardous chemicals and to ensure their safety. It is interesting to note that the Reagan Administration, as part of its cost paring, suggested that 25 per cent of hazardous waste could be disposed of in land fill. There was such a public outcry that that order was rescinded a very short time after it was given. It can be surprising to note just how close to home these episodes can strike. For instance, in my electorate a recreational lake-Edwardes Park Lake-which is used for sailing and boating, is set in a general picnic area. Oil contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls, called PCBs, was disposed of on site at a nearby junk yard, with inadequate precaution and inadequate regulation. These PCBs found their way into that recreationallake. As a result, by health standards the PCB levels in the lake are unacceptably high. These levels persist. This situation is indicative of the problems which have horrified the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation during its inquiries. The first report of the Committee deals only with storage, disposal and transport of hazardous wastes. A subsequent report will give a total picture of the management of chemicals potentially hazardous to health and the environment. The Committee has in general made recommendations which necessitate the co-operation of the States. It is hoped that this co-operation will be achieved through the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment ( Mr Wilson) and the Australian Environment Council. However, the Committee feels strongly about the lack of past and recent action. It directed its consideration to the powers held by the Commonwealth if sensible action could not be brought about by consultation and co-operation with other bodies. To this end, it obtained an opinion from Professor Geoffrey Sawer regarding Commonwealth powers relating to the safe transport, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes. This opinion is attached as appendix VII to the report. The opinion certainly points out that the Commonwealth has substantial power in this field and cannot resile from taking effective action on the grounds of lack of powers. In particular, Professor Sawer referred to the corporations power and the interstate trade power in the Constitution as very effective powers in this area. Opinions from the of Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and the Parliamentary Library supported Professor Sawer's opinion. As a result, the Committee, which feels very strongly about the urgent need to adopt effective waste disposal strategies, made perhaps its most important recommendation, namely: If State governments fail to introduce effective waste disposal strategies by 1985, the Commonwealth legislate to control hazardous wastes to the fullest extent of its power. If reason, consultation and co-operation with the States cannot bring a result, there is no dodging responsibility at the Federal level. The inquiry found a very unsatisfactory situation overall. Conditions vary considerably from State to State, from facility to facility. We believe prime responsibility for action lies with the generator, but we need some mechanisms to determine the real volume of hazardous wastes. That is why the initial recommendations of the Committee deal so much with registration of various details of the wastes. Such registration will allow a clear view of the course of the hazardous waste from generation to disposal. Indeed, this knowledge may lead to an increase in economically viable recycling programs. A small portion of hazardous waste is intractable in its nature. It is too toxic to be disposed of by routine methods-air, water or landfill. The quantity of this is not known. At the moment it is held on site, usually by the generators, until a satisfactory disposal method is available. The Committee felt that it was highly probable that some of this material was improperly disposed of or illegally dumped. Some of it has been stored in the open in steel drums for years. is frightening to consider what may happen with the possible corrosion of drums and the release of contents. The Committee presses a strong case for uniform standards for storage of such waste. Probably the storage sites should be managed by regulating authorities. In any case, such storage sites should be licensed. We referred to the methods of disposing of such wastes. We urge a co-operative approach between the Commonwealth and the States towards incinerator construction. To date the inquiry has been an instructive and absorbing exercise. The force of the recommendations are strong. They represent the unanimous view of the all-party Commitee. I strongly urge quick action on these matters.",43
100,Deus ex machina,ENVIRONMENT AND CONSERVATION,Sitting suspended from 12.59 to 2 p.m.,44
101,Mr BURR ,ENVIRONMENT AND CONSERVATION,"Wilmot)-by leave-I congratulate the honourable member for Petrie ( Mr Hodges) and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation for the work they have done in exposing what I consider to be one of the most disgusting and disgraceful parts of our industrial development in Australia. From the investigations that we have been conducting over a period of some 12 months, it is obvious that in the course of our industrial development in Australia we are naturally using quite a lot of dangerous and toxic chemical components in our industrial manufacturing processes. Very little thought has been given to the way in which those industrial wastes will be disposed of. At Castlereagh in New South Wales we inspected what I consider to be the best attempt in this country to dispose of chemical wastes. In that instance the New South Wales Metropolitan Waste Disposal Authority is making a very good, genuine and concerted attempt to dispose of the hazardous industrial waste from the Sydney metropolitan area, at a cost of some millions of dollars to the New South Wales Government. While the Victorian Government's attempts are not as advanced as those of New South Wales, at least the Victorian Government is making some attempts to dispose properly of hazardous chemical wastes. Unfortunately in no other State is any attempt being made to dispose properly of chemical wastes. In Brisbane we observed what I consider to be one of the most disgraceful exhibitions by public authorities in this country. I made that comment publicly while the Committee was in Brisbane inspecting the disposal area at Willa wong. That area could be likened only to the very dangerous Love Canal situation in New York where many It people lost their lives or were deformed in some way, not knowing that they were being affected by chemical wastes. That same situation, in my view, would without doubt have developed in Brisbane had the Committee not conducted its investigations. The report outlines very clearly the nature of the dangers that we discovered in Brisbane. I found even more disturbing the fact that both the authorities in the Brisbane City Council and the Queensland Government disclaim any responsibility for the situation that has developed. It was quite obvious that the Brisbane City Council was responsible because the area was under its authority. It is unreasonable to expect a local government authority to provide the millions of dollars that are necessary to provide a properly integrated waste disposal area. The Queensland Government has a very real responsibility. In my view it is shirking its responsibility and not doing what the people of Queensland have a right to expect it to do. Despite anything we have said in this report and despite actions that are now being taken by the Queensland Government to investigate problems in the Brisbane city area, I strongly urge the Queensland Government to put the weight of its resources behind helping the Brisbane City Council to provide a proper integrated waste disposal area in the Brisbane city area. I believe the Queensland people have a right to expect that. Unfortunately, in none of the other States, apart from New South Wales and Victoria, was any attempt being made by any State government to assist local government in the proper disposal of hazardous chemicals. In Western Australia we inspected a disposal area which was operated by the Canning City Council. Within the limitations of its resources the Canning City Council was doing the best it could but without any assistance at all from the Western Australian Government. In the course of our investigations and inspections we looked only at the major metropolitan areas in Australia. We did not look at the smaller industrial areas of Australia. This report cannot highlight where there are problems in those areas, but without doubt problems exist that at this stage are not exposed. Therefore, residents in those areas are exposed to dangers. I think particularly of areas such as Albury-Wodonga.",44
102,Mr LUSHER ,ENVIRONMENT AND CONSERVATION,Not Tasmania.,44
103,Mr BURR,ENVIRONMENT AND CONSERVATION,The honourable member for Hume ( Mr Lusher) reminds me of Hobart and other parts of Tasmania and of those other smaller industrial areas of Australia. I strongly urge the authorities in the smaller industrial areas and their State governments to look very closely at the hidden problems of industrial waste disposal. If these very hazardous toxic wastes are not properly disposed of residents living in those areas will be exposed to extreme dangers.,44
104,Mr WEST ,ENVIRONMENT AND CONSERVATION,"Cunningham)-by leave-This is a timely report. Over 50,000 chemicals are now in active industrial and commercial use. Many are highly toxic and at least 129 of them are registered in the United States of America. under the Priority Pollutants Register of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. These 129 chemicals can be classified as highly dangerous to humans and the environment. Many chemicals have been released accidentally or purposely into the environment and they have produced great problems. Pesticides have accumulated in the food chain. A related group of chemicals, polychlorinated biphenyls or PCBs, have probably caused many more problems. They are banned from manufacture in the United States and their importation to Australia is banned. They can cause numbness of limbs, deformities of bones and joints and still-births and they are already widespread in the environment here and overseas. A 1979 survey of the Brisbane River mullet found levels of PCBs which exceeded the tolerance levels set by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Many horror stories result from the dumping of toxic chemicals. The most famous one has been referred to here today; that is, the Love Canal incident in which Hooker Chemicals dumped 22,000 tonnes of toxic chemicals in the canal and covered them. Eventually leachate from this dump caused miscarriages, birth defects, respiratory problems and nervous breakdowns amongst nearby residents. The clean-up cost approximately $50m. We have been lucky in Australia not to have experienced an environmental disaster similar to Love Canal. However, it could happen here. I refer, as did my colleagues on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation, to the Willa wong disposal facility in Brisbane. All workers have been told to leave their jobs for health reasons and toxic wastes are leaching into tributaries of the Brisbane River. Australia has no compulsory controls over the introduction of these chemicals for commercial and industrial use, and a majority of State laws governing their· use, transport and mate disposal are disparate and inadequate. In many cases the disposal techniques can only be classified as scandalously negligent. In the metropoitan area of Sydney, a high degree of control is exercised by the New South Wales Metropolitan Waste Disposal Authority which is, of course, a State Government instrumentality. All generators and transporters must be licensed and strict surveillance is carried out as the tanker cargoes are received at the Castlereagh land facility, which we inspected. Records are kept. PCBs, lead, cadmium, arsenic, toxic pesticides and cyanides are not accepted. The land fill is based upon non-permeability of soil, and a strict monitoring of the water table is maintained. But let us contrast this situation with the deplorable practices carried out in the Brisbane area at Willa wong, which is a swampy low-lying area, on the flood plain of the Brisbane River. I found the evidence given by former employees and chemists incredible and unbelievable. The Petersen Government completely reneges its responsibilities to the Brisbane City Council and the Council attempts to carry out an operation which should clearly be under the jurisdiction of either State or Federal government. This facility is contracted to two companies,one of which also transports the hazardous chemicals to Willawong. The generator is not obliged to inform the transporter what chemicals are involved. The receivers have no idea what is going into the ground. Extremely intractable wastes are supposed to be banned but the Committee exacted hard evidence that they have been received. We received evidence that PCBs, cyanide, lead and cadmium have all been sent to Willawong and have very probably been received. No records are kept and often the drivers do not know what they are carrying. The disposal technique is not containment in impermeable clay. It is exactly the opposite situation to that which applies at Castlereagh. Trenches are dug in areas previously saturated with nightsoil and 12 million litres per annum of extremely hazardous liquid wastes are poured into the soil to be absorbed into the environment. As one witness, Mr Carlisle, told the Committee: Willa wong has now become this big sponge full of unknown liquids which will gradually leak out. It is leaching out now and we don't know how much will leach out in the next few decades. I might add that a clean-up operation could eventually cost millions of dollars if we are to avoid another US Love Canal type of disaster. I blame the State and Federal governments for not developing a responsible method of disposal under a tight State-Federal legislative umbrella. ulti- Such is the shocking situation in some States. Let me briefly mention Victoria and Western Australia. In Victoria, the previous Liberal Government attempted to establish a treatment facility storage area and high temperature incinerator for hazardous wastes at Avalon near Geelong. This was the wrong site, by reason of poor geology and proximity to the Government Aircraft Factories. Strong opposition forced the Victorian Government to act hastily during the recent election campaign and switch the site to Werribee. But the geology at Werribee is still inadequate. I am told that the new State Labor Government has established a task force which will investigate the problem of safe disposal of intractable wastes in the Melbourne metropolitan area. But to my colleague in Victoria I say this: The siting of the new Victorian facilities must be planned to reduce environmental and health risks to an absolute minimum and the site must be the right one-undeniably not at Werribee! In Perth, Western Australia, the Canning City Council has run a facility based on evaporation and permeation similar to the facility at Willawong, Brisbane. Perth is increasingly taking its water supply from the water table. Apparently the State Government is now examining other areas at a proposed facility based on a secured land fill. It is incredible that these methods were ever allowed in the first place and it is incredible that they continue. The recommendations of this report are a guideline for a new system of management of the storage, transport and final disposal of intractable wastes in all the States and Territories. Such a revamped system, including State and Federal governments, envisages a registration of all generators, transporters and disposers the production of uniform standards for storage and disposal, ensuring that previously used sites are not used for housing, sport and recreation or for any other such purposes. If I might digress, members of the Committee were astounded in Brisbane when one of the managers of the Willa wong facility said that in the future, when the company had finished with the land as a site for a waste disposal facility, it might be used as playing fields-an area for children to play on. Such is the administrative ignorance under which these intractable wastes are being disposed. Finally, such a system should allow for the classification of chemicals that can be received at land fill facilities and those which require final disposal by high temperature incineration. The Committee says that a single high temperature incinerator at a central site, probably near Sydney, could fulfil the national need without uneconomic duplication. Such an incinerator would dispose of PCBs and all the really hard chemicals. I understand that the site announced by the New South Wales Minister for this high temperature incinerator may be in the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman). I think there probably ought to be a public inquiry into the siting of this incinerator. There are two points to be considered. Although we need the high temperature level incinerator, there is still obvious argument about the site. That is the first point. The second point is whether other States will be given access to the facility. This is the area where there is need for Federal involvement to tie the whole thing together. There is no point in each State going to the expense of building its own high temperature incinerators when, as the Maunsell report and the report of this Committee says, one national incinerator would suffice. It is a matter of getting our act together and rationalising the whole matter. I say that to my New South Wales State colleagues who may not be so keen to receive waste from interstate! The Committee thinks much could be accomplished through State governments and the Australian Environment Council. Another Committee recommendation-I agree with my colleague the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins) when he says that it is the most important recommendation in the report-states: If the State governments fail to introduce effective waste disposal for 1985, the Commonwealth should legislate the control of hazardous wastes to the fullest extent of its power. The ideal situation is that registers be kept from the point of importation or manufacture, through their industrial or commercial use, through transport and to final disposal; that is, regulation and surveillance from the cradle to the grave, to use the American Environment Protection Authority term. This recommendation also raises the extent of Commonwealth constitutional power to act either as a co-ordinator or an enforcer if States will not comply. I refer to the legal opinions offered to the Committee by Professor Geoff Sawer, by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and by the Parliamentary Library. These opinions relate to constitutional powers afforded to the Commonwealth, which include power over trading corporations, trade and commerce, interstate trading, the issuance of export licences, taxation and levies powers, the High Court of Australia definition of the implied national power, power to acquire property and power to offer section 96 grants to the States. That is a pretty powerful constitutional package that we could fall back on if the States do not act. I believe that in all these areas the Commonwealth has sufficient constitutional authority to achieve comprehensive control over hazard chemicals, either by co-operation with the States or by direct Commonwealth action, or by a combination of both. I refer the House to the full published text of Professor Sawer's legal opinion, which is attached to the report. Mr Speaker, the Fraser Government is ignoring this immense problem, but the Committee has not ignored it! It has done a really good job and there has been a high degree of agreement. The Government's voluntary notification system for the introduction of new hazardous chemicals, currently run under the auspices of the National Advisory Committee on Chemicals, which is responsible to the Australian Environment Council, is simply inadequate. The Opposition requires a much more comprehensive approach. I envisage Commonwealth involvement from the point of introduction and use of new and existing hazardous chemicals, a compulsory and comprehensive licensing and regulatory scheme and strict national standards regarding industrial and commercial use, transport and final disposal. I thank the staff of the Committee for the work they have done and all the members of the Committee for the responsible way in which they have gone about a task which has involved literally dozens of days of hearings and inspections throughout Australia. Finally, let the House have no doubt about the urgency of the problem of safe usage and permanent disposal of poisonous and cancer-inducing chemicals and hazardous wastes. It is one of the great environmental issues of our times.",45
105,Dr KLUGMAN ,ENVIRONMENT AND CONSERVATION,"Prospect)-by leave-The honourable member for Cunningham ( Mr West) who has just sat down mentioned, as did the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation, the honourable member fpr Petrie ( Mr Hodges), that since the Committee's report was finalised the New South Wales Government has announced a proposal for a high temperature incinerator to be built at Wetherill Park in Sydney. Wetherill Park, which is near Fairfield, is in my electorate. There is strong opposition on two grounds to the proposal to build that incinerator. Basically the argument put forward by local residents in opposing it is obvious: risk. One of the difficulties is that we cannot assure the people that no risk is involved. The second objection-this is a much wider risk-is that the incinerator would be located about 1.5 kilometres from the Prospect reservoir which provides water for the city of Sydney. When one tries to look rationally at the proposal and not get too emotional-I can assure the House that it is not easy for the local residents to do that at present-it is difficult to assure people that no danger is involved when we take into account the report of the House of Lords Select Committee on Hazardous Waste Disposal which, in part, stated: . . . chemical . . . incinerators are subjected to very aggressive operating conditions; design imperfections are therefore readily identified and long periods of commissioning are required. The report of the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation states: Care will be required both during commissioning and during normal operation of any incinerator to minimise the chance of pollution in the event of equipment malfunction. The Committee makes the point that it is talking specifically about the rocking-drum type incinerator which is not the one proposed, as I understand it, for Wetherill Park. The Committee said that the reason for this is that the rocking-drum type of incinerator has not been built on this scale before. As I understand it the incinerator that is to be built at Wetherill Park has not been built on a similar scale before. I commend members of the Committee for giving us more ammunition in our fight, in our attempt, to stop the building of that incinerator at Wetherill Park. At page 34 of its report the Committee makes a recommendation. It states: The Commonwealth approach the New South Wales Government with a view to allowing national access to the Sydney incinerator either through cooperative funding of its construction or through a grant under section 96 of the Constitution. I do not know what the New South Wales Government's reply to that will be but I do think it is a matter of national importance. I think that the Commonwealth ought to be involved in it. I think that if the Commonwealth does become involved in it then before construction of a high temperature incinerator takes place a public inquiry into the proposal should be held under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. An inquiry has been promised now by the Minister for Planning and Environment in New South Wales, Mr Eric Bedford. The local council very strongly opposes the proposed incinerator. For all practical purposes, one would have to say that all the local residents oppose the There is a potential proposal. Before any attempt is made to go ahead, the inquiry which has been initiated by the New South Wales Government should take place. If any attempt is made to use an incinerator for the purpose of disposing of waste from other States it will be necessary to have a public inquiry which is provided for under Commonwealth legislation. My own view is that an incinerator is necessary to dispose of waste. Transport is an important issue and a cost factor. I think that such an incinerator should be built in some area which is fairly isolated and much further away from the city than Wetherill Park. It should not be built in a residential area or in an. area which is less than two kilometres from the water reservoir which supplies water to the city of Sydney. No matter how many safety features are included on that type of equipment it is obvious that it is possiblethe risk is very small but it is possible-that safety devices will not work on a particular occasion. For that reason, it is important that the incinerator is not built in a residential area or close to the water supply of Sydney. I again commend the report, especially its references to the original problem of reducing the amount of chemical waste which it is necessary to dispose of.",47
106,Mr HOWE ,ENVIRONMENT AND CONSERVATION,"Batman)-I ask leave of the House to make a short statement on the same matter. Leave not granted. Mr West-I raise a point of order. I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, with due respect, and I remind honourable members opposite who refused leave, that an arrangement has been made with the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation and the Deputy Whip to allow at least the members of the Committee to speak.

108,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ENVIRONMENT AND CONSERVATION,"Order! The honourable member has put his point. The matter to which he refers is one for resolution between the managers of business on both sides of the House. As far as the Chair is concerned the request was properly put and leave was refused by one dissentient voice, and there the matter must rest. If, by arrangement and not at the direction of the Chair, there is a will to recommit the matter the Chair will be responsive to that intention. Mr Bourchier-I raise a point of clarification. I discussed this matter with the Deputy Whip. He assured me that honourable members had approached him about speaking because he is the Chairman of the Committee. He gave me his assurance that no guarantee was given as to the number of speakers who would be given leave to speak in the debate.",48

113,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN ROAD TOLL,"Mr Speaker has received letters from the honourable member for Kennedy ( Mr Katter) and the honourable member for Werriwa ( Mr Kerin) proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by Standing Order 107 Mr Speaker has selected the matter which, in his opinion, is the most urgent and important, that is, that proposed by the honourable member for Kennedy, namely: The need to create a national awareness of the problem of the dreadful road toll throughout Australia. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their placesMONICA",48
114,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN ROAD TOLL,"I call the honourable member for Kennedy. Mr Bourchier- Mr Deputy Speaker, may 1 seek the indulgence of the Chair for a moment?",48
115,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN ROAD TOLL,Not at this juncture. The honourable member for Kennedy has the call. Mr Bourchier-It is rather important because-MONICA,48
116,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN ROAD TOLL,I am afraid that procedurally the intention of the honourable member for Bendigo cannot be accommodated. 1 call the honourable member for Kennedy.,48
117,Mr KATTER ,AUSTRALIAN ROAD TOLL,"Kennedy) (2.28)-1I have often wondered how the people of Australia regard what we call a matter of public importance. 1 think from time to time matters of public importance which come before this House are questionable in their purest sense. I think that all 124 members of this House and all 64 members of the Senate agree that there is no more critical issue affecting the daily lives of Australian families-it affects also those close to the families involvedthan the devastating road toll. In the next 15 minutes I will try to avoid becoming overemotional. Members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety live with, are involved with and come to grips with this appalling situation almost daily. It has become a cliche to come into this House and say that members of a committee are great fellows and they work hard, but I do not think anyone would stay on this Committee unless they had an involvement, emotional or otherwise, in trying to cut down the appalling road toll. The purpose of my bringing this matter forward, with the support of other people, is to try to expose to the nation just a little further what is happ-ning nationally relation to the road toll. I should like particularly to commend the media. Since soon after Easter, until now, there has been a continuing and accelerating interest. I well remember a young lady associated with Nationwide saying that the difficulty was to keep this thing moving. That is a difficulty. Something that perhaps lacks news value in many respects is difficult to keep in the public eye. The media people have responded in a magnificent manner because they appreciate the fact that they can play an important and continuing role in trying to instill in the Australian public an additional sense of responsibility about the road toll. I think that the Australian people should understand what our national House of Representatives Standing Committee on - oad Safety is about. It has been said to me: 'Why would six or seven of you fellows know more about road safety than we do?' That is pretty clear. First, we are a statutory committee. We take evidence on oath. We carefully select our witnesses. There is a combination of three things: The work of the Committee and the secretariat, the class of evidence that comes to us continually on oath, and the consultants. The consultants are inclined to be overlooked. At all our major hearings we get the services of what we consider to be, after evaluation, the best authorities in the land and, in many cases, out of the land, international authorities. They sit in and evaluate, check and test the evidence that comes forward in regard to the various questions that come before the Committee. For example, in considering the passenger vehicle-I shall explain the matter shortly-we had Peter Wherrett. That was not because he looks good on television, gets a lot of publicity and knows a lot about motor cars. There is a very special reason why the Committee chose Peter Wherrett and his counterpart from the United States. They were the two consultants that we had in the earlier days. It was because he was very interested in the subject and had embarked on a national operation of advanced driving, advanced testing and advanced training. So we thought that this man was deeply involved, apart from his obvious association with the motor vehicle. I mention that to indicate how we take every measure possible to get the best evidence and to test it and to test it again. We have had witnesses of extraordinary capacity and experience. We have had Volvo's design engineer from Sweden. This is not a commercial. I have rolled a Volvo. Someone has said: 'He is pretty good; he can even roll a Volvo'. If there is such a thing as a safe vehicle, the Volvo is the in nearest thing to it. Until about four years ago there had not been a fatality in a Volvo in Australia, but then came the crunch-and it was a crunch. Two or three young men in my electorate had a head-on collision in a Volvo and were killed instantly. The Committee has had as witnesses some directors from Mercedes, in Stuttgart in Germany. We have had Dr Brian Henderson, and the great Gordon Trinca, a man internationally recognised for his dedication and understanding, the president of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons and the President of the Road Trauma Committee. He is the co-author of the book Road Trauma, which I hope all honourable members have the opportunity of examining. I have sent copies of it to most honourable members. So we have had this line-up of witnesses over a period. In the sequence of inquiries has been the passenger vehicle and everything surrounding it, its suspension and its braking system, and roads. Roads came into our inquiries to a great degree. There has been much talk about roads lately and it has been suggested that it is perhaps we, members of the Federal Government, who are to blame because we do not inject more funding for the construction of better roads. I am sure that the House would not be surprised to know that most of the disastrous accidents that occur, the greatest sequence of accidents and the greatest continuity of accidents, are on the major highways. Some 50 per cent of accidents are in rural areas, but not on the bullock tracks, not on the across-property roads. They occur on the highways. Because of the magnificent contribution made by the beef roads system and so on, we have some great roads. I will not deny that we also have some terrible roads. But it is not right to accuse a government of being responsible for at least a significant proportion of road fatalities because of the lack of quality of many roads. The test is on the statistics and that argument does not make sense. I should like to indicate some of the measures that the Committee and the nation are beginning to recognise as measures that will at least take sensible and proven steps to achieve a reduction in the road toll. It is interesting to look at the figures for the countries that are more prominently associated with road fatalities and casualties. The latest figures show that the United States has the lowest death rate per 10,000 vehicles, at 3.4. Canada's rate is 3.4. The United Kingdom's rate is 3.7. New Zealand's rate is 4.3. Who is at the top of the list? We are-with five deaths per 10,000 vehicles. It is a great shame to find that we have a death rate that is more than 50 per cent greater than that of the United States, which is fairly famous over the time that the motor vehicle has been in operation. Where has it been shown that the fatalities mostly occur? What is the major factor that contributes to them? Is it speed? Is it the irresponsibility of young people who become overexhilarated? Although the greatest number of fatalities and casualties occur in the lower age groups, it has been proven, as the evidence that has come before the Committee shows, that some of the very strange habits of more elderly drivers contribute greatly to the casualty rate, so let us not state precisely that it is always the fault of the young person, because that is not so. But of course speed contributes. The condition of roads contributes. However, I am not telling anyone anything new. No one in the House will collapse with surprise when I say that the great predominating influence is grog. People used to talk of the 'drunken driver'. That is not said any more. What is now said is 'the drinking driver'. I should like to explain that the Committee started by examining the passenger vehicle and then moved to the heavy vehicle-heavy trucks, semi-trailers and so on. The accent, regrettably, has been on those in my own State in recent times. There has been a string of fatal accidents associated with semi-trailers. The Committee then went on to the bicycle and the motor cycle, and then on to human behaviour. That is what we are now dealing with. The first phase of dealing with the subject of human behaviour was an investigation into the influence of alcohol and drugs on road safety. Some very interesting evidence was forthcoming. I shall not talk of obvious solutions because there is no one solution. However, one can combine the various activities which will limit road fatalities. The one that has become the most spoken of, and the most tried approach to this subject, has been random breath testing. This subject has created something of a furore in certain States. I want to make it quite clear that we are not looking for confrontation with the States. My goodness, we could not live with ourselves if we were to throw this topic into the political arena. Had I needed another eight honourable members to stand up in this place and support discussion of this matter of public importance I am sure that, without any hesitation, I would have been able to get them from the other side of the House. It is interesting to see in the chamber one of the old team members who contributed greatly to this matter of road safety. I would like to try to explain the situation, but I hesitate, and for very good reason. Our Committee wants to work closely with each of the States. A study of the evidence will indicate that not a State in the whole of this nation has not made a most valuable contribution to the matter of road safety. I refer particularly to the contribution by Dr Jamison in Queensland. I could indicate on a State by State basis the profound contributions that have been made. But I respectfully say to the State authorities that, because they do not have the same continuing involvement in this matter and they do not have the same opportunities as the Commonwealth has to tap the information resources which are available throughout the world-they are at the very highest level-we feel we can contribute by making available to the States the results of the work of our Committee. I return to the matter of random breath testing. I do not like to talk about polls, but no one can deny that Morgan Gallup Polls have considerable influence. The results of a recent nationwide survey show that 80 per cent of the people who took part in the survey favour random breath testing and that in my State of Queensland 73 per cent favour it. Mr Braithwiate-How many?",48
118,Mr KATTER,AUSTRALIAN ROAD TOLL,"Seventy-three per cent in Queensland. It is very interesting that, on the proposal to introduce random breath testing in Victoria five to six years ago-I am speaking from memory-about 65 per cent were in favour, about 20 per cent were against it and the rest were undecided. The latest gallup poll in Victoria revealed that 91 per cent of the people are in favour of random breath testing in that State and 8 per cent are against it. Mention has been made of civil rights. It is said that governments should not introduce random breath testing because people are against it and it would be politically unwise to do so. Anyone who has the damned audacity to talk about what would be politically wise or unwise in relation to the dreadful death toll on our roads should be totally condemned. If anyone wants to talk about politics and civil rights, I would like to know what are the civil rights of a young fellow and his girlfriend or a man and his family who are travelling responsibly on the road, not having had a drink, and another person-a 007 with the right to kill-having filled himself with grog, gets behind the wheel of a motor car and sideswipes their car, killing the young fellow and his girlfriend or the man and his family or, even worse, imposing on them a living death by making them paraplegics, tetraplegics or vegetables for the rest of their days. It is a serious matter. I ask the Parliament and the people of this nation to support our Committee in our attempt to get national awareness on this very grave problem.",50
119,Mr MORRIS ,AUSTRALIAN ROAD TOLL,"Shortland) (2.44)-No one could but accept the appeal from the honourable member for Kennedy ( Mr Katter) for a greater national awareness of the road toll in this country and the problems associated with it. But for this section of the discussion let us be quite realistic. A wareness by itself is nothing. Awareness should generate action and in this whole issue, at this level, that is what is lacking. The matter proposed for discussion is: The need to create a national awareness of the problem the dreadful road toll throughout Australia. That is an admirable objective, but what does it mean when those who are aware of it and who have control of the national purse strings are content to remain aware and, instead of increasing the financial allocation to overcome the problem, are in fact reducing it? Whilst I agree with much of what my amiable and friendly colleague the honourable member for Kennedy has said, the fact'is that responsibility for the national road toll does not rest with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road safety; responsibility rests with each of the State governments, with each of the local governments and, most of all and particularly in this debate, right here in this chamber, with this Government. Whilst it is all very well to generalise about it, to agonise about it, to express concern at the number of Australians being slaughtered on our roads each day, each week, that cannot be an excuse for government to bow out of doing something about it. The Committee does perform a valuable task within the range of its responsibilities to this Parliament. It does perform a valuable task in making available information. The honourable member made some mention of Volvo drivers and Volvo cars being the safest. I remember one of my colleagues referring to this honourable member as a disaster on wheels in a Volvo. But one problem that is often put to me is that there is such a campaign about safety and promotion of the safety aspects of Volvos that often the people driving those vehicles are the worse drivers because they think they are impervious to harm; they think that because they are in a Volvo nothing can happen to them. Maybe that is what happened to the honourable member in his escapades earlier.",51
120,Mr SHIPTON ,AUSTRALIAN ROAD TOLL,Are you attacking Volvos?,51
121,Mr MORRIS,AUSTRALIAN ROAD TOLL,"I am just stating facts, my friend, if you can understand them.",51
122,Mr SHIPTON ,AUSTRALIAN ROAD TOLL,Are you attacking Volvos?,51
123,Mr MORRIS,AUSTRALIAN ROAD TOLL,"I am speaking out in support of the people whom I do not want to see maimed or killed on the roads. If the honourable member is in favour of that, he should stand up and say so. The Committee, whilst performing a valuable role, does not carry these responsibilities. The honourable member for Kennedy said that most accidents occur on major highways. Statistically that may be correct. Many would question, and I certainly do not accept, his argument that road conditions are not a principal factor in the incidence of road casualties and road craslies. Cerof tainly, crowded road conditions and increased use of heavy, higher speed road vehicles competing with lightweight, small passenger cars for available road space are a principal cause of the disasters and the casualties that we see. Certainly, in respect of heavy motor vehicles, they are a cause of the very high fatality rate amongst passengers in motor cars. In heavy road vehicles generally the drivers and passengers have little chance of being injured, but heaven help the passengers and drivers of lightly built passenger vehicles which collide with a gigantic vehicle of some 50 to 55 tonnes gross weight while travelling at 100 kilometres an hour. What can we do about this problem? There is a need for greater national action on the problem of the dreadful road toll throughout Australia, not just an awareness. Awareness by itself, as I have said, is of little use. Awareness must generate action. The honourable member for Kennedy is a former Minister of a conservative government. He is a senior member of the National Country Party in Queensland, the State that is more concerned about civil liberties than it is about the dangers created by drunk drivers on the roads in Queensland. The honourable member is the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety. Sure, we on the Opposition side agree with much of what he said on this subject. There could be a bipartisan approach. But what has he done about it? What has his Government done about it? He has made little impact-Mr KatterYou surprise me. I thought that if there were one question on which you would be bipartisan it would be this one. You ought to be ashamed of yourself.",51
124,Mr MORRIS,AUSTRALIAN ROAD TOLL,That is not a defence. If you raise this issue in a political arena it is a political issue. Mr KatterYou ought to be ashamed of yourself.,52
125,Mr MORRIS,AUSTRALIAN ROAD TOLL,"It is a political issue. You are a member of a government that has slashed road funds in this country by 17 per cent in real terms in the past five years. You and those who sit around you are members of a government which slashed funds for road safety promotion and research and the promotion of road safety practices last year by 28 per cent in real terms. It is adopting a bipartisan approach to recognise the problems of the road toll. It is not adopting a bipartisan approach, I put it to you, to allocate those kinds of priorities to the improvement of road safety. Mr ShiptOD-You are attacking the committee system.",52
126,Mr MORRIS,AUSTRALIAN ROAD TOLL,"I am attacking your Government, my friend.",52
127,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,AUSTRALIAN ROAD TOLL,Mr Millar)Order! The honourable member for Shortland will address the House through the Chair and will ignore interjections. Honourable members on my right will remain silent.,52
128,Mr MORRIS,AUSTRALIAN ROAD TOLL,"Since 1975 successive Fraser governments have exhibited a callous indifference to the national road toll. I ask honourable members to look at just two of its first decisions. Its first decision was to abolish the bureau of roads, the expert body set up to establish by public consultation what were road needs. The Government abolished it straight off. Its next action was to abolish the independent Roads Safety and Standards Authority. Is that the action of a government concerned about road safety? Certainly not. Then in 1980 it abolished the highly successful - all States supported it-program established by the Labor Government, the Minor Improvements for Traffic Engineering and Road Safety Program. That involved a mere $17m. That program had been highly cost effective and successful, yet it was abolished by this Government. In the years 1975-76 to 1980-81 road funding was slashed by 17 per cent in real terms. If we look at real funding for road safety promotion and research and promotion of road safety practices we see that that has been slashed by 28 per cent since last year. Let us come to the last item, random breath testing. The honourable member for Kennedy and those on the other side well know my strong support for random breath testing. But in the one area where this Government could have acted, it has not. Six months ago a committee of the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly recommended-it was supported by the Assembly-the introduction of random breath testing in the Territory. What action has come from the Government? None. So there is a quick resume of what this Government's attitude to road safety has been. It is not enough for those opposite to complain. I raise this issue in this way because if the Government is concerned about road safety and it wants to make roads safer to travel on, and if it wants to reduce the national road toll, it needs to spend money and to give leadership and encouragement. All of those things it has not done. As I said, the honourable member for Kennedy has expressed genuine support for the introduction of random breath testing, but he has had little impact. Abundant evidence is available-without my going through it in this limited time left to me-to show that the introduction of random breath testing would have a significant effect in reducing the level of road fatalities and casualties. It has also been proven beyond doubt that the ingestion of alcohol prior to driving significantly impairs driving ability. On evidence put before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety it has been shown that the ingestion of a given amount of alcohol by a 17-year-old affects that person some seven times more than it does a seasoned drinker of 30 years of age. Members in a society where the young are encouraged to drink and made to feel that they are something less than masculine if they do not drink and that they do not attain adulthood without drinking, ought to be aware of the impairment that occurs in young people who drink alcohol before they drive. Research has shown that in 80 per cent of fatal single-vehicle road crashes involving drivers under 25 years of age, alcohol is the major contributing factor. Since this House commenced proceedings this morning, on average, one person will have died on the roads somewhere in Australia as a result of the ingestion of alcohol. On average, every two and a half hours somewhere in this country somebody dies on our roads. Alcohol is the major contributing factor in half of those deaths. If we look at single vehicle road crash fatalities involving drivers under 25 years of age, we see that in 80 per cent-four out of five-alcohol is the principal contributing factor. The value derived from random breath testing is not in the number of people who are caught but in raising people's expectations of being detected. We have to try to encourage a change in social attitudes in the community. There is change occurring. I think the polls' support for random breath testing is an indication of the change. But we have to encourage a change so that those people who do drink and who want to enjoy themselves do not do it in association with the operation of a motor vehicle. That is one of the great values I see of random breath testing, raising the expectation of being detected. We heard about civil liberties. Let me draw a comparison for the Parliament. If a person under the influence of alcohol staggers out of his local club in New South Wales, hops into his car and drives home, nobody says a word. I rarely hear of cases of a member of the public drawing attention to somebody who is drunk in control of a motor vehicle or trying to gain control of a motor vehicle. The next day when he gets to work that person is a hero. His friends ask: 'How did you get home?' He replies: 'I made it, mate'. He is regarded as a hero. Let us take that same man and consider him wandering out of that same club, at the same time and in the same state, with a pistol in his hand. Everybody will run for the police and there will be general panic and alarm that damage is about to be done and he will be apprehended. The man with the pistol in his hand out in the street and under the influence of alcohol is far less dangerous than the drunk in his Volvo driving down the busy Pacific Highway. I prefer to ignore civil liberties in this question and say that the danger of the drunk in charge of the motor vehicle is much greater than the drunk in charge of the pistol who has to find somebody to injure. Research has also shown that unless there are very strong campaigns in respect of random breath testing and unless there is great awareness of the testing being carried out, public perception of and reaction to it is little. Evidence of the effect of random breath testing is shown in Victorian results. If we take as a base the number of deaths on the roads in Victoria in 1976-the year in which random breath testing was introduced in Victoria-and multiply it by five for the five years that followed, we find that the actual number of deaths was 593 less than it would have been had the 1976 death rate been repeated. On a comparable basis the New South Wales death rate was 199 more for the same period. Overall, between the two States, there is a difference of almost 792 human lives. The honourable member for Kennedy talked about random breath testing. The Minister for Transport ( Mr Hunt) ought to be taking the lead in this. Four years ago his predecessor referred the matter to the Australian Transport Advisory Council. This Minister did the same thing. Mr Katter-He made an announcement on it.",52
129,Mr MORRIS,AUSTRALIAN ROAD TOLL,"He made an announcement. Honourable members will find that it is a recycling of the Press statement of the former Minister for Transport on 24 August 1978. It is not good enough. How can we make road conditions safer? What has happened to real road funding? In Queensland there was a cut of 19 per cent in five years. That State was robbed of $95m in road funds. In South Australia the cut was 28 per cent-robbed of $77m. In Victoria the cut was 21 per cent-robbed of $112m. The cut in New South Wales was 15 per cent, which is a reduction or loss of $92m. In conclusion, sure, one has to support and share the concern of the honourable member for Kennedy about the need to create a national awareness of the problem of the dreadful Australian road toll. That would be quite a meaningless exercise unless that increased level of awareness were accompanied by an increase in funds for road construction, road maintenance, road safety and the promotion of road safety practices by the States.",53

Aboriginal Land Rights To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the projected repeal by the Queensland State Government of the Aborigines Act 1971-79 and the Torres Strait Islander Act 1971-1979 will almost certainly lead to the degazettal of all Aboriginal reserves in Queensland, as has already been the case with Aurukun and Mornington Island. That if, as is likely, the Aboriginal communities from these reserves are placed lation on fifty years leases they will be exposed to serious encroachment on their land by mining and tourist interests. That it is also quite clear, on past evidence, that these interests will have the full backing of the Queensland Government and the rights of Aboriginal people to land rights and self-management will not be granted by that Government. That the Commonwealth Government has the power to legislate and acquire land for Aboriginal people under its constitutional powers since the amendments to the Constitution in 1967, but it is your Petitioners' sincere belief that it failed to act in 1976 and thus, failed in its duty before the people of Aurukun and Mornington Island. That the Aboriginal people of Queensland have stated that they want land rights and self-management. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government make use of its constitutional and legislative powers to grant full land rights and self-management to the Aboriginal people of Queensland. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Cross and Mr Dobie. Petitions received. Slaughter of Seal Pups To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the present hunt for Harp seals in Canada is carried out in a cruel and inhuman manner. That the population of Harp seals has not been clearly shown to be increasing. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Government formally call on the Canadian Government to end the Harp seal hunt and use its constitutional powers to halt the importation into Australia of products derived from the Harp seal, Pagophilus groenlandicus. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mrs Darling. Petition received. Slaughter of Seal Pups To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.

Family Planning Association of Victoria under similar shire council legisTo the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled should take action as it deems appropriate to ensure the continuing effectiveness of the Family Planning Association of Victoria. In particular that: Federal government continue to provide funding to the Family Planning Association of Victoria for clinical services to meet the growing demands of the community. Increased funding be provided to the Family Planning Association of Victoria's Training, Education & Research Unit for educational services to the community.

132,Mr THOMSON ,PROGRAMS,"Leichhardt-Minister for Science and Technology)-I have pleasure in tabling the report of the Committee to Review Productivity and Innovation Programs. I seek leave to make a statement concerning the report. Leave granted. Mr THOMSONAs a consequence of the Review of Commonwealth Functions in April 1981, the Government decided that a range of productivity and innovation programs, conducted by the Department of Science and Technology, should be reviewed by independent representatives from the private sector. Further, of the Technology Transfer Council was to be retained until 1982 and continuing Commom-· wealth involvement evaluated. In July 1981, I announced the formation of the committee to undertake these reviews. It was chaired by Mr Raymond Kirby, Managing Director, James N. Kirby Holdings. The other members were Mr Robert Robson, Managing Director, BMI Ltd; and Dr Michael Searby, then Managing Director, H. C. Sleigh, Ltd. In framing its report, the Committee consulted with a wide range of people and sought comments from some 350 organisations. The Committee also sought submissions through advertisements in national Press, receiving more than 190 submissions. The report was submitted to me in December 1981. The Government has considered the Committee's report and is satisfied that its recommenformation dations provide a sound and logical basis for Government involvement in industry to help overcome specific problems. I am therefore pleased to announce that the Government has accepted the Committee's recommendations. Decisions on funding will be taken in the budget context and I will take up with the Treasurer ( Mr Howard) the recommendation of tax deductibility for contributions to the Inventors Association. In its review the Committee developed specific criteria to guide Government as to when intervention might be appropriate. In summary, it concluded that intervention by the Government in the affairs of industry can be justified only in cases where the public benefit clearly exceeds the cost and where market forces would not, by themselves, achieve a socially and economically desirable result. The Committee also recommended guidelines for the development of programs where government involvement was judged to be appropriate. The Government has accepted these criteria and guidelines. Finally, the Committee evaluated each of my Department's existing programs against both the criteria for appropriateness of government intervention and the guidelines for program implementation. In all, thirteen programs were reviewed. The Committee has taken note of the Government's policy of less involvement in industry and has recommended termination of five programs which had achieved their purpose and could be phased out or transferred to industry. The Committee also endorsed the Department's role as a catalyst which provides the encouragement and assistance necessary for industry to develop its own programs of self-help. This approach permits Government support to be discontinued or scaled the funding down at an appropriate time. The Committee made strong recommendations for continued government support for the Technology Transfer Council, especially the Council's work in transferring the results of government funded research into industry. I have been most impressed by the work of the Technology Transfer Council and look forward to a further period of productive co-operation. The Government has accepted the Committee's recommendations that it should continue programs which encourage inventions and innovations. Support for the Assistance to Inventors Scheme will continue and discussions will be initiated with State governments on the establishment of innovation centres, designed to assist in the commercial development of new inventions. Other programs supported by the Committee were InTechnology Week and a revised manufacturing technology program to accelerate further the adoption of new technology. I have no doubt that implementation of the Committee's recommendations will make a positive contribution to the efficiency and competitiveness of Australian manufacturing industry. I would like particularly to compliment the Committee on its task and the production of a first class report. It is a model of clarity, despite the fact that it had a very tight timetable. It may be the only report of its type where the Government has accepted all the recommendations. I commend the report to the House. I present the following paper: Report by the Committee to Review Productivity and Innovation ProgramsMinisterial Statement, 29 April 1982. Motion (by Mr Killen) proposed: That the House take note of the papers.",56
133,Mr BARRY JONES ,PROGRAMS,"Lalor) (3.7)-The report of the Committee to Review Productivity and Innovation Programs is an attempt by the Minister for Science and Technology ( Mr Thomson) to salvage something out of the carnage left when the razor gang had finished carving up the surviving elements of the old Department of Productivity within the Department of Science and Technology. Of the 18 bodies marked for extinction in the razor gang report, 11 were in the area of science and technology. The Minister then set up a committee of three businessmen in an attempt to make the best out of a disastrous situation. The Government has accepted all of the Committee's recommendations-hardly surprising because the composition of the Committee reflects the thinking of the Government very faithfully. The brief to the Committee was absurdly narrow-I hasten to say I do not blame the Minister for that-and that made it impossible to produce a report which attempted to tackle the massive problems facing Australian industry, and high technology industry in particular. The members of the Committee are certainly able, conscientious and hard working but their production reflects an extraordinary narrowness of vision which is unfortunately characteristic of much, but not all of Australian's business leadership. The economic views expressed by the Kirby Committee are somewhat to the right of Treasury and fractionally to the left of Genghis Khan. Because of the narrow terms of reference, the Committee has made no attempt to examine Australian industry in a global context. There are seven outstanding omissions from the report. The first is the question of foreign ownership of high technology industry in Australia. In a document of 192 pages there is literally not one sentence on this subject, and yet it is the central problem. Attempting to analyse the state of industry in Australia without describing the extent of foreign control would be like trying to describe sex without talking about men and women. As I have said repeatedly in this House, so many of our high technology industries are either completely in, or overwhelmingly controlled by, foreign hands. I instance motor manufacturing, electronics, drugs, chemicals, plastics and many more. The Kirby Committee refers somewhere to 'the Australian chemical industry'-a strange misnomer. It would have been more accurate to refer to 'a chemical industry located in Australia', as it is not Australian in any real sense. Secondly, I refer to the role of the multinational corporations in Australia. Again, this is never mentioned in the report. Some multinationals have larger incomes than the gross domestic products of some countries. The decisions Ford, General Motors, ICI, Hoechst, IBM and Esso make about their operations in Australia are made at head office overseas, not here. My third point concerns Australia's technological dependence. In paragraph 6.5 of the Kirby reportthe following candid concession is made: Much of Australia's manufacturing technology originates other advanced industrial nations. That is the beginning and the end of the discussion. It is something of an understatement. A mere 94 per cent of royalty payments on technologies used in Australia go overseas! In very few countries in the technologically advanced world would we find such a significant imbalance-94 per cent to 6. My fourth point relates to the impact of the global economy. Although entering an expanding global economy might provide great opportunities for Australia, it also poses threats to some sectors of our economy, especially manufacturing. The global economy downgrades the significance of national and regional economies. That is totally ignored in the report. My fifth point relates to the fact that we have in Australia a poorly informed managerial class. This is referred to only casually in the report, which notes the failure of the Confederation of Australian Industry to support the major thrust on quality development by establishing an Australian 'Quality Label'. That is incredible in itself. Also, in paragraph 6.8, the comment is made that many firms are 'simply not aware of the development of technologies appropriate to their needs' which have been evolving in the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the universities. What are they doing with their heads; where are they? When will they pull them out of the sand? When are we to find thinkers in our managerial class? As recently as August 1981 I attended, in company with the honourable member for Adelaide ( Mr Hurford) a meeting with CAl leaders, held in Canberra. I raised with them the subject of biotechnology, which, as the Minister agrees, seems likely to be the single industry in Australia with the greatest potential for expansion in the I 980s. This was only eight months ago but I was greeted by the unanimous response: 'What is it? We have never heard of it'. Australia does not score well in areas of innovative thinking and entrepreneurship, and if we lack them in industry we are really in the cart. My sixth point concerns Australia's declining information base. Australia is in an unprecedented era of technological change, a postindustrial era marked by a decline in employment in traditional manufacturing areas and a shift towards information-based activity. Under this Government, Australia simply lacks the appropriate social and economic infrastructures to effect a relatively painless transition. As Mr Justice Michael Kirby pointed out in a recent paper on education, according to Organisation for Econin omic Co-operation and Development education tables Australia can no longer compare itself with the United States and Japan, rather with Portugal and Turkey. At the age of 17, 88.1 per cent of Japanese are still at school, compared with only 31.7 per cent of Australians. More than 50 per cent of Honda's process workers have university degrees. We are still dependent on data bases that are controlled elsewhere. The Fraser Government is winding down Australia's research and development. In absolute terms, the level of spending remains where it was, but if we take into account inflation and the relative increases in funding in other countries, the fact that Australia is standing still while other countries are rushing ahead is astrous to Australia. This is strictly 'The Running Jumping and Standing Still Show' in research and development. Our participation rates in higher education and the number of patents taken out in Australia per annum or per capita are discouragingly low. According to all of the standard indicators, we are not doing well. My seventh point relates to the fact that in the report no attempt is made to compare the Australian situation with that of similar countries abroad. I can find no reference-not even a sentence-that compares Australia's situation with that of, say, Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, Norway and the Netherlands. I would interpolate that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, may have been interested to read in the Economist the other day that Finland is about to adopt the first completely digital telephone system. The country that has won the race to provide that service is not, as one might imagine, the United States, but Sweden. Datasaab, which is a component of the Saab automotive manufacturing organisation, and a firm that has not had a long experience of main frame computers, has won the contract. The chances are that when Australia's telephone system goes digital it will adopt the Swedish model because the Swedes are experts in that area.",57
134,Dr KLUGMAN ,PROGRAMS,They are left-handed.,59
135,Mr BARRY JONES,PROGRAMS,"That may have something to do with it. Sweden has a population of eight million but has beaten the United States and Bell Laboratories, with the enormous resources that they have behind them, in this very important and highly competitive area. Even worse than the seven major omissions in the report are the major fallacies that dominated the thinking of the Kirby Committee. The first is its devotion to Friedman's concept of the market. In paragraph 7.29 the Committee expresses its quasi-theological devotion to the market in these terms: The Committee believes in the wisdom of market forces . . . There is no better determinant of the value of a project than market forces. In paragraph 1.3 it states: . . . profit is the best motivator of industry. This credo is invoked on many pages of the report, but its authors never clarify what market or markets they are referring to. What market do they mean-an Australian market, a State-wide market, a regional market, a South East Asian market or a global market? They never say. They treat the market as an abstraction and rarely deal with disreal situations, because when we begin to particularise we see the full extent of the problem. If we ask, 'How can we get Ford Australia to compete with Ford USA?', we have only to state the question to recognise its absurdity. How can IBM Australia compete with IBM in the United States? Honourable members know the - hort answer to that question. How can Hoechst Australia compete with Hoechst Germany? One has also to ask the question: To what extent would an international corporation have one unit really compete in any meaningful way, as if it were simply part of a national economy, with another component of the industry which was located in another national economy? Once we ask those questions we can see both the nature of the problem and the great difficulties involved in overcoming it. The problem is that if the global market operates in areas such as those of which I have been speaking it seems that it must inevitably operate against us. The Committee does not address that problem. We should also ask: When does the market determine the value of a product? When does it bring in its verdict? The timing is absolutely critical. As I have told the House previously, when Francis Crick and James Watson were working on the structure of DNA they had no idea that their discovery would have enormous economic significance. They made their great discovery in 1953 and won their Nobel prize in 1962. Crick told me that it was not until 1966 that it even crossed their minds that it could remotely have any economic significance. When would the market have formed its judgment? What judgment could the market have passed in the early years of their work? Can markets pass judgment expost facto? If we have to invest in the future, as we must, we will have to take some intuitive leaps. I must say that in a number of areas I would rather rely on my own judgment than on the market in picking winners in the area of science and technology. The market often seems to validate a judgment too late, after the development stage. One has to go through an agonising period of development. The second fallacy is that a naive view is taken of the impact of technology on employment. The Kirby report adopts the view adopted by the illfated report of the Myers Committee of Inquiry into Technical Change in Australia, a fourvolume production which sank like a stone and was obsolete before copies were printed. Even now one speaks of it only with a hushed voice. Historically, the medium and long term effect of technological change-as neither the Kirby or Myers reports seem to have recognised-MONICA",59
136,Dr KLUGMAN ,PROGRAMS,Can you recommend any good books?,60
137,Mr BARRY JONES,PROGRAMS,"Yes, an excellent one has just been published on this subject. The medium and long term effect oftechnological change is to effect a transfer of work away from the areas technologically affected towards forms of work, often lower paid, which are complementary to the areas that have been technologically affected. The Fraser Government is still floundering in the area of high technology. It does not know what to do because it does not know where it is going, and the market is not telling it. We face a disastrous decline in our high technology industries compared with what is happening in other countries. I cannot help raising again the issue of France. President Mitterrand's Government has decided that France's future lies in the development of its high technology industries. The result is that it is already expending twice as much as we are on research and development. Even more important its own industry is contributing. As the Minister knows better than anybody else, industry in Australia is taking a free ride on the back of the Government. It is extraordinary when one hears all the talk that we have had about monetarism. It is often said that 'there is such thing as a free lunch' but industry in Australia takes the view that there is such a thing as free research and development. It does not mind grabbing whatever there is and does not do much in terms of development. In Sweden, for every Kroner spent by the Government on research and development industry contributes 7 Kroner. In Australia, for every dollar spent by the Government industry contributes 63 cents. I think that the Government's response in this whole area is totally inadequate. The few timid, tepid recommendations, which we do not particularly disagree with, in the Kirby report far enough. In Australia we have never had a ful! commitment to monetarism. Instead we have endured a particularly unattractive hybrid of Stone Age monetarism and Easter Island mercantilism as advocated by the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser). The Kirby report seeks merely to rearrange the deck.chairs on the Titanic. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Ministerial Statement",60
138,Mr KILLEN ,DEFENCE,"Moreton-Minister for Defence)-by leave-I wish to inform the Parliament of certain developments affecting Australia's strategic circumstances in the world setting and of changes in the defence program necessitated by the nation's financial circumstance. In October last year when I spoke on defence in this place I said: Our circumstances and our responsibilities have changed greatly in the course of the past 10 years. We have a clear commitment to fend for ourselves and to contribute to stability in our own region. I find myself in complete agreement with that philosophical view which contends that men and women who have a preference for the estate of liberty must carry with grace the burden of protecting it. In March 1980, in another statement in this House, I said: There is scope now for crises deeper and more frequent than we have hitherto experienced . . . There will be few now who can confidently assert that wherever favourable opportunities may occur for manipulation, subversion and interference, including the Asian and Pacific regions, the Soviet Union will not exploit them. Uncertainty and instability everywhere are stimulated by this. It is therefore appropriate to ask ourselves today: Is the world a safer and more secure place than it was then? Has the world been swept to a state of serenity in the interim? Are the risks to world peace higher now than they were seven months ago or two years ago? Civilised mankind must ask those questions and ask them with all can dour. In the search for an answer mankind must be equally candid. This no nation's perception of its role in this troubled world is clear. We cannot and must not assume the role of the unconcerned, uncommitted and disinterested spectator. We are by world standards admittedly a middle power. It should not be overlooked, however, that we can contribute to the peace and security of the world and we can do this in a variety of ways. By ensuring there is stability in our region we make a very worthwhile contribution to the struggle in the emancipation of men from the belief that differences can be settled only by conflict. The reality is that today we look out upon a world of increasing unrest, diswill not go turbance and conflict. For more than a decade the Soviet Union's spending on strategic nuclear armaments has been three times that of the United States of America. The arithmetic of melancholy goes on. Soviet spending on conventional weapons in the same period has been about double that of the United States. The armed forces of the Soviet Union outnumber those of the United States more than two toone. In many categories of weapons the Soviet Union produces and deploys more than the United States. By way of example, more than 300 Soviet SS18 missiles are now deployed, most with 10 warheads. This missile has been designed to eliminate the retaliatory capability of the United States missiles housed in their underground shelters. About 300 SS20 missiles are now operational and deployment of new launchers apparently continues east of the Urals. This missile, with a range of more than 4,500 kilometres, can strike at targets in Europe from sites deep within the Soviet Union. They represent only the tip of the Soviet's awesome arsenal. Can any person who comes into this Parliament with but a vague interest in the survival of the species remain unmoved by the evidence of this potential for mankind to lurch or stumble down the nuclear path to misery and the ultimate holocaust? These are not issues to be dismissed lightly. We cannot hide from reality or from this potential horror under the shield of narrow self-interest and say: 'Oh, this is no concern of ours'. It must remain civilised mankind's prime concern. While this goes on within the Soviet Union, there is undisputed evidence that that nation is using its increasing military reach to support its political influence. It has been or is in the process of acquiring strategic lodgments in Cuba, the Middle East, Africa and Indo-China. It actively probes for opportunities in the Indian Ocean. Soviet footholds in Afghanistan, Ethiopia and the Yemen pose potential threats to the interests of other nations-not the least to the free and secure flow of their oil supplies. The Soviet Union's commitment to world domination remains utterly undiminished. In the face of this Soviet effort the United States has taken a series of measures to maintain strategic equilibrium. It is the United States, and the United States alone, which has the capacity to act as a countervailing influence to the awesome power of the Soviet Union. President Reagan has also launched initiatives for negotiations for arms reduction. It must surely be the hope of all mankind that the two super-powers will be able to address these critical issues in a realistic and constructive way. All the while the Soviet Union remains in occupation of Afghanistan, a non-aligned neighbouring Third World country. The continuing occupation of that country and the brutal repression of its people represent a massive assault on the norms of international behaviour. Today there are 100,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan. There is no evidence to suggest that the Soviet Union will withdraw and restore to the Afghan people their independence. Every person in this House should ask the question: Why are they there? On the contrary, there is every sign that the Soviet Union will persist in its occupation and that other nations must reckon in the future with this advanced base for Soviet interference in neighbouring countries. Within the primary area of strategic interest to Australia-that is, the regions of South East Asia and the South West Pacific-the Government notes the continuing occupation of Kampuchea by 200,000 Vietnamese troops. It notes too the Soviet Union's support for that occupation and the Soviet Union's access to military facilities in Vietnam. The members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence have made a very useful contribution to discussion of these matters in its report entitled 'Threats to Australia's security-their nature and probability'. I congratulate the Committee on the diligence and depth of its examination and on the general content of its conclusions. In due course I will present to the Parliament a detailed response to the Committee's report. May I say at this point that in general terms I support the Committee's critical assessment that 'Overall the Committee's conclusions as to the nature and probability of threats to Australia's security are cautiously reassuring'. Drawing back from the global scheme, common strategic concerns are the subject of bilateral discussions from time to time between Australia and the Association of South East Asian Nation states. We seek to participate in regional discussion on these issues and to improve our understanding of the defence concerns of our neighbours. To this end, senior Service officers and officers of my Department visit the ASEAN countries regularly and in turn are visited by their counterparts for professional exchanges. Recently the former Chief of Defence Force Staff held discussions in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia. I visited Malaysia and Singapore in 1981 for defence discussions. This year I have been pleased to receive in Australia Abang Abu Bakar, Deputy Minister for Defence of Malaysia, and Mr Howe Yoon Chong, Minister of Defence of Singapore, for similar talks. I am delighted that this week the Philippines Minister of National Defense, Mr Juan Ponce Enrile, is visiting Australia. The Government has encouraged partners in the five power defence arrangements to hold combined multinational ground force exercises. In 1981, a successful exercise of this type was held Australia with troops from Malaysia, Singapore, Britain, New Zealand and Australia. This year another was held in New Zealand. This type of exercise, and five power maritime and air defence exercises, will continue to be held in the region. Outside of the five power arrangements the Government has encouraged bilateral exercising with several of our regional friends. We have also welcomed to Australia detachments of the Republic of Singapore Army and Air Force for training. By providing the use of our training facilities, we seek to build on relationships derived from other forms of co-operative training and professional exchanges with our regional friends. I have already announced that in mid-1983 it will be necessary to redeploy one RAAF Mirage squadron from Butterworth to Darwin in order to prepare for the forthcoming re-equipment of the tactical fighter force with new fighters. This decision was taken on grounds of operational necessity. This reflects no change in our priorities and diminution of Australian interest in security issues of concern to regional countries. By agreement with the Malaysian Government, Australia will retain the operating detachment of P3 long range maritime patrol aircraft at Butterworth. The future of that detachment will not depend on decisions about the future of the second Mirage squadron at Butterworth. Australia proposes to continue to deploy aircraft to Malaysia and Singapore to take part in air defence exercises. This would include temporary deployments of the new tactical fighters after their entry into service. While on the subject of combined and joint exercising, I would like to make particular reference to exercise Kangaroo 81, which many members of this Parliament were able to observe at first hand. The aim of Kangaroo 81 was to exercise participants in combined and joint operations in a conventional, mid-intensity conflict in a 'defence of Australia' setting. This aim was achieved. Perhaps the single most important lesson to emerge from the exercise was related to command and control arrangements. The practicality of the direct method of command from the Chief of Defence Force Staff to joint force commanders in the field was tested. Although limited by the requirements of peace time planning, it provided useful lessons for the future. The continual exchanges and exercises which occur between Australian forces and those of the United States and New Zealand have been most effective in raising the level of operational compatibility with our allies. A major dimension of our defence relationships with countries in our own area are our defence co-operation programs with our regional in friends. The Government expects to spend $42m this financial year on defence co-operation in South East Asia and the south-west Pacific. The program has steadily expanded over the past few years and now embraces formal programs with II neighbouring countries. In particular, the number of servicemen brought to Australia from ASEAN and south-west Pacific countries for individual trainij1g in the various professional and technical military skills has continued to expand steadily. The range of co-operative activities involves projects such as survey and mapping activities, an armed forces manufacturing workshop, aircraft maintenance and support assistance, the establishment of a defence research centre, and specialist training. I turn now to financial considerations and to the defence program itself. The Government has recently found it necessary to contain the growth in post-Budget 1981-82 public expenditures. Along with other areas of government, defence no has had to find offsets for price and wage increases. The increase in Service pay announced late last year will cost $171m in this financial year. There has also been an increase in Public Service pay as well as price rises in other areas. The effect in this year has been to divert investment expenditures provided for in the Budget away from real growth towards meeting higher wages and other costs. There will be flow-on effects in later years of the defence program. Consequently some planned objectives for the development of the Defence Force will not be achieved as early as originally intended. Other objectives have, however, been brought forward. I emphasise that while none are to be abandoned, their achievement in the intended time frame will require high levels of defence expenditure to be sustained. The major acquisitions brought forward are the purchases of a carrier to replace HMAS Melbourne and 10 new P3C Orion aircraft. The acquisition of HMS Invincible, which will be recommissioned into the Royal Australian Navy as HMAS Australia, has met with doubts and criticism in some quarters. The Government carefully considered all views and decided that on balance it should proceed with the acquisition of Invincible, which was on offer from the British Government on very favourable terms. With Invincible, Australia is buying a ship essentially for its contribution to anti-submarine warfare, although it will also provide facilities for command and control of larger task groups and for transport of troops. It is not being bought for its capacity to operate short take-off and landing aircraft. The ship will be used as a helicopter carrier and there should not be any expectation in present circumstances that we will be going beyond that. Together with the Orion P3C fleet of 20 long range maritime patrol aircraft, the Invincible and its helicopters will give this country a very strong capability for anti-submarine warfare, at a total investment cost of about $1, 100m. The Government considers that an island continent and trading nation such as Australia must have this capability and that protection of shipping from sub.marine attack must command a very high priority in Australia's defence investments. The current commitments and the future of the Royal Australian Navy's existing fixed-wing aircraft are being examined by a defence working party as a consequence of a Government decision that these aircraft are to be paid off as soon as practicable to provide early savings in expenditure. It is expected that there will also be consequent manpower savings. Earlier I advised the House that we would acquire 10 new P3C Orion aircraft to replace the existing squadron of P3B aircraft. Following the United States Navy's decision to curtail its rate of acquisition of P3C aircraft, the cost of the project is expected to rise to about $280m at August 1981 prices, subject to satisfactory contractual negotiations. Furthermore, in order to sustain an economic production rate Australia will have to take delivery of its aircraft much earlier than planned. Deliveries will have to begin in November 1984 and be completed by March 1986. This requires much greater expenditure in the early program years than was initially planned. In view of the importance the Government attaches to this project, we have advised the United States of our decision to proceed with the order for \0 P3C aircraft, subject to the negotiation of satisfactory contractual terms and conditions for the purchase of the new aircraft and the sale of the B models. Significant relief from Budget pressures in 1981-82 has been provided by reductions in planned payments on purchases under United States Department of Defense foreign military sales arrangements. This has been made possible following a review with United States authorities of the schedules of payments under current foreign military sales orders and the cash flow requirements from those orders. Relief is also anticipated in the early years of the new five-year defence program 1982-87. Its full extent is still being assessed, but it will certainly help in accommodating expenditures on Invincible and the Orions without major dislocation of the defence program. Though some rescheduling is unavoidable, for the reasons outlined, this action should be measured against a background of other recent decisions involving substantial expenditures to augment the defence inventory of the nation. In this financial year alone, - ustralia will have entered into firm commitments for the purchase of new defence capital equipment worth more than $3,000m. By any measure, that is a great deal of money. It is more than two-thirds of Australia's total spending on defence in 1981-82. The Government is acutely aware, however, that the sum in itself signifies very little. The important thing is the extent of defence capability represented by that money. It is, unfortunately, not as much as we would like. This is not a problem unique to Australia. It is common to every country which needs to have its defence forces keep pace with the rate of technological advance. Even the much advocated trading of quality for quantity, whatever its intrinsic merits or demerits, has little effect on the total costs involved. I have referred earlier to the burden which must be borne by the taxpayers of this nation. Some representative costs of defence activity are total worth noting. The FA 18, which will constitute the new tactical fighter force, is about twice the price of the F4 Phantom, an aircraft it is intended to replace and one which will still be in United States service for many years. This same pattern of cost growth generally applies to ships, helicopters, armoured vehicles and missiles. The complexity of modern equipments increases operating costs. The Fill, the backbone of our strike force, is almost twice as costly to operate as the Phantoms, which were operated for a period while awaiting the F Ill. Complexity also increases manpower costs. Highly qualified and skilled personnel are needed to repair and maintain new equipments. These skills in themselves are expensive. The Royal Australian Navy's diesel-electric submarines must be refitted after every five years of running. The cost is $33m, including $1.3m for replacement of the batteries.· After 600 hours of operation the Atar engine in a Mirage requires overhaul. The cost is $182,000 exclusive of spare parts. The cost of defence manpower has risen rapidly. In 1978-79 the average annual salary of a military officer was $17,200. Today it is $28,OOO-an increase of 63 per cent. The average salary for a sailor, a soldier or an airman is now $18,800 per annum compared with $10,800 in 1978-79-an increase of 74 per cent. In addition, allowances payable to servicemen now total $140m per year compared with $83m in 1978-79-an increase of nearly 70 per cent. In the same period defence civilian staff salaries have risen by an average of $4,200 from $10,800 to $15,000-an increase of 39 per cent. Other civilian payments for overtime, penalty rates et cetera now cost $22m compared wih $16m in 1978-79. Operational and training costs are substantial. The Services must regularly practice fire their weapons, both to ensure their operational readiness and to give operators experience of a kind which cannot be gained by practice drill and simulation. Every live round fired by a Leopard tank costs up to $670. Many rounds have to be fired in practice each year. Such expenditure is inescapable. Enormous outlays are required for the development of facilities to support operational capabilities. The modernisation of Garden Island Dockyard in Sydney will eventually cost about $200m. The alternative of relocating the fleet base and dockyard, even if practicable, would have cost in the vicinity of $1,OOOm. The introduction of the FA 18 fighter aircraft will require new support facilities and housing at William town and Darwin totalling well in excess of $100m. The $3,000m which I quoted earlier will be paying for the new tactical fighter, trucks for the Army, air to air missiles for the Mirage fighter aircraft, the new aircraft carrier and many smaller projects. To those who believe that at a project cost of $478m the Invincible was an expensive purchase, I would like to point out that $3,000m would barely cover the cost of a Nimitz class carrier, with approximately the same amount needed to provide an air group for it. I mention this not because we have ever considered making an offer for a Nimitz class carrier, but simply to illustrate that in looking at the cost of defence equipment, it is important to have a sense of perspective. These new commitments will be funded from future defence budget allocations. In this context the Government has recently reaffirmed the importance of sustaining the momentum of the defence program and it is therefore determined to provide the levei of funding necessary to meet past commitments, ongoing activities and at the same time provide reasonable flexibility for new investment decisions. Plans for the new tactical fighter aircraft are progressing to schedule. Eight formal letters of offer and acceptance, covering major aspects of this complex and expensive project, have been signed. Work on the Australian industry participation program has already started and major Australian contractors are actively engaged in establishing production resources. Some orders for machinery and plant have already been placed by the Government. In addition, we are moving towards finalisation of the arrangements for the design and development, in Australia, of a new basic trainer aircraft for the Royal Australian Air Force. Negotiations for the purchase of a light training helicopter will commence shortly and I expect to announce the decision on this in the near future. Orders have been placed with Australian industry for over 9,600 Barra sonobuoys and for Mulloka sonars for the destroyer escorts. These Australian-designed and manufactured sonar devices are amongst the most advanced of their kind in the world and are uniquely suited to antisubmarine operations in Australian waters. Australia recently accepted a letter of offer and acceptance from the United States for the supply of equipment to modernise our three DDG guided missile destroyers. Here again, comparative costs are worth noting. In the mid-1960's, these three ships cost $115m. In constant dollars, three FFG guided missile frigates will cost us almost twice as much. To ensure that the Parliament and the people of this nation are kept informed of how the defence budget is to be spent, it is my practice to advise the House of important decisions as early as possible. I have already mentioned some changes to the defence program previously planned. I now outline other significant program changes agreed by the Government: The Government will not at this stage proceed with the acquisition of an additional five Fremantle class patrol boats and the second underway replenishment ship. The long-serving Canberra aircraft, which are currently used in the aerial photographic survey role and other RAAF support tasks, will be paid off. Until a new aircraft is acquin,d, any requirement for these capabilities will be met by other means such as chartered aircraft. Re-examination of the Defence Integrated Secure Communications NetworkDISCON-has permitted initial installation to proceed with reduced user access and hence savings are possible. The initial installation will, however, be capable of expansion. The provision for expenditure over the next five years on follow-on destroyers will be reduced. The level of annual expenditure will be given detailed consideration along with the planned reforms at the Williamstown dockyard. Automation of Army map production facilities is continuing, but a proposal for yet further enhancement of these facilities will not proceed at this stage. Planned expenditure for additional antisubmarine warfare helicopters has been deferred and program expenditure on other RAN and RAAF helicopters has been reduced. There will be a reduction in the level of refurbishment of the Mirage. Many of the lower priority facilities and infrastructure developments have been slowed down or delayed. Among the high priority projects, construction of a new airfield at Derby, Western Australia, will begin as planned but the period of construction could be extended by up to two years. There will be reductions in programmed expenditure for operating costs. This will be achieved by continuing economies already introduced in this financial year. It will mean restraint in the level of some training and the cancellation of others. Other areas affected include travel, equipment repair and general administrative expenses. Planned fuel and other stockholding levels will be reduced and service activities, including Navy's steaming time, Army's utilisation of its armoured vehicles, and Service flying hours, will be restrained. Each of the Mirage squadrons may have to specialise to some extent in either the air to air or air to ground role. This would demand less training time and weapon usage than at present, when all pilots train in both specialist roles. There will be no reduction in numbers of Mirage pilots. The alterations to the defence program will also have a significant impact on planned manpower requirements: Measures to improve manpower retention rates have been implemented, particularly in the area of Service pay and allowances. Savings in recruitment, training and other overheads follow from improved manpower retention levels. In addition to manpower savings from the early acquisition of Invincible, and savings on Sky hawk, Tracker and Canberra aircraft operations, further manpower savings will be achieved by holding Army strength for 1981-82 and 1982-83 at the June 1981 level of 32,850. Defence civilian manpower has been progressively reduced in recent years, in line with Government policies of reduced public sector staffing levels and the transfer of functions to the private sector. It is planned to maintain civilian staff numbers close to current levels and to defer indefinitely the transfer of selected functions from the Defence Science and Technology Organisation to the private sector. The changes to the defence program which I have outlined here today are, in the main, the consequence of the need to provide funds for the acquisition of the Invincible and the additional P3C Orions earlier than planned, and to absorb to a significant degree the higher costs of manpower. To have deferred these decisions on the carrier and the Orions to align with originally planned timings may well have resulted, at best, in the need for considerably higher expenditure in the future, and, at worse, in not being able to acquire the equipment at all. The alterations made to the defence program will, of necessity, bring about some disappointment and dislocation in the short term. Of prime importance, however, is the fact that the orderly programmed development of deactivities fence capabilities will continue. I should like to take this opportunity to announce further developments regarding the Williamstown Naval Dockyard. The Government has decided, on the basis of the report of the Advisory Committee on the Management and Operation of the Williamstown Naval Dockyard, that sweeping reforms should be made to present dockyard managerial arrangements, including the appointment of new senior personnel who will be given appropriate authority and responsibility in the manpower, purchasing and financial fields. I am now arranging for an industrialist with recognised management capability and a retired union official of appropriate status to be invited to serve as consultants to the Department of Defence on the implementation of these reforms. Meetings are continuing between officers of my Department, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, leading trade unions and job representatives to explain the administrative reforms and the improvement in work practices and performance which must be demonstrated if Williamstown Naval Dockyard is eventually to secure orders for follow-on destroyers. I have spoken today of the prospects for the nation's continued security. We can have some confidence that iri our immediate circumstances, developments continue to favour us. Both our geography and the political and defence relations we enjoy in our neighbouring regions support that confidence. The broader international prospect is less reassuring. I accept that the catastrophe of nuclear war exercises a powerful restraint upon the nuclear powers and is a critical factor for stability. But the tensions and conflicts are constrained, not dissolved. We cannot dismiss the facts of the Soviet Union's continued rate of military development, of its continued occupation of Afghanistan and its continued efforts to exploit other opportunities that present themselves world-wide to improve its status vis-a-vis its rival super-power, our ally the United States. We cannot disregard the fact that Soviet activity jeopardises important interests of the United States, and many other nations. These nations are bound to react. In those circumstances, we cannot underrate the potential for mismanagement and crisis. Who, a month ago, would have accepted that a British battle fleet would be moving against Argentina? We cannot calculate and foretell the interplay of our complex international life. However sound our judgment that, at one extreme, conflict between the super-powers is unlikely and, at the other, our own regional security prospects are favourable, we cannot afford not to provide against unexpected changes for the worse. Australia's defence effort must continue. We must recruit and train and equip and support our Defence Force. We must invest in our defence infrastructure, both military and civil. We must support our international friendships and cooperation. What I have stated are goals. They are national goals. They are and must remain proud national goals. Liberty is not something which can be inherited and passed on. Liberty is not a chattel to be claimed under a will. It is something to be won by effort, by example and, yes, by sacrifice. I would feel a sense of shame if I were to say to contemporary Australia that the cost of preserving our liberties and of making an effort to see peace in this world will not be high. It will be high. It will mean the carriage of a burden. It will mean a sacrifice. It does not mean that despair is our lot. On the contrary, it means that hope and determination must remain a part of our lives. I present the following paper: Defence Strategic developments and program changesMinisterial statement, 29 April 1982. Motion (by Mr N. A. Brown) proposed. That the House take note of the paper. Suspension of Standing Orders Motion (by Mr N. A. Brown)-by leaveagreed to: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Corio from ing for a period not exceeding 30 minutes.",60
139,Mr SCHOLES ,DEFENCE,"Corio) (3.57)-The statement made by the Minister for Defence ( Mr Killen) ends with a very broad sweeping reference to the cost of liberty and the cost of lack of defence preparedness. I add to that that the even greater cost is of procrastination. The Australian defence forces and Australian defence capability are currently feeling the' effects of procrastination. This statement is the second statement which has come to this House as a direct consequence of the decision to purchase the aircraft carrier Invincible from the British. It is a statement of the real cost rather than a statement of the initial dollar cost. The statement reveals the extreme price that Australian defence preparedness will have to pay following the decision to buy the Invincible. It will be a price which is difficult, if not impossible, to justify, a price which is to be paid to acquire a doubtful capability for the Australian defence forces and a price whose enormity will become apparent if ever the Australian defence forces are called upon to defend this country. It will be a price that is dear indeed. The Minister, in a throw-away line, said that contractual commitments which have been entered into for the purchase of defence equipment this financial year are equal to two-thirds of the total defence budget. That is a meaningless statement. It could be said of at any time in our history that more than half, probably two-thirds, of our defence budget was the amount necessary to be paid to replace, on a long term basis, the major defence systems of our defence forces. The commitment is not for this year alone; it is, in fact, a deferred commitment over many years. The reason for the almost panic decision to buy the aircraft carrier Invincible is best known to the defence forces and the Government. One has suspicions about the political clout of the Royal Australian Navy and the influence and pressures which have been brought to bear by the United States for Australia to place an aircraft carrier on station in the Indian Ocean and thus allow the United States to be free of that obligation. I do not dispute that that may be a reasonable request from an ally. However, I do dispute that the current state of our defence forces and the current state of our equipment programs can permit us the luxury to which the Government has committed us. The Invincible will, within the next 10 years, do irreparable damage to the re-equipment programs of the Australian defence forces. It is all right for the Minister for Defence to say that the Government has arranged to defer payments on the FFGs and that it has arranged to place orders speakfor but defer payments on the additional Orions which are and can be said to be a necessity for our defence preparedness. I suggest that they are of far greater necesssity than the Invincible. Deferred payments are not payments forgone. They are not payments which reduce their impact into the defence equipment budget. They are reduced in this Budget and probably will be reduced in the next Budget. But they are a cost which must be borne by other defence procurements which will be required in three or four years time when those payments must be met and cannot be paid for other than by a further deferment. Deferment is the name of the game. I think this House should look at the record of this Government in the area of defence and its record during the period of involvement with defence of the present Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) and . the Minister for Defence. The 1969 pre-Budget announcement on defence was the last announcement prior to the 1972 change of government. It was a substantive statement of government intent for re-equipment of the Australian defence forces at the onset of the end of the Vietnam war, at a time when a new approach, new equipment programs and a new outlook on defence planning were necessary, and the statement to the House indicated they were being adopted. One year later the present Prime Minister as Minister for Defence tore the guts out of that statement with deferments and cancellations. A year later, the next plus one Minister for Defence, because there had been one in between, made a further deferment statement to this Parliament. So we had cuts and deferments, but literally no defence equipment was on order at the time of the change of government in 1972. In 1976 the present Minister came into this House with what was universally accepted as a substantive, acceptable and important statement on defence policy. At no stage were the financial commitments given in that statement ever honoured. In the first Budget following the statement made in October 1976 in the White Paper 'Australian Defence', cuts were announced, and at the end of the five-year period for which that statement should have had currency the actual equipment program was behind what it was at the time of the announcement of the five-year program in this Parliament. Deferment is the name of the game. The Australian Army has practically no piece of equipment under 10 years of age. It has no equipment in the pipeline and what in 1976 were said to be substantive requirements of the Australian Army-surface to air missiles and antitank missiles-are no longer in the five-year program. The price to the Navy of the Invincible is to be deferment of the follow-on destroyer program, a slowing down of the FFG program and a cancellation of five of the patrol boatsthese were announced two years ago in the heat of the debate on Afghanistan-and a substantive reduction in capacity, including a total loss of naval air power. But there is no suggestion that that power will be retained or that naval air power will be restored. There is to be no fixed wing aircraft on a carrier. It might be within the Minister's knowledge that only the British Navy, of all major navies, in fact relies solely on carrier-borne aircraft for naval air operations. Not only is there no capacity but also there is no suggestion that any planning has been done. That is what concerns me. The Minister, in the last few days, released a statement which indicated that a committee would be established to study the future of naval air power. The terminal date of the Melbourne has been known for five years. It was mentioned, as was an inquiry into the future of naval air power, in the 1976 White Paper. But we have had a statement in this House within the last week saying that a committee will be established to inquire into the future of naval air power, at the time of the announcement of its cessation. That is not defence planning or forward planning; it is planning based on short term considerations. It is planning based on opportunity defence considerations and planning about which one has to have a suspicion. It reflects movements in the power structure within the defence policy areas and movements in the moods and the political equations which make up the decision-making processes of the Prime Minister and this Government. The follow-on destroyer program and the decision in regard to the Williamstown Naval Dockyard are, I think, typical of forward and long term planning. The Government, in an effort to overcome problems existing at the dockyard-and one must say that there was urgent need for examination of the performance and the future of the Williamstown Naval Dockyard-appointed a committee to inquire into that dockyard. The Government announced a follow-on destroyer program based on the FFG hull. On behalf of the Opposition I indicated quite clearly that we did not consider it was a good decision or a decision that really met Australia's needs. The Hawke Committee inquiring into the Management and Operation of the Williamstown Naval Dockyard met and brought down recommendations which happened to be in line with what I had said in this Parliament practically a year before. The Hawke Committee, as an expert committee, indicated that the link between the Department of Defence and the Williamstown Naval Dockyard should be broken, that a commercially based management should be established with responsibility directly to the Minister for Defence rather than through the Department of Defence. I would have thought that that recommendation would have been acceptable even to this Government; in fact I think it would have been totally acceptable to this Government. Unfortunately we have not had the opportunity to debate that report in this House. But the statements which have come forward since have indicated that the Government is going through what in the Hawke Committee is referred to repeatedly as 'efforts at a patching-up operation which have consistently failed to solve the problems at the dockyard.' The Committee report indicates also that the problems at the dockyard are not only industrial or trade union based. Those honourable members in this House who have bothered to read that report will understand that part of the problem is the dislocated management, the lack of contact between those who make the decisions and those who have to carry them out. It is a typical problem of a manufacturing or commercial industry being run by persons who have no commercial competence and nor should they. They are serving technical personnel whose job it is to carry out a role in naval technical services. The patch-up program announced by the Minister will do little more than speed up the ultimate closure of the dockyard. If that is the Government's policy, then its announced reforms will achieve that aim. It would seem that Australia would be better served if the recommendations of the Hawke Committee of inquiry were adopted by the Government and the Government sought to acquire a vessel which could add to the Navy's capabilities without the immediate requirements of entering into a major construction program of the FFG type. Our orders are being completed at the Todd shipyard. Upon completion, provided the vessels stand up to the wear and tear of getting to Australia-there are some doubts about the standards of workmanship involved in the current FFG program-we will have four major deepwater ships in the Australian Navy with certain capacities. These capacities should be supplemented by other capacities which are needed in a navy that does not have the opportunity of specialisation such as is available to larger navies, for instance the United States Navy. In his statement the Minister for Defence made great play about tensions in the world situation and the need for a country such as Australia to fend liberty and, what is more, to be prepared to defend liberty. One would be much happier if the statement said that liberty meant liberty not only for those people who are under communist domination but also those people in the world who are under totalitarian dictatorships and whose liberties have been removed. One has the suspicion that in its foreign policies Australia ignores the lack of liberty and the right of people to live like human beings in countries where the dictators say they are anti-communist. I think it is unfortunate that we do not take the view that all people who deny liberty-all those people who engage in torture and all peopl- who constitute a threat to a way of life to which human beings are entitledshould be condemned. We should be prepared to act in those areas.",66
140,Mr SPENDER ,DEFENCE,Like the Argentinian junta.,68
141,Mr SCHOLES,DEFENCE,"The Argentinian junta is one example. I doubt very much whether the honourable member for North Sydney can name more than one or two countries in the whole of South America or Central America which are not. Unfortunately, because of political considerations we do not look on those countries, other than Cuba, Nicaragua and El Salvador-and El Salvador only if there is a change of government-as being deniers of civil liberties. They are as bad as one another. Among the items which the Government has indicated it will carryon is the order for Orion C aircraft. Even this order has a funny history. In 1974 a cost-benefit study was undertaken to ascertain whether or not the Orion B aircraft could be upgraded in order to meet Australia's requirements. It was determined then that the cost and the life expectancy of those aircraft would not justify an upgrading. Yet in 1980-six years laterthe Minister announced in this Parliament that those aircraft would in fact be upgraded. Mr Killen-I said nothing of the sort.",68
142,Mr SCHOLES,DEFENCE,"I think the Minister should read his own program. It was subsequently announced outside this House that a trade in arrangement had been arrived at and that Australia would purchase new Orion C aircraft. We have now run into a problem which will cost us money. This will happen because of the deferments in placing orders and because of an incorrect decision made at an earlier time to upgrade the Orion B fleet. We have now reached the situation where the production line is cutting out. We have now been asked to maintain that production line because the United States forces do not, at this detime, intend to maintain it but they would like it maintained. For that privilege Australia will pay an additional $40m for our aircraft on today's estimate by the Minister. The Minister said it had gone up by $40m. Whether or not that will in fact hold up is a matter which will be determined when contracts are signed and the actual cost of the aircraft comes back through our purchasing system. The fact is that because of what was looked on as a cheap decision initially we will pay through the nose. That decision could not be justified six years before it was announced because of the life of the aircraft. The Government is slowing down what is seen, at least in Western Australia, as an important military requirement, the Derby airfield. I also want to refer to Cockburn Sound. The Minister will remember Cockburn Sound because three days before the last State election in Western Australia he announced that home porting of Australian vessels would take place at Cockburn Sound. He would also remember that four days before the 1977 poll in Perth the Prime Minister announced that home porting of Australian vessels would take place at Cockburn Sound. I as-ed whether he will be announcing that again in 1983. Correctly, he said that he could not assess the date of the next Western Australian election. I am certain he can assess that that promise will be available for the making whenever the next election is held. The development of Cockburn Sound is a recurring promise without substance. This promise is available to the Government whenever it needs it. The 1976 White Paper indicates an intention to establish a patrol boat base on the north west coast of Australia between Darwin and Broome. That was announced but it now appears to have disappeared from the program. I suppose we can safely assume, with five fewer patrol boats, with the patrol base not being built and with the delay in the Derby airfield that, despite the statement about war in three years and the urgency which existed two years ago about upgrading our defences in that area, and despite the increased tensions that the Minister talks about and the increased dangers in the world, these projects no longer are looked on by the Government as being urgent requirements which now must be met. This statement illustrates the cost of purchasing the Invincible. The ultimate cost will be a reduced anti-submarine warfare capability in the Australian Defence Force. Honourable members should make no mistake about that; our capability will be reduced. The facts of life are that we are losing a capacity in pensioning off the Tracker craft. We will have no fixed wing aircraft on the Invincible. That fact has been announced. The helicopters which will be available will be inadequate. The FFG helicopters will not be available. The statement indicates that their purchase will be deferred. The Sea King helicopter depends on a dunking buoy sonar operation which is not of significant anti-submarine value in view of the numbers which can be operated from the Invincible. We will have a reduced capacity as a result of this purchase which is distorting the whole of the Australian Defence vote. I turn now to another aspect of the statement. I think the most dishonest thing the Government has done is to blame Service pay for its defence problems. Service pay is an inevitable consequence of having a defence force. It is manned by persons who are entitled to be paid and rewarded and to work under conditions of employment which are at least comparable with members of the civilian community. I do not think the Minister disputes that for one minute. Mr KillenNo, and the pay is far ahead of the civilian community and you must acknowledge that.",68
143,Mr SCHOLES,DEFENCE,"I point only to the Budget. This statement is a response to the Budget figures and the financial dictates of this particular Government. If the Minister looks at his own statement he will find that it says so. Salaries for those in the services were adjusted this year as a consequence of a work value case, the first undertaken since 1973. The results of that case were predictable. They were not significantly out of line with movements in comparable areas in the community. Mr Killen-I said that they should be the same as for the civil service.",69
144,Mr SCHOLES,DEFENCE,"I said they should be not less than salaries in the civilian community. They should be comparable with them. The other adjustments in salaries are substantially in line with those in the community. They can be anticipated, as is the fact that there will be another increase in salaries before the end of this financial year unless the Minister fails to approve the recommendations of the committee of inquiry. I do not think that the Minister will do that. The facts are that in last year's Budget $100m was allowed as a contra to subsequent salary rises during the year. The Budget indicated that salaries in the community were expected to rise by 13.5 per cent during the 12 months covered by the Budget. The sum of $100m represents a 6.5 per cent increase in total Service pay over the 12 air- months covered by the Budget, 13.5 per cent being the figure by which the Budget claimed that would increase. This means that there was a shortfall of approximately $140m in the Budget to pay for salaries. In relation to the 14.3 per cent, I think it is, increase in a full year-honourable members might remember that there was in train a work value case which would have been taken into account in addition to the 13.5 per cent average increase because of the time factor involved-it is now said that the $140m shortfall is not an additional unexpected amount on the Defence vote but is an amount which would normally have been expected to be added to the Defence vote as a consequence of Supplementary Estimates. It was not included in the original vote, even though the figures in the Budget indicated that that amount would be required. That is normal budgetary practice. To suggest now that the salary increases in excess of the amount, being less than half of that anticipated, which was originally allowed for, were unexpected or could not have been coped with within the Budget is to suggest that there was some fiddling with the figures in the original Budget. Defence expenditure is now suffering cuts as a consequence of costs which are properly attributable to unavoidable costs and unavoidable changes in salaries which were anticipated when the Budget was prepared. To say that that was a cost increase which could not have been anticipated is to make an excuse for a reduction in the Defence vote. That is what it amounts to. As a consequence, there is a substantial alteration in the funds available-not the two-thirds of the vote-for equipment purchases this year. Leaving out the $81 m advance payment for HMS invincible, as shown in the Supplementary Estimates, we have a figure of$475m for new capital equipment, as opposed to a figure in excess of $600m in the Budget last year. With the $81m added for the invincible, which is a replacement for other capital equipment which should have been purchased during the year and for which provision was made, the equipment vote is down to 13.2 per cent. The Minister, in a statement in the House, indicated that within five years from 1980 the equipment vote would take up 25 per cent of the Defence vote. To achieve that today would require an additional $1,OOOm in the Defence vote and a 37 per cent increase in the equipment vote over the next three years-which I doubt the Government is likely to achieve. Slippage on major capital equipment has been one of the major aspects of government policy and deferment of announced decisions has been another. I have a list based on the 1976 White Paper on slippages. I shall show it to the Minister. I seek leave to have thif> incorporated in Hansard, if the Minister does not mind. I do not want to have to read it. Mr Killen-No. I have Cameron's authority here, and it is about time that it was followed again in the House. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKF.R ( Mr GILES) - Leave is not granted. The honourable member may table the document if he wishes, of course.",69
145,Mr SCHOLES,DEFENCE,"No, Mr Deputy Speaker, under the Standing Orders an ordinary member is not allowed to do that. I have a list of items which covers two pages of typewritten foolscap, showing slippages in the dates on which equipment orders were to be placed and deliveries were to be made. Mr KilIen-That is arguable, like many of your other arguments.",70
146,Mr SCHOLES,DEFENCE,"The dates that the Minister announces and the dates on which orders are placed are not arguable; they are matters of record and of fact. I am sure the Minister, as a lawyer, understands that. I wish now to go through the appropriations for capital equipment since 1975-76, as I am not allowed to incorporate the list, and to indicate the percentage of the appropriation which has actually been spent on new equipment in each of those years, including slippages. In 1975-76 86.3 per cent of the appropriation was spent. In 1976-77 it was 82.4 per cent. In 1977-78 it was 95.7 per cent. In 1978-79, the good year, 99.5 per cent of the appropriation was spent. In 1979-80 it was 98.7 per cent. In 1980-81 it was 91 per cent. The estimate for this year is that 84 per cent of the appropriation will be spent for capital equipment. The Government's record in defence is one of deferment, procrastination and failure to carry out the undertakings it has given to the House. I therefore move, as an amendment to the motion that the House take note of the paper: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: The House(I) condemns the Government for its persistent failure to implement its own announced defence programs and for its failure to define clearly defence policies and force structure and equipment programs to meet Aus· tralian defence requirements; (2) directs the Government to immediately prepare and present a definitive statement on defence policy, Australia's strategic position and forward planning for the structure and equipment of the Australian Defence Force; and (3) notes that the most recent definitive policy statement on defence of November 1976 is no longer relevant to the Government's actual defence programs or the current strategic situation.",70
147,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,DEFENCE,"Mr GILES) - Is the amendment seconded? Mr MorrisonYes, Mr Deputy Speaker, I second the amendment.",70
148,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFENCE,"Before the honourable member for St George makes his speech, I merely indicate that it is quite correct that no member other than a Minister can table a document without leave. I am sure that the honourable member for Corio fully understood that.",71
149,Mr MORRISON ,DEFENCE,"St George) (4.28)-1 do not take pleasure in seconding the amendment, because this is a very sorry day for Australia's fence. The Minister for Defence ( Mr Killen) has come to the House with a confession. It is a confession of failure. It is a confession of incompetence and of mismanagement. What the Minister said today and what this Government has said on previous occasions underlines a monumental incompetence on the part of this Government in the management of the defence of Australia and the responsibility for that defence. The statement that the Minister made today is to be condemned. It should be censured. Of all the broken promises of the Fraser Government, the dismal record of this Government in defence now reaches a high pinnacle. The Minister's statement today brings into our language a type of lexicon of rescheduling, of delays in acquisition, of deferment of payments and of delays in construction. The newspeak of 1984 is here two years ahead of time with the Minister for Defence, because each and everyone of those statements underlines incompetence and mismanagement in the defence of Australia. Moreover, the statement uncovers again for all to see the Government's monumental hypocrisy. It underlines the yawning gap between promise and performance. This is not new. My colleague the honourable member for Corio ( Mr Scholes) pointed out what happened in the late 1960s. Let us have a look at the record a little closer ern times. The White Paper that the current Minister for Defence brought in in 1976 was a remarkably good paper because, as he well knows, the propositions and the capital equipment under order were based on the programs of the Labor administration. We had no objections to the proposals in the 1976 White Paper. Why should we; it so closely followed the programs that were devised by the Labor administration in the period 1972 to 1975? But that White Paper of 1976 said there would be an expenditure of $12,000m over five years. There is nothing remarkable about that figure except that the Government, in its grandiloquent way, put a figure on a five-year defence rolling program. As I said at the time, that may be okay for public relations exercises but to mistake a five-year rolling program for committed purchases is a monumental error, and of course the Government fell into it. The Government said that in that period there would be an annual increase in outlay of 5 per cent in real terms. The promise-another one of the Fraser Government promises-was that there would be a five per cent average increase in outlay in real terms. What was the performance? The indecrease was slightly over 3 per cent. That average was achieved only because of the forward commitments of the Labor Government which impacted particularly on the 1976-77 Budget, when there was an increase of 7 per cent. But there was a promise of a 5 per cent increase over that period and the record shows that the increase was three percent. In 1978, after these tremendous public relations exercises of talking about defence, the rhetoric on defence and the promises contained in the 1976 White Paper, the Minister for Defence had to come into this House and make a confession. He is certainly getting a lot of practice at it. We know that he has aspirations to monastical life. He is certainly getting enough training in the practice of confessions. On 24 October 1978 the Minister, in this place-I ask honourable members to remember these words because they have a remarkable ring of similarity to what he said today-said: Outlay this year . . . will not be large enough for us to achieve in the time that we originally contemplated all of the objectives and projects of the Defence White Paper of 1976. So we had the statement in 1976 and two years later an abject confession. Not to be deterred, the Government formulated again, during its Afghanistan fervour, another program which was to modannounced on 19 February 1980. This time the annual increase was not going to be the 5 per cent that was set out in the White Paper; the annual increase was going to be 7 per cent in real terms. Again let us have a look at the performance. We are all aware of the promises but let us get down on paper the record. In the year that statement was made the increase was 3 per cent. In the following year, 1980-81, the increase over that in 1979-80 was 5.6 per cent; in 1981-82 it was 5.3 per cent. There was a promise of 7 per cent and the performance was much less, about 5 per cent. We now have the Minister, after the rhetoric of the Afghanistan debates, including the repetition of some of the phrases in the introductory remarks in the statement today, saying on page 10: Consequently some planned objectives for the devel-JJment of the Defence Force will not be achieved as early as intended. I do not know why the Minister does not just keep the statement he made on 24 October 1978 and every couple of years walk in and lay it o- - he table instead of subjecting himself to the humIliating experience of having to come into this House again and again for confessional. The honourable member for Corio has pointed out the impact that the hasty decision by this Government on the purchase of HMS Invincible has had. I want to go into more detail on that proposition. It certainly, as the Minister freely admits has thrown the financial planning of the Gover-ment into disarray or disorder. But that is not all. It is not just a question of money. What is significant is that it has thrown the whole force structure of the defence forces into disarray-it has certainly thrown the force structure of the Royal Australian Navy into disarray. The Minister has not adequately explained to the House the reason for that curious decision except to say that it was cheap. That is one of the reasons that the Defence Sub-committee of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence is to examine the nature of that decision making process. So we will al- be like tourists i!l Hong Kong-going broke savmg money. That IS precisely what is happening to the Australian Defence Force program and to the Australian Defence Force structure because of that hasty decision to purchase the Invincible. He has had a little time to reflect. I detect from his statement that he is now not quite so sure, quite so positive about the advantages of the Invincible. He now says that on balance the decision was probably right. A tone of apology has crept into his statement. Well might there be a tone of apology because every subsequent statement in the speech he gave this afternoon underlines the tremendous impact of that decision on the navy. I refer to the deferment of the FFG program. He stated that there would be no more ASW - anti-submarine warfare-helicopters. I must say that we have reached the height of absurdity when we buy an aircraft carrier which is in fact an anti-submarine warfare helicopter carrier and the Minister says that the Government is going to defer the. program for the purchase - f more anti-submanne warfare helicopters. It IS writ large for him on page 13 of the statement. We are buying an aircraft carrier in a sense. It is an anti-submarine warfare platform, no more no less. Today the Minister stated, as he has stated it before-there is an agreeable consistency about his remarks-that we are not going to buy any short take-off vertical landing aircraft for it. ongmally There are not going to be any fixed-wing aircraft for it. There may have been some logic in the purchase of the Invincible if we we were to maintain the full capacity of a fleet air arm, but we are not going to do that. So the real estate people in Nowra might just as well get underway because they are going to have a lot of property to sell there. Mr Kerin-It will wreck the town.",71
150,Mr MORRISON,DEFENCE,"As the honourable member suggests, it is going to wreck the town. In fact, I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce ( Sir Phillip Lynch) is already getting out t-e razor gang to capitalise on the land deals that will probably take place there. What about the Trackers and Skyhawks, the equipment of the HMAS Melbourne? Let us not make any mistake, the Melbourne was a far more effective operating ship than the Invincible. But the Trackers and Skyhawks from the Melbourne are going to be phased out. The Fleet Air Arm is gone and all we will have is a helicopter aircraft carrier without any helicopters. It will roll around the sea as a large scale board room for the admiriils of the Navy. If honourable members want to come down to an issue-I will take the Navy's view because I have a very high regard for our naval brethren-I quote the following Navy statement: It is the Navy's strongly held professional vie.w that the absence of integral seaborne air would senously JeopardIse our capability to conduct effective maritime operations . . . It goes on: Australia's wide ocean areas . . . are vast, but without seaborne fixed-wing air capabilities for counter-air reconnaissance, air defence, maritime strike and tactical air reconnaissance naval forces would be limited to coastal operations within the assured cover of land based fighter jstrike aircraft . . . This could have serious consequences for the protection of trade. Here is the Navy making a statement which denies any justification that the Government has ever put forward for an anti-submarine warfare type carrier. That statement was made on 2 May 1980. So despite the professional advice of the Navy and of many groups within the Departme-t of Defence, this Government has pursued this once quickie-type purchase of the Invincible. It is a complete disaster of a purchase and the disaster is now being revealed. All the finances of the Department of Defence have to be restructured. If that was not bad enough, the whole forestructure, not only of the Navy but also of the Royal Australian Air Force and other parts of the defence forces, have been grossly distorted. It is for these reasons that the Opposition roundly condemns the statement made by the Minister for Defence this afternoon. I am sure that it is a statement he will live to regret. It is a catalogue of omissions and of remissions. Not one word in that statement would provide any security for the Australian people. It is a statement of disaster and one that the Opposition thoroughly and roundly condemns. Debate (on motion by Mr White) adjourned. NA NA",72
151,Mr BOURCHIER ,ENVIRONMENT AND CONSERVATION,"Bendigo)- Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence I wish to make a short explanation. Earlier today a report was tabled by the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment. Unfortunately I precluded the honourable member for Batman ( Mr Howe) from speaking. I was under the impression that the debate had gone according to arrangements made. I apologise to the House and to the honourable member for Batman. If the Chair would allow him to speak on the subject now, this side of the House would accept it.",73
152,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,ENVIRONMENT AND CONSERVATION,Mr GILES) - I will allow that course to be followed.,73
153,Mr HOWE ,ENVIRONMENT AND CONSERVATION,"Batman)-by leave-The report tabled earlier today was the first report of the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation on its inquiry into the management of chemicals potentially dangerous to health. It is quite a broad inquiry and covers the adequacy of legislative and administrative arrangements, the question of research and dissemination of information, and international co-operation. This first report specifically covers the storage, transport and disposal of hazardous chemicals. The issue of hazardous chemical wastes is extremely important for two reasons. It is important, in the first place, because it provides a way into the question of public health. I think it is erally agreed that if we are to make serious inroads into the incidence of morbidity within the community and if we are to cut health costs in the long term, we need to have a new emphasis in this country on public health. Secondly, I think the report is important because it draws attention to what economists call externalities associated with one of the most important industries in Australia; that is, the chemical industry. I think it has now been well documented, particularly in the United States of America, that if we look at the incidence of cancer in the community and then look for the causes, we need to look at the environment. Indeed, the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States has argued that up to 90 per centof cancers are environmentally induced. Of course, cancer has become a major killer in modern society. Its incidence is tending to increase despite the advances that are occurring in modern medicine. While considerable emphasis has been placed on the lifestyle theories of cancer which, for example, seek to absolve capital and those who produce in the society from responsibility for major disease, many scientists believe that, if we are looking to the causes of cancer in modern communities and in sophisticated and industrial societies, one area we need to look at very seriously is the chemical industry. The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health has estimated, in a study published recently in the United States, that 30 per cent to 40 per cent of all cancers were the product of worker exposure to carcinogenic chemicals within a work place situation. I remember visiting a community called Middlesex in the State of New Jersey where the chemical industry is very heavily concentrated. I was told by a teacher I met that in the school where she taught she was able to observe a pattern of males between 40 and 50 suffering from cancer. She said that in the school perhaps once every couple of weeks one found a chemical worker in that age group suffering from cancer. I think it has been established in the United States that the incidence of cancer tends to be very much higher in those areas in the country, particularly in areas on the East Coast, where the chemical industry is most highly concentrated. The importance of this inquiry is that it represents one of the first attempts in Australia to look at the possible relationship between aspects of chemical usage and public health. The report is also important because it draws attention to the significance of government regulations within a period in which many people, particularly those on the other side of the House, wish to see less regulation and the removal of existing regulations. genThe report documents something of the increased costs associated with the failure to manage properly the storage, transport and disposal of chemicals. It cites the example, which, of course, is very well known, of Love Canal in the United States, where the clean-up costs alone have been estimated to be of the order of $50m. It has been estimated in the United States that the total cost of cleaning up chemical waste dumps may be of the order of $50 billion, which is an immense amount of money. The study undertaken by the Committee has, in my view, been a pioneering one within this Parliament, for a number of reasons. It draws attention, I believe, to an issue which will become highly controversial in Australia. But prior to that controversy occurring and concern erupting, before the public has been made aware that problems exist, politicians have a responsibility to initiate inquiries and to open up issues. This report draws attention to a matter in the community of which people may at the moment be largely ignorant but on which in the future they will want to get all the information they can. Most people simply are unaware of the fact that disposal facilities, such as the facility at Willa wong, to which all of the other speakers have referred, actually exist. The study, particularly when it is completed, will represent a significant body of information on an issue on which there is very little information available in Australia. I draw the attention of honourable members to pages 4 and following of the report which draw together the limited information-it is very sketchy information indeed-that is available within this country about the storage, transport and disposal of chemicals, or indeed about the external effects of the chemical industry in this country at all. Page 4 of the report states: The Committee is appalled at the lack of accurate information in Australia on the amounts of hazardous waste being generated, stored and disposed of and consequently the predicted generation rates. It is simply not possible to say how much toxic wastes are being stored in all sorts of extraordinary locations around the country, nor do we know at what rates these wastes are being produced each year and to what extent the problem will be more serious in the future. However, the report does correlate some of the limited information available. It points to overseas information of some relevance to Australia. Further, the report notes that despite the fact that the one report produced which does try to draw together a picture and define something of a strategy, the so-called Maunsell report, has been in existence for some time, it has not been released by the Australian Environmental Council as a publication. So even when information has been collected it has not been made available to the public. The Committee has really been confronted by a situation in which it has been made aware of the colossal ignorance that exists within the Australian community concerning these by-products of the chemical industry. This clearly must be seen, finally, as a responsibility of the Federal Government. But, of course, it is also the responsibility of the chemical industry which has been, in the post-war period, one of the growth industries in Australia. As a subsequent report will discuss in some detail, we have had introduced into this country hundreds and perhaps thousands of chemicals, none of which have been tested for toxicity within Australia and many of which have not even been tested for toxicity in the United States. People are completely unaware of the dangers associated with some chemicals. Undoubtedly these chemicals are contributing to a great deal of the disease which exists in this country. So, this report is important if for no other reason than that it draws attention to the lack of information but at the same time provides to the Australian public what information is available. I will only very briefly refer to the survey of the present methods of disposal that the Committee carried out with the limited resources that were available to it. The little that we saw in the various States, with the possible exception of the New South Wales Government facility at Castlereagh, indicates that waste disposal of hazardous chemicals in this country is one of the most massive and amazing scandals that one could possibly imagine. I find absolutely appalling the complete irresponsibility of Federal, State and local governments, let alone the irresponsibility of an industry which is generating these wastes and not being concerned to ensure that highly toxic wastes are properly disposed of. We simply do not know lack of what contribution this industry has made to ill health within the Australian community. The Committee concluded, on the basis of its limited observations, that proper disposal facilities are not, however, the answer to the problem. A comprehensive cradle to the grave strategy with adequate penalties and backup is required to ensure that wastes are handled safely at all stages from generation to disposal. I refer members of the House also to the section on management, which is an extremely important section of the report. It is quite staggering that wastes which are being disposed of in this country, often in suburban tips, are simply not being identified. No one knows what is actually being dumped. The possibility of a Love Canal within Australia is, one could almost say, extremely likely. It would be just sheer accident if we did not have something of the order of a Love Canal. It has been suggested that I might conclude my remarks. I remind honourable members of the importance of the section on the need for registration, of the need to establish perhaps at the State level but under Commonwealth supervision a proper manifest system to have standards in relation to disposal and certainly of the need to resolve the problem of a national incinerator. I make it very clear that the Committee only refers to the Sydney proposal because that seems to be a developed proposal. The major thrust of the Committee is that we need a national incinerator. I want quickly to assure the people in Werribee that the State Government has no plans, and in fact has rejected any such idea, for locating a waste disposal facility near that city. I suggest finally that the Department of Home Affairs and Environment has an appalling staff situation. Five people in the Department are responsible for this problem in Australia, despite the fact that we are talking about one of the largest industries in this country and potentially massive problems. In conclusion, I wish to express my thanks, as other members have done, to the staff of the Committee. This report is, in terms of presentation, a pioneering report. It contains a great deal of information which I am sure many people throughout the Australian community will use for a very long time. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your indulgence in allowing me to speak. I thank again the Government Whip. NA NA Bill presented by Mr Street, and read a first time.",73
154,Mr STREET ,AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT BILL,"Corangamite-Minister for Foreign Affairs) (4.57)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to authorise a further payment of $A8.965m, to be paid initially in the form of promissory notes, to the International Fund for Agricultural Development. As honourable members will know Australia was one of the founding members of the Fund, which commenced operations in 1977. The primary objective of the Fund is to help increase agricultural production in developing countries. In addition, its activities are focused the poorest nations and the poorest sections of rural populations. The initial capital resources of the Fund totalled $USI billion to which category I members, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, and category II members, members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, contributed, with nominal amounts being contributed by category III members, the developing countries. These initial resources have been fully committed in the Fund's first four years of operation. A replenishment of the fund is therefore necessary to enable IF AD to continue its lending program. Although commitments from donors are urgently required to enable the Fund to approve existing and new loan proposals through to 1984, no draw-down of the new resources will occur for some time. Australia will not in fact incur any expenditure under this replenishment in the 1981-82 financial year. Negotiations as to the overall replenishment level, to be recommended to concerned governments, commenced early in 1980. After prolonged interand extra-category discussions a target of $US 1.1 billion was finally agreed on at the fifth Governing Council session in January 1982. Of this target category I countries agreed to contribute up to $US620m and category II countries up to $US450m. In order for category I countries to move beyond the earlier category target of $US595m, five countries have pledged additional contributions. Australia is technically regarded as one of these countries by virtue of the Government's decision to contribute its share of 1. 74 per cent of up to $US600m, which is $USlO.44m, equivalent at the ruling exchange rate to a contribution of $A8.965m. 1982 The Government believes that the International Fund for Agricultural Development plays an important role in the promotion of increased food production in developing counSecond Reading tries. The Fund accords with one of our chief aid priorities in providing the impetus and wherewithal for developing countries to help themselves achieve self-reliance in food production. IF AD plays an important role in promoting long term food security in developing countries through its focus on projects in the agricultural sector. These projects cover not only increasing production but also give specific attention to the poorest groups, taking into account distribution and availability, which are key aspects of developing countries' overall food security. The countries and regions in which IF AD is concentrating its assistance are precisely those in which the major problems of food insecurity are most acute. Australia sees the on concentration of effort on food security matters as a particularly productive avenue for achieving progress in the North-South dialogue at present. As a major primary producing country with considerable agricultural expertise it is especially appropriate that Australia should play an active role in an organisation such as IF AD. I believe that it is both in Australia's national interest and in the interest of the international community as a whole that we should continue to support the International Fund for Agricultural Development by contributing $A8,965m to the replenishment of the Fund. This amount represents essentially continuation of Australia's overall share in the Fund. I hope that other countries, especially the larger donors, will act promptly to lodge their agreed contributions to enable IF AD to continue its important work in improving the lives of millions of poor people. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen) adjourned. NA Bill presented by Mr Killen, and read a first time.",75
155,Mr KILLEN ,DEFENCE FORCE DISCIPLINE BILL,"Moreton-Minister for Defence) (5.03)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Since World War II repeated efforts have been made to consolidate and modernise the disciplinary law of this country which applies to the Services. This Bill provides new disciplinary legislation for the Defence Force and contains, for the first time in one Act, the disciplinary law applicable to the three arms of the Defence Force. The Bill replaces the existing legislation, which has come in for well-merited criticism over many years on various grounds. I will deal with the existing legislation briefly before describing the contents of the Bill. The existing legislation is contained in the following: three United Kingdom Acts, two of which have ceased to operate in the United Kingdom; four sets of United Kingdom rules or regulations, all of which have ceased to operate in the United Kingdom; three Australian Acts; and nine sets of regulations under the Australian Acts. The United Kingdom Acts, rules and regulations do not apply in their original form but are subject to extensive modifications, adaptations, exceptions and additions prescribed in the Australian regulations. The present situation with respect to disciplinary law may be described as a Serbonian bog of archaisms. Oddities and inconsistencies abound. I will give some examples. In the case of the Navy and the Air Force, some provisions of the United Kingdom legislation apply in parallel with corresponding, but not identical provisions of the Australian legislation, with conflicting directions in the latter as to which is to prevail. The basic law for the Navy is contained in a modern United Kingdom statute-the Naval Discipline Act 1957-whereas Army and Air Force law has its basis in, or is modelled on, the superseded United Kingdom Army Act of 1881, with all its archaisms, such as offences of 'duelling'; 'behaving in a scandalous manner unbecoming the character of an officer and a gentleman'; 'by beating drums negligently occasioning false alarms on the march'; and 'conniving at the exaction of any exorbitant price for a house or stall let to a sutler'. I would have thought that one who follows an army and sells provisions to soldiers-an activity which held some prominence in the 16th century-commands little relevance today. 1982 Sutlery may have brought its own unique perils. Contemporary Australia gives me the impression it is not greatly troubled by them. Second Reading The Army is provided with two sets of disciplinary laws, one of which applies when members are serving in Australia in peacetime, the other when members are serving outside Australia or on war service. Civil offences may be tried by service tribunals, but not by Army tribunals in Australia in peacetime. The civil offences that may be tried are offences against the - laws of England, but Navy tribunals may also try offences against the laws of the Commonwealth. Army and Air Force tribunals apply the English rules of evidence but Navy tribunals apply the rules of evidence applicable in the Australian Capital Territory. Offences involving stealing are dealt with according to the concepts of theft in the United Kingdom Theft Act 1968, except in the case of trials by Army tribunals in Australia in peacetime, when the common law concepts of larceny are applied. The maximum punishments that Navy commanding officers may impose greatly exceed the powers of Army and Air Force commanding officers. The maximum punishment imposable by an Army court martial in Australia in peacetime is imprisonment for three months regardless of the nature of the gravity of the offence. It is fair to say that any person who is not familiar, through practice, with the operation of these laws, who tries to find a way through the labyrinth of statutes, regulations and extensively modified United Kingdom legislation, faces a daunting task indeed. The existing law requires service lawyers to maintain a continuing and full awareness not only of Australian law and its developments, but also of English criminal law and its developments, a task more difficult and demanding than may be generally recognised. A change to a United Kingdom criminal statute or to the English law of evidence may take place, temporarily passing unnoticed in Australia. Such a change may cause an offence to be tried quite wrongly and thereby rendered nugatory. The admixture of United Kingdom and Australian law provides ample scope for errors to occur. This is no fantasy. There has, in fact, been one naval conviction quashed because the Judge Advocate advised the court-martial on the basis of an English decision which had not been followed in Australia by the High Court. I return to the Bill, which is based on the report of the 1973 Working Party on the Defence Force Disciplinary Code, which was tabled in Parliament on 2 April 1974. The Bill takes account of subsequent work done by the working party as a result of comments by members of Parliament, the public and members of the Defence Force. It also has regard to guidelines determined at a conference chaired by me in November 1978 and attended by the three Judge Advocates General of the Services, senior service officers and officers of the Attorney-General's Department. The working party attempted to produce a Bill that would be Australian, modern and uniform. The Bill that I am now introducing is Australian and modern but it is not quite uniform. I will have more to say on that point later. The Bill deals with three principal matters and a number of ancillary matters. These may be briefly described as follows: It prescribes offences that apply to members of the Defence Force and certain civilians who accompany the Defence Force; it creates tribunals for the trial, conviction and punishment of such offences; it provides machinery for appeals against, and reviews of, convictions and punishments; it deals with ancillary matters such as investigation of offences, trial procedures, and serving of sentences. Against that background I now discuss the Bill in more detail. The offences have been completely revised and several new offences have been included-for example, offences involving the use of vehicles for the possession and use of narcotic drugs. Obsolete offences have been eliminated and all offences have been restated in modern language. The maximum punishments have been reduced to modern levels and serious offences have been distinguished from mere breaches of discipline by the provision of much lighter maximum punishments for the latter. The scale of punishments has been revised and several kinds of punishments have been abolished, such as cashiering and dismissal from ship. The law of the Australian Capital Territory has been substituted for the law of England as the appropriate law for the purposes of civil offences triable by Service tribunals and for the law of evidence and the principles of criminal responsibility that are to apply. With regard to the investigation of offences, the Bill applies, with some exceptions, the Criminal Investigation Bill. The Bill also reduces the present powers to arrest alleged offenders and retain them in custody. All differences between and among the Services with regard to the kinds of court-martial and their procedures, including review procedures, have been abolished. Two levels of courts-martial are provided. A new form of tribunal is that of Defence Force magistrate who is to have jurisdiction equivalent to that of the lower level of court-martial. Provision is made for a Service lawyer to be appointed as judge advocate at every court martial and to make rulings on questions oflaw or mixed law and fact. Such rulings will be binding on the court-martial. Three levels of summary authorities are provided. The extensive summary powers conferred on Navy commanding officers have been substantially reduced and there has been some increase in the powers of Army and Air Force summary authorities. Greater supervision has been provided over the imposition of the more severe summary punishments. Several new procedures and requirements in relation to trials and reviews have been provided. A judge advocate may conduct a preliminary hearing to dispose of certain legal issues. Service tribunals are to be required to observe sentencing criteria. Provision is made for recording a conviction but issuing no punishment, for suspending the punishment of a fine and for setting non-parole periods. Provision is also made for automatic reviews of convictions and punishments and for ordering a retrial. As a safeguard on the restriction of the right to elect trial by court-martial or Defence Force magistrate where the exigencies of Service dictate, a reviewing authority is required to quash a summary punishment where, in his opinion, trial by court-martial or Defence Force magistrate should have been arranged. Certain requirements or rules under existing Army and Air Force law are abolished. These are: The requirement for the proceedings of a court martial to be confirmed before coming into force; the rule that conviction by an Army or Air Force court-martial is not a bar to subsequent trial by civil court for the same offence; and the rule that the condoning of an offence by competent Service authority is a bar to subsequent trial for the offence. Provision is made for one judge advocate general for the Defence Force and for the appointment of deputy judge advocates general. It is the function of the judge advocate general, when disciplinary proceedings are reviewed by reviewing authorities, to be the final arbiter on questions of law, or mixed law and fact, that may have arisen at a trial by a Service tribunal. A Bill such as this necessarily has regard to the organisation, administration and operation of the Defence Force. When there are substantial differences in this regard between the three arms of the Defence Force on a matter to which a provision of the Bill relates, the difference is liable to be reflected in the Bill. For example, because naval police do not serve at sea, it is necessary for the Bill to retain the special powers of arrest conferred on members of the regulating staff or the staff of the officer of the watch of a ship. Again, because promotion from the rank of captain to the rank of major in the Army takes into account service in rank instead of seniority, it is necessary to provide a special punishment called forfeiture of service for the purposes of promotion because the punishment of forfeiture of seniority cannot apply. The only important area in which the Bill fails to achieve uniformity is in the powers of summary punishment conferred on commanding officers and subordinate summary authorities in relation to sailors, soldiers and airmen. The powers conferred on these authorities in relation to sailors exceed those conferred in relation to soldiers and airmen. Closely related to this is the right to trial by court-martial or by Defence Force magistrate. The right provided in the Bill is more restricted for sailors than it is for soldiers and airmen. The reason for conferring more extensive powers on commanding officers in relation to sailors and restricting the right of sailors to elect trial by court-martial or Defence Force magistrate is the difficulty that would be encountered in conducting numerous such trials without adversely affecting Navy operations or, alternatively, causing lengthy delays in bringing offenders to trial. In the case of subordinate summary authorities, the relevant factors are: The organisation of the Navy; the command structure in Navy ships and establishments; and the nature of the duties of and r.esponsibilities of commanding officers of ships. A matter in the 1973 report that engendered particular comment was the treatment of the question of obedience to superior orders as a defence to a charge of committing an offence. The report restated the traditional position under British Service law that a member of the armed forces can be convicted of disobeying a superior order only if it is lawful and cannot be convicted for the consequences of obeying a superior order unless the order was clearly unlawful. Consideration was given to whether there should be a provision imposing an obligation on a serviceman to refuse to obey an order which is unlawful. However, such a provision would impose on every serviceman the impossible burden of knowing whether obedience to a particular order would contravene some obscure, customary law of war. Not all customary laws have been codified nor, on some questions, is the law settled. The Bill gives effect to the traditional position, except that it excludes the traditional defence where the accused knew or ought to have known in the circumstances that the order was unlawful. Finally, I mention the Courts-Martial Appeals Act 1955, which provides a convicted person with a right to appeal against his conviction to the CourtsMartial Appeal Tribunal. This Act is being retained with necessary consequential amendments and certain improvements that will be made by the Defence Force (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. That I will introduce next. The Defence Force Discipline Bill is the result of a prolonged and thorough review of the existing law involving officers of the Defence Force, the Department of Defence and the Attorney General's Department. I would like to express my thanks to them for their skill, their patience and elect the very considerable contribution they have made to the creation of this Bill. The Bill will, when it comes into force, provide a much needed modernisation and simplification of the law in this area. It moderates the severity of the existing law yet should be more effective for the reasons I have given and because it has been designed for present day circumstances of service in the Defence Force. It remains for me to say this: The Bill will lie on the table of the House during the parliamentary recess. This will provide interested parties with an opportunity to consider the Bill's provisions. The Government does, of course, stand ready to consider any submission which may be made with respect to the Bill. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Dr Blewett) adjourned. DEFENCE FORCE (MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) BILL 1982 Bill presented by Mr Killen, and read a first time. Second Reading",76
156,Mr KILLEN ,DEFENCE FORCE DISCIPLINE BILL,"Moreton-Minister for Defence) (5.19)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is complementary to the Defence Force Discipline Bill 1982. It deals with three matters. In the first place, it repeals existing Defence Force disciplinary legislation and makes other amendments to various Acts consequent on the enactment of the Defence Force Discipline Bill. Secondly, it makes amendments of a policy nature to the Courts-Martial Appeals Act 1955 designed to widen the right of access to the Courts-Martial Appeal Tribunal, to expand the range of powers available to the Tribunal, to improve certain procedures relating to the Tribunal and to provide a right of appeal to the Federal Court of Australia. Finally, it provides transitional provisions for the disposal of offences committed under existing Defence Force disciplinary legislation. Apart from amendments designed to achieve consistency between the Defence Force Discipline Bill and the Courts-Martial Appeals Act, significant changes to the Courts-Martial Appeals Act include: A person convicted by a Defence Force magistrate will be entitled to appeal to the Courts-Martial Appeal Tribunal. A person acquitted on the ground of unsoundness of mind at the time of the offence will be entitled to appeal against the acquittal, provided that the defence of unsoundness of mind was not raised by him. A convicted person will not be required to petition a Service reviewing authority before becoming entitled to appeal to the Tribunal; instead his right to appeal will arise when the automatic review by the Service reviewing authority is completed or the period allowed for automatic review expires. An appelant or a chief of staff may appeal to the Federal Court of Australia on a question of law from a decision of the appeal tribunal. The Appeal Tribunal will be empowered to substitute a conviction of an alternative offence of which the appellant might have been convicted on the evidence. The Appeal Tribunal will be empowered to quash a conviction and order a new trial in appropriate cases. A reserved decision of the Appeal Tribunal may be delivered by one member of the Tribunal sitting alone. The membership of the Appeal tribunal will be restricted to holders of judicial office. The amendments proposed to the CourtsMartial Appeals Act 1955 include the retitling of the Act as the Defence Force Discipline Appeals Act 1955 and a renaming of the Appeal Tribunal as the Defence Force Discipline Appeal Tribunal. This is a consequence of the provision of a right to appeal to the tribunal against convictions by a Defence Force Magistrate. The other amendments and transitional provisions made by the Bill do not warrant detailed mention in a second reading speech. May I say that the Bill, along with the Defence Forces Discipline Bill, will lie on the table the House during the parliamentary recess to enable interested parties to consider its provisions. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Dr Blewett) adjourned. GOVERNOR-GENERAL AMENDMENT BILL 1982 Bill presented by Mr Fife, for Mr Viner, and read a first time. Second Reading",78
157,Mr FIFE ,DEFENCE FORCE DISCIPLINE BILL,"Farrer-Minister for Education) (5.24)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill provides for an increase in the salary of the next Governor General after he is sworn in in July. By section 3 of the Constitution it is provided that the salary of the Governor General shall not be altered during his continuance in office. Thus the salary fixed at the commencement of a Governor General's appointment must remain unaltered during the period of his office. It means that the salary of the Governor General cannot be indexed or otherwise changed during his term of office, even if his appointment is extended. It is necessary then for the salary of a new Governor General to be set at a level which will be commensurate with his office and on a fair and reasonable basis, on the understanding that it will continue at that level during his incumbency of that position and over a period of years. The Governor General Act 1974 was introduced by the Labor Government and provided for a salary of $30,000. It was amended in 1977 to increase the salary to $37,000. It is now proposed that the Governor General's salary be $70,000-a salary that will remain unchanged through the period of the next Governor General's appointment. The salary set for the Governor General by the Labor Government in 1974 puts the salary of the Governor General considerably ahead of the salary of the Chief Justice of the High Court on a tax free basis. The Government is now proposing a salary of $70,000 for the new Governor General bearing in mind the relationships and movements in the salary of the Chief Justice and consumer price index increases since 1974, and the need to establish a salary which must, by the terms of the Constitution, remained fixed for some years ahead. The salary of the Chief Justice is also the yardstick referred to in section 4 of the Governor General Act 1974 for determining the pension payable to a former Governor General and his spouse. The current gross salary for the Chief Justice is $87,000. In 1974 the then Prime Minister put forward some important principles as applyof ing to consideration by the Parliament of the Governor General's remuneration. They were that the Governor General's salary should be dealt with in a non-party way; that the salary should recognise the importance and place of his high office; and that the appointment of a Governor General should not depend on personal wealth or the availability of other income. The Government parties, then in opposition, strongly supported these principles and still do. They were restated by this Government on introduction of the 1977 Bill. I would now like to commend those principles, first enunciated by Mr Whitlam, again as a basis for the current proposals. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Blewett) adjourned. FERTILIZERS (BOUNTY AND SUBSIDY) AMENDMENT BILL 1982 Bill presented by Mr N. A. Brown, and read a first time.",79
158,Mr NA BROWN ,DEFENCE FORCE DISCIPLINE BILL,"Diamond ValleyMinister for Business and Consumer Affairs) (5.28)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to extend the operation of the nitrogenous fertilisers subsidy and the phosphate fertilisers bounty schemes at current rates for a further three year period until 30 June 1985. This fertiliser assistance, due to expire on 30 June 1982, was introduced in the mid 1960s to stimulate increased use of fertilisers as a means of expanding agricultural production. The Industries Assistance Commission, recently submitted to the Government its report on the question of continuing assistance for nitrogenous fertilisers and phosphate fertilisers for use in Australia. Following examination of this report, the Government has decided to accept the lAC's recommendation that the current schemes be extended for a further three years. However, the Government has decided to defer a decision on a further recommendation of the lAC that the assistance should be terminated after 30 June 1985. Another issue which the Government will consider is the question of extending the assistance for fertiliser usage to cover imported fertilisers without restriction. The existing subsidy rate of $20 per tonne of contained nitrogen and the existing bounty of $12 per tonne of single strength superphosphate or $138 per tonne on the available phosphorous content of other phosphatic fertilisers will continue to be payable for the next three years. The cost to the Government of continuing this fertilisers assistance is estimated to involve a relatively constant annual budgetary outlay of from $50m to $60m. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Dr Blewett) adjourned. NA EmptyHere sonal explanation.",80
159,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Hon. Charles Jones)-Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented? EmptyHere,80
160,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The honourable member may proceed. EmptyHere just been drawn to comments in two Press articles Second Reading which appeared yesterday in relation to a speech I gave in this place on Tuesday on the appropriation Bills. I would like to correct the errors that were made in those reports. Firstly, page 13 of the Canberra Times and page 15 of the Sydney Morning Herald of yesterday's date contain the same article which stated that I said that any increases in income taxes must be matched by increases in indirect taxes. That is not correct. What in fact I said on Tuesday was that I believed there was a possibility for the Government to reduce income taxes and, further, that larger reductions in income tax would be possible if the Government continued with the moves it had made to increase indirect taxes. In fact, I am reported as saying on page 18820f Hansard: Clearly, any increase in indirect taxes must be matched by a reduction in direct taxation. So in fact the Press reports reversed what I said. The other comment that I wish to correct also appeared in the same article in the Canberra Times. The article stated: However, he said, the Government could 'kiss goodbye' responsible economic management if there was another round of wage increases. In fact I did not say that. Clearly, whilst the Government's economic strategy may be influenced by large wage increases, this does not mean that responsible economic management by the Government would end. In fact I said that if we have another round of wage increases similar to that which we have just had we can kiss goodbye to a re-emergence of a prospering Australian economy. EXCISE TARIFF (PETROLEUM) AMENDMENT BILL 1982 Debate resumed from 21 April, on motion by Mr N. A. Brown: That the Bill be now read a second time.",80
161,Mr KEATING ,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Blaxland) (5.33)-The purpose of the Excise Tariff (Petroleum) Amendment Bill is to increase the rate of excise on crude oil in line with the new import parity price set by the Government on I July 1981 and I January 1982. On I July last year the price of oil increased from $30.23 a barrel to $30.79 a barrel and on I January this year to $32.25 a barrel. The excise on oil-that is the crude oil levywas also increased at the time of increases. What we are now debating is the legislation which authorises those excise increases. I think at the outset I should just register the Opposition's objection to the delay in bringing this legislation before the Parliament. One set of tax changes is almost 12 months old and the other is six months old. We believe that Parliament should be given an opportunity to debate these matters closer to the time of implementation. One just ponders what sort of situation we would be in now if Parliament were to reject this measure. If Parliament were to do so it would be virtually impossible to unscramble the nightmare of collections from the motoring public, garage proprietors, the refiners and producers such as Esso-BHP, Moonie and West Australian Petroleum Pty Ltd. Where would we be if the Parliament decided that it was not going to authorise these collections? That is why we say that the authorisation legislation should be introduced much closer to the time of implementation of the new increases. The Opposition will not be opposing this Bill. However, on behalf of the Opposition, I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, House notes that any defeat of the measure would require the Commonwealth to forego approximately $160 million this financial year to the demns the Prime Minister for not honouring his election undertaking to commit any additional oil levy revenue to tax cuts and family allowances'. I would like to make it clear why we are taking this action. The Bill does not set the price for oil. We have had a debate in this country about the merits of charging Australians the world price for their own oil. The Labor Party's position on this has been well known in the last few years. We have objected to the rate at which the Fraser Government deregulated oil prices in this country. We saw oil prices go from $2.33 a barrel to $32 a barrel over a period of 2t years to 3 years. That meant that the motoring public of Australia Second Reading was slugged at the bowser. As.we said, there was a branch of the Taxation Office at every petrol pump. We now find that 12 per cent of receipts in the Commonwealth Budget comes from oil and petroleum products. That is the percentage collected by way of the crude oil levy and the excise or the pump tax on refined petroleum products. This is a very heavy tax and a substantial commitment to revenue. The Fraser Government, of course, took this policy on as a tax raising measure. It tried to market it as a resource allocation measure. While nobody would argue that there would not be some marginal effect, and that there has been some effect, in resource allocation and a change in the habits of some consumers of petroleum products, by and large this policy was implemented as a tax measure. What we are seeing at the moment is a continuation of this policy. The Opposition at the last national election said that if it gained office it would freeze the price of oil for 12 months and adjust the oil price by the consumer price index or import parity whichever was the lesser. In the period since we have seen two increases. In July this year we probably will see another increase of about $3 a barrel. Even though the Saudi Arabian oil price is now stabilising at $US34, the depreciation of the Australian dollar versus the United States dollar will mean that, when we take the exchange rate difference into account, there will be probably a $3, or a little over $3, increase this coming 1 July. That will, of course, reap another $400m or $500m for the Fraser Government in taxation. What has happened is that because of a downturn in world economies, oil prices have stabilised and spot prices have fallen. The long term contractual prices have stabilised and spot prices have fallen. Saudi Arabia, which happens to be the oil producer we settle upon in terms of fixing the our price, is the world's largest producer of oil. Because that country has been a most significant force in the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Australian oil producers, and conCountries it has been able to hold the line at $US34. Without the exchange rate differential the Australian price of oil in real terms would in fact be starting to fall. It will not be falling, because of that dollar exchange parity. But I would like to make the general comment that because of the stabilisation in prices the point of objection which the Opposition had to this rapid increase in oil prices through 1979 and 1980 is not so great. Had the Labor Party's criteria of a 12-months freeze and adjustments in line with the CPI or import parity, whichever is the lesser, been applied at the current time the price of oil would be a few dollars in the barrel less than it currently is. I will take the House back to the central issue. The legislation does not fix a policy. It is an administrative policy; the price of oil is determined administratively. I indicated at the start of my speech that the oil price had risen well over a year ago. The motorists have paid tax at the pump, the refiners have collected the money and given it back to Esso and BHP. If this legislation is not now passed, the money will be retained by Esso and BHP, and the Commonwealth will forgo any future collections at this price. We do not believe that this is in the interests of anybody, particularly the Commonwealth Government. On that basis the legislation should be defeated. While we disagree with the Government over the basis of the oil pricing policy we do not think the defeat of this measure would materially assist anybody other than Esso and BHP in particular or Wapet or the Moonie oil producers. If there is $160m left with the producers as a result of this legislation being denied there would be clawbacks under the company tax arrangements. There would still be a massive fillip to these oil companies by virtue of the fact that the legislation is not being passed. I say this to indicate why we still maintain our reservations about the Government's oil pricing policy but will vote for this legislation. In the amendment we say that we will not decline to give the Bill a second reading, but we note that the defeat of the measure will mean that we will forgo $160m. We condemn the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) for not honouring an election undertaking to commit any additional oil levy revenue to tax cuts and family allowances. I will take that point up. In the 1980 election campaign, oil pricing and petrol pricing was a very large issue. In the campaign the Prime Minister had this to say: If there are any further significant increases (in petrol prices and tax from them) then the first priority of the Government will be to return that to the Australian family through the taxation mechanism or through family allowances. While we don't at the moment expect dramatic increases, the revenue will be returned to Australian families. That just has not happened. The Prime Minister is in breach of that undertaking. I am taking this opportunity to remind the Prime Minister of that undertaking and to indicate that the House should condemn the Prime Minister in the terms of this amendment for not meeting that promise. The sum of $160m is a significant amount of money. Given the fact that family allowances have not been indexed from the time of their implementation in 1976-their real value has fallen dramatically with inftation-at least $160m could have been committed in this area but that, of course, has not happened. I am not sure what the Prime Minister defines as a significant increase, but since that statement the price of oil has increased by $4.75 a barrel and the Government has received almost $500m in additional taxes. If we are talking about this particular measure we are talking about the potential of $160m, but if we look at the period from the time that statement was made to this point, we note that about $500m in revenue has been collected by the Commonwealth over a price rise of $4.75 a barrel. The question one may reasonably ask is: Why did the Government not stand by its commitment, as the Prime Minister said, to assist the Australian family through the tax mechanism or through family allowances? We have seen no relief for family allowances or taxation. Oil revenue this financial year is unlikely to be as high as is predicted in the Budget. It will still be more than the last financial year even with lost production from industrial disputes. Also, there was a substantial increase in revenue during the first six months of last year. This has still not been returned in any way, shape or form. I have been over the Australian Labor Party's point of objection to the taxing policy. I thought I should just mention the question of the tax mechanism itself. We have made the point over and over again that the method we have adopted to tax oil in this country is a system of multiple levies. Six levies operate in the Bass Strait oil fields. We now find that even with the lowest production, the highest cost fields pay a levy of $3 per barrel. This must eventually discourage the draining of fields after a certain point; in other words, the operating of this levy system, as the Government has established it, will mitigate against the full recovery of oil from reservoirs when the secondary recovery techniques are employed and when the cost of mining or producing oil from these reservoirs rises. Hence the Opposition has supported a resources rent tax which is a much fairer, more equitable and more stable form of taxation which does not discriminate against marginal production or from the draining of reservoirs and which would, of course, be non-distortionary and produce the right kinds of production decisions which we will not see produced from the existing levy system. The existing levy system is subject to arbitrary price changes by the Government. Every six months those six levies have to be changed and the basis of the change is essentially on the basis of bureaucratic decisions taken concerning the level at which a certain category of field should be taxed. We do not think that there is any basis for such an artificial assessment of the tax take at the fixing of a particular levy rate. We think that the resource rent tax concept is far more efficient in the producers' terms. It makes their accounting much more simple. Because it is a nondistortionary tax it would ultimately mean that there is more oil to be produced for the Australian public, more savings in the balance of payments and more revenue for the Government. I will sum up what I have said. We stand by the objections we have made in terms of the deregulation of Australian oil prices from the very low historical price of $2.33 a barrel to this full SaudiArabian price over a very short time. There is no doubt that as oil prices stabilise, and the motoring public and the community adjust to these higher level of prices, the damage being inflicted will be lessened by time. That does not detract from the fact that this legislation is very has been no authorisation of these collections from the Parliament. The Parliament could have rejected the legislation. This will not happen now as the legislation will be supported by both the Government and the Opposition in the Senate as well as in the House of Representatives and the Bill will be passed. I repeat that it would be impossible to rebate the collections if we were to take them back to the motoring public. We do not think we are in the business of giving oil companies, such as Esso, BHP, Wapet or the Moonie producers, a hand-out of this magnitude with the tax being levied only at a company tax rate of 46c in the dollar. We believe that as the Government won the election and has implemented its policy the money should be collected. Again I indicate that the oil pricing policy is not being affected here. This is an administrative decision. We have disagreed with the thrust of the decisions. In terms of the implementation of the tax take and the sharing and dividing of the tax we support the measure, but with the caveat of reminding the Prime Minister of his breach of promise to the public in respect of the return of the tax to family allowances. We indicate, once again, that we will be critical of the Government's oil pricing and energy policy on an appropriate basis. Over time we will see what effect these higher prices really have had on consumption.",81
162,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Hon. Charles Jones)-Is the amendment seconded?,83
163,Mr BEAZLEY ,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,83
164,Mr OKEEFE ,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Paterson) (5.50)-The purpose of this legislation is to amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to enact the excise tariff alterations made by Excise Tariff Proposals No. 3 (1981), No.1 (1982) and also Tariff Proposal No. 3 which was moved on 25 August 1981. This increased the excise duty on stabilised crude petroleum oil by $3.45 to $177.53 per kilolitre and on liquid petroleum gas by 40c per kilo litre to $37.07 per kilolitre. Tariff Proposal No. 1 was moved in the House on 17 February 1982. It increased excise duty to $186.26 per kilolitre but it reduced the export duty on liquefied petroleum gas to $20.46 per kilolitre, which was a drop of $16.61 per kilolitre. Australia is a very fortunate country indeed as it produces 66.9 per cent of its own petroleum resources, mainly from Bass Strait, which, of course, is the Esso-BHP consortium; from Wapet and Barrow Island, another consortium; and a small quantity from the Moonie field in Queensland. We import 33.1 per cent of our crude petroleum, mainly from Saudi Arabia but some late coming. There from Indonesia. The alterations covered by this legislation are in line with the Government's policy of adjusting Australian crude oil prices to world parity on 1 January and 1 July each year. The levy has become a very important part of our national budget and benefits the people of Australia as well as being a sound conservation policy measure. We must protect the petroleum resources that we have in this country. It is sound policy to do so. Early oil fields in Australia certainly provided great financial revenue for the Government. When this Government changed the oil pricing and levy system in August 1978, the oil based revenue began the rapid expansion which has taken revenue collections from $521 m in 1977-78 to an estimated $3,200m this year. However, this estimate will be considerably reduced because of the strikes that have taken place in Bass Strait. Unfortunately, at present, because of these strikes we have four crude oil tankers standing off Botany Bay waiting to unload crude oil into the refineries to give us products on the eastern seaboard. We could have problems with our fuel supplies in New South Wales as a result. The Budget results appear at this stage to indicate a deficit of approximately $200m because of these delays and strikes. Honourable members may ask why. It is because of the strikes at the scene of the Bass Strait production platform and also because of the shipping delays which have already been mentioned. This has not only cost the Government revenue; it has also caused serious fuel shortages on the eastern seaboard. From now on it does not matter how much oil is discovered in and around Australia. The oil levy has virtually reached its optimum point unless we as a government change the rules to restore its growth potential. The reason for this slow down is twofold. Australia's oil consumption has flattened out and the Saudi Arabian oil price, the basis for our oil prices and the Governmt;nt's levy, is also expected to remain relatively stable for the immediate future. Saudi Arabia charges its own consumers appr-xi-ately 13c a litre for super fuel but when It dIstrIbutes fuel to other Arab nations an- th.rou.ghout the world it is sold at a price which IS hIgher than that charged here. It is a fortunate country to have such a surplus of oil. When I w-s there - it.h a delegation recently it was prodUCIng 8.5 mIllIon barrels of crude oil a day. Since my visit that figure has been reduced to about 7.5 million barrels a day. We must realise that the oil glut is good for the consumers but not for the Government's revenue aspira-ions. The Government bases its oil levy on old 011 found before August 1975 in varying amounts according to the size of the field. As local prices rise in relati?n to the Saudi Arabian price, the bulk of each rIse goes to the Government in levy. The more oil Australians consume the more is produced from our local fields and the greater the levy to the Government. But now both prices and consumption have slowed down considerably. The Govern-ent cannot expect to receive any further real Increases above the inflation rate from its golden egg unless there is another world oil shock which sends prices through the roof. The Government has examined some methods of solving that taxing problem. It has looked at P?ssib.le cha-ges to the basis for setting the local 011 prIce. WIth the Saudi Arabian price clearly about to stick at around $US32 to $US34 a barrel the level for the foreseeable future, the Governm:nt studied the possibility of tying the local oil p-lce to - not.her yardstick which might produce a bIgger prIce Increase and, of course, a rise in levy revenue. It was just as well it decided to stay the set price. No doubt the Government would have attracted political flack for a decision which raised the price of petrol and would have been forced to justify it. This would have been difficult because soon after that study was undertaken the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries met and decided that a number of producers should lower their price while the Saudis raised their price in an attempt to restore unity to OF-c. A second option under study is a rise in excIse on petrol. The Government would need to mount a strong conservation argument to sell a petrol excise, an argument difficult to sustain given the glut conditions in the world oil market. In the Government's favour, however, would be th- fact that Australia's petrol price remains the thIrd cheapest amongst member counties of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Oevel-pment. We realise, when we travel, that petrol IS sold overseas at a much higher price than is charged in this country. Let us look at the program for oil exploration and development in Australia in the immediate - utu-e. It is essential that we do all we possibly can In thIs country to explore for more oil. There will be no shortage of work for oil rigs in Australia this year. An amount of $2.4m has been budgeted for by member companies of the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association. There are programs in line for 302 exploratory wells this year. However, that number would strain Australian industry resources to their limits. A figure of 280 wells would be more realistic, far and away a. r-cord for th-s country and double last year's actIvIty. The polIcy of the present Government with regard to pricing is certainly having a beneficial effect for the oil companies and those who are exploring for petroleum in this country. This lower figure takes into account the availability of suitable rigs, together with setbacks caused by adverse weather which could reasonably be expected. At the end of 1981 seven drill ships and 32 land rigs were available. An amount of $848m has been provided for exploration, of which $431m is for on - sho-e work. Operators are expected to have 15 d-IiI shIps and more than 40 land rigs searching for 011 and gas.

165,Deus ex machina,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Sitting suspended from 6.2 to 8 p.m. Mr <?'KEEFE-It is interesting to know where the varIOUS wells have been drilled in Australia. In Queensland 137 exploratory wells were drilled in 1982; in South Australia, 3 I; in Victoria, 28; in New South Wales, 4; in Tasmania, one, and in the with Northern Territory, 20. Some 190 wells were - rill-d on-shor an- 57 off-shore. The resurgence 7 In 011 exploratIOn In Australia since 1977 has a number of causes based on price and financial retur-s to - h- industry. These include, first, import par-ty prICIng for new and old oil which places oil pro-ects on a high economic threshold; secondly, fl-xlble levy scales for oil, which encourages margInal field development and field extension by al-owing existing producers acceptable returns; thIrdly, no levy on new oil, with the resultant expectation of higher profit from new discoveries' and fourthly, industry confidence in the mainten: ance of these policies. There is no doubt that the Government's oil pricing policy has achieved success and is accepted throughout the nation. The crude oil levy is an important aspect of Government policy. Without the levy, taxation would need to be significantly higher in order to finance the services demanded of government, and the gains from import parity would go to the oil producers as a windfall profit. The success of the Government's crude oil policy has been backed by openness, predictability and equitable sharing of income gains. This policy requires that in the interests of conservation and responsible management of scarce liquid fuel resources, prices of petroleum products be set at reasonable levels. The Bill has the full support of members on this side of the House.",84
166,Mr BEAZLEY ,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Swan) (8.3)-1 take up my seconding of the Opposition's second reading amendment. The Opposition is placed in a position in which it is obliged to support Government legislation to ratify a tax increase on the Australian consumer because it has no confidence in the willingness of this Government to hold down the price of the product in the event of the defeat of this legislation rather than permit it to flow through to the oil companies as a massive windfall profit. Were we confident that the Government was sufficiently mindful of the consumer's interest, we would be in a different position. We note, nevertheless, the breach of an electoral undertaking by the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser), given in October 1980 to return this additional impost on the taxpayer via cuts in other taxes. It is all very well to argue that industrial unrest and other disruptions to production have reduced the anticipated take. No such qualifications were put by the Prime Minister on his promise when he made it in a state of electoral desperation during the course of the 1980 campaign. This is the first real test of the seriousness of this Government when it says that it wishes to swap indirect tax increases for cuts in direct tax. Such promises, solemnly undertaken, will be broken when convenient and within months of their being made, as this one has been broken. We are left to wonder what circumstances will occur to permit other promises to cut direct tax, arising from other indirect taxes, to be rendered inoperable. The Government has failed lamentably its first test on its argument that there would be benefit to the taxpayers in a broadening of the tax base. This legislation was sold originally as a measure for the conservation of Australian energy resources and encouragement to develop Australian production. That was always nonsense. From the outset it was a revenue raising measure. The Government stole the Whitlam Government's policy to permit world parity pricing on fields developed after 1975. The new oil parity pricing policy was not a policy initiated by this Government. It was a policy initiated by the Whitlam Government. This Government married the policy to the revenue raising measure before us so that it could justify raising old oil prices to world parity levels with itself as the principal beneficiary. It was the Whitlam Government's policy of parity pricing which produced eventually the spurt in exploration. This Government merely hung its deficit problems on the coat tails of it, to the detriment of the rest of the Australian economy. The Government has been the principal beneficiary of the impost of this tax on old oil-in other words, on fields developed before 1975-and it has not particularly effectively applied it to those oil fields. The honourable member for Paterson ( Mr O'Keefe) argued that the levy that was imposed on old oil fields was sufficiently flexible to encourage increased production in those fields. It is manifestly not. The degree of flexibility simply is not sufficient for those fields to be encouraged to make use of fairly expensive new equipment to draw them to their fullest possible capacity. The Government will need to review that aspect of it. That was only a minor aspect of it. A major aspect of it was that the price rise, which had absolutely nothing to do with exploration at all, was an imposition by this Government on the Australian taxpayers for revenue purposes and for no other purpose. We on this side of the House are always pretty generous hearted. We do not mind the Government appropriating our policies. We merely demand two things-firstly, a nice acknowledgment and, secondly, that the Government have the decency to appropriate our whole policy, not merely a part of it. Whitlam's parity pricing policy for new oil to encourage production and exploration was introduced only as a first step to that end. We on this side of the House have seen that of itself it is an insufficient measure to retain and increase the indigenous share of Australia's oil market. If the Government were by sleight of hand to introduce parity pricing on fields already developed with close to a 100 per cent levy on the subsequent price increase, at the very least it might have put some of that money into achieving the objectives of the original Whitlam policy. It has not done so, and quite palpably as a result the achievements in new exploration and exploitation are simply not what they should be. Our exploration policy is still very much in the hands of the world market and subject to its vagaries. Given the marginal nature of our fields, the fact that we are a low priority to many oil companies which invest here, and with a restricted domestic capital market, we can expect a fast rundown in drilling activities once the circumstances become slightly difficult. Indeed, only a few months ago the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association estimated that a record 280 to 300 wells would be drilled in Australia this year with a record expenditure of $848m. I note that the honourable member for Paterson utilised those figures as though they were current. Now it looks as though at most two-thirds of that activity will be achieved. The explanation is, firstly, that the oil glut resulting from the recession and the ability of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to adjust production has lowered demands for liquid hydrocarbons. At the same time, the prevailing mood on the stock market makes it impossible for small Australian producers to raise cash needed for what an article in the Age described as 'relatively cheap on-shore programs'. These developments need not have had the impact they have had, had the Government implemented a further Labor policy and introduced a hydrocarbons corporation with the sorts of powers we had suggested for it. Government intervention to aid exploration and production is practised by the most impeccably monetarist and free enterprise governments around the globe. The Government here hides behind ideological fixations of its most rampant extremists to avoid doing the most simple things to benefit the Australian people and Australian industry. We are not suggesting nationalisation but a national effort in which the Government plays a proper part. Why should we not be subject to the vagaries of the world oil market? In the first place we have not experienced the same degree of reductions in oil consumption of other members of the International Energy Agency. In fact, the figures last year ran between 50 per cent and 60 per cent of the average lEA consumption drop. In other words, our consumption of oil dropped about half the rate of the lEA average, and even more, I think, in the case of American consumption of oil. We retain a high level of demand. Secondly, whilst Australian crudes are light crudes and all our heavy oil requirements for bitumen, fuel oil, and industriallubricants come from the Middle East we still, nevertheless, import a large amount of light crude. In the 34 per cent of the domestic oil market that is served by imported oil a substantial percentage could be replaced by domestic Australian production were it brought to an appropriate level. We are not speculating on the spot market so the light crudes we import tend to be around the Saudi price. Import substitution remains as profitable as it could with our parity price fixed at the Saudi level. There is thus no substantial reason why, properly managed, our domestic oil exploration and production should be reduced. In the area of import substitution our crudes remain viable alternatives to a substantial amount of imported crudes. Imported crudes are not coming in at substantially lower prices than domestic production. In any case, the capacity to pass on the consequences of any cost differential to the consumer in our highly non-competitive inpricing structure makes this no great problem. A hydrocarbons corporation would advance exploration by encouraging the private sector' by entering joint ventures with it or in direct competition. A capacity to raise funds from loans and public borrowings would overcome the fluctuations of an extraordinary nervous stock market contemplating the risky and expensive oil exploration business. There are, however, other reasons why such a corporation with additional rights to operate as a fully integrated oil company, including downstream activities such as trading and refining, is now essential and a positive advantage. In the first place, if there is no increase in light crude production from domestic sources-and this seems unlikely without a hydrocarbon corporation's impetus to exploration-that same corporation will be needed to assist in alterations to the technical capabilities of some of our refineries. Our refineries are geared to an essentially Australian production of good quality light crude. The availability of this on the international market is reducing substantially. Saudi Arabia, from where we get the substantial proportion of our light and heavier crudes, is demanding that importers of light crude take an increasing amount of heavier crude. Should we require to import an increasing amount of our light crude needs we may need to develop a refinery capacity which will permit the refining high sulphur content heavy crudes into transport as well as industrial fuels. Our refineries do not have to hand the flexibility for such an adjustment. They will not need it if we maintain and increase our domestic productions via government encouragement. If we cannot, then a hydrocarbons corporation entering the field would ensure such a refining capacity is developed more rapidly than would otherwise be the case in Australia. Without that initiative we would be more dependent on the refining capacity of other countries. Secondly, Australia needs to begin to look seriously at the possibility of government-togovernment deals on oil imports. Here a hydrocarbons corporation would give the Government thoroughly competent and well informed personnel to negotiate such agreements. Government-togovernment deals are an increasingly important feature of the international oil market. Japan, for example, imports about a million barrels a day on this basis. As producer countries move to increasing influence over the upstream and downstream aspects of the oil market this becomes even more significant. There has been a massive shift in the balance of power in the oil market as statistics demonstrate and as all honourable members would be aware. This has impacted heavily on the profitability of both oil majors and independents which, incidentally, poses additional problems for receiving investment in exploration in Australia. Overseas companies are not as liquid as they used to be. In 1950 the seven oil majors controlled 92.8 per cent of internationally traded oil and the independent private companies 7.2 per cent. Direct marketing by producers was non-existent. In 1979 the majors controlled 46.6 per cent and the independents 11.2 per cent. Direct marketing by producers had increased from nought per cent in 1966 to 7.9 per cent in 1973, and to 42.2 per cent in 1979. That percentage continues to increase dramatically. This intervention by governmental producers in marketing should not be confused with the shift in the distribution of power between producers and consumers as such. As Brian Levy, in an excellent article entitled 'World Oil Marketing in Transition', which appeared in International Organisation in 1982, pointed out: The redistribution of oil tries largely came prior to the did the ability of the exporting nations to set themselves an upper limit on production levels; Arab oil exporters had exhibited this power back in 1973. The shift has however destroyed a large number of marketing arrangements and vertically integrated linkages. A hydrocarbons corporation with strategic as well as commercial objectives would be of significant assistance in negotiating this country through a difficult period. The governments of large numbers of wealthy, private enterprise economies are now turning to measures most easily organised by such a corporation to deal with the problems they confront. It is not as though, as I have said, the idea of a hydrocarbon corporation is a novel one. The Canadians have operated an equivalent, in Petro-Canada, for some considerable time. Their Department of Energy, Mines and Resources said of Petro-Canada: Events since Petro-Canada was created have re-enforced the general appreciation of the positive role that can and has been p!ayed by such an instrument, as a 'window' on the industry, a stimulus to activity, and a supporter of domestic industries providing goods and services to the energy sector. Nevertheless direct public sector participation in this sector remains too low. By world standards, the degree of private sector involvement in the Canadian oil industry is high. Petro-Canada has not involved a government takeover of the oil industry but has provided that oil industry with invaluable assistance. Despite recent setbacks, the drilling program in Canada dwarfs our effort so initiatives like Petro-Canada cannot be all that bad. Had we a hydrocarbons corporation actively interested in the development of the North West Shelf gas fields, for example, the Western Australian consumers might well not now be facing the dramatic increases in the energy charges they do. Because of delays in the securing of contracts for exportcontracts which will be forthcoming-Western Australian consumers are slated to bear the whole burden of the initial stages of development and the north-south pipeline. In the first place Western Australian consumers should never have had to carry the whole cost of that pipeline and nor should they have to carry the whole cost of initial development. I point out that 1.2 million people will be carrying an investment of several billion dollars. Whereas it was promised by Liberal governments that the gas would never be used for electricity generation, it now will be. As a result, there have been some estimates of a doubling and trebling of electricity bills to meet the cost. A hydrocarbons corporation could have cushioned the effects of this shift in the burden of the project from foreign to domestic consumers and provided additional negotiating revenues toward producing counrevolution in marketing. So too, muscle with potential export markets. The upshot of all this is that the Government, having stolen Labor's clothes on parity pricing for new oil to get exploration going, could now use some of the taxpayers' money purloined under the parity pricing on old oil to steal the whole suit of a decent exploration policy from us. We should also encourage the Government to stick to its promises in regard to distributing the next increase in the oil levy to taxpayers, as we have suggested in our amendment. It is just like the Prime Minister, in desperation, to make promises in the final moments of an election campaign and to then declare them inoperable. That type of cynicism discredits us all. It makes the development of an equitable taxing policy untenable when the public has no regard for the Government's word on the matter. I think I can say, though, that one useful purpose has been served by this whole exercise when we look, as we do in our Opposition amendment, be played at the Government's promise in regard to this. An awful amount of nonsense is being talked by the Government at the moment. It puts the view that the broadening of the tax base to increase vastly the amount of take from sales taxes-taxes such as this one-will relieve the burden for the income taxpaying community. What that means, in effect, is that those who are avoiding tax at the moment will pay sales taxes; those who are paying income tax at the moment will continue to do so but will pay sales taxes also. Anyone who believes that the Government will take seriously the soft end of its promise that an increase in sales tax will reduce the burden of income tax, ought to look very seriously at what has happened in regard to its promise concerning the proceeds of its oil parity pricing policy. That was to have meant, in this year, a return to the taxpayers, in some shape or form, of an amount of about $160m and, in the first six months of last year, of an additional $50m or $60m. That money has not been returned to them. Excuses have been found for rendering (hat promise inoperable. However, none of those excuses were foreshadowed when the promise was made. If other excuses for rendering inoperable the promises concerning the sales tax-income tax trade-off no doubt they will not be announced in advance but rather will be thoroughly utilised when an appropriate occasion arises. The Government's policy on oil parity pricing has always been cynical. It was cynical in being portrayed as an aid to exploration. As I said earlier, the concept of using it as an aid to exploration was initiated by the Whitlam Government, when it applied world parity pricing to new oil. The Government merely hung its proposal on the coat tails of that proposal. It was cynical of the Government to have explained it in that way. On that layer of cynicism was added another, prior to the last general election, when the Government promised that the impost that we are now considering would be returned to the taxpayers in either benefits by way of the family allowance or reductions of income tax. However, we know from long and sad experience what to expect from the Government, so we ought not to be surprised. At least honourable members, though perhaps not willing to hand the oil companies a windfall profit, such as would result from the defeat of this legislation, might well feel inclined to express their protest at this kind of behaviour by supporting the amendment that the Opposition has moved.

167,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,PARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGE,"Kingsford-Smith) (8.31)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Bill is a very short measure. It relates to a provision which would enable senators from Queensland to be elected in the same way as those from any other State. The interesting aspect of the need for this legislation arises from the Constitution. Section 7 of the Australian Constitution states: But until the Parliament of the Commonwealth otherwise provides, the Parliament of the State of Queensland, if that State be an Original State, into divisions and determining the number of senators to be chosen for each division, and in the absence of such provision the State shall be one electorate. The Parliament of Queensland has done nothing about the matter, nor should it. We are acting in the national Parliament. We want senators elected from each State on the same terms and conditions. This Bill, which has now passed through the Senate without any objections from the Government, states: Senators from the State of Queensland shall be directly chosen by the people of that State voting as one electorate. That is what they do now. It also states: The Parliament of the State of Queensland may not make laws pursuant to section 7 of the Constitution dividing the State into divisons and determining the number of senators to be chosen for each division. Of course, that is obvious. As stated in section 7 of the Constitution, once we in this Parliament provide for the election of senators, there is no room for a State parliament to make any distinction. Perhaps the Bill needs to be looked at to see whether it is accurately drafted. In a nutshell, it should provide as follows: Senators for the State of Queensland shall, notwithstanding any law of Queensland, be chosen at the same time and in the same manner as senators are chosen for each of the other Original States of the Commonwealth of Australia. I think that would be a better wording. I leave it at that. I understand that I am not to delay the House.

169,Dr BLEWETT ,SOCIAL SERVICES LEGISLATION,"Bonython) (8.34)-It gives a degree of pleasure to the Opposition to be able to say that in general the Opposition welcomes most of the amendments provided in the Social Services Legislation Amendment Bill. The obsessive concern of the Government with saving money on social welfare is still apparent even in this Bill but it is not as dominant as it had been in many of the social security Bills presented to this Parliament. Even where the concern with saving money is dominant, in most cases we believe the changes to be justified. may make laws dividing the State Let me just list the changes that are proposed in this legislation. The legislation seeks to improve access to the unemployment benefit for those who have problems, for whatever reason, of submitting their claim forms. The sickness benefit waiting periods are to be waived for those with chronic complaints; that is, the old 13-week limitation will be waived in respect of those people with a recurring incapacity. Family allowances to temporary residents, that is, for the children of diplomats and foreign service personnel, will be denied. Also, the family allowance will be denied to prohibited immigrants. In future specific notification will be required to be made in respect of the handicapped children's allowance if the child moves out of the home. The legislation, as it stands at present, covers a child who moves from an institution to a family or from a family to an institution, but moving from the home has not previously been noted. There are a number of technical amendments in the Bill relating to changing the words 'social vices' to 'social security' and the words 'child endowment' to 'family allowance' throughout the legislation. The Government is just catching up with changes that have been made five or six years ago. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, there is an effort to rationalise the relationship between the compensation payments and sickness benefit payments. In many ways, this has been and will be a continuing problem. Let me briefly inform the House of the Opposition's response to each of those points. Whilst we suspect that some of the changes in relation to access to the unemployment benefit are fairly limited and fairly technical-this might even be described as cosmetic legislation-for a few unemployed they will bring direct benefits, particularly those unemployed people who experience a delay in getting their postal claim into the Department of Social Security. To date, that situation has denied the payment of the unemployment benefit to those people for the period prior to the receipt of their claim. Under this legislation those benefits will be paid from the time the applicants registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service provided, of course, that their claim is made within 14 days of registration. Again the Government has shown a certain generosity. If there are specific reasons for delay the date of payment will refer back to the date on which the applicant registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service. Secondly, the change in respect of sickness benefits is obviously one which we welcome. It is quite unnecessary often for people with chronic illnesses to have to make a series of applications, and having to wait seven days before they can get the benefit. This change means that even outside the l3-week period people may make a claim for the same incapacity or the same illness and not have to wait seven days for payment. We welcome that. We feel the decisions in relation to family allowances-that is to deny family allowances to the children of diplomats and foreign personnelare justified. That is a change which we would support. It is difficult to justify Australian taxpayers' money being directed through family allowances to the children of diplomats and foreign service personnel. The denial of the family allowance to prohibited immigrants is a somewhat more difficult issue. But as the Government has provided that, if they cease to be prohibited immigrants they will receive the family allowance. Also, in a somewhat surprising gesture, no effort will be made to recover family allowance back payments if the prohibited immigrant should besercome a permanent resident. Given these qualifications, the Opposition accepts this provision. Changes are made to the handicapped children's allowance simply to clear up one more technical point. One hopes, however, that the Government, in applying the new rule, will be generous because if we have situations of sickness, illness or other problems in a family there may be some delay in notifying that a handicapped child has moved out of a home. One hopes that the administration will take account of such circumstances. We are disappointed that the Government in pursuing these anomalies did not take up a couple of related points. One of the anomalies is the distinction between payment for unemployment benefit and payment for sickness benefit in relation to people becoming ill. For instance, if an unemployed person is injured or contracts a serious illness, that person is paid only at the unemployment benefit level, although that person may have extra expenses related to the accident or illness. The result is that there is at present a $11.60 a week difference, or $603 a year difference, for a single person over 18 between what he would get if he was on the sickness benefit rate-that is if he was injured or took sick while he was employed-as contrasted with what he receives if he takes sick or is injured while he is unemployed. This is an anomaly in the measure. It seems to us that the claims of the sick person are changed very little whether he is unemployed or not. One would have thought that the Government, in correcting these anomalies, could have provided that where an unemployed person is injured or contracts a serious illness during his period of unemployment, he could be paid at the sickness benefit rate. He would have much the same costs as the person who is sick, ill or injured while at work. It is surprising that the Government has left in the provision that sickness beneficiaries are the only recipients of supplementary assistance who pay tax on that assistance. Sickness beneficiaries too do not receive the same fringe benefits that are available to invalid pensioners. In the process of clearing up these anomalies one would have thought that the Government might have looked at a number of other minor anomalies here which do not involve very much in terms of total expenditure, but which would certainly, for the particular individuals involved, bring real benefits and would make much more sense of the confusion of the social security legislation. The major part of the Bill-in some ways this is the most difficult part-deals with the relationship between compensation payments and sickness benefit payments which I think can best be described as a legislative jungle. The Minister for Transport ( Mr Hunt) referred to this in his second reading speech. The critical section is section 115. The Minister said: Section lIS provides that, if compensation is received for the same incapacity as that which qualifies a person for sickness benefit, and it is paid for the same period in respect of which he is qualified to receive benefit normally payable for that period is reduced by the amount of the relevant part of the compensation. Similarly, sickness benefit may be recovered where the compensation is subsequently paid for the same period for which sickness benefit has been paid. I am sure every honourable member in this House is familiar with the series of problems that arise for constituents as a result of the complications produced by compensation payments and sickness benefit payments and the problems of recovery in relation to that. It must be said that ihis Bill makes some attempt to grapple with what is a peculiarly difficult problem. First of all, the technical facilitation of information about a beneficiary's compensation payment is an improvement on the existing legislation. It will certainly speed up processes because, in many cases, it is the delay in these adjustments which causes many of the problems for individuals. Secondly, there are proposals giving the Director-General power of interception of compensation payments which would otherwise be made to sickness beneficiaries or a former sickness beneficiary. This is certainly a more efficient procedure. Again, it also prevents some of these delays which lead to the accumulation of problems. It is very important however that this interception is not made without the consent of the compensation victim and through guidance by an expert lawyer. Ther are dangers in that provision and they need to be watched. I can see the advantages which will accrue both to the Department and to the beneficiary, but the beneficiary's interests have to be protected. It is important that this action is not taken without the consent of the compensation victim. Thirdly, there is no doubt that the amendments improve the situation as regards dealing with compensation payable under no-fault motor accident schemes. Previously these had been excluded from the compass of the legislation. To include these in the way suggested by these amendments will deal with another gap in the legislation. I refer to the fact that no-fault motor accident victims were not covered by the provisions of section 115. The amendment to permit the Commonwealth Government to recover directly from an insurer reflects similar changes in other social security legislation. This means that the Commonwealth Government can make claims directly against and insurer. Again, in many ways this is a preferable way of doing it, provided correct information is given to the compensation beneficiary. However, I think it is fairly clear that this is a bit like the tax avoidance problem, in that one is piling up increasingly complex legislation to deal sickness benefit, the rate of the with the difficulties in this field. As the Minister himself confesses, section 115 does have a number of shortcomings. There is no doubt that not all of the shortcomings in that very difficult section will be resolved by the provisions contained in this Bill. Perhaps the Minister will clarify a point for me, though I hold out no particular hope of comfort. I refer to the case of John Alan Edwards, which went before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Tribunal found that it was quite unsatisfactory that sub-section (2) of section 115 should be applied by implication. I quote from the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal: That sub-section requires a deliberate and proper decision to be made as to what part of a lump sum (if any) can, in the opinion of the Director-General 'reasonably be regarded' as being a payment of the kind set out in the sub-section. This should appear from the papers and show the basis on which the opinion was formed and the figures used. It does not seem to me that that problem is resolved by the amendments contained in this legislation. In this case the Tribunal found: . . . it would be 'pure speculation to attempt to apportion the amount awarded between the common law claim and workers compensation claim'. The implication there is that the sustenance level income from sickness benefits while the compensation claim is being settled should be earmarked and separated from the compensation for injury. As I understand the legislation, this cannot be done even under the changes it contains. This points towards the fact that perhaps some of these problems can be solved only by introducing a national compensation scheme. If that is too big a task to impose upon the Government, I ask that the previous particular point be given further consideration. However, I think this whole effort to pull together the complex set of compensation provisions with the temporary cover provided by social security sickness benefits does underline an issue which has faced this Parliament and this country for the last decade; that is, the need for comprehensive national compensation legislation in this country. In the amendment which I shall move we stress again our belief that the only solution to the mounting set of difficulties we find in this field will be to introduce national compensation legislation. We would return basically to the principles of the Woodhouse proposals in relation to national compensation: The acceptance that compensation is a community responsibility, a responsibility that members of the community should accept for every person struck down by sickness or injury; that this compensation should provide a comprehensive entitlement, a uniform assessment of compensation, without regard to fault; and that it should have an important stress on rehabilitation. Most of the provisions now do not build in incentives for rehabilitation. We want compensation legislation which will provide incentives for the person to be directed to self-reliant activity through rehabilitation. At the moment our mess of compensation legislation provides no such incentives or encouragement. Finally, it must be real compensation; that is, compensation which is clearly income related. Of course such a scheme, like our health scheme and our various other proposals, would be far more administratively efficient than the kind of complex mass of private provisions that we now face. In the compensation field at the moment, we find a whole series of provisions-some through common law, which usually involves great delays, considerable expense in securing a result, much uncertainty and frequent disappointment-and no emphasis on rehabilitation. Of course, workers compensation is another source but it is not uniform between the States. It excludes the selfemployed and it excludes non-work related incidents. Social Security payments are trying to prop up these cumbersome and complex provisions. Of course, the social security sickness benefit payments, and in some cases invalid pension payments, are made only to those who can meet the means test. They do not provide compensation re. lated to the losses incurred. Mr Donald Cameron-Have you costed this?",89
170,Dr BLEWETT,SOCIAL SERVICES LEGISLATION,"I am suggesting that both the Government and the Opposition should be considering national compensation as an alternative to the present system. I have little doubt that in the long run the cost to the community, as distinct from the cost to sections of the community, would be cheaper than the present cumbersome mass. Mr Donald Cameron'--- That is what Bill Hayden said in 1974 when he introduced Medibank and we have been crippled ever since.",92
171,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,SOCIAL SERVICES LEGISLATION,Mr Millar)Order! The honourable member for Fadden will remain siient.,92
172,Dr BLEWETT ,SOCIAL SERVICES LEGISLATION,"I should like to comment on the latest interjection made by the honourable member for Fadden. If he looks at the Budget statements in relation to the 1975-76 Medibank plan he will find that it came in under the budget. I suggest that he stop peddling the kinds of myths all which he finds useful for political purposes and go back to look at the figures which will show that the costs of Medibank, as budgeted in 1975, came through in the 1975-76 period under the budget. I turn now to another weakness of this measure. There is another major problem in the social security field to which we believe this legislation could have rightly given attention. I refer to the disadvantages suffered by families with one or two children compared with families of three or more children as a result of the latest change in family allowances which was made in the last Budget. No doubt the Opposition will meet the response: Can we afford to remove this disadvantage which is faced by smaller families? I think the question we should all be facing is: Can we afford not to change this system which does impose disadvantages on families with less than three children compared with the somewhat improved status of families with three or more children? Look at the situation of pensioner families. I refer to single parent families, the poorer families in the community. Pensioner families which have income only from the pension are all below Professor Henderson's rather austere poverty line if they have one or two dependent children. The single parent families with no other income are well below the poverty line. Let me give some examples of the situation at the moment. A single parent pensioner with two children is $19.45c a week below that austere poverty line. The family of an umemployed breadwinner with two children is $12.40 below the poverty line. The source of the hardship that has developed in relation to family allowances is that family allowances for those who have fewer than three children have been frozen since 1976. Since then there has been a 70 per cent increase in inflation. Therefore, the value of the allowance for those families has been cut by more than half. The changes the Government made in the last Budget were made irrespective of the incomes of different families. In 1981, the Treasurer ( Mr Howard) stated: Prior to the last election the Government stated that any significant increase in oil revenue in \980-81We have heard something about that tonightover the Budget estimate would be returned to Australian families. But what happened as a result of the decisions then made in the Budget was that the benefit was returned to only some Australian families-to those with three or more children. Yet if we look at Australian families right across the income board we find that 76 per cent have fewer than three children. That is, three quarters of Australian families did not get any benefit from the family allowance changes out of this increased revenue. Even more important, the percentage is higher for pensioner families. The proportion of such families with fewer than two children is above that average figure of 76 per cent. So we say .to the Government, when it is contemplating major changes in the Budget, that one of the most obvious ways in which one can do something to help Australian families is to introduce an extension of the family allowance provisions covering families with one child and two children, and to index those allowances to cope with inflation. As I said at the beginning, we agree with and accept most of the amendments that have been made to the Bill. We see the compensation amendments as efforts to improve a basically unsatisfactory system which ultimately will have to be dealt with generally by moving towards national compensation legislation, which is familiar in many countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. This seems to be the ultimate way out of the kind of problems with which the Bill has tried to deal. To some of them, it has provided some satisfactory answers; I do not believe that some others will work. Indeed, the great complexity of compensation and social security payments mounts. That is a major consideration. The second major reservation is that we believe that there is a major task in front of the Government in relation to family allowances in that it is necessary to move in the direction of extending the August 1981 benefit to all families, to those three-quarters of the families in Australia who have missed out on the changes made in the last Budget. One recognises the financial constraints in these situations. It may be that a government would have to look at income testing in relation to this matter. But certainly at present poor families with one or two children have suffered severely from the failure to index family allowances since 1976. There has been no change for them. We direct the Government's attention to these issues by moving the following amendment: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view tuting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, House is of the opinion that the Government should(I) increase family allowances for first and second children, thus removing the disadvantage affecting most Australian families with children, and (2) provide a system of ate the excessive costs, delays and uncertainty which exists in the present system'.",92
173,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,SOCIAL SERVICES LEGISLATION,Mr Millar)-Is the amendment seconded?,93
174,Mr SCOTT ,SOCIAL SERVICES LEGISLATION,"Hindmarsh) (8.58)-1 second the amendment. I want briefly to deal with a couple of aspects of the Social Services Legislation Amendment Bill. No doubt many honourable members on both sides of the House have had brought to their attention problems involving the Department of Social Security making claims on either sickness benefit payments or alleged overpayments. A particular case with which I wish to deal highlights the degree of the problem. It is a case that has not been resolved at all satisfactorily for the constituentconcerned. It involved a typical car accident and long litigation. For a long period my constituent was unable to continue with work and had to resort to sickness benefit payments. In the final wash-up with the case coming before the court, settlement was made on the basis of a sum that would be paid to the constituent for the injury, along with two other sums-one being for legal costs, and the other being an amount to cover the repayment of sickness benefit. The calculations were made to ascertain the amount that would be paid to my constituent. The sums of money involved were quite considerable. The solicitors for my constituent and for the other party ascertained what the sums were, including legal costs. They ran into several thousand dollars. They had previously agreed on a fixed amount that would be available to the constituent. They then endeavoured to find out from the Department of Social Security the amount of repayment that was due on sickness benefit payments made over the period the constituent had been waiting for the case to be finalised in court. The system that operates, certainly in South Australia and possibly in other States, must be a very loose system because the sum that was due for repayment was conveyed by way of a telephone call. The solicitors were given a figure of $2,045 as being the amount of repayment. Settlement was made on the basis of three factors: The amount to cover compensation for the degree of injury; the amount to cover legal costs; and the amount of repayment due to the Department of to substi- Social Security. A week later the Department contacted the solicitors and advised that it had the given a wrong figure and that the figure was not $2,045 but in fact $7,849. The Department did this in such a way that it made contact with the solicitor who was drawing up the documents and national compensation to eliminsaid that its costs had to be repaid. In effect, my constituent was short some $5,000 because the Department made a mistake I have here a letter from the Department. The Department does not even say that it is sorry. The letter states that the legal opinion provided to the Department indicated that where money had been paid by the person liable to pay compensation there was no discretion to repay the money. Clearly the Department in its correspondence has acknowledged its error. It is rather tough on the constituent to say the least. The letter could hardly be classed as an apology. A number of areas in the Social Services Act have required some rethinking to remove these types of anomalies. We know from other fields connected with the Act that there is another side to the Department. I would not be alone in having had drawn to my attention the problems of constituents who have been attacked by the Department for alleged overpayments. I have referred to this matter before in other speeches. I just want to illustrate the difference in attitude in the Department. It appears that when the Department has made an error which costs a constituent some $5,000 there is not even a letter of apology saying 'sorry'. But in the case of a pensioner who was alleged to have been overpaid an invalid pension to the extent of $4,940 it was a matter of 'pay up or else'. That person is well on in years and will never be able to repay that debt. Again I would say that the fault lay within the Department. Another case that has crossed my desk deals with a supporting mother. It is alleged an overpayment of some $3,322 was made. Again a very terse letter was sent from the Department stating that it would be in that person's interests to start repayments immediately. We see that the Department is careful of the public purse when it comes to recovering moneys from people who can ill afford to pay. But when it, in an incompetent way, has deprived a constituent of some $5,000 due to its error one barely gets an apology. Mr Milton-It happens in the case of deceased pensioners too.",93
175,Mr SCOTT,SOCIAL SERVICES LEGISLATION,"I have no doubt, as the honourable member for La Trobe says, that there are many cases. So it is with some degree of satisfaction that we see the Government coming to grips with the proposition. But as the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) said, it is going nowhere near far enough to deal with the problems that everyone on both sides of the House, as I said earlier, has to cope with. These are human problems. Very often they involve people on the lowest incomes, such as age pensioners, the sick and the invalid. So I hope that the Government will take heed of the proposition that we move in the form of an amendment and will act to eliminate these kinds of hardships.",94
176,Mr HODGES ,SOCIAL SERVICES LEGISLATION,"Petrie) (9.7)-Whilst rejecting the amendment, I find it refreshing that the Opposition is agreeing with the social services legislation that is before the Parliament. It is nice that we can occasionally have a bipartisan approach to some issues. The Social Services Legislation Amendment Bill has four main provisions. I want to address my remarks to two of those in particular, the one dealing with family allowances and another that concerns the payment of sickness benefits. Before I speak specifically to the provisions of the Bill concerning family allowances I want, first of all, for the benefit of the House, to go through some of the provisions of the family allowance. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the payment of a family allowance, which was an initiative of this Government in 1976, has been a great boon to families in this country. The family allowance is payable to people with children under 16 years of age or dependent children between the ages of 16 and 25 in full time education and, of course not in employment. In the main the allowance is paid to mothers. Of course parents receiving the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowance are not eligible for the family allowance; nor are students who are invalid pensioners. The family allowance is not taxable and it is not paid on behalf of children outside Australia, unless they are temporarily abroad or living abroad pending migration. The honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) made the point that the family allowance had not been increased for one or two children since 1976, and that is correct. But one of the difficulties that any government faces and that oppositions do not have to face is that there are always calls for tax cuts. We hear those calls in the community today. People frequently call on the Government to effect tax cuts. On the other hand, an increasing number of people want expenditure increased. That is exactly what the honourable member for Bonython proposes. It is very difficult to effect both expenditure increases and a reduction in the level of revenue through tax cuts. The current Budget increased by 50 per cent the family allowance for the third and subsequent children. The payment for a child in an institution increased from $21.70 to $39 a month. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard two tables from Budget Paper No. I of the 1981-82 Budget. Leave granted. The tables read asfollowsNA First child Second child 21.70 Third child 26.00 30 June 1981 . . . . . . . . . . . 1982 (estimate) . . . . . . . (a) At 30 June 1981 there were 660 students. Source: Department of Social Security.",94
177,Mr HODGES,RA TES OF FAMILY ALLOWANCE,"The estimated number of children to attract the family allowance under the current Budget is 4,236,000. The House ought to bear that figure in mind because this is a universal benefit. With the burgeoning social welfare bill many people believe that the family allowance should be paid only to the needy, or perhaps directed more specifically to the needy or lower income people. It is a benefit available to the poor, the not so poor, the comfortably off, the wealthy and the very wealthy. It is available to parents of dependants right across the spectrum. Frequently we hear the question: Should the family allowance be taxed? It may well be that this benefit should be paid to all, as at present, but that it should be taxed or perhaps means tested. Having given that background to the family allowance, I move specifically to the legislation which will exclude payment of the family allowance in respect of the children of diplomats, consuls and staffs of embassies and also overseas personnel who are not attached to the Australian forces. One may express surprise that people in such positions would see fit to claim this benefit while in our country. As we know, many of these people are here for up to three or four years, and the benefit is payable after they have been resident in this country for 12 months. The people I referred to, such as the diplomats and the consuls, are not contributing directly to taxation. They may pay some indirect tax but certainly they do not make a direct contribution. Yet, I understand many of them have made application and indeed have received the family allowance. Also, it will $amonth $amonth Present Rates from Present Rates from Rates January 1982 Rates January 1982 Fourth child 26.00 39'.00 15.20 15.20 Fifth and Later Children 30.35 45.55 21.70 Child in an institution 21.70 39.00 39.00 Children in families Total Full-time Children Per cent students in Insti- change aged 16 tutions over Under to 24 including previous 16 years years Total students (a) Number year '000 '000 '000 '000 '000 . . . . 3938 279 4217 10 4227 +0.1 . . . . 3950 275 4225 10 4236 +0.2 not be paid to parents who are prohibited immigrants. I point out to the honourable member for Bonython that the family allowance will amount to a little over $1 billion this financial year, with a total welfare budget of $11.4 billion. I wish to deal next with the sickness benefit because this particular reform in the legislation I believe will considerably help chronic illness sufferers. At present the sickness benefit is paid seven days after the applicant becomes incapacitated for work provided a claim is lodged by the applicant within 13 weeks from the day of incapacity. The amendment contained in clause 41 (b) of the Bill provides that the Director General will take into consideration an illness for which previous incapacity has been established and sickness benefit paid and will authorise immediate recommencement of the sickness benefit; that is, the seven-day waiting period will not apply and the benefit will be paid immediately if the incapacity recurs. This amendment will benefit people with chronic illnesses who suffer from recurrences making them incapable of working. Many of these people exhaust their sick leave entitlements and then, because of the seven-day waiting period, have difficulty in meeting financial commitments. This amendment will remove a real fear for chronic illness sufferers, most of whom have no desire to be employed intermittently but who are forced to take such employment because of their chronic health condition. I now turn to a particular service that I believe ought to be instituted be the Department of Social Security. I believe that the lack of an adequate counselling service within the Department is causing a good deal of hardship to people, many of whom, because they are unemployed, invalids, ill, handicapped or widowed find it very difficult to fend for themselves. Because of the position in which they are placed they perhaps find it difficult to negotiate. Perhaps because of age, or because they are widows who have been very dependent upon their husbands to look after their business affairs, they are at a disadvantage. The handicapped and the ill also often find it difficult to in application forms or to ascertain what are their entitlements. Although the Department of Social Security in many offices, particularly the regional offices, does a fine job, it is not possible, given present pressures, to provide the kind of counselling service that I believe to be necessary. Most of the unfortunate people to whom I have referred rely for advice upon their member of parliament, bank manager, accountant, solicitor, friend or relative. It has been my experience - no doubt other members from either side of the House will have had similar situations arise-that in the last two or three years many pensioners, in particular, have been poorly advised by bank managers or the representatives of lending institutions. Many have non-interest bearing or low interest bearing bank accounts. Thus, they are not receiving the maximum safe return possible upon the money that they have available or invested. They are depriving themselves of a better standard of living-often in an attempt to gain a pensioner health benefit card or perhaps a full rate pension. In fact, through gaining higher income as a result of a better investment they could be receiving more 'other income' and leading a better life. I believe that if such a counselling service were set up many of these people would find that their 'other income' would increase and their lifestyle would improve. On the one hand, the deriving of benefits in this way is all important but, on the other hand, benefits will also be derived by the Government through a reduction in expenditure. It may well be that the savings effected in the payment of pensions alone, as a result of the better investment of pensioners' capital, would more than fund the proposal, and the extra staff involved in this counselling service. I wish to take up a point that the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) made in regard to Medibank. He stated that it was under budget. I can only say that that proves very little. Indeed, one might question the accuracy of the budgeting that took place in the period 1974-75. I hope that we will never see a return to the openended system of Medibank that we witnessed in the years 1972 to 1975. I commend the Bill and reject the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bonython.",95
178,Mr LEO MCLEAY ,RA TES OF FAMILY ALLOWANCE,"Grayndler) (9.19)Although the Opposition does not oppose the Bill generally, it commends to the House most particularly the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett). I believe that it adds substance to an otherwise pedestrian measure. I am concerned that the Bill fill reflects no real consideration of the plight of either the chronically ill or the chronically unemployed. The amendments proposed by the Government in the form of this legislation, do nothing to change the relative poverty of a great number of Australians. It is but another example of band-aid legislation, one which highlights the total inadequacy of the Government's social security policy. The first amendment, indeed, is related to the change in the title of the Director-General-a simple matter which raises some interesting thoughts in this context. Judging by the complaints that I have received in my electorate office about delays, lost forms, cheques that have gone astray, et cetera, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) is quite correct in dropping the word 'Services' from the title of the Director General of the Department. However, the word 'Security', which replaces the word 'Services', deserves some comment. I am forced to ask the question: Security for whom? How secure can one feel when a Government that talks about 5 per cent tax cuts as a solution to our economic problems brings in legislation such as this? When we talk about a social security amendment Bill it is important for the House to remember that a 5 per cent tax cut means that the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) will get about an extra $55 a week in his pay packet; an ordinary back bench member of this House will get approximately $11 a week extra in his pay packet; and an adult shop assistant will get only $2 a week extra in his pay packet. The unemployed, the sick, the supporting parent and the age pensioner will get nothing. The poor do not earn enough to pay tax, so tax cuts do not help them one iota. The clamour for tax cuts, I believe, will further deflect politicians in the community from grappling with the fundamental problem of relative inequality in this country. The Government can finance such tax cuts only by reductions in social security and welfare spending. Where then lies security for the Department's clients? In this House and in the community we are continually treated to a barrage of propaganda that suggests that the welfare bill in Australia is getting out of control. This is a blatant lie. It is an attempt by the Government to create an atmosphere that will allow it to attack those elements of our society which are the least powerful-the aged, the sick, the unemployed and the low income families. The Government is well aware that spending on social security and welfare as a percentage of the total Budget was approximately the same this financial year as it was in 1977-78. In fact, on a per capita basis there has been a reduction in the value of these payments when one takes into account, the increased number of unemployed, aged, and supporting parents since the 1977-78 financial year. The age pension has not kept pace with inflation. Lone parents and low income families have fallen further below the poverty line, a poverty line that even this miserable Government accepts. Spiralling interest rates have taken the cost of housing beyond the reach of ordinary families. The cost of rental accommodation has skyrocketed. In this sort of climate the Government's response has been to reduce funds for welfare housing. Pensioners receive a maximum of $8 a week in a rent allowance, which will not even buy a day's accommodation in Sydney. Low income families receive no rent assistance whatsoever from this Government. A survey of real estate agents in my electorate in Sydney indicates that the rent for a two-bedroom house or flat is in excess of $80 a week. The Government has reacted to this crisis by allegedly providing subsidies to home buyers. People who attempt to get those subsidies find, as some of my constituents have been told by bank managers, that it is a confidence trick and that the money is not there. That is because the Government is providing assistance to those with money-those who wish to purchase homes; those who have some assets. While that is commendable, at the same time the Government provides no assistance at all to families with no assets and those who are required to pay rent. All of these so-called social security programs provided by this Government are really social insecurity programs. They do nothing to change the relative positions of the poor and the depressed. Further band-aid policies proposed by the Government allow the Government and other people in the community to feel warm inside while it continues to provide low benefits to those who are in distress in Australia. Universal systems, such as this family allowance and other allowances which are talked about in this legislation, while being administratively cheap, are socially very expensive. The Government pursues the poor in my electorate when it has overpaid them some benefit. In this legislation the Government admits that benefits have been paid to those who should not have been entitled to those payments. The Government has made no attempt whatsoever to recover this money. Family allowances have been payable since 1976. I find it amazing and positively scandalous that it has taken the Department of Social Security six years to realise that it was sending benefit cheques to the wives of diplomats in Yarralumla and Red Hill. One is appalled at the morality of those diplomats, consuls and military personnel of foreign governments who have had the gall to exploit this loophole in the law. Rather than cover up this sordid affair the Minister should be naming those persons and those foreign governments responsible. It should make it clear that the responsibility for looking after those people rests with their governments; these people should not be a burden upon the Australian taxpayer. It is bad enough that family allowances have declined in real value by nearly 25 per cent since 1976 without the recipients of family allowances having to bear the burden for children of highly paid foreign diplomatic staff. This legislation deals with the payment of sickness benefits. I will put to the Parliament the rather iniquitous position that people who deal with the Department of Social Security find themselves in nowadays. It is very nice for the Government to be able to reduce some of the waiting time for those persons who apply for sickness benefit. However the staff cuts and staff ceilings in the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service have turned dealing with those departments into a bureaucratic nightmare. The physical separation of the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Department of Social Security in two offices in my electorate makes for an absurd circumstance. People have to lodge their claim in one office, then run down the street and deal with some other office further away. Some time ago both those offices were situated on adjacent floors. But because this Government felt it was paying too much rent in the premises in Marrickville it moved the office. That places many migrants and old people in a rather invidious position. We have the ludicrous circumstance where the Department 'of Social Security has its offices on the second floor of a building that has no lift. One might think that that could be a cruel trick by the Government to prevent frail, aged and disabled people from being able to go up to that floor to register. It most certainly makes a mockery of the programs the Government was talking about in the International Year of Disabled Persons when it moves the Department of Social Security office in Marrickville from ground floor premises to second floor premises. People in wheelchairs were not very impressed by that. They are even less impressed by the fact that when they are in a queue and need to go to the conveniences they have to go down two floors and lose their position in the queue. The Government has absolutely no concern for the clients of the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service. The staff in those Government departments are being stretched to intolerable limits. I must say that I was pleased to hear the honourable member for Petrie ( Mr Hodges) earlier this evening suggest that more counselling should be provided for people who apply for benefits from the Department. It is unfortunate that the Government has not been willing to take up his suggestion. My electorate has a very high proportion of people on these benefits and the highest proportion of people in this country who were not born in Australia. I find that they have vast difficulty dealing with the Department. There is a lack of counselling services and a great lack of services from people who can speak a second language. When one deals with the great array of people, particularly in the Marrickville and Campsie offices of the Department of Social Security, absolutely absurd that over half the people who work in those offices cannot speak another language. It is also very distressing that the partment has moved away from the policy it had under the Labor Government of having senior people working on the counters in those departments. For instance, the Government should consider what is done in California where all people who work in service departments in that State's government, be they from the director down, are required to spend some time each month on the counter. That allows the administrative staff to realise the vast problems that confront the people who are attempting to deal with these departments. Once again, the lack of services provided to people in those areas is indicative of this Government's approach and attack on those persons in the community in Australia who are the least powerful. This legislation deals with workers compensation settlements. The Government has put forward a number of ways in which it believes it can deal with the overpayment of special benefit and sickness benefit to people who ultimately receive a lump sum workers compensation payment. Once again, the need for counselling is most important; once again, no counselling is provided whatsoever. Bureaucratic conditions in this area lead to great misunderstanding when workers compensation payments are made. Many people settle out of court for amounts which they do not realise will be required to be reduced by the recovery of the sickness benefit payments, which in some cases amount to thousands of dollars. The Department should be providing information and counselling to people who apply for the sickness benefit and indicate that they are pursuing a workers compensation claim. I had one case recently in my electorate where the Department of Social Security and the insurer could not come to an agreement about how much was to be recovered. Payment of the sickness benefit was discontinued to the person involved because of the supposed settlement. But the insurer, the person who had insured the individual's employer, refused to commence compensation payments until the matter was settled. It took 10 weeks to sort out this matter because of a series of bungles on the part of the Department and the insurer. In the meantime a man, his wife and four in children were without income for 10 weeks. Where does his security lie in Australia? Where does he find the money to meet his commitments-his rent, food and clothing for his children-in that 10 weeks? This situation was caused mainly because of a lack of staff in the Deit is partment to follow up these matters. The Government also refers in this legislation to the recovery of special benefit payments. That De- brings forward the vexed question of maintenance guarantees in respect of new migrants to Australia. The legislation refers to the right of the Director-General to waive recovery of certain payments and over-payments. This brings to the attention of the Parliament a perennial problem which arises in electorates such as mine-the interdepartmental hot potato involved with maintenance guarantees and special benefit payments. At present there appears to be a hiatus between the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Afairs and the Department of Social Security regarding the cancellation of maintenance guarantees and the subsequent recovery of special benefits from some people who, in the opinion of the Department, were inadvertently paid special benefits. Wide discretion is needed by the Director-General and other delegates in the Department in these recovery cases. The Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) seemed to exercise a much wider amount of charity and consideration in dealing with this discretion when she was the Minister for Social Security. She seemed to exercise a lot more compensation than does the present Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney). I know that the present Minister is a compassionate person. Unfortunately, it seems that Government crackdowns have caused him to take a much stronger line. This has caused great hardship to many people in Australia, and in particular many people in my electorate. A speedy resolution of this interdepartmental wrangle in which the only loser is the beneficiary-those people without assets-is most necessary. Finally, I would like to talk about that most frustrating of all areas of the Social Security Department, the social security appeals system. The social security appeals system is beginning to resemble the chancery system described with such eloquence by Charles Dickens in Bleak House. The system was designed, I believe, to provide redress by self advocacy to those who believe themselves mistreated or misdealt with by the Department of Social Security. They find themselves nowadays in a labyrinth of legal and bureaucratic entanglements when they attempt to use this system. Involvement in the appeals system is a daunting exprience for people who are least able to sustain it. First there is the departmental appeal procedure, then there are delays of about six months in Sydney before a case comes up for hearing before the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. If after this period the appeal before the Tribunal is successful it can be overturned by the Department often after a further delay of up to six months. Those people who genuinely go before the Appeals Tribunal believing that if they are successful their benefit will be returned to them find that the Director-General can refuse to return that benefit. I have seen the effect of this cedure on whole families as, one by one, they succumb to the stress of insufficient income and uncertainty about their future. If at the beginning of the procedure incapacity was not 85 per cent, most certainly by the end of the whole process the family members have been reduced to less than 85 per cent capacity and then they are required to start once again. They are then required to make an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which is the final redress and requires legal representation. To people who in the main have been bankrupted by these other inordinate delays in the Department, the whole appeals system is burdensome and expensive. It does nothing for the security of the Department's clients. In my opinion the whole system of social security in Australia perpetuates social inequality rather than assisting people who are in the most need in our society. I commend to the House the Oppositions proposed amendment in the hope that they will provide at least some small way of overcoming some of the problems that the social security system has run into under the control of the present Government. Amendment negatived. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Hunt) read a third time. PARLIAMENTARY CHEF: POSSIBLE NA",96
179,Mr SPEAKER,RESIGNATION,"I wish to make a short statement to the House. My attention has been drawn to statements made by Senators Missen and Elstob in another place on 25 March and a report of their comments in the Sydney Sun newspaper of 16 April which were very critical of the standard of food preparation and meal services provided in this Parliament. As a result of the criticism which adversely reflects on his professional capacity the executive chef, Mr James Nicol, has submitted his resignation. I do not believe that the comments made by Senators Missen and Elstob reflect the general opinion of members of this House. I desire to place on record that Mr President and I do not share the views expressed by Senators Missen and Elstob and hold the professional capacity of the executive chef and the management of the Parliamentary Refreshment proRooms in high regard. I could not put in better words those used by the President earlier tonight in the Senate. He stated: I can only say that I regard it as a most unfortunate set of circumstances that his resignation is being considered, because I have felt that he has done an extremely good job as chef in this place and that there was a remarkable and dramatic change for the better when he took over his position. I regret very much that he has been forced into the position of even considering his resignation. Whether the gentleman will pursue his resignation I do not know but I feel it is important that he be informed that in fact the standard of the preparation of meals and service has been much improved over the last few years. Honourable membersHear, hear!",99
180,Mr CARLTON ,RESIGNATION,Mackellar)-by leave-I think I speak for all members of the House when I say that members of the House of Representatives regret very sincerely the remarks made by our colleagues in the Senate. I think all of us would agree that the executive chef has performed in an exemplary fashion and that the meals provided in the Parliamentary Refreshment Rooms are of an extraordinarily high standard. We hope that the executive chef reconsiders his resignation.,99
181,Mr SPENDER ,RESIGNATION,"North Sydney)-by leave-I must confess it is a very curious thing that upon the worse possible of bases there is apparently some agreement between the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal Party upon a matter upon which they are both obviously in error. I do not know what brought about the expressed view by Senator Missen and his colleague Senator Elstob in the other place. Perhaps they have been going around the Tour d'Argent and other places in France. But given the circumstances under which the staff work here, the very reasonable prices that we pay and the hours worked and other inconveniences, I hope, as do other members of this House, that the chef will reconsider his position and accept that both sides of the House think that the food is good, wholesome, adequate, reasonably priced and well served. I do not know about those senators; perhaps they could pay another $25 or $30 per meal to eat elsewhere.",100
182,Mr LES JOHNSON ,RESIGNATION,"Hughes) - by leave-My view is that if one set out to contrive a way of de-dignifying the Parliament, this would be the best way of going about it. It seems to me that people are entitled to their view. Whatever view individuals have on this matter, it does not have to be dignified in the way that we have seen occurrences develop here this evening. We do have a Joint House Committee. We have proper processes for investigating matters such as this and I think it is appropriate that the Parliament should get on with its more important business.",100
183,Mr CHARLES JONES ,RESIGNATION,"Newcastle)-by leave-I join very briefly in what the honourable member for Hughes ( Mr Les Johnson) has said. I think this matter should have been dealt with through the Joint House Committee. May I say that I appreciate the service that is rendered in the members' dining room. I think the ladies who wait at the tables go out of their way to try to make the life of a member here that little bit more tolerable. They have to put up with everyone for three days a week. I think the staff do an excellent job. On the improvement in the meals over the last 12 months or so, I think someone in the establishment has really gone out of his or her way to try to make dining more attractive and to meet the requirements of members. Of course there are some members who would never be satisfied with whatever they got. But I think the dining room is run on a much better level now than it was in previous years. I repeat, the service of the staff is excellent. People who come here for breakfast would not get better service or food anywhere. AUSTRALIAN MEAT AND LIVE-STOCK CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 1982 Bill presented by Mr Nixon, for Mr Sinclair, and read a first time. Second Reading",100
184,Mr NIXON ,RESIGNATION,"Gippsland-Minister for Primary Industry) (9.45)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to provide for amendments to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act 1977 to strengthen the Corporation's control over Australia's export meat trade. The Bill will also enable the Corporation, in certain circumstances, to adopt the role of a sole trader or to limit the number of licensees that may trade with particular overseas markets. Honourable members will recall that last year penalties for the contravention of licence conditions were significantly increased. In this Bill further penalties have been included and other existing penalties raised to realistic levels. Uppermost in my mind in proposing these amendments to the Act is the need to maintain and uphold the rep.utation and integrity of our meat export industry. Recent events, especially cases of meat substitution and some incidents involving complaints about the quality of Australian meat, have highlighted the need for the changes. If Australia is to remain competitive on world meat and livestock markets, it is absolutely vital that our industry meets the requirements of overseas buyers. Our product must conform precisely to contract specifications. It must be labelled properly and be free from contamination. This Bill seeks to achieve these objectives by extending the powers of the AMLC so that it is properly equipped to carry out its major functionsthe protection, development and promotion of our overseas meat trade. The changes contained in this Bill have been recommended by the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation, which represents the producing, processing and exporting sectors of the meat and livestock industry, and have also been sought actively by producer organisations. The vast majority of Australian meat processors and exporters are beyond reproach in their business dealings. However there is a small minority which has engaged in unacceptable practices and, in the process, has brought the reputation of our industry into question. This legislation is designed to ensure that this minority can no longer bring the industry into disrepute. I hope it will also serve to remind all exporters of the responsibilities they have to the industry as a whole. Separate legislation-the Export Control Bill-has already been introduced to cover matters associated with the preparation, grading and trade description of exports of food for human consumption. That legislation, and its regulations concerning the preparation of meat for export, will complement the provisions proposed in this Bill. The main instrument available to the Corporation in controlling exports is the export licence. All existing licences will be withdrawn when the Bill is proclaimed. People, including existing licensees, seeking a licence to export meat or livestock will have to apply to the Corporation and will have to meet the new criteria set out in the Bill. The objective is to ensure that only people of integrity, competence and sound financial standing are in possession of export licences. Following the meat substitution issue last year I received requests from the industry that people and firms preparing meat for export should be licensed by the Corporation. The industry's concern arose because of limitations in the Act which prevented the AMLC from taking action against the packer in cases where the packer did not export himself but sold to a licensee who bought sight unseen. Under the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act the offending party was the exporter. However, an examination of their proposal has shown up some practical difficulties in implementing such an arrangement in the AMLC's legislation. An alternative aproach has therefore been adopted. The Export Section Nature of offence Section 16c Not advising AMLC of changes to details in application for licence after it is submitted. Section 478 Obstructing authorised officers. Section47c Persons to assist authorised officers Section 47E Failure to return identity card. Section 47G Provide information or documents. Section 50 Exporting without a licence or in contravention of licence condition. Section 50A Providing false information. Control Bill requires all premises in which meat is prepared for export to be registered by the Department of Primary Industry. Under that Bill regulations may be made which will require the holder of the registration to be a fit and proper person. The criteria for a fit and proper person under that Bill will be similar to those which must be met by an applicant for a licence under this Bill. This Bill will enable the Corporation to ensure that meat and livestock for export are prepared in accordance with the buyer, quality and other specifications. Under the Export Control Bill the packer of meat will be required to conform to conditions concerning the health of the product, its grading and trade descriptions. The provisions contained in each Bill will complement each other and ensure that neither the packer nor the exporter will be able to escape his responsibilities in regard to the preparation of the meat or in meeting buyer specifications. The linking of the two Bills will enable the Department of Primary Industry and the AMLC to co-operate to ensure adequate control of all matters from the preparation to the export of the meat. The Bill also clarifies the powers of the AMLC to suspend or cancel a licence and strengthens the Corporation's powers to obtain the information needed to assess whether the licensee is conforming to the conditions of his licence. The Bill before the House provides appropriate penalties for breaches of the export control provisions. These penalties are consistent with those in the Export Control Bill. There is a range of penalties involved which are summarised as follows: NA Penalty provisions in Existing Act Bill None $2,000 or imprisonment for 12 months or both. None $1,000 or imprisonment for 6 months or both. None $1,000 or imprisonment for 6 months or both. None $100 $500 $2,000 or imprisonment for 12 months or both. None for exporting without a li- $100,000 or imprisonment for 5 cence. For exporting in breach of years or both on indictment or licence conditions $100,000 or $5,000 or 12 months or both on imprisonment for 5 years or both summary conviction. on indictment or $5,000 or 12 months or both on summary conviction. None $2,000 or imprisonment for 12 months or both. Section Nature of offence Section 50B Falsely hold out to be licensee or None able to arrange shipping. Section 52 Offence against Regulations. A further major amendment proposed in this Bill is to give the AMLC power to engage in sole trading subject to the approval of the Minister. On several occasions recently private exporters and ultimately producers have been disadvantaged in dealing with countries with single purchasing authorities. The monopoly power of these single buying organisations can be used to distort the operations of the market place and in some circumstances can have a depressing effect on prices received by exporters and producers. As an example of the problems that can occur, late last year a licensee tendered to a single import agency at 11-13 cents per kilogram below the then current equivalent United States price at which other licensees quoted. The licensee was awarded approximately 80 per cent of the tender, even though at the time of his offer he had no firm contracts for supply of beef from Australian meat processors. About the time the licensee sought supplies of beef livestock prices fell. This is one example of practices which have led the Corporation and producers to request that the AMLC be empowered to sole trade or restrict the number of licensees that may quote to a market. To implement the industry's request the Bill permits the AMLC to be the sole trader or restrict the number of licensees where there is a single buyer which controls all or substantially all of the imports into a country and where there is a need to ensure a fair return to producers. The Corporation's existing trading powers allow it to trade but do not permit it to exclude licensees from quoting or selling to the same market. Under these current provisions the Corporation could find itself in competition with private Australian exporters unless they voluntarily withdrew from the market or unless the foreign buyer chose to deal only with the Corporation. The proposal for the Corporation to limit the number of licensees who may export to a particular market is simply another means of offsetting the monopoly power available to some buyers. Other Australian licensees or meat processors will be able to supply meat to the licensee or licensees trading with the market concerned. However, once the arrangement is implemented only the designated licensee or licensees will be permitted to export to the market. Penalty provisions in Existing Act Bill $5,000 or imprisonment for 12 months. $500 $1,000 I want to emphasise that the exercise of these new trading powers by the Corporation will be limited to circumstances where it is confronted by a monopoly buyer which the Corporation judges is distorting normal market forces, and the use of the power will be subject to ministerial approval. The current system of meat trading, based on free market principles and involving some 260 private operators licensed to export meat and livestock, operates reasonably well in normal trading circumstances. However, logic and common sense demand that we do not let a situation continue where the Australian industry, both producers and exporters, could sustain losses in the face of the market-distorting effects of sole buying authorities. The Bill proposes that the AMLC be given the power to engage in futures trading for livestock or meat, subject to ministerial approval. Futures trading is a normal commercial technique which should be available to the Corporation if it decides to trade. The intention is to enable the AMLC to hedge price risks through trading on Australian or overseas futures markets. The power has been made subject to ministerial approval in order to ensure that the approach the Corporation takes, if and when it decides to use the futures market, is consistent with its position as a statutory authority. In my statement to the Parliament on 8 September 1981 on the meat substitution issue I clearly stated the Government's resolve to close loopholes which had enabled such fraudulent activities to occur and to implement a system which would ensure that the reputation of the Australian meat and livestock industry was restored to the high level it had previously enjoyed. The amendments proposed in this Bill and the associated Export Control Bill are clear evidence of the Government's determination in this regard. I commend the Bill to the honourable members. Debate (on motion by Dr Blewett) adjourned. INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL 1982 Bill presented by Mr Fife, and read a first time. Second Reading",100
185,Mr FIFE ,PENALTY PROVISIONS,"Farrer-Minister for Education) (9.55)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Insurance Act 1973 to strengthen the minimum requirements to be met by insurance companies authorised under the Act and to effect a number of other improvements associated with the existing supervisory machinery. The need for a strengthening and streamlining of the Act has been argued by the Insurance Commissioner for some time. This view is now generally accepted in the insurance industry, and the amendments incorporated in the Bill have been developed after a process of detailed consultation with the industry. The Government has taken note of the general approach of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System to the regulation of general insurers; namely, that the purpose of regulation should be to provide a degree of consumer protection without seeking to preclude failure of any particular company. The Government broadly endorses that approach. In considering the supervision of the insurance industry it was, accordingly, necessary to strike a balance between the need for some degree of enhanced prudential control and the objective of minimising government regulation of the industry. The provisions of the principal Act are not stringent and the majority of companies in the industry would already more than adequately comply with the requirements now proposed. These requirements will, however, serve to upgrade prudential standards of the industry generally. In summary, the legislative changes incorporated in the Bill are considered to be the minimum necessary to promote the efficient operation of the Act at this time and represent an improvement in existing supervisory arrangements rather than a widening of government regulation. There are several specific features of the Bill should mention. Solvency and Paid-up Capital Requirements The Bill provides for increases in the minimum solvency and minimum paid-up capital requirements. The present solvency requirement stipulates that the value of the assets of an authorised insurer must at all times exceed the amount of its liabilities by not less than $100,000 or 15 per cent of premium income during its last preceding financial year, whichever is the greater. The present solvency margin of 15 per cent will be raised to 20 per cent. The minimum solvency requirement of $100,000 will become $Im. The minimum paid-up capital requirement has been increased from $200,000 to $500,000. Transitional arrangements allow for phasing in of the new requirements. These amendment proposals are consistent with the conclusion reached by the Campbell Committee that the existing solvency margin and minimum paid-up capital requirements may be inadequate to enable the Insurance Commissioner to achieve he objectives of the insurance Act. Treatment of Premiums It has been decided to reduce the period in which unpaid premiums due to a body corporate may rank as assets for solvency purposes from six months to three months unless otherwise approved by the Insurance Commissioner. This proposed amendment is also in line with a recommendation made by the Campbell Committee. In addition, the amendments establish a percentage of premium income over which amounts due by intermediaries would not rank as assets-that is, 20 per cent in the case of all intermediaries and four per - cent for anyone intermediary. So that the industry might have an adequate period of time to adjust to these percentages, a transitional period of two years has been allowed during which interim percentages of 25 per cent and five per cent respectively will apply. It is appropriate here to mention one matter which is not, at this stage, the subject of this Bill. It is the opinion of the Insurance Commissioner that premium income should in all instances be calculated as at the date the body corporate legally becomes at risk for liability accepted. I am advised, however, that some companies at present are unable to adopt this procedure in place of the existing procedure of calculating premium income on the basis of date of entry into the accounting records. This leaves scope for a number of undesirable practices which can weaken the effectiveness of certain provisions of the Act. It is I my understanding that the industry generally is moving towards accounting on a commencement of risk basis on its own volition. Debate interrupted. NA",102
186,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,ADJOURNMENT,"Dr Jenkins)Order! It being 10 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Mr Fife--I require the question to be put forthwith without debate. Question resolved in the negative. INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL 1982 Second Reading Debate resumed. Mr FIFEMy purpose in drawing attention to this matter is to encourage this development and to give fair notice that at some future time it may be determined that amendments be introduced based on the requirement of the commencement of risk approach. A number of amendments have been introduced in the accounts area of the principal Act to enable the Insurance Commissioner to monitor more closely compliance by a body corporate with the solvency requirements of the Act. In particular the amendments, together with regulations to be brought forward subsequently, will provide for the furnishing of improved quarterly returns. Changes in Monetary Values The various monetary amounts, including penalty provisions, specified in the principal Act have been brought into line with changes in general monetary values that have occurred since the Act was drafted in the early 1970s. Other Provisions of the Bill The bulk of the remaining provisions are of a machinery nature, including provisions to take account of the Government decision to sell the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation and provisions to streamline existing procedures in cases of company failure. Other Amendments Foreshadowed In June last year the Treasurer ( Mr Howard) announced the Government's intention not to regulate the activities of insurance brokers. At the same time he indicated that the Government would be giving consideration, in consultation with industry, to amending the Insurance Act 1973 with a view to circumscribing dependence on extended credit terms in the insurance broking industry and to ameliorating the consequences of broker failure for insureds and insurers, provided this can be done without undue regulation or administrative cost. Comments received from insurance industry bodies on possible approaches to this matter are currently being assessed with a view to determining whether a suitable legislative proposal can be developed. It has not been possible in the time available to finalise to introduction of the present Bill. However, the Treasurer intends to make a further statement on this matter in due course. In the meantime, I point out that the measures above concerning unpaid premiums and amounts due from intermediaries will provide an incentive for insurers to phase down some less desirable credit practices. mention also that, as the Treasurer announced on 2 November 198 I, it is intended at a later time to introduce amendments to allow direct underwriters of mortgage insurance to operate without detailed supervision under the Insurance Act and to pursue arrangements for self-regulation. Other amendments may flow Accounts from work in hand following the review of the Office of the Insurance Commissioner called for following the Review of Commonwealth Functions last year; and from further consideration of the recommendations of the Campbell Committee. Further statements will be made on those matters at a later time. I commend the Insurance Amendment Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Willis) adjourned. NEW BUSINESS AFTER 11 P.M.

We have just come back-I think we have been here for only about four weeks altogether-and now the Government wants to close down Parliament because it has problems on its back bench, and probably on its front bench too.

188,Dr BLEWETT ,HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Bonython) (10.11 ) - This is the last of the omnibus Bills that were introduced by the previous Minister for Health, the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr MACKellar). Its provisions range from medical fraud to vaccines for mumps. It was introduced in a speech that was so unbelievably turgid that the surrogate Minister at the time, the Minister for Transport ( Mr Hunt), simply gagged upon it. Thus, it is incumbent upon the Opposition to elucidate its major features. That is further made necessary because the Bill was written by one Minister, introduced by a second and is now being presided over by a third, a Minister who might be called the Minister for Multiple Functions. Such is now the chaos within the Fraser Ministry, such have been the changes in its Ministers, that the Opposition is AYES now compelled to explain to Government MinisRuddock. P. M. Sainsbury, M. E. ters what the Government's Bills contain. The material in this complex Bill can be summarised under four major headings. First, it attempts to cope with medical fraud. Secondly, it deals with medical overservicing. Thirdly, it shores up the developing cracks in the latest, the fifth, Fraser health scheme. Fourthly, it includes the mumps vaccine as part of the Commonwealth's vaccine program. NA First let me explain the provisions in respect of medical fraud. They include a number of administrative provisions. To begin with, stricter requirements are imposed on doctors as regards forms and accounts relating to medical benefits. A limit of two years is to be imposed upon the lodgement of claims for services rendered under previous health insurance schemes. A limit of six months is imposed on the lodgement of claims for services F. rendered when the benefit is assigned to a doctor. Sanctions for medical fraud are also included. These are the important parts of the Bill. The Scott. J. L. Theophanous. A. C. patients of a doctor who is convicted of two or more offences of fraud will be ineligible for medical benefits for a period of three years. The key West.S.J. Wiliis.R. clause of the Bill is clause 8, which deals with this sanction and the machinery for its adoption. Finally in regard to fraud, the privacy provisions PAIRS are amended to provide for the passing on of information relating to disqualified medical practitioners to the Director-General of Social Services.",105
189,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,NOES,Mr Millar)BILL 1982 Order! I ask the honourable member to resume his seat briefly. The level of conversation is far too Second Reading high. I suggest to honourable members who are subject to a compulsion to engage in discussion that they retire from the chamber or subdue the level of their conversation. I call the honourable member for Bonython.,105
190,Dr BLEWETT,NOES,"The other major provisions relating to fraud concern amendments to privacy provisions to provide for the passing on of information relating to disqualified medical practitioners to the Director-General of Social Services, the Secretary to the Department of Veterans' Affairs, State officials responsible for medical discipline and officials designated by private funds. The second major section of the Bill deals with medical overservicing. The great bulk of the Bill-clauses 15 to 36-deals with the committees responsible for dealing with overservicing-that is, the medical services committees of inquiry and the optometrical services committees of inquiry. The amendments in this section of the Bill are designed primarily to deal with problems posed for those committees by the growing tendency to the incorporation of medical practices. Also the amendments make it mandatory that any ministerial determinations arising out of these committees of inquiry should be laid before the Parliament. The third section of the Bill shores up the developing cracks in the fifth Fraser health scheme introduced on 1 September 1981. First of all, it improves the administration of the disadvantaged persons provisions-although that is not a particularly difficult task given that bureaucratic mess. Secondly, it increases the authority of number the Government over the private health funds. There are to be tighter regulations on the forms in which data are to be transmitted to the Department of Health. There will be stricter requirements in relation to departmental advances to the private funds. There will be an extremely broad power over the management practices of the funds, and Government approval will be required for the extra and additional tables as well as for the basic tables. Finally, in this field, Commonwealth authority is increased vis-a-vis the States. Ministerial approval will be required for the benefit to be paid for the hospital services fee for outpatients fees, as such approval is already required for the benefit level for in-patient bed day fees. The fourth and final section of the Billthe simplest-means that the vaccine for mumps will now be added to those for measles, poliomyelitis and rubella in the Commonwealth free vaccination program. Let me now respond on behalf of the Opposition to the major measures in this omnibus Bill. will deal with them in reverse order to the earlier discussion. Naturally the Opposition commends and supports the amendment to the National Health Act which will authorise provision by the Commonwealth of free vaccine for immunisation against the disease of mumps. We agree that the inclusion of a mumps vaccine at Commonwealth expense in the immunisation program which is presently conducted by the States and territories complies with principles of good public health. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Transport said that the extension of the vaccination program was an indication of the Government's continuing concern to safeguard and improve public health. Let me say that this Government's concern for public health is pretty muted; indeed, it is mostly rhetorical. It is not backed with an activist and consistent program which is concerned with public health. Let me cite just one instance. I refer to the School Dental Scheme which was initiated by a Federal Labor government which stressed prevention. It covered those least able to help themselves yet who were able to benefit at a vital stage of their physical development from an adequate program. The School Dental Scheme was moreover relatively cheap to administer, it provided tangible benefits and had a clear area for graduated expansion and a prospect of vastly improved dental health in the future. Page 59 of the annual report of the Director-General of Health for 1980-81 states: Since 1977-the first full year of an evaluation study of the Scheme-a reduction of about 50 per cent has occurred in the of permanent teeth requiring filling. In 1980, children aged six to thirteen years who were examined by the school dental services throughout Australia had an average of 2.17 decayed, missing of filled permanent teeth compared with 2.97 in 1977 - a reduction of 27 per cent. Furthermore, the percentage of children without decayed permanent teeth increased from 50.7 per cent in 1977 to 66.2 per cent in 1980. On the very next page, after that commendation of the scheme, came the announcement that the scheme was to be passed back to the States. In the face of these proven benefits the Commonwealth has handed this program to hard pressed and only intermittently caring States. The evidence of State attitudes can be seen in the children examined and through the School Dental Program. There was over 80 per cent coverage in the States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania but an appalling 12 per cent in Victoria. A national input into this scheme is needed to pull up the States which are retarded in this coverage. Yet national responsibility has now been abdicated for these major discrepancies in public health within the nation. The resultant dental neglect will be one further example of the new federalism in I practice. Our children's teeth and an excellent and proven public health program have been jettisoned by a Government concerned more with rhetoric than with the reality of public health. The next set of amendments is concerned with plugging the gaps already developing in the seven month old fifth Fraser health scheme. They are the initial confession that the fifth Fraser health scheme will go down the drain, as have the previous four schemes. The Bill attempts first of all to tackle some of the small hiccups in the illconceived and hastily implemented plan. An effort is made to clear up one of the anomalies in that bureaucratic nightmare, the disadvantaged persons scheme. The change in clause 4 corrects the existing situation whereby continuous disadvantaged person status can only be secured retrospectively. The Labor Party supports this improvement although we abhor the stigmatisation involved in the whole disadvantaged persons scheme. We believe it to be unnecessary under a national health scheme. I wish also to draw attention to a number of contemporary confusions, complexities and anomalies in the whole disadvantaged persons scheme. In November 1981 all health care card holders were sent a letter advising them of the new income levels applying to health care card holders. The rates quoted for a four weekly period were $825 for a married couple, plus $100 for each dependent child and $495 for a single person. Naturally, people reading those letters would imagine that they would continue to retain their disadvantaged persons status provided their incomes were below these levels. That was not so. There was no way that the Government was to be struck by some generous impulse. These levels were simply those which enabled a person not to lose the card for the six months after its initial issue. The income levels at which a card could be maintained at the end of a six-month period were in fact $660 and $396. If the administering department cannot understand the disadvantaged persons scheme, how can its intended recipients? Secondly, from the latest figures, apparently some 600,000 people have inquired about health care cards but only 175,000 cards have been issued. The 430,000 people who did not proceed represent those in need who missed out. Just one dollar in income could separate them from health security or financial hardship. We will soon begin to see the economic casualities of the latest health scheme as people are dunned for unpaid medical and hospital bills. Thirdly, it is important to member that, as the health care card is not fully indexed, the number of people eligible for the card will decline every six months. Finally, in relation to the health care card, there is a further glaring anomaly which requires attention. I refer to the eligibility of overseas students for the health care card. Originally the Government informed students that if they satisfied the income test and did not have their health costs met by their sponsoring body they would be eligible. Then bureaucratic red tape intervened and it was decided that they were not eligible. The apparent reason is that they do not qualify as Australian residents as they cannot, by virtue of the declaration they must make to enter Australia, state that they intend to reside here permanently. We were assured in November that that was just a technical issue and would be cleared up. After six months we are still waiting and this Bill does not remove this anomaly which financially penalises overseas students in this country. If, at the base, the latest health scheme is complex and full of anomalies, at the apex or the top the scheme is clearly fracturing. The scheme was introduced in a flurry of free market rhetoric about, the user pays principle and the virtues of the private insurance industry. Such claims are mostly nonsensical anyhow in the health field and this Bill suggests clearly that government relations with the private health funds are beginning to sour. It is ironic that in this Bill, the first major piece of legislation since the new scheme was introduced, there are sweeping new powers over the so-called private health funds. There are new regulations on the appropriate forms on which information will be supplied by the private health funds to the Department of Health. There are stricter requirements under which advances will be made to private health funds from the Department of Health. Ministerial approval is not required for the additional or extra tables, nor merely for the basic tables provided by the funds. Above all, clause 43 extends quite sweeping powers over the management and practices of private health funds. There will be no more travel agencies set up by private health funds. There will be no more tax consultation incentives as inducements to take out private health insurance. There is in fact not much sign of private enterprise left here. If we read these clauses we see little evidence of the free market in health. Despite the previous Minister's firm commitment to free enterprise and to minimum interference, he has already found it necessary to prop up the deficient re- system, to place further curbs on the private health funds. Those curbs will grow because the logic of this kind of system in the health field in this country will just not work. Increasingly the health funds will have to have these kinds of interventions and curbs placed upon them. Such curbs are inevitable. They are simply the logical outcome of trying to treat health care as a private market system. The private health funds are simply tax collecting agencies for government, and collectors of a regressive tax at that. The Labour Party fully supports the extension of appropriate government authority in this field. But these measures simply do not go far enough. There is as yet no protection for people, who were by this Government's policy induced to join private health funds, when those health funds collapse, as happened with the Druids in Tasmania and the Foresters in Queensland. Mr Donald Cameron-Like Medibank is going to.",105
191,Dr BLEWETT,NOES,"It is simply not good enough for the Government to wash its hands of people facing outstanding bills because of the collapse of their health fund. I hope, therefore, that the honourable member for Fadden will support the proposal we are making, that people induced to join these funds should be protected by government action. He should do so, despite the vendetta he is pursuing with Medibank Private. Again, the Government is completely silent about the activities of commercial health insurers who will gradually undermine the philosophy of community rating on which the Government scheme is allegedly based. Even further evidence of the disintegration of the latest health scheme is clause 41, in which the Minister seeks indirectly to reassert control over the States in the setting of hospital professional fees and outpatient fees. According to the Minister, this is designed: . . . to ensure a consistent approach by the Commonwealth in this area and, at ism for the Commonwealth to protect the interests of contributors where hospital charges raised conflict with Commonwealth policy. Let me repeat these words: For the Commonwealth to protect the interests of contributors where hospital charges raised conflict with Commonwealth policy. So, following the free market the rights of the States go out the window. Remember all that rhetoric about the rights of the States under the new health legislation-the rights of the States to control their own hospital systems and to charge their own hospital charges? The Government is now in desperate retreat, for its abdication of responsibility for hospitals to the States meant that it had lost effective control of hospital charges, yet it has remained responsible for the insurance increases that flow from increased hospital charges. It is now belatedly and ineffectually trying to regain control of hospital charges, for it knows that as the Government responsible for health insurance it will cop the flack for increased health insurance contributions deriving from increased hospital charges. It is probably too late and the changes in this Bill are not likely to work. In New South Wales bed-day charges rose from $50 last August to $96 today-a rise of over 90 per cent in less than 12 months. Within the next few weeks bed-day charges in Victoria and South Australia will rise to at least $100 a day-a rise of 100 per cent on charges prevailing last August. That will be the quite magnificent contribution to inflation made by this latest Liberal health scheme-a 100 per cent rise in bed-day charges for the majority of public hospital beds in this country since last August. The large number of amendments relating to the medical and optometrical services committees of inquiry deal mostly with the problem of bringing incorporated practices effectively within the ambit of these committees. Otherwise, those amendments do very little to address the problem of overservicing, which it is the task of these committees to police. Indeed, apart from the technical problem of incorporated practices and the provision for laying a ministerial determination on the reports of these committees before the Parliament, the Bill makes no progress in addressing the difficult and important issues relating to overservicing. The Bill does address the problem of fraud, which is at the extreme end of a continuum with overservicing in the middle and responsible medical practice at the other end. However, by concentrating on severe sanctions for fraud, which the same time, provide a mechanthe Opposition fully supports, the changes focus insufficiently on the real problem areas. However there is not much point in having an effective sanction if we have serious problems in catching and convicting doctors and nothing is done about those problems. While significant numbers of doctors are suspect, only 60 or so have been tried and only 51 were convicted between 1975 and 1981. I will quote from a discussion paper on this point which we secured from the Department of Health. It states: In comparing the extent of fraud perpetrated by members of the medical profession, and the extent perpetrated by the public, the latter pales to insignificance. An independent observer could not fail to be concerned about both the success rate of medical profession vis a vis public prosecutions and the relative weight of penalties imposed on members of the medical profession vis a vis members of the public. That is the Department's own view in that discussion paper. Yet the solutions in this Bill concentrate overwhelmingly on dealing with doctors after conviction for fraud and not dealing with the problems of securing fully the evidence and the convictions. The Minister prefaced his remarks by noting: It is a minority of the medical profession who are abusing the health insurance system. The Opposition endorses that view, believing that the great bulk of doctors act with integrity towards the health insurance system. However, the minority whose integrity is in doubt is both worrying and significant. In the Government's internal discussion paper entitled 'Legal problems and possible solutions associated with prosecutions relating to the Health Insurance Act', it is estimated that 2,500 doctors require investigation and that some 900 of these require high priority treatment. The higher figures represent at least 10 per cent of the active medical work force and the lower figures 3 to 4 per cent. Whichever figure is acceptable, it is a sizable and significant minority. If 10 per cent of the unemployed were allegedly milking the taxpayer the cries for action would be definite. If 3 per cent of supporting mothers were alleged to be ripping off the system I am sure that the honourable member for Fadden ( Mr Donald Cameron) would be afire with righteous indignation. Yet fraud by members of the wealthiest profession in the country is surely morally more deserving of blame than the often desperate frauds of the poor. Mr Donald Cameron-I have been very outspoken about this. Dr BLEWETTI agree that on this point the honourable member for Fadden is consistent. Our basic point in relation to this fraud legislation is that all the penalties in the world are of little use if the offenders cannot be caught. Apart from the aim of standardising statistics obtained from funds and eliminating old claims, there is no recognition of this critical point in the amendments in this Bill. The Australian Medical Association, to its credit, urged months ago, in February 1982, that the Government needed to put more money and manpower into dealing with medical fraud. The advice I have obtained from numerous sources indicates that fraud and overservicing detection areas, the departmental fraud squad and the Commonwealth Police personnel and financial resources, are totally inadequate to deal with medical fraud. In Western Australia. I understand that the departmental resources for this area of activity are one officer with one clerical assistant. Moreover, staffing figures differ widely from State to State. If we examine those staffing ratios in relation to this matter between New South Wales and Victoria it suggests that doctors are more wicked in New South Wales than in Victoria. Perhaps departmental officers subscribe to this view. Nevertheless, it is difficult to justify the discrepancies in staff allocated to fraud in the two States, and for that matter between New South Wales and the rest of Australia. I repeat that all the penalties in the world will be of little use if neither staff nor the priority are given to examining and tracking down the fraud and overservicing. I call on the Minister to state what steps he and his Department and the Australian police force are taking to increase staff and facilities available for this area of activity. The next log jam is in the courts. A whole series of technical flaws in the law make successful prosecution difficult. For example, there are court decisions which indicate that the physical attendance of the doctor on the patient is not necessary to constitute a professional attendance. In a Queensland case the court held that 'by turning his mind' to the patient's problems, without the patient even being present, a doctor performs a professional attendance and therefore is deserving of payment for it. In section 3C of the Medical Benefits Schedule the Abbreviations for pathology services have no legal standing whatsover and this therefore enables many pathological activities to escape the ambit of the law. On this matter I will quote a recommendation which was made to the Department in the discussion paper prepared in late 1981. It states: The Medical Benefits Schedule, the legislation, Departmental (Governmental) policy and claiming documents should be critically examined as a matter of urgencyI repeat 'as a matter of urgency'and ambiguities be removed wherever possible. There is no effort made in this Bill to remove any of these ambiguities which it was believed were an urgent matter, if one was to attend effectively to the problem of medical fraud. Nowhere in this legislation have simple amendments to correct these technical loopholes been made. The whole question has simply been ignored. As the Australian Medical Association points out: There is a need for the Commonwealth to overhaul the slow and cumbersome legal machinery which allows offenders to go on offending without check. Nothing has been done. Then there is the second major legal log-jam which is again occurring in the courts. The discussion paper pointed out: . . . that many of the current problems in achieving penalties commensurate with the magnitude of the fraud and preventing future fraud . . . can be largely attributed to 19th Century legal processes being unable to cope with 20th Century circumstances. The law is simply not designed to deal effectively with the mu.1titude of small, similar offences perpetrated by one person in respect of many persons. The AMA made the same point to the Government in February in a somewhat more pragmatic way. It stated: The law required that each individual claim had to be proved beyond doubt to be fraudulent or medically unnecessary before action could be taken. This was an almost impossible task given the size of the problem. the The AMA was saying that with this kind of legal requirement it is an almost impossible task for the courts to be able to deal with this problem, which the AMA recognised. Only a fraction of the actual cases of fraud committed by a doctor can ever be presented to a court during a case. This is because the fraud has often occurred in a multitude of small charges and services but each one has to be individually found proven. It is difficult to get patients to remember what day, or what time, or what length of service, or what procedure was carried out when it occurred 12 or 18 months previously. It is even more difficult if the patient is old or sick or has difficulty with the language. A competent lawyer-doctors can afford the competent lawyers-can tear these witnesses to pieces. Even when some cases are found proven, they are likely to be the tip of the iceberg and, without the chance to put other evidence relating to the totality of the fraud, the sentencing magistrate may be inclined to treat the fraudulent doctor more leniently for what might appear to be only a couple of hundred dollars of fraud. We are dealing here with a form of white collar crime burgeoning in and through the technological society. We must combat such fraud with technological evidence. Therefore, the Australian Labor Party supports bringing before the courts technological evidence, that generalised evidence from the computer profiles on doctors which can give a fair indication of the magnitude of the doctors' crimes. We believe that to be a major need but we also recognise that the rights of the doctor who is accused have to be protected. We have to use this generalised evidence. We believe that, there is no way of effectively dealing with these kinds of crime unless this kind of technological evidence is brought before the courts. At the same time this is a new experiment. These are new ideas and the interests of the individual practitioner have to be protected. Therefore, we believe that such generalised evidence should be brought before the court after conviction but before sentencing-that is, after the case has been found proven, in relation to particular cases, but before the sentence is administered-so that the judge can get a sense of the totality or magnitude of the doctors' frauds. We believe equally that the doctor convicted should have full opportunity to rebut or counter the computer evidence. Again, though these proposals have been suggested to the Government, there is no indication anywhere in this Bill of an attempt to tackle this problem by using in some way generalised evidence in the courts. Even if the Government is somewhat reluctant to use it in the courts, the discussion paper suggested some three or four other ways in which this generalised evidence could be brought to bear in order to ensure that the punishments bestowed on fraudulent doctors compared with the magnitude of the crime. I am completely convinced that, unless we are prepared to bring this kind of evidence before the courts or effectively before the peers of these doctors, we will not be able in any way to cope with the generality of this problem. Finally I want to suggest that another measure we should perhaps be looking at are verification procedures of doctors' practices by consumers. We need increasingly to involve the consumers in checking and keeping an eye on doctors' activities. Taxpayers, in addition to payments to the health funds, pay taxes which help to subsidise the health scheme. As taxpayers and consumers they have a major interest in checking on doctors. There are numerous ways this can be done. For instance, when I was in Canada last year I found that in Manitoba a verification procedure was in process whereby a small percentage of patients were sent statements for services claimed to have been rendered to them by medical practitioners. The patients are simply requested to verify that they received the services claimed. This works mainly as an effective deterrent but it also does help to detect numerous aberrant billing procedures. I am not suggesting that this is necessarily the ideal method. I do not have the technical resources to decide which is the best method. I suggest to the Government that we should examine whether we can involve consumers in various verification processes to deal with what is a major problem in this society. For the reasons I have outlined I move: That all words after That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not opposing the Bill, the House is of the opinion that the following additional measures are necessary to combat medical fraud: (I) elimination of technical ambiguities hampering the courts; (2) provisions for admitting generalised evidence to the courts after conviction on specific charges but prior to sentencing, with full opportunity for the convicted practitioner to counter the evidence, and (3) adoption of verification procedures through medical consumers' .",108
192,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,NOES,"Mr Millar)-Is the amendment seconded? Mr Kent-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak. Debate (on motion by Mr Hodges) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1982 Bill presented by Mr Fife, and read a first time. Second Reading",110
193,Mr FIFE ,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Farrer-Minister for Education) (I0.43)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill to amend the income tax law covers two important subjects. It will give effect to the Government's decision, announced by the Treasurer ( Mr Howard) on 14 April 1982, to amend the secrecy provisions of the income tax law. The amendments will permit the Commissioner of Taxation-in very special and limited circumstances-to disclose to certain royal commissions information obtained from official income tax records. The second main feature of the Bill is the legislation necessary to give effect to one of the housing assistance measures announced by the Government, namely the scheme of home loan interest tax rebates that was foreshadowed by the Treasurer on 18 March 1982. Associated with this group of measures is another amendment which will permit the Secretary to the Department of Housing and Construction to be given information from income tax records for the purposes of administration of the Government's new scheme of home deposit assistance to families on low incomes. I turn now to the details of these measures. Disclosure of Taxation Information to certain Royal Commissions The secrecy provisions of the income tax law generally require that the Commissioner of Taxation and his officers maintain absolute confidentiality about information on taxpayers' affairs that comes into the possession of the Commissioner in the course of administration of the income tax law. However, there is in the law authority for the Commissioner to supply taxation information to specified authorities, mainly those having responsibility for the administration of laws under which benefits of one kind or another are paid by the Commonwealth. In this situation, the Government recognises that the amendments now proposed do break new ground. The measures are in response to recommendations contained in Interim Report No. 3 of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union and follow a strong plea by the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking. Provisions in the Bill will specifically permit the Commissioner of Taxation to make information from income tax records available to these two ongoing royal commissions. The Bill will also allow such information to be passed to other royal commissions that are given terms of reference that authorise such a course. A royal commission that receives information obtained from Taxation records will be able to disclose it in any report to the Governor General, or in public proceedings, so long as this is done in a way that does not disclose the identity of the person or persons concerned. Such a royal commission will however be permitted to divulge tax information, including identification of persons, to the Attorney-General if it holds the view that the information indicates that there may have been a breach of a Commonwealth Act. In turn the Attorney-General may, if he considers it appropriate to do so, pass on the information reported to him by a royal commission to the Australian Federal Police, which will be able to use it for internal purposes. The Government has not lightly taken the decision to permit these royal commissions to be provided with confidential tax information. It is an old and well established principle in this country that taxation information should be kept confidential and the effectiveness of the taxation system owes a lot to that very important principle. In coming to this decision, therefore, the Government had to weigh very carefully two competing areas of public interest. On the one hand there was the need to maintain taxation confidentiality and, on the other, there was the necessity for action to be taken to support inquiries in particular areas of special public interest. In these circumstances, in reaching the decision we have come to, we have felt it appropriate to ensure that the highest possible level of confidentiality, compatible with the decision, should be maintained. Accordingly, the proposed legislation will impose very strict secrecy restraints on persons to whom taxation information is conveyed under the new provisions. These restraints will be of the same general kind as those that already apply to taxation officers and others who receive taxation information and will extend to the royal commissions, the Attorney-General and the Australian Federal Police, as well as to the respective staffs of those bodies or persons to whom tax information may necessarily be communicated. Furthermore, the proposed amendments are so structured that persons to whom confidential tax information is conveyed under them will be precluded from using it in an action to prosecute any person. It bears repeating that these amendments do not evidence any policy of generally easing the strict confidentiality applying to tax records. As the Treasurer ( Mr Howard) said when he was foreshadowing these amendments, their effect will be watched very closely and they are not to be taken as a precedent for any other relaxation of tax secrecy. Home Loan Interest Rebate Honourable members will recall that, on 18 March 1982, the Treasurer made a ministerial statement in this House following a detailed view by the Government of housing policy. statement the Treasurer reinforced the Government's commitment to preserving the highest more practicable level of private home ownership in Australia and identified four main problem areas in the field of housing finance. This Bill will give effect to the Government's decision to alleviate one of those problems-the burden of mortage payments. These tend to be highest in real terms, of course, in the early years of a housing loan. This Bill proposes the provision of a rebate of tax for home loan interest payments made on or after July 1982. The basic features of the rebate were referred to in the Treasurer's earlier the House, and he also released a detailed supporting statement at that time. In those circumstances, I trust that I can be brief in my references now to the rebate, particularly as it is explained fully in the explanatory memorandum that is being made available to time. honourable members. The rebate of tax to be authorised by this Bill will be available to an individual taxpayer resident in Australia in respect of the first five years of occupancy of the person's sole or principal residence here. Subject to certain upper limits, the basic rebate will be 32 cents for each dollar of interest paid on or after 1 July and during the relevant income year, provided interest has accrued while the taxpayer occupied the dwelling. A feature of the rebate is that ing home-owners may qualify. It will be available to home owners who first occupied a sole or prinSavings cipal residence on or after 1 July 1977, and will extend to those who first occupy a sole or princibuyers. pal residence no later than 30 June 1985. For married person-this will apply also to a person a de facto marriage relationship-the five-year occupancy period will run from the date on which either of the partners first became an ownerthe occupier on such a residence. As regards the limits on the rebate, the basic upper limit will be $500 a dwelling in the first of owner-occupancy, to be reduced by $100 a year for each subsequent year. Rules covering people who took up occupancy prior to I July 1982 will mean, for example, that if the occupancy ocmarried curred in 1981-82 the person the full first limit of $500 in 1982-83. The limit otherwise applicable in any year will, however, increased by an additional amount of $200 when the dwelling is also home for a dependent child dependent student. When a taxpayer changes his or her place of residence within the five-year period, he or she will be entitled to the rebate in respect of interest attributable to the acquisition of the second dwelling, but the upper limit will be redetermined having regard to the date on which he In his or she occupied the original dwelling. Special arrangements will apply when two or persons have interests in a dwelling which is occupied by them as their sole or principal residence and when a dwelling is also used by a taxpayer for purposes other than as a sole or principal residence. In the case of a matrimonial home, the interest rebate will be transferable between spouses, irrespective of which one incurred and paid the interest. This will help to ameliorate the effect of another basic rule, which is that the re1 bate cannot exceed the tax otherwise payable by the taxpayer. With those introductory remarks, I statement in commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Uren) adjourned. NA 1982 Bill presented by Mr MCVeigh, and read a first Second Reading",110
194,Mr MCVEIGH ,HOME DEPOSIT ASSISTANCE BILL,"Darling Downs-Minister for Housing and Construction) (10.55) - I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. 1982 The Home Deposit Assistance Bill gives effect to the the Government's promise, announced by the Treasurer ( Mr Howard) on 18 March 1982, to inexisttroduce an improved deposit assistance scheme. This Bill provides for replacement of the Homes Grant Scheme, which since its inception in 1964 has given valuable assistance to first home In all, approximately $450m has been a made available to more that 600,000 first home in buyers under the scheme. I will be introducing concurrently separate legislation to provide for the winding up of that scheme. The Bill recognises valuable assistance the Homes Savings Grant Scheme has given to people over the years in that it draws on many of the provisions of that scheme. year However, to increase the effectiveness of this form of deposit assistance, the Bill will provide for a new, means-tested Home Deposit Assistance Scheme to help low and middle income earners, or single, when they buy or build their will be eligible for first home. In adopting features of the old scheme, we have be recognised that some anomalies existed and the Bill now before the House has been designed to reor move those anomalies. The Home Deposit Assistance Scheme is a major element in the Government's new housing package. The package also includes measures to enable banks to make an additional $400m available for housing loans, a tax rebate on home loan interest, and a mortgage and rent relief scheme. Negotiations with the States on the Mortgage and Rent Relief Scheme are underway and I hope to introduce legislation for that scheme in the Budget session. The Bill before the House provides for the Commonwealth to pay grants to people buying or building their first home on or after 18 March 1982, who have saved towards their home in certain specified forms-basically those which form the pool of long term housing finance-and who satisfy the specified eligibility criteria. There will be no waiting period for the payment of these grants. The scheme, with its income-based means test, will direct grants to people, especially single income families with dependent children, who have the greatest difficulty in acquiring a home. The maximum basic grant will be $2,500, an increase of $500 on the old scheme. Grants of $1 will be paid for each $1 of eligible savings, rather than $1 for each $3. There will no longer be any limit on the value of homes which qualify. The new Home Deposit Assistance Scheme is designed to ensure that government assistance to overcome the deposit gap is better directed to low and middle income earners and is available at the time of purchase. This new scheme is an honest attempt to help people into home ownership. I hope that its benefits are not whittled away by increases in housing and land costs, especially increases associated with unreasonable wage demands. I would like now to summarise for honourable members the main features of the new scheme. The Home Deposit Assistance Scheme will operate with effect from 18 March 1982 to provide assistance to people buying or building their first home by contract made on or after that date. Owner-builders commencing to build on or after that date will also be included. Eligible applicants will be able to qualify for a tax-free grant of up to $3,500, made up of a savings based grant of up to $2,500 and a family bonus of $500 for one dependent child and $1,000 for two or more dependent children. Previously the family bonus has been available only in respect of dependent children in the custody, care and control of applicants at the date of the contract for the home. An anomalous position has resulted in that a family whose child is born one day before the contract date receives the bonus yet a family whose child is born one day after does not receive this assistance. Further, the Government recognises that many people take steps to acquire a home of their own as soon as they learn they are expecting a child. Accordingly, under the new scheme the family bonus will be paid to applicants where a child is born or otherwise comes into theircustody, care and control within ten months after the home contract date. Reference in the Bill to a period of 11 months reflects that under the Social Services Act family allowance may not be payable in the month of birth. As entitlement to a family bonus is linked in the Bill to receipt of family allowance, it is necessary to specify a period of 11 months. Qualifying homes may be new or established and will not be subject to any value limit. Applicants for these grants will be expected to reside in the home as their principal place of residence within a reasonable time after its acquisition. It is not intended to assist with the acquisition of a home used solely for investment purposes or as a holiday home. However, I am aware that people in transient occupations, for example teachers, ministers of religion, policemen and defence personnel, do not always have the opportunity to acquire their own homes and take up residence straight away. The Bill will enable regard to be had to circumstances such as location or nature of employment preventing immediate occupancy of the home. In this way people in transient jobs will not be disadvantaged. Applicants under the new Home Deposit Assistance Scheme may be married or single, young or old. There will no upper age limit but eligible applicants must be at least 16 years of age, or married or engaged, at the date of entering into the home contract. Under the scheme it replaces there was a minimum age limit of 18 years. In practice that limit has led to the exclusion of some people deserving of assistance. An applicant's spouse, legal or de facto, and any other person who has joined in the home acquisition, must join in the application for a grant. The scheme is intended to assist people buying their first home. Accordingly, where one partner has previously owned a home but remarried and purchased again the couple will not be eligible for assistance. However there is provision for previous ownership to be disregarded in cases where the dwelling was not the person's principal place of residence. The means test will apply to the combined taxable income of all applicants for the financial year preceding home purchase and will be related to the Australian Statistician's figure for average weekly earnings for that year. A full grant, subject to qualifying savings, will be payable where the weekly average of the taxable income or combined taxable income for that year does not exceed a figure which is approximately 135 per cent of A WE. No grant will be payable where combined taxable income exceeds a figure approximately 155 per cent of AWE. These limits are expressed in the legislation as annual income rounded up to the nearest $100. For people buying a home during the current financial year, the combined taxable income of husband and wife or other joint applicants, for the financial year 1980-81-which is the income year against which they will generally be tested-will be assessed against limits of $18,900 and $21,700 That is to say, subject to qualifying savings, a full grant will be payable where the combined taxable income is $18,900 or less. Where it falls between $18,900 and $21,700 the amount of the grant otherwise payable will be reduced proportionately. No grant will be made where the combined taxable income exceeds the upper limit. The Bill provides for the income limits for subsequent financial years to be provided in the regulations. This will allow the rounding of the income limit amounts, and will also allow for appropriate adjustment to be made in the event of any change in the basis of measuring the A WE series. It is the Government's intention to introduce an appropriate regulation each year prior to I July which will set the limits in respect of the income year drawing to a close. Those limits will be approximately 135 per cent and ISS per cent of average weekly earnings based on information published to that date by the Statistician. The amount of the family bonus payable will not be subject to this means test taper. If applicants are entitled to only a minimum basic grant they will still be eligible for the full family Where there has been a significant change in family circumstances since the previous financial year, the Bill provides the power to have regard to those changed circumstances for the purposes of the means test. Where an applicant has withdrawn from the work force in the period between the end of the last financial year and the date of home acquisition, and where there is no current intention or immediate prospect of rejoining the work force, only a proportion of the taxable income will be tested. for example, if one partner stops work six months before home purchase, only half of that person's income for the previous financial year will be considered. This arrangement would apply to cases such as women ceasing work to have children, or people leaving the work force because of invalidity, or some other circumstance where the duration of the period out of the work force can be established with some precision. In respect of other circumstances of reduced income, subsequent to the financial year being means-tested, and which are beyond the control of the applicant, a provisional grant of 80 per cent, plus 100 per cent of the family bonus where applicable, will be paid, based on the applicant's expected taxable income for the current year. An adjustment will be made later on the basis of the actual taxable income for the current year. Only cases of genuine decline in the financial fortunes of applicants will be considered, such as unemployment, injury leading to a change in employment, impact of a natural disaster, and the like. The necessary amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act to permit the Commissioner of Taxation or a person authorised by him to communicate information to the Secretary to the Department of Housing and Construction for the purposes of the administration of this legislation are contained in the Income tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No.2) 1982. In relation to the savings requirements, applicants must have held savings in one or more of the approved forms for at least one year immediately before the date of the home contract. The grant will be paid on the basis of one dollar for every dollar held in an acceptable form. The maximum basic grant of $2,500, subject to the means test, will be paid where there have been two or more complete years of saving; a grant of up to $1,250 will be payable where there has been only one complete year of saving. I would like to stress that savings carried over from previous years will be taken into account. If an eligible person has sa ved, say, an averge of $500 over each of the past five years and has total savings of $2,500 by the date of bonus. home purchase, a full grant would be payable. However, only an increase of up to $1,500 in savings held in that year preceding home acquisition will count towards a grant. This is to ensure that a person will not benefit from a deposit of moneys that would not be regarded as normal savings within the intention of the scheme. The amount of the family bonus will not be dependent on the amount of acceptable savings held. Even if only a minimum grant is payable, a full family bonus will be paid. The principal forms of savings acceptable under the new scheme include deposits with savings banks, building societies and credit unions, fixed deposits with trading banks, Australian savings bonds purchased as inscribed stock or for safe custody with a bank, and payments in connection with the home acquisition, made on or before the contract date, such as for the land, for building materials or for legal fees. A number of savings banks now offer facilities whereby depositors may draw cheques on their savings accounts. The Bill recognises this development and accepts such accounts as savings for the purposes of the scheme. Moneys held in trust on behalf of an applicant which are held or expanded by the trustee in an acceptable form, and which are clearly identifiable as moneys held on behalf of the applicant, will be accepted as savings. The previous scheme required all parties to an application to be Australian citizens or to have permanent residence status at the date of entering into the contract for the home. This requirement has led to anomalous situations in a number of cases. Take the example of a migrant husband who'has set up a home in anticipation of his family's arrival. If his wife had not reached Australia and attained citizenship or resident status before the contract date, she would not be eligible and the family would not be entitled to a grant. This Bill provides for a grant to be payable once the plicant, or at least one of the joint applicants, comes an Australian citizen or a permanent resident, irrespective of whether this occurs before or after the contract date. The Bill includes a 'sunset' clause, which means that the scheme will cease after three years unless new legislation is enacted. This will allow the Government to reassess the effectiveness of the scheme in the light of prevailing circumstances. Printed explanatory material and application forms are being produced for early and widespread distribution. I am requesting the cooperation of savings institutions and industry groups which have direct contact with the home seekers to ensure that there is the widest possible awareness of the benefits of the Home Deposit Assistance Scheme. This Bill enables the Government to continue to encourage and assist people into ownership. It will provide a more equitable and effective distribution of assistance. 1 commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Uren) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1982 Bill presented by Mr MCVeigh, and read a first time.",112
195,Mr MCVEIGH ,HOMES SAVINGS GRANT ACTS,"Darling Downs-Minister for Housing and Construction) (11.10)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill provides for the termination of the Homes Savings Grant Scheme, to be replaced by the Home Deposit Assistance Scheme for which 1I have just introduced the enabling legislation; that is, the Home Deposit Assistance Bill 1982. The Homes Savings Grant Scheme was established in 1964, under a Liberal-Country Party Government, by the Homes Savings Grant Act 1964. We reintroduced it in a much widened form, to apply from 1 January 1977, by the Homes Savings Grant Act 1976. Since the Homes Savings Grant Scheme first came into operation more than 600,000 grants, valued at some $450m, have been approved for payment to people buying or building their first homes. However, following a recent review of our housing policies, the Government has decided to increase the scheme's effectiveness with revised arrangements which are more in tune with current needs. The Homes Savings Grant Act 1975, introduced by the Whitlam Government, sought to phase out the Homes Savings Grant Scheme. Accordingly, eligibility under the 1964 Act ceased ap- in respect of homes acquired after 31 December be1976. Only a handful of outstanding applications under that Act have been received during the past 12 months. This Bill provides that applications for assistance under the 1964 Act will not be accepted beyond the date the Home Deposit Assistance Bill 1982 receives royal assent. Eligibility under the 1976 Act relates to homes acquired by contract· dated 1 January 1977 or later. This Bill terminates eligibility where the contract to buy or build a home is made after the date on which the Home Deposit Assistance Bill 1982 receives royal assent. Applications will be accepted for one month after the date eligibility is terminated. However, the Government recognises the difficulty people living in remote areas might experience in obtaining the necessary application documents. Accordingly the Bill provides that a written notification within that month of an intention to apply will be accepted provided a formal application is lodged within one further month. The new Homes Deposit Assistance Scheme arrangements apply from 18 March 1982. From that date, until the new scheme receives royal assent, the two schemes will operate side by side. People who enter into a contract before the new scheme receives royal assent and who, as a result of the operation of the means test, may not be eligible under the new scheme, will have an opporSecond Reading tunity to apply under the Homes Savings Grant Scheme. They should lodge their application as promptly as possible and certainly within one month of the date of royal assent to the new scheme. The Government will publicise the cut-off date widely and 1 strongly urge people who have bought their first home and who have not yet lodged an application to do so promptly. The Homes Savings Grant Scheme has served Australian home buyers well. It is being repealed to make way for a replacement scheme which draws on many of the provisions of the existing scheme but will increase the effectiveness of this form of deposit assistance. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Uren) adjourned. NA Second Reading Debate resumed.",115
196,Mr HODGES ,HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Petrie) (11.14)-There are a number of provisions in the Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1982 but I intend to confine my remarks to those which deal with medical fraud. Some weeks ago it was revealed through the newspapers that, of the 25,000 doctors in Australia, about 10 per cent-or 2,500-were involved in defrauding the Government. Of that number, about 900 or 3.6 per cent were more deeply involved in fraud and overservicing. The then Minister for Health, the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr MACKellar), in his second reading speech made reference to the fact that a minority of the medical profession was abusing the system. While one would agree that in percentage terms it is a minority, nevertheless the numbers are rather large. Of course, the amount by which the Government-which means the taxpayer-is being defrauded is considerable. I want to make it quite clear that I have no sym- 51 pathy for doctors who are guilty of medifraud. At every opportunity those who are detected ought to be brought to successful prosecution. The cost to revenue was estimated at about $IOOm, of which about half was attributed to medifraud and the other half to overservicing. I want to make it clear that this Bill deals only with fraud and the penalties for fraud; it does not address the issue of 78 overservicing as such. Of course, we have in place at the moment medical services committees of inquiry which deal with cases in which overservicing is detected. I emphasise that that particular aspect of overservicing, which is a major problem, is not covered in this legislation. A computerised system has been developed to detect fraud and overservicing. I believe this will give the Department of Health a fairly clear indication of those doctors who are overservicing and defrauding the Government. I point out that the Australian Medical Association deplores the actions of those members of the medical profession who are involved in fraud and overservicing. The AMA supports the main thrust of this Bill and the Government's attempts to stamp out or to minimise the abuse that is currently going on in the system. I also point out to the House that the medical profession basically determines the way in which the annual income of doctors is made up. I make reference to the fact that, after the initial visit that a patient makes to a doctor, subsequent visits are really in the hands of the medical profession. The question of whether a patient, after the initial BILL 1982 visit, has specialist services, pathology tests or whatever is left in the hands of, usually, a medical practitioner. So it is very simple for a doctor to be involved in overservicing. At this point, Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which deals with item numbers under the medical benefits system. Leave granted. The table read as followsNA Fee Item (N.S.W. DifferNo. rates) ence Description $ $ 3 8.70 . - Brief consulation (0-5 mins) 14 12.00 . - Standard consultation (5-25 mins) 19 18.20 . - After hours consultation (5-25 mins) 25 22.50 . - Long consultation (25-45 mins) 33 34.50 . - Prolonged long consultation (45 mins +) 17.40 .. Home visit (5-25 mins) 53 24.50 .. After hours home visit (5-25 mins) 57 29.00 .. Long home visit (25-45 mins) 69 17.40+ .. Consulation at Nursing Home or Hospital (one patient) 75 12.00+ .. Consultation at Hospital (three or more patients) 76 10.40+ .. Consultation at Nursing Home (two patients) 8.70+ .. Consultation at Nursing Home (three or more patients) 88 34.50 .. Specialist consultation (initial) 94 17.20 .. Specialist consultation (subsequent) + Per patient - At the Doctor's Surgery",116
197,Mr HODGES,ITEM NUMBER DESCRIPTIONS,"The rates shown are those that apply in New South Wales. Of course, there is a description of each item. Item No.3 is listed as a brief consultation of up to five minutes for which, under the New South Wales rate, the doctor receives $8.70. Item No. 14 is the standard consultation from five to twenty five minutes, for which the doctor receives $12. Item No. 33 is a prolonged long consultation of 45 minutes plus, for which the doctor receives $34.50. It can be seen from this table that if a doctor claims long consulsultations; tations-or, more specifically, if he claims prolonged consultationswhen he is in actual fact performing standard consultations, he stands to gain a great deal of money as a result of those claims for services which he is not performing. To illustrate my point and the extent and seriousness of the problem of fraud, I want to refer to one or two tables that I have with me. In actual fact, they are profiles of doctors. The profile of a doctor under scrutiny can be compared with the profile of the average doctor. The first example I refer to is a general practitioner who was also approved as a pathologist. In this stance the doctor has an annual income of approximately $250,000 while the income of the average doctor he is compared with is $70,000. In other words, he has an income of about three and a half times the average. Mr Donald Cameron-A quarter of a million dollars?",116
198,Mr HODGES,ITEM NUMBER DESCRIPTIONS,"A quarter of a million dollars, as the honourable member for Fadden has pointed out. In this case the doctor had 441 standard consultations in a quarterly period. The average number of patients for his category is 1,047. I refer the House to the fact that item No. 25, which relates to long consultations, attracts a fee of $22.50c whereas the standard consultation attracts a fee of $12. So if he was not delivering service but claiming the higher figure he would have been receiving $10.50 extra on every occasion. This doctor had 814 fong consultations in this quarterly period whereas the average is 43. Fees for long consultations should have represented, on average,S per cent of his income. However, they represented 25 per cent of his income. On average, 61 per cent of his income should have been made up from standard consultations; but in his case the figure was only 7 per cent. Mr Donald Cameron-Who is he?",117
199,Mr HODGES,ITEM NUMBER DESCRIPTIONS,"This is a general practitioner who also operates as an approved pathologist. He had a quarterly income of $61 ,900 whereas the average was $17,500. I turn to the second example. It involves a general practioner who earned $160,000, which is more than double the average annual income. This doctor had 1,292 prolonged long consultations. The average for such services is six. That means he saw patients for that number of services in a quarterly period all, as he claimed, for 45 minutes or more. Prolonged long consultations should have represented 1 per cent of his income but in fact they represented 98 per cent of his income. The doctor had seven standard conhe should have had 1,047 if he was about average. In other words, 61 per cent of his income should have been derived from standard consultations. In fact he had almost negligible income from standard consultations. The third and final profile to which I want to refer concerns an ophthalmological surgeon, in other words an eye specialist. In this case the specialist had an annual income of almost $400,000 whereas the average is about $100,000. So he had an income of about four times the average. The average for service item No. 6904 is about five services. This doctor had 442 such serin- vices. This item should have represented about 2 per cent of his income; however it comprised 57 per cent of his income. So it is quite clear from a quick glance at these profiles that there are many doctors-not allwho are defrauding the system either through straight fraud or overservicing. One of the great values of the system that has been developed by the Department of Health-I give full credit to the Department-is the fact that it will immediately point up on a quarterly basis the activities of doctors throughout this nation. It will be a simple matter to point up the worse cases. It is then up to the Department to gain the necessary evidence, having pointed up the very severe cases, before taking the particular doctor or doctors to prosthat ecution. When we get to prosecuting the medical profession one of the difficulties will be that officers of the Department and of the Australian Federal Police will have to interview patients. Most of us who have been involved in the medical profession know that patient loyalty has to be overcome. Patients feel that they may lose something. A great bond exists between doctors and their patients. Nevertheless it can be done and, no doubt, methods will be developed by the Department and by the police to readily bring them to successful prosecution. If found guilty of fraud on two or more charges, the provisions of the Bill are acted upon. The doctor will then be basically put out of business, because he will not be able to claim a benefit for three years. In my view doctors who are frauding the system, although respectable, are really criminals. They must be brought to successful prosecution and these practices must be stamped out. Registration of the medical profession is a matter for State goverments. It may well be that doctors so successfully prosecuted will be deregistered by their States. If not, they still have the capacity to work in hospitals, institutions or indeed work for companies as salaried doctors. They will not be able to operate in their own private practice under the system as we know it at the moment. The Bill makes provision for a disqualified doctor to appeal. The Minister will then review his disqualification. In subsequent disqualifications no appeal provisions will be available. It is a little more severe for the doctor who is convicted successfully on the second occasion. When the provisions of this Bill become law they will act as a deterrent. The honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) expressed some concern that the Government may not be able to achieve what it wants to achieve because the system is bogged down and the courts are busy. The mere fact that this legislation is in place, in my view, will act as a deterrent to the medical profession. If that is not enough, one or two successful prosecutions and the implementation of the provisions of this Bill will certainly bring it home very forcefully to members of the medical profession. I believe that will have the desired effect. There is a great deal of criticism in the community that the Government has not brought enough members of the medical profession to successful prosecutions. That may well be the case. I have some facts and figures which I would like to put on the record. They pertain to the period from I July 1975 to 31 January 1982. In that time 55 doctors were prosecuted, 45 were convicted and 10 were dismissed. In the same period 108 members of the public were convicted. Penalties ranged from fines to good behaviour bonds to gaol terms. Doctor recoveries as at 3 I January 1982 amounted to $1,503,945 and public recoveries amounted to $86,332, making a total of about almost $1.6m. In addition as at 31 January 1982 159 cases involving doctors and others were under investigation with the Australian Federal Police. It is clear from those figures that there have been a number of successful prosecutions. I venture to say that with this legislation in place there will be many more. As I said earlier, the deterrent action will assist the Department in bringing about a reduction of the overservicing and certainly a reduction in medifraud.",117
200,Mr KENT ,ITEM NUMBER DESCRIPTIONS,"Hotham) (11.30)-This is another Bill before the House amending the Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1978 introduced by a former Minister for Health. The Bill covers a number of measures from immunisation against mumps to the determination of the levels of public hospital charges by the States. However, the main provision of the Bill deals with medical fraud. In his second reading speech on the previous Bill that Minister stated: The Government has for some time now viewed with concern the various problems that have necessitated many amendments proposed in this Bill. These proposals have been foreshadowed for some considerable time and will receive, I believe, the full support of the Australian people. Nothing is further from the truth than that statement. The Bill that we are discussing today introduces hastily concocted measures brought in because of the wide publicity given to medical fraud. It is true, though, that the Government knew for a long time that its medimuddle was designed to lend itself to rebuffs by the less scrupulous members of the medical profession. The Government knew that for a long time, but it was not prepared to do anything about it until the scandal was exposed in the media and admitted to by the Australian Medical Association. So much for the worth of the amendments to the legislation. But after all, what can we expect from a government with a track record in the health field of one panic measure after the other, one idiotic change after another. In six years of rule the Government has introduced no fewer than five changes to the National Health Act and that after its leader, the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser), the man who is known as the man who tells 'nothing but the truth' said in 1975: 'We will maintain Medibank'. Since that promise was given, that man, the Prime Minister, in collusion with his Health Ministers, assisted in the abolition of Medibank and the taking away from the Australian people of the first universal health scheme introduced by the Labor Government. Mr Bourchier-- They just could not afford it.",118
201,Mr KENT,ITEM NUMBER DESCRIPTIONS,We cannot afford the honourable member; that is why he will lose his seat. Mr BourchierYou are joking.,118
202,Mr KENT,ITEM NUMBER DESCRIPTIONS,"I am not. I am dead serious about it. The honourable member should look after his seat. The Government, in its zeal to dismantle Medibank, introduced one inane health scheme after another. In its zeal to assist private health insurance companies, private hospitals and private medical practitioners it created complete confusion in the health care field. Because of its ideological zeal to abolish free universal health insurance-which stood there as a monument to good Labor government-the Government did not care that the Liberal scheme actually invites unscrupulous private practitioners to rip off the system. It does not care that hundreds of millions of dollars of public money is wasted and that another $ 180m a year is pocketed by fraudulent operators. The only reason the Government has brought in this ineffective Bill is that it has felt the public indignation brought of the about by the reports of medical fraud and feared that doing nothing would be electorally damaging to it. This explains to us why the hasty measures were brought in without first thoroughly examining the position and trying to find remedies. The Government, in its usual style, is looking to use punishments and penalties after it reintroduced a system of hotchpotch private insurance that lent itself to fraud and corruption. If anyone is to be condemned for mismanagement of the health care of the Australian people it is this Government. The Government was forced to acknowledge that it has facilitated the $180m annual medical rip-off, but it wisely keeps quiet about the other side of the story to which I will come shortly, the hospital ripoff. Recently I read a study entitled 'Patterns of private hospital oWnership in Victoria' which stated in conclusion: Private companies were found to dominate the acute care private hospital business in Victoria, and this business rapidly expanding. More than half of the private hospitals have multiple company structures, and the companies had the usual characteristics of investment companies. The document also states: . . . correspondingly, the Victorian Health Commission registration requirements were inadequate . . . The study found that many of the 'for profit' private hospitals are owned by medical practitioners and their families. The study was unable to unearth the bed utilisation figures for these doctors and the hospitals. The Government's health policy is based on the encouragement of greater use of private enterprise in Australian hospital resources, completely disregarding the conflict of commercial interest and professional practice of medicine. The authors of the study requested access to information from officers of health insurance funds and the Commonwealth Department of Health regarding the utilisation by the doctors of their hospital beds. The details were kept secret. They were not available. Why were these details kept secret? There is only one reason-that is, that the figures would reinforce our long-held suspicion that a great number of operations performed in Australian hospitals are unnecessary operations, facilitated by the negligence of the Government in not introducing proper tissue controls. When the doctors or their families own the acute bed private hospitals one can imagine how many unnecessary operations are performed. If one is not careful some of these medical rogues will whip out one's appendix or uterus in no time to collect the fee to fill their pockets. The Australian Medical Association stated that there is no clash of interest in doctors owning hospitals or having large investments in them and that their greed for profits does not interfere with their professional ethics. I would feel somewhat uneasy to be operated on by a surgeon who has a large investment in a funeral parlour, no matter what the AMAsays.",118
203,Mr SCOTT ,ITEM NUMBER DESCRIPTIONS,And a large scalpel.,119
204,Mr KENT,ITEM NUMBER DESCRIPTIONS,"And, as the honourable member for Hindmarsh said, a large scalpel. The last decade has seen heavy involvement of doctors and their families in private acute care hospitals. This has corresponded with an increase in medical fraud and overservicing. There is also a tendency for multinational corporations with connections in the medical supply and technology fields to invest in our 'for profit' private hospital system with the tacit approval of the Government. Of course, these multinational corporations are not was interested in establishing hospitals in areas where there is the greatest need for them-for instance, in the south-eastern and western suburbs of Melbourne. This development has received extraordinarily little Press coverage and only then in the financial pages. Short articles have appeared with headings such as 'Hospital financing new target for capital market', 'Hospital take over by US based group', and 'Business moves in as Government quits hospital beds'. There have been only a few attempts at investigative journalism. The whole question of medical, surgical or-even worse-psychiatric hospitals being run for profit impinges on the ethics of the medical profession. The issue of the pecuniary interests of doctors and the potential conflict of interest was raised by the Director of the Victorian Consumer Affairs Bureau. He compared the practice with a judge having shares in a gaol. There is obviously a need for a register of pecuniary interests of doctors. The largest of the overseas controlled companies, the Hospital Corporation of America, which was the first to invest in Australia, has stated that it came here at the invitation of some Australian doctors. Famous for the increase in tax avoidance, the Fraser Government cannot escape responsibility for the increasing medical rip-off. The Government, by encouraging private greed and private profits, is in conflict with the ethics of the medical profession. In the first instance, that should be condemned. As I said earlier, the Government, by supporting the private health insurance funds and the use of private hospitals, creates opportunities for fraud and invites overservicing. The Government proposes now to introduce some belated and inadequate measures to try to curb the worse excesses in a system that it has created. For many years now the Fraser Government has been preoccupied with the aim to make the poor and the ordinary Australian families pay more for their health services while, at the same time, it has been conniving in the fraudulent practices of the less scrupulous section of the medical profession. The Government neglected to enforce the law as it stands today. Out of some 209 doctors referred to the Australian Federal Police for formal inquiries since 1975, only 46 cases have so far been brought before the courts. The convictions are so few that it will not deter any person from defrauding the public, as the chances of being caught and convicted of medical fraud are minimal. Any proposed tightening of the legislation without the acceptance of the amendments moved by the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) will not have the effect of bringing about more prosecutions and convictions. When dealing with this type of fraud we are dealing with whitecollar crime and our legal processes are not geared to deal with such matters. Our legal system is unable to cope with white-collar crime and our ability to detect such crimes is inadequate. Our legal processes are at least one century behind the times. British justice is designed to protect the loot of the rich from the thieving of the poor. With such a legal system we cannot protect the public from unscrupulous operators. Out of hundreds and hundreds of cases of medical fraud, accounting for an established $180m a year, only a few doctors were prosecuted and only a very few-mostly foreigners-were convicted. It could be a coincidence, although it would be a bizarre coincidence, that most of the very few doctors who were caught and convicted for fraud have very foreign-sounding names. Could this be a tribute to Anglo-Saxon honesty, or are we selective in prosecution? Be that as it may, the conviction of a few Asian doctors will not stop medical fraud. The only answer to the problem of rising medical costs is the new Hayden health plan. It has inbuilt controls. Unlike the Fraser health scheme, which encourages malpractices, the Hayden health plan discourages them. Mr Donald Cameron-Have you finished?",119
205,Mr KENT,ITEM NUMBER DESCRIPTIONS,"No, but I shall finish with the honourable member in a minute. He should not be impatient. We can wait for his stupidity. Based on Medibank principles, the Hayden health plan has three important features: Firstly, it is universal, as everybody will be covered; secondly, it is equitable; thirdly, its simplicity will make it efficient in operation. It is this third feature of the Hayden health plan, its simplicity and efficiency, that will make laws such as the Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1982 redundant. We are opposed to the Fraser Government's practice which advocates giving a free rein to greed and provides every opportunity for cheating. It then turns around and imprisons-very selectivelysome of those who overdo it. Finding that this does not deter anyone, it wields the big stick of financial penalty by proposing to refuse health insurance benefits to the patients of doctors who have been proved on two or more charges to have committed medical benefit fraud. I am not sorry for dishonest medical practitioners, because I question the right of those people who lack basic decency and professional ethics to practise medicine. However, if we remove the temptation of greed, people will be less likely to succumb to it. I turn now to another matter. Whilst there is a marked difference between medical fraud and overservicing, there is a very thin line between overservicing and bad practice of medicine. Overservicing is inherent in fee-for-service medicine as practised in this country. Threats and penalties will not solve this problem as long as a blank cheque is given to private medical practitioners to determine their yearly income. How many times does it occur to us when we have a minor ailment and visit a doctor that we shall be given a prescription and be told by the doctor to come back again next week for a check? This second visit to the doctor is in many cases unnecessary. Many who have the time will go back to the crowded surgery, sit there for an hour, eventually pick up a germ or two, only to be told by the doctor that he or she is okay. I do not want to say that every doctor is practising medicine in this way, nor do I say that such practice of encouraging over-use of services is fraudulent. In many cases bad medical practice is not doing any harm to the patient's health, but it is certainly harming the nation's pocket. Had a patient gone to a health centre with the same ailment the salaried practitioner there would have had no special interest in asking him to come back, unless he was still troubled by the symptoms. A salaried doctor has no special interest in overservicing, as his pay will not increase with an increase in the number of visits. Having said that, I am not going to judge whether fee for service medicine or salaried practice has the higher professional standard. Suffice to say that in Fairfield hospital, one of the large public hospitals in Victoria, staffed by salaried specialists, when a private practitioner refers a patient to the hospital the staff there screw up his diagnosis, throw it into the waste paper basket and proceed to make their own tests. That is what the staff think of the diagnostic ability of private doctors. Be that as it may, about 50 per cent of the Australian people have the opinion that private fee for service medicine is more advantageous. At the same time the other 50 per cent, consisting mainly of younger people and migrants, are more satisfied with salaried medicine-assuming, quite rightly, that salaried medical practitioners are more dedicated to their profession as financial and business interests do not impair their professional judgment. Unfortunately, salaried practice is rarely available for those who want to use it as this Government is supporting private fee for service medicine only. As I said before, private fee for service medicine means an open cheque for medical practitioners to determine their own income. And if one looks into some waiting rooms of private specialists, furnished with antique furniture-in very expensive taste-one will understand why the medical care of the Australian nation is so expensive. The establishment of health centres staffed by salaried general practitioners would certainly have the effect of reducing health spending and restraining excessive private costs. The only hope of ever curbing overservicing is proper control over doctors' activities without impinging on the privacy of patients by the introduction of competition between salaried doctors and private medical practitioners. The Hayden health plan, through its support for community health, will lay a foundation for further development of a salaried medical service. It will ensure the patient right of choice of doctors, but the doctors will have only one paymaster. The Canadian experience teaches us that where there is only one paymaster it is much harder to get away with improper practices. The introduction of the new Hayden health plan based on the principles of Medibank will make this piece of legislation as redundant, archaic and irrelevant as its author, the Fraser Government.",120
206,Mr DONALD CAMERON ,ITEM NUMBER DESCRIPTIONS,"Fadden) (11.49)-In all seriousness I want to recall a bit of history on the performances of about 10 per cent of the medical profession. I am endeavouring not to be political in these comments, rather to be helpful to the Opposition, which seems to be wandering down the same disastrous track it followed back in the early 1970s when most of its supporters who are now sitting and smiling on the Opposition side were not members of this House. At that time the medical profession said that if the Australian Labor Party introduced its health plan the doctors would be the ones who would get rich. About 99 per cent of the members of the profession-I am trying to be moderate in my approach-warned that they would get rich. I am absolutely terrified because, in spite of the lessons, the Labor Party is talking about reintroducing the same scheme but with a few different frills. I make the observation that what Labor did caused the medical profession to enjoy a new high standard of living.",121
207,Mr HOWE ,ITEM NUMBER DESCRIPTIONS,Tell us when they didn't have a high standard of living. Mr Donald Cameron-Doctors have always had a better standard of living than the rest of the community as a result of their study and efforts. No thinking person in this chamber should deny them that. Mr Kent-They do very well.,121
208,Mr DONALD CAMERON,ITEM NUMBER DESCRIPTIONS,You have had your speech. I just want to make my comments.,121
209,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,ITEM NUMBER DESCRIPTIONS,Hon. J. D. M. Dobie )-Order! If the honourable member addresses his remarks through the Chair there may be fewer interjections.,121
210,Mr DONALD CAMERON,ITEM NUMBER DESCRIPTIONS,"I appreciate your assistance, Mr Deputy Speaker. Doctors have always enjoyed a higher standard of living, but the Opposition gave them a new level. The tragedy is that some of them, being human, simply could not give it away and have been possessed by greed. They continue to exploit the system. Approximately 90 per cent of honest doctors have a vested interest in hunting out the crooks. If it were established that one in 10 of any other profession-architecture, pharmacy, law, politics or the Public Service-was a crook, the entire system would collapse as public faith and trust would be eroded. One in lOis a remarkably poor performance for any profession. I simply make the observation to the medical profession that it has a vested interest in rooting out those who are exploiting the present system. The honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) made reference to a recent court judgement in Queensland which said that a doctor had only to have his mind 'on a particular patient to allow him to make a service charge. I have heard & report of a doctor in Queensland who, on Saturday mornings, arranges seances and prayer meetings which are conducted by his wife. He just pops in on those attending the seance-they are all pensioners-and says: 'How are you all going?' That is sufficient for him to make a charge. I do not understand how he could make a charge for that. But if the comments of the honourable member for Bonython are correct, that is probably the doctor's way of getting around the system. I am told that his wife hands around the pensioner medical service booklet, has everybody sign it and then it is up, up and away. That is the type of business which it is rumoured is going on. I have also heard about it from what I regard as a very reliable and, I might add, professional source. In 1980 a doctor wrote to me saying that he was most annoyed that the Commonwealth police were raiding surgeries and examining patient records. He said: 'I will never vote Liberal again while you people do this'. I must admit that I was a little tardy in replying because I received the letter during the election campaign and it was misplaced. But a few months later I found it and wrote back to him, as the continuing member, and said: 'Dear Doctor, I apologise for not having answered your letter, but I wish to take the points up. Would you please tell me how we can avoid the fraud that many members of your profession are reportedly indulging in?'. I did not get an answer. Being tenacious, I wrote to him again saying: 'Please tell me how we cope with what I regard as a real problem'. He continued to ignore my request. Whilst I have no intention of naming him, I suppose many people could conclude that his actions and reactions place him under an air of suspicion. I noticed that the honourable member for Bonython and the honourable member for Petrie ( Mr Hodges) generally praised the performance of the Australian Medical Association in the advice it has given in recent months. But I want to underline that it has been only in recent months. I have some recollection of public debate last year by the General Practitioners Society in Australia and the AMA in Sydney in which one doctors' association said that overservicing was going on. (a) Performance to date (b) Specially approved allocation of $21 m. grant (p. 28/90f 1981 report) (c) Arranged Reserves (p. 15) (d) Percentage allocation of $21 m. as at 30/6/81 (e) State by State percentage of Medibank Income for 80/81 (p.27/28) The AMA came out stoutly saying that it was not going on. It said it was just not happening. Then suddenly, earlier this year, we had this moment of enlightenment when the AMA confesses to all that many of its members have in fact been bringing discredit to the entire system. I observe simply that I find it remarkable that an organisation that is supposedly so close to its members was unaware of what was going on. Because of peer pressure or membership pressure it may well have been placed in a position where it was forced to ignore what was going on. That is almost all I wish to say on this subject. I conclude on this particular aspect of doctors' fraud by making mention of an early part of the second reading speech of the Minister. He said: The Government considers that a medical practitioner who has been proved to have committed medical benefits fraud on two or more charges is guilty of a most serious breach of trust and should be dealt with accordingly. One does not normally divulge conversations from one's own party room, but in a meeting I stood up-you will recall this, Mr Deputy Speaker-and said that I believed it should be one offence only. If anybody else in the community had one charge proved against him, he. would be a goner. I still cannot understand why doctors should be placed in a privileged position whereby two or more charges must be proven before they are subjected to the provisions of this legislation. Politicians, as we all know, have only to make one mistake and they are out-one mistake only and that is it. That applies generally to the rest of the community, and I am most critical of the enshrinement of the principle of two offences being required before action is commenced. The honourable member for Bonython made reference to my interest in Medibank. I seek leave of the House to have incorporated in Hansard a table in regard to Medibank which I have shown to the honourable member for Bonython. Leave granted. The table read asfollowsMEDIBANK AS AT 30.6.81 ($m) NSW Vic. Qld. SA WA Tas. Total -6.54 17.83 -8.63 -1.62 -0.62 -1.73 -1.31 3.58 10.82 2.75 1.95 1.90 21.00 -2.96 17.83 2.19 l.l3 1.33 0.17 19.69 17 51.5 13.1 9.3 9.1 100 39.2 35 13.8 5.2 4.6 2.2 100 (f) $2Im. would be allocated thus if (e) followed A Reserve Position based on equitable allocation of $21m. grant on a contribution income ratio The only state where Medibank has performed in a manner to to date had been the same as the other states a catastrophic allocated to Victoria, Victorians are being made to pay inflated (g) Management Expenses as a percentage of contribution income . . . .

211,Mr DONALD CAMERON,ITEM NUMBER DESCRIPTIONS,"After looking at the table which I have incorporated in Hansard one would understand why I am so concerned about the way Medibank has performed. I am also concerned about the fact that the Australian Labor Party has promised the people of Australia virtually to dismantle the entire private sector of the health system and to replace it with Medibank. The explanation of this table, for those people in high office who sometimes do not seem to understand tables and figures, is that it shows that in New South Wales in the last few years Medibank has lost $6.5m; in Queensland, more than $8.5m; in South Australia, more than $1.5m; in Western Australia, over half a million dollars; and, in Tasmania, in excess of$1.75m. The truth about Medibank is that, without Victoria, it would have gone bankrupt. It would have collapsed because its operations nationally, with the exception of that one State, have been a disaster. It terrifies me that the Labor Party is hell bent on returning to the system that was introduced in the mid-1970s and which proved such a dismal failure. So far as efficiency is concerned, the table indicates that in South Australia the management expenses of Medibank amounted to 22.7 cents per dollar of contribution income, compared with 9.2 cents for the major private health fund of that State. Thus, the cost of providing management services for Medibank was two and a half times that of providing them for the largest private health funds in Australia. The supporters of Medibank give us many explanations concerning the difficulties which it faces. I am afraid that at this hour I have not the opportunity to go into that in detail but I do observe that when the Labor Party went out of office in 1975 Medibank had access to every man and woman in this country. The fact that people left it and returned NSW Vic. Qld. SA WA Tas. Total 8.23 7.35 2.90 1.09 0.97 0.46 21 1.69 25.18 -5.73 -0.53 0.35 -1.27 19.69 meet reserve requirements is Victoria. If Victoria's performance situation would now exist. Because none of the $21 m. has been contribution rates to carry Medibank in the other states. 15.1 13.9 17.9 22.7 19.7 18.6 NA 13.3 9.8 9.2 8.6 13.3 to the private health funds in such numbers indicates that the people recognised the weaknesses of Labor's health scheme. Mr Robert Brown-What rubbish.",123
212,Mr DONALD CAMERON,HBA MBF MHA HBF MBF,"What rubbish, they say. They cannot even work out how much their health scheme will cost. In 1974-75 they said Medibank would cost a certain sum, but upon the scheme being introduced the cost suddenly escalated. The honourable member for Bonython - and I am not inviting him to talk-said earlier that Medibank had spent less than it budgeted for. The fact is that the budget was set at such high limits that nobody could have outspent it. With those few remarks I commend to honourable members the table which has been incorporated because it explains why I have been so concerned about the operation of Medibank. I assure honourable members that they will be hearing more from me on the subject.",123
