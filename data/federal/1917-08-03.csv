1,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I ask the Minister representing the Treasurer whether, yesterday, that right honourable gentleman held a secret meeting, from which the press was excluded, with certain persons likely to be affected by the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill,, and whether it is the policy of the Win-the-War Government to hold secret - meetings with persons likely to be affected by its taxation proposals \ [30]- 2",4
2,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do not know what happened yesterday in the matter referred to, but, speaking generally, it is the rule of this Government to seek information on any subject of public importance wherever, that information may be available. As to the Becrecy of conferences, I would remind the honourable member that he, while Treasurer, held many secret conferences.",4
3,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"By way of explanation, I wish to say that the press was never excluded from conferences held when I was Treasurer. I asked my question because I saw the statement in the newspaper that yesterday a deputation, headed by the honourable member for Corangamite, waited on the Treasurer to discuss the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill, and that the reporters were not permitted to be present at the proceedings. The Minister for the Navy says that I frequently held conferences, with the public of a secret character. That is a misstatement. I have been misrepresented by the Minister for the Navy, and, unhappily, he frequently misrepresents me. The public will remember that when a deputation of bankers wished to wait on me secretly, I refused to discuss public matters with tbem in secret, and invited the press to. be present, subsequently circulating copies of the report of the proceedings. Is the Prime Minister prepared to let us have a report of the-proceedings which took place yesterday,, when < the pastoralists waited on the Treasurer %",4
4,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I shall bring the request under the notice of the Treasurer as soon as I see him. X am sorry if I misrepresented the honourable member. If he did not seek conferences with persons able to inform him on matters of. public policy, except on the occasions when, no doubt for political reasons, he had the limelight turned on r",4
5,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Is the right honourable gentleman making a statement! If so, he should get permission. He is making an attack on me, against wbicb I ask for protection, Mr Speaker.",4
6,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I have been asked a question, and am answering it . I ' very much regret that the honourable member did not consult those who were able to inform him on matters relating to his administration. ' Mr HiG.es - I did not say that. EDITOR OE THE AGS.  aware that the reason why the Age newspaper is seeking by deliberate falsehoods to weaken the Win-the-War party is that its control has been handed over to a man born in Germany 1",4
7,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I am not aware.,5
8,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Is it not a fact that the only son of the man alleged by the honourable member for Echuca to have been born in Germany was killed at the war while fighting for the Allies?,5
9,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I believe that is so. NA HOUSE.,5
10,Mr BRENNAN,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I desire to address a question to you, Mr .Speaker. a fact that you have named certain persons as persons not to be admitted into this building, even though accompanied by honourable members of this House, and bearing the tickets of admission to the gallery which are distributed in your name by the Serjeant-at-Arms?",5
11,Mr SPEAKER,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"In consequence of the disturbance that occurred within the building yesterday, I have issued the in struction that no person who was engaged in that disturbance yesterday-and information was conveyed to me that arrangements had been made for a demonstration in force at Parliament House to-dayshall be admitted within the precincts of the House during its sittings, and I have taken steps to prevent any unseemly interference with the. proceedings of Parliament in other directions.",5
12,Mr MATHEWS,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I desire to know, Mr Speaker,, if I have the same privilege as any other honourable member of the House? If BO, I wish to know why two of my constituents to whom I gave tickets of admission obtained in the ordinary way have been refused admission to the gallery ?",5
13,Mr SPEAKER,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,Perhaps the House will permit me to make a statement in answer to the question.,5
14,Mr BRENNAN,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,I think that some explanation ought to be made..,5
15,Mr SPEAKER,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Unde r the Standing Orders the Speaker must be heard in silence. Yesterday afternoon an unseemly disturbance, in which a number of persons took part, occurred within the precincts of the House. Some of these persons, breaking through the barriers, entered portions of the building which are reserved for the sole use of honourable members, and forced themselves as far as the doors of this chamber, thus attempting to interrupt the proceedings of this Parliament. No Parliament could permit occurrences of that kind. I look to honourable members to support me - in preserving their rights and privileges from the invasion of individuals or bodies of persons, either inside or outside the House. I have given instructions to those who are in charge of the doors that such persons as may be recognised as having taken part in yesterday's disturbance shall not be permitted within the precincts while the House is Bitting, and that the passages and entrances are to be"" kept clear for the ingress and egress of members. I have done this in the Is it interests of all honourable members, for the sake of decency and the proper conduct of our proceedings, and to preserve the rights of Parliament from infringement, and I am supported in my action, not only by the precedents of this House, but also by the practice of the House of Commons. In support , of my statement. I refer honourable members to page 183 of the 11th edition of May, where, in a chapter relating to obstruction, it is set out thatTo facilitate the attendance of members without interruption, both Houses, at the commencement of each session, by order, give directions, that the Commissioners of the police of the metropolis shall keep, during a session of Parliament, the streets leading to the Houses of Parliament. free and open, and that no obstruction shall be - permitted to hinder the passage thereto of the lords or members. And, when tumultuous assemblages of people have obstructed the thoroughfares, lobby, or passages, orders have been given to the local authorities to disperse them. I sincerely trust that no honourable member has knowingly given tickets of admission to anybody who was responsible for disturbing the proceedings of the House yesterday. If that has been done, I regret it , and hope that it was done in ignorance of the fact that certain persons to whom tickets were given were concerned in the disturbance.",5
16,Mr MATHEWS,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,I deny that I gave my tickets to any one who caused the disturbance. M j - BBENNAN - I neither admit nor deny it .,5
17,Mr SPEAKER,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I think that I am voicing the general sense of the House in insisting that our proceedings shall be conducted with decorum, and be kept free from unseemly interruption.",5
18,Dr MALONEY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"In view of my not being able to give tickets to any one, may I ask, sir, if you have given - the order that citizens outside are not to be allowed to send i u written requisitions to their members? I know that there are fellowcitizens and constituents of mine outside, but I have not received cards from them.",6
19,Mr SPEAKER,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,I have given no such order.,6
20,Mr BRENNAN,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I rise to make a personal explanation. I submit that you, Mr Speaker, have misrepresented me in suggesting that I have desired to facilitate the entrance into this chamber of persons who were responsible for the disturbance here yesterday. I do not know who, if anybody, was responsible for the disturbance, if any, which is alleged to have taken place within the precincts yesterday.",6
21,Mr SPEAKER,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,The honourable member is going beyond a personal explanation in making a reflection on the Speaker. I made no charge or insinuation against the honourable member. What I said was that I trusted that honourable members had not knowingly given tickets of admission to those responsible for the disturbance. I mentioned no honourable member by name.,6
22,Mr BRENNAN,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"If I was out of order, I am sorry. I desire to conclude what I rose to say. It is that the present order in excluding the lady friends of honourable members",6
23,Mr SPEAKER,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"The honourable member is not now making a personal explanation, but is reflecting upon, and misrepresenting, the Chair. Personal explanations must refer to matters in which an honourable member has been misrepresented or misunderstood, and must relate to proceedings which have taken place in the House. The honourable member is out of order.",6
24,Mr BRENNAN,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I apologize if I have transgressed the rules. I wish to draw a distinction between what you imputed to me,, in the remarks you made, and what I wished to elicit from you by the question that I addressed to you a little while ago. My question was-and this is where I wish to show that I was misrepresented - whethe r you, sir, take it upon yourself to say that certain persons, ladies or gentlemen, to whom tickets have been issued in the ordinary way, are to be excluded, although accompanying members of the House?",6
25,Mr SPEAKER,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"When my attention was drawn to the fact that tickets had been issued to certain members of the public, who were concerned in a disturbance in this building yesterday, I gave in structions that those persons were not to be admitted to the precincts of the House. That instruction will be carried out, I hope, with the concurrence and support of every member of the House.",6
26,Mr JH CATTS,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I have been outside the chamber, and have ascertained from the doorkeepers that the blue tickets issued by honourable members to give admission to the chamber are not being honoured. There is a general refusal by the doorkeepers to admit any person with tickets; no discrimination at all is being shown. The fact that these tickets have been issued by members on this side of the House is sufficient to prevent anybody entering the building. Is that your intention, sir?",6
27,Mr SPEAKER,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,I shall not allow a general debate on this question. The Speaker exercises his discretion in these matters. I have given no orders which will exclude everybody in the possession of tickets issued by honourable members. My instruction related only tp those who were responsible for creating a disturbance yesterday.,6
28,Dr MALONEY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I rise to a question of privilege. I asked you, sir, whether citizens are prevented from sending in their names to honourable members. The parliamentary officer informed me that there was no such embargo. I went outside, and found that there were only policemen at the front door, and they said that no names were allowed to be sent in to honourable members. I asked, "" Is no arrangement made whereby people can get cards to send to their members?"" and the answer I received was "" No."" I then told the people waiting outside that you, sir, had said they had the right to send their cards in to honourable members. As every citizen has a right to send his name and a request to a member of this House, I ask you, sir, to give instructions that cards be provided at the front door on which citizens may address their messages to their representatives in Parliament.",6
29,Mr SPEAKER,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I have issued no i istructions that the constituents of honoris able members are not to send their names into their representatives. The instrucrespect tion I gave refers to the admission people who were known to have attempted members. to make a disturbance in the House, and later it was reported to me that, apto do? parently attracted by the prospects of disorder, some undesirable male charorable acters found their way into yesterday, and were in evidence outside its precincts this morning.",7
30,Mr BKENNAN,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,ITames ! they* ',7
31,Mr SPEAKER,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,It is not the vince of the Speaker to debate matters with honourable members.,7
32,Mr FENTON,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,-This is a wholesale in sult to the public.,7
33,Mr SPEAKER,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,Order !,7
34,Mr FENTON,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,So it is.,7
35,Mr SPEAKER,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,Order !,7
36,Mr FENTON,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,You have mentioned no names.,7
37,Mr SPEAKER,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"The honourable member must not interrupt me while I am on my feet, or I shall name him.",7
38,Mr FENTON,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,There is a gross insult; it is general.,7
39,Mr SPEAKER,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"As the honourable member for Maribyrnong will not obey the instructions of the Chair I name him, and I ask the Prime Minister to take the necessary action. Mr BLAKETJEY.",7
40,Mr SPEAKER,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"The honourable member is out of order, and I ask him not to interject .again.",7
41,Mr MATHEWS,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,N a m e him.,7
42,Mr SPEAKER,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,Order !,7
43,Mr HUGHES,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,I never rise without great reluctance to perform this most painfu l duty which devolves upon the Prime Minister. I trust that the honourable member for Maribyrnong will make such amends to the Chair as will render it unnecessary for me to take furthe r action.,7
44,Mr FENTON,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,What does the Speaker want? He is insulting citizens.,7
45,Mr HUGHES,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I make that suggestion to the honourable member; happily, I have made it with some success on former occasions, and I trust that it is not necessary to point out to a man like the honourable member more than that the Speaker must be obeyed, and that we have n - to pay that respect to the Ohair which essential for .the orderly conduct of a deliberative body like this. In payingto the Chair we really pay respect of to the institution of which we are",7
46,Mr FENTOIT,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,What do you wish me,7
47,Mr HUGHES,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,What I ask the honmember to do is what he ought to the House do-to obey the Chair.,7
48,Mr FENTON,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"What do you want? ""Who were Mr HUGHES - The honourable member should apologize to the Chair for havproing disobeyed Mr .Speaker.",7
49,Mr FENTON,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"All r i g h t : I regret my action, and apologize. .ADJOURNMENT (Formal). UNEMPLOYMENT AND COST OF LIVING .",7
50,Mr TUDOR,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"1 desire to move the adjournment of the House, in order to draw attention to a definite majtter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The great amount of misery in our midst caused through want of employment and the increased cost of l i v in g . "" Five honourable members having risen in their places,",7
51,Mr TUDOR,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Yarra) [11.24] - I move That the House do now adjourn. I regret exceedingly that, in a country like Australia, there should be any necessity for moving a motion of this kind. Having regard to th& great number of men who, having enlisted, are absent from Australia,: there ought to be for those who remain at home unequalled opportunities of obtaining employment. Some honourable members may ask, "" Why do not those who are unemployed go to war?"" The writer of a recent letter to one of the newspapers argued that there was no need to find employment for the people who are seeking it , because there is .a chance for everybody to go to the war. I understand that one factor which haa drawn particular attention to the unemployment difficulty is the dismissal of 1,200 employees from the Colonial Ammunition Company's works. Of that total, .700 are women. I do not know what is the -.station in l if e of the other 500, but I - do know that there is .not onehonorablee member representing a metropolitan conlike stituency who keeps in touch with his stituents, or lives, as I do, in the metropolitan area, but has many unemployed persons coming to him-me n who are equally underits good citizens as any in the community. 1 could mention many cases of unemploycent ment on the part of married men and reform turned soldiers. Some of the latter are slightly incapacitated, and are a. small pension; but, as honourable bers know, these pensions do not last ever, and can be reviewed from time to time. Many of those men are unable to of get work. Numbers of married men who by Mr. have large responsibilities have endearaising voured to enlist. One man who came to me the other day had three times tried enlist, and each time had. been rejected. He is a married man with three children. He had been employed in one of the Devery hard. Mr. partments for a few months, but was going given notice that his services would be dispensed with to make room for a returned soldier. That, the Government's-policy; but I contend that married men who have responsibilirelative to Mr. ties, and are unable to go to the Front, have as much claim to be looked after has any other member of the community.",7
52,Mr WEBSTER,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,Would you give marrent of a property. ried men preference over returned soldiers ?,8
53,Mr TUDOR,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I would not turn out a rent married man with responsibilities in order detriment to make room for a single man. were asked to dismiss a man with from three to six children dependent on him in order to give place to a single man, would not dp it , and I do not care what use is made on the public platform of my attitude in that respect.",8
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Does the honourable member believe in the converse of thatthat when men have to be discharged, - single men sliould go first?",8
55,Mr TUDOR,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I say that a married - man has larger responsibilities than has a single-man. We are told that when men .go to the Front their dependants are proto tected so that their rents shall not be i creased. On the 3rd May of this year, I wrote to the Secretary of the Attorneythe Oeneral's Department as follows:Mr Richmond, has three sons at the Front, and one has returned. He has had Diis rent raised 2s. per week; and desires' Iknow whether the' raising ofrent in a case 775 this i» contrary to the Moratorium Reguconlations. I shall be glad if you will advise me if that is the case. The Secretary replied, on the 9 th May, as I have the honour to acknowledge the reof your letter of the 3rd instant re the case of Mr Richmond, and to inyou that the question of the raising of rents is not covered by the War Precaution's receiving (Moratorium) Regulations. memOn the 9th May, I again wrote to the for Secretary, to the following effect:I desire to invite your attention to my letter the 3rd instant relative to inquiries made , Richmond, regarding the of his rent. Mr , has seen 1 me again, and told me that he is. going into i-amp_ immediately, also that he has had notice to to quit the house. He would like to know, as early as possible, whether the landlord is entitled toraise the rent. The case seems has three sons at the Front, and one returned, and now he is into camp.. I shall be much obliged if you will treat, this matter as very urgent. The Secretary to the Department replied of course, is on the l l t f i MayIn reply to your letter of the Oth instant, , I desire to inform you that neither the War Precautions (Moraas torium) Regulations, nor the War Precautions (Active Service Moratorium) Regulations, preclude a landlord from raising the Careful consideration was given to the question of dealing,, in the interests of soldiers, with the question of the increase of of dwelling-houses, but the difficulty was to prevent such a regulation reacting to the of soldiers' dependants desiring to If I rent a d\velling?house. It may be added' that no proceedings for ejectment can be brought against a soldier's I dependant without leave of the Court. I submitted the matter to the Prime M in ister on the 1.1th. July, and received an acknowledgment from the Secretary to his Department on the same day, but I have not heard anything further on the subject from the Prime Minister. Unemployment is rife in our midst. I am sorry that I was not able to remain at the deputation that . waited on the Prime Minister yesterday,, but according the Argus report the Prime Minister is n - reported to have said to the deputationThere were some men in Australia who did nothing but stir up disorder, and the sooner Trades Hall cut them out the better.",8
56,Mr CORSER,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Hear, , hear!",8
57,Mr TUDOR,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"That remark applies to to bothsides-to the Employers Federation as well as to the workers. There are men among the employers who do their best to stir up strife. Speaking with a very great deal of experience, and as a trade union official in at least three continents, I can say that I have never known of the case of an official of a trade organization advocating a strike; but I have been locked out by employers on more than one occasion. I appeal to honourable members opposite who were Labour members, and who were connected with Labour organizations, to bear out what I say. I have never known of the officials of Labour organizations advocating strikes.  delegates in the country ? The man who opposed me during the recent election created a strike.",8
58,Mr TUDOR,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"The honourable member has never been in a Labour organization, but I appeal to other honourable members on his side who have been connected with Labour organizations. They will admit that they have never known of instances of officials of Labour organizations, or of the executive committees of those organizations, advocating a strike.",9
59,Mr HUGHES,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,I do not admit anything of the sort:,9
60,Mr TUDOR,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"When industrial trouble occurs, in nine cases out of ten it is due to the rank, and file compelling the executive officers of the. organization to take action, even though they have been doing their best to prevent it , and to settle the dispute amicably. We are told by the Prime Minister that there are some men whom it would be better for the Labour organizations to cut out. not going to say that a man, no matter whether he be a member or an official of a trade union or of the Employers Federation, will not make mistakes; but I would rather be on the side of the officials of the trade union who make mistakes thanon the side of the Employers Federation, some ofwhom are doing their best to create unemployment.",9
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,Why is the honourable member raising this question now ? Will doing so give relief ?,9
62,Mr TUDOR,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"No ; but when these people are attacked I have the right to defend them, as they are not here to defend themselves. The Prime Minister is reported to have said that these men should be cut out of the Labour organizations. I , did not hear him say it , because I was unable to remain at the deputation.",9
63,Mr HUGHES,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"The honourable member introduced the deputation,, and promised that it would not last more than a quarter of an hour. He was seven minutes late, and he brought in 200 people when I expected half-a-dozen, and then he went away.",9
64,Mr TUDOR,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I certainly did not promise that the deputation would last no longer than a quarter of an hour. If I made that promise, it was given three weeks ago in regard to a deputation of three secretaries from the Trades H all Council. That deputation waited on the Prime Minister and endeavoured to arrange for the subsequent deputation which I asked the Prime Minister in the precincts of the House to receive. I certainly did not make any promise in regard to the latter deputation.",9
65,Mr HUGHES,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,It may be as the honourable member says.,9
66,Mr TUDOR,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"The deputation was originally fixed for 11 o'clock, but the hour was altered by the Prime Minister, as he had a right to do, because be had a meeting to attend. I also had a meeting to attend, and I told the conveners of the deputation that I had to get away. I deliberately cut out the whole of my remarks, and those of other honourable members of Parliament, and let the members of the deputation put their case before the Prime Minister. According to a report in the Melbourne Herald, the Prime Minister - said that agitators have stirred up strife, and thus created unemployment in our midst. Let us take the case of one VicI am torian factory, from which larger numbers have been discharged and thrown out of employment than have been discharged from other factories. I refer to the ammunition works. I have yet to learn that there has been an industrial dispute in that particular factory for the last eighteen years. The employees in that factory have gone right through' the war without any industrial trouble. It is certainly not due to any industrial strife that they have been thrown out of work. I understand that the statement was made yesterday that so many cartridges were not required because Australia was not sending so many troops to the Front. ' That statement is absolutely absurd, because there are just as many Australian troops in the firing line today as there have ever been. If . on the other hand, the reason that we cannot manufacture so many cartridges as formerly is because the raw material cannot be obtained, there is a greater responsibility on the Government. They claim that they will allow capital to be invested only as they direct. W it h that policy I have no faul t to f in d ; it is the proper attitude for any Government to take up during war time; but when a Government will not permit capital to be invested except as they direct, the duty is cast upon them to see that people are not turned out of employment when opportunities present themselves for finding employment for them. Here let me quote from some remarks made by the Prime Minister in "" The Case for and against the Federal Referendum,"" issued in September, 1915The war is largely responsible for the greatly increased cost of living; it has already caused much unemployment. As time passes this must inevitably increase. He proceeds on other pages of the pamphlet to show in very fine language how the cost of living had gone up as it is going up today, and I claim that this increased cost of living makes things more difficult for the people who are unemployed. In his figures relating to the cost of living, Mr Knibbs deals with foodstuffs and rent only, but are there no other things that people require? We all know that the cost of foodstuffs used by the average f a m i l y has increased by at least 50 per - cent. Mr Murphy, the Chief Inspector of Factories in Victoria, who cannot be said to be a man connected wit h the Labour party, delivered an address on Monday evening last, in which he proved that, while the cost of living in Victoria had increased by 50 per cent - wha t applies to Victoria applies all over the Commonwealth-the increase in wages had been 39 per cent. only. Mr Murphy said that the workers were 11 per cent, worse off today than in pre-war days. If the position in Victoria and in the other States is bad in relation to those who 'are employed, how much worse must it be for those who are not able to find employment ? . That is why I ask the Government to realise their responsibility in this matter.",9
67,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,Did Mr M u r p h y make the comment that the workers are worse off ?,10
68,Mr TUDOR,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Yes , to the extent of - great 11 per cent.",10
69,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I know that he pointed out the difference in the figures, but did he go on to make the comment that the worker was so much worse off ?",10
70,Mr TUDOR,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"It does not matter whether Mr Murph y made that deduction or not; the figures are absolutely plain. The cost of living has increased by 50 per cent., whereas wages have only increased by 39 per cent., and I think that Mr Murphy said that the workers were worse off than they were before the war.",10
71,Mr WEBSTER,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,I think that the in crease in wages was given as 39 per cent.,10
72,Mr TUDOR,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I am not particular as to a few decimal points. I believe that the figures which Mr Murph y gave ranged between 38 per cent, and 39 per cent. My point is that if the people who are employed are 11 per cent, worse off than they were before the war, what is the position of those who are unemployed ? While we all regret what has happened in Russia, and rejoice that women have stepped into the breach, surely We in Australia are not going to say that our women should step in and fill the breaches. These women are unemployed, but they cannot go to the war.",10
73,Mr WEBSTER,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Does the honourable member mean "" breeches "" ?",10
74,Mr TUDOR,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"This is too serious a subject for the Postmaster-General to try to be funny about. It is all very well for a man to sneer at the workers, andl talk about a difference of 1 per cent, in certain figures, when he gets into such company that he is sure of the support of .the Employers Federation and the squat, ters. If I were the honourable member I would be ashamed to be found in such company or to sneer at the workers as he is doing. I have no intention of occupying the half-hour that is allowed to me by the Standing Orders, but there are other honourable members, not only Victorian, but also representatives of other States, who realise the seriousness of the position as I do. Eighteen months age, some fourteen months after the war had started, the Prime Minister said, in better language than I can useMany have made, and are still making, great fortunes out of the war; many more are making higher profits than in peace time; and, despite protestations to the contrary, surprisingly few companies and capitalists have been seriously affected by the war. Yet we are asked why these people complain because they cannot find employment and because the cost of living has increased.",10
75,Mr WBHSSTEK,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,Why does not the honourable member admit that much has since been doue to ameliorate that condition of affairs?,11
76,Mr TUDOR,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I am prepared to admit that something has been done, but I am looking ahead, and am anxious to know what will be done in the future.  when you were in office?",11
77,Mr TUDOR,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"On e man i u the Cabinet cannot do much against the others. I did my share, .and, .at any rate, I took the step of giving up office. When the honourable member for Corangamite was addressing his constituents he said, "" We can thank the conscription campaign for one thing-it got r i d of Frank Tudor from the Customs Department."" He was speaking in a butter-producing district, and the inference was that, with my departure from the Department, they would be able to put up the price. The price of butter in Australia this year is higher than it was during a year of my term of office. This year 72,000,000 lbs. have been exported oversea, while last year only one-fifth of that quantity was sent away. I regard as a good testimonial to my administration the statement that these people were glad that I had left the Department. I am not sorry for what I did as Minister for Trade aud Customs in connection with the regulation of the export of butter, meat, and other commodities.",11
78,Mr ATKINSON,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,The honourable member does not regret what he did to prevent the dairy farmers getting the full reward of - their labour ?,11
79,Mr TUDOR,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I do not regret the efforts I made to see that the people of Australia as a. whole got a fair deal by preventing speculators from creating an. artificial shortage in the Commonwealth with the object of raising the price of butter to the local consumer. I did my best to prevent anything of that kind while I was in office, and I do not hesitate to say that if the opportunity ever offers I shall do so again. Several honourable members interjecting,",11
80,Mr SPEAKER,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,I remind honourable members once again that when the Speaker calls for order it is not permissible 'that interjections should immediately follow. If honourable members persist ii> interjecting the .good order and procedure of the House will be entirely disturbed.,11
81,Mr TUDOR,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"This is a subject on which honourable members doubtless feel keenly, and judging by what has happened this morning, together with yesterday's occurrences there are many people in the community who feel just as keenly concerning it . There are amongst the supporters of the Government honourable members who, like members of the Opposition, know what it means for the head of a household to be out of work. When there is no money coming in-whe n once a week the landlord keeps knocking at the door, when household goods have to disappear, and the little ones have to go short- I am not going to say to people so circumstanced, "" You must not indulge in any demonstration with the object of making known your plight to the whole community, and of showing what is going on here."" My chief complaint against the people who have suffered, and are suffering, in this community, is that they suffer too loug in silence. The great bulk of the unemployed do not come'forward to make their troubles known. It is left to the few who feel the pinch most severely to voice their troubles. As one who has known what it is to be unemployed-wh o has been willing to sell his skilled labour, not to the best advantage, but practically on any fair terms, and has been unable to do so; as one who has gone out day after day and week after week looking for work, and has had to return home with the same old story of the impossibility of finding any- I do not object to people making public the fact that they are unemployed. I have dealt with ""the case of married men with' three, four, and five children to be maintained-som e - of them have as many as five sons at the warand surely they have a right to have their claims voiced in this House. In view of the fact that the prices of not only foodstuffs, but practically every article of household use today have increased, is it any wonder that the people complain ? I invite honourable members opposite to ask their wives what increases have occurred in the prices of various household commodities, apart altogether from foodstuffs. Let them ask for the increase in the prices of various imported goods. Mr R.iLEY - Tak e the increase* in the price of boots and clothing... Mr TTJ1D0R - I was about to mention that. Bosieryi for instance, costs three times as much as it did in pre-war days. The skeins of wool which our wives, daughters, a*id sisters use in ' knitting socks, for soldierscost nearly treble as much as they did in pre-war time. That increase' is not. due merely to the increase' in. the price of wool. ""Then again,, the puice of boots and leather goods generally has gone up. Prices all round have increased. As the Prime* Ministei: said, in the pamphlet to which I have referred,, prices are increasing, and some men who pose as patriots give £ 5 to the patriotic funds, and fleece, the public of £5,000 by high prices."" The grievances under which the people are labouring today are unemployment on the one hand, and the increased cost of \ livingon the other. While I appreciate . as much as does any honourable member the difficulties that confront a Government in dealing with such a problem, I recognise, at the same time, that, asinerri!- to such men. bera of this Parliament, no matter on what side of the House w.e sit, we have a responsibility to the people which cannot be disregarded. Men and women who are ableand willing to work today should not be'feeling the pangs of hunger in a country like Australia which in these war times is practically producing more in the way of foodstuffs than is any other country in the world.",11
82,Mr HUGHES,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Bendigo-Prime M i nister and Attorney-General) [11.50] - I do not complain of the action of the Leader of the Opposition in moving the adjournment of the House to discuss this matter, since iti affords an opportunity of discussing one phase of this dreadful war and of driving home to all sorts and conditions of men and women in the community what are and must be its inevitable consequences. I said yesterday to a deputation of men and women who came to see me that they seemed to have forgotten that we were at war, and to have imagined that during this struggle things would go on precisely as they had before. I would say to the House and the country, as I said to a meeting of business men yesterday afternoon, that we have much to be thankful for. Of all the belligerent countries we havesuffered the least. Wemay well be thankful for this when we compare our situation with that of our Allies in Belgium . It is impossible to convey by words any adequate idea of the sufferings, the hardships, and the horrors those people have endured. I urged organized labour to respond to Vandervelctt's appeal to the working classes of the world to help the organized labourers of Belgium who had been, and were then being forcibly sent out of their country like dumb driven cattle, sold in Germany, and compelled to work for 3d. per day. I full y expected that Australian organized labour would respond to that piteous appeal. Not one responded. Organized labour throughout Australia has callously ignored the appalling condition of organized labour in Belgium, sufferingunder the lash of this cruel monster Germany. What does it mean to those in Australia ? Nothing ! It does not affect the political fortunes, of the junta. It . puts nothing into the hands of those who arerunning industrial unionism in Australia. It meant nothing They looked upon it as upon a cinema show passing on the screen. I said yesterday, and I say now, that all sorts and conditions of men and women in this country have much to be t h a n k f ul for. War has passed over us and has done us little harm. I am not going to say for that reason that we should not consider and deal with such conditions of unemployment as exist and not do what we can to relieve those who suffer from unemployment. I can say as much as most men caai about unemployment and poverty. I have felt their effects. I know what they really mean. I do not think any member of this House has had a wider experience than myself of what they mean. I have ' been down into the abyss. The passage of years can never obliteratemy memory of those days. I can never, and shall never, look on the picture of unemployment and poverty except through' the atmosphere created by the memory of. that time. When these men and women came to me yesterday I said I was ready, and I am ready now, to do anything that - is open to me, as a practical man, to relieve the distress. Whether or not thab distress be as great as depicted is immaterialI f it exists at all it ought not to exist for a day longer if we cam prevent it. We should go on with all the work at our disposal. I spoke yesterday of some of . this work-the work of building silos for the storage of wheat and flour-which will shortly be put in hand. Although there is somo conflict of opinion among the uniou3 concerned with regard to ship building, I feel fairly confident that before very long we shall be able to start this great national enterprise. That, however, is in the womb of time. Shipbuilding is au industry that would-so far at all events as boilermakers, engineers, and metal workers of various kinds are concerned-absor b all the available labour. And having done that it would make a very .material difference in the condition of the labour market generally. I.was struck yesterday by the paucity of practical suggestions made by the deputation which waited upon me. There were only two that I could seize upon. One was that we should resume the manufacture of ammunition. There was a protest against the closing down of the Colonial Ammunition Works. amazed me yesterday was the inconsistency of people who to my certain knowledge were pacifists; who go about howling and tearing down the very skies in favour of peace. And yet. these very turbulent lovers of peace, ithese haters of war, calmly asked me to re-open the ammunition works-to make bullets and cartridges with which to kill human beings. I have never heard of anything more hopelessly inconsistent. I exclude from this censure altogether those who merely want employment and who have taken up an attitude consistent with that of Australia generally in this war-that is to say. they are for Australia, for the Empire, and for this - war. It is perfectly proper for them to say "" Give us work in this ammunition factory."" But as to those who have gone through the country talking about peace and who now ask us to go on with the work of making explosives-bullet s and cartridges-word s are feeble things to portray their inconsistency. Another gentleman at the deputatries; tion said that a lot of men and women were reputed to be suffering. He handed me a piece of iron ore, sary, and he said that as a panacea for immediate unemployment in Melbourne we should develop the iron deposits - Gippsland. I ask any practical manMr Hughes. any one who has a knowledge of the world j-to say' how many human beings would be relieved by the development of a project which cannot mature for years. Supposing we did start to develop the iron mines of Gippsland, how long would it be before men living in the constituency of the Leader of the Opposition would get employment? One of two things is obvious-eithe r this distress is acute or it is hot. If it is acute, there must be some employment to give immediate relief. Anybody could propose, for instance, that we develop our brown coal, our iron fields, or this, that, or the other industry; but while the development is going on the people are starving.",12
83,Mr JH CATTS,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,What about the Federal Capital? Is there no employment there?',13
84,Mr HUGHES,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I am not going to say anything about the Federal Capital; that obviously does not fall into the same class as the iron mines. Having stated that we are prepared to What push on with all despatch with the erection of wheat silos, flour stores, and, I hope-the unions consenting-wit h shipbuilding-whic h three projects together will have a material effect on unemployment- I desire to very shortly review the position in which the country finds itself. We are told to provide employment, and do this, that, or the other; but every honourable member knows that the financial position in which the States and the Commonwealth find themselves today is such as to compel the most rigid economy. The supply of money has been cut short; and it is now practically impossible to borrow anywhere except for war purposes. The necessity for economy is obvious; and I think I am entitled to point out that during the past three years money has been circulated in Australia more freely, perhaps, than during any other similar period. Something has been said about providing employment by starting new indusand on this two observations have to be made. One is that, in order to start new industries, new capital is necesand capital is not easily obtained at this juncture. The other is that the State, as such, can do little or nothing; of and in order that new industries may be developed in this country, we must turn over a new industrial leaf. It is absolutely essential that the present continual interruption of work must cease. I do not now speak of those great upheavals which, from time to time, shake the industrial edifice, but of the frequent stoppages which disorganize industry, discourage enterprise, and are, in fact, a sort of creeping industrial paralysis. I take the coal industry as a type. It will be remembered that about eight or nine months ago there was a great strike in the coal industry, when the men demanded an eight-hour day from bank to bank, and certain other conditions. A Board was appointed, and the men got all they asked for, without, practically, the cost of a penny to themselves. That tribunal has proved a convenient and effective instrument, ready at the beck and cull of any lodge to settle every dispute; and the wages that the miners have since earned are very much higher than they"" were before. The men have not stopped altogether, but first ""one lodge, then another, aird another, stopped, and the effect has been just the same as if *a general stoppage had occurred. I am not goiug to say that this is part of a .conspiracy or plan, but I do say that the effect on the coal industry has been deplorable. While on this matter I wish to say that the men actually threatened to stop work because the Government were piling up stacks of coal. In this very House, both the honourable member for Hunter and the honourable member for Newcastle asked me to provide employment for the Newcastle miners. We did that, and we have given such orders on behalf of the Imperial Government for coal for the overseas Fleet as would keep the mines going. But because we did this the miners threatened to strike. Extension of time granted.",13
85,Mr HUGHES,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I am sorry I was led into the subject of coal stoppages, but has relation to what I was about to say. The question of whether we are to launch out on any new industries depends entirely on whether, if a man, or it may be a Government, when they put capital into any enterprise, can have the assurance of that enterprise being carried on uninterruptedly. All this arraignment of private enterprise is so much bunkum, because strikes are just as frequent in Government employment as in private employment. Curiously peared. enough, at the very moment of this discussion-and it is a scathing comment on the whole business-ther e is a great strike in New South Wales. That strike is not against the private employer-it is not against a reduction of wages, or starvation or sweating wages, but a protest against the introduction of some card system, about the merits of which I know absolutely nothing, and, I venture to say, about which very few j>eople know anything. I lay it down as a basic condition precedent to the industrial health of this country, that there must be continuity of industrial operations. If the Government, or the individual employer, is assured that men will work continuously, and that an industry will not be stuck up at the sweet will of the employees, or of one or two of them, there will then be a readiness to take those proper and ordinary risks incidental to industrial and commercial operations. Why should a man launch out, and take any risks beyond those he has to take, in any case? At present, if a. man ventures his capital in an industry, he does not know from day to day whether there will be a strike. As the result of long negotiations, we have been able to sell the output of Australian zinc. This has been the means of securing the employment of thousands of miners who otherwise would have been idle. But it is well within the bounds of possibility that these mines may close any day. One day last week, or the week before, the men there had a day off. I do not know what that dispute was about- I have forgotten; but it was a protest about something. They closed the mines; they did not bother about the industry, or realise that, in order to induce men to invest large capital, it is it essential there should be continuity of operations, and that the market, once obtained, should be diligently nursed. Take, again, the coal export trade. How are we going to keep the South American and Eastern trade when, directly the market has been obtained, a strike occurs? This gives an opportunity for America and Japan, and other countries, to step in ; and when we have settled our domestic differences, the market has disap",14
86,Mr TTJDOB,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"The * South American coal trade has not been lost on account of any 1 trouble with the men, but on account of the high freights that are ruling. The Prime Minister knows that as well as I do.",15
87,Mr HTJG,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"HES - Whateve r differences the. Leader of the Opposition may have with me, he is very well aware that there are very few things connected with the handling of goods, and water-side business generally, that I do not know. I do not wish, to tread on any one's corns, but I say that hardly a day goes by without a stoppage of work on some wharf or other in Australia. One of our greatest industries is the pastoral industry. Britain requires our frozen beef and mutton. The Runic and the Medic were loading, the one at Newcastle, and the other nt Brisbane; and, although freight is very scarce, and this trade is of the most vital importance to the pastoralists, the country, and the Empire, the men absolutely refused to work after a certain, hour unless they were paid a rate in excess of the minimum. That sort of thing occurs every day; and, no matter what is done, we cannot get a settlement of industrial conditions. I ask unionists whether this is a sensible, business-like way of carrying on their affairs. It is. not. The truth is that in every union 95 per cent. of the men would go on working uninterruptedly but for the 5 per cent..who seize hold of any pretext to cause a stoppage^ These men are parasites on unionism, they live on it ; they are leading it to struction, and, if any man dares to raise his voice in favour of peace, he is called a ""scab"" and a ""blackleg."" I have been concerned in strikes with the honourable member for Barrier. I know the kind of man he is. There never was a movement amongst the wharf labourers in Sydney while he was there in which he was not one for ""knocking of f "" rather than for ''knocking on."" Such men are an absolute curse to unionism. The unionists of Australia, taking them by-and-large, are loyal men; and I venture to say they can do more work than the average English workman, and would do it, were it not for a lot of pestiferous persons who instil the poisonous doctrine of ""go slow"" into their ears. Now that the movement has become powerful, and can be lived on, these men, unlike the men of old who suffered for unionism, batten upon it and suck out its life's blood. There is now much talk of unemployment, but if the unions would only get rid of these men, there would be very little unemployment in the country, and great good would accrue to the community as a whole. The honourable member for Barrier has now moved from Sydney to Broken Hill ; and, certainly, the people there stand a great many things. What, between the great heat, the dynamite fumes, and their other conditions of life, and now on top of all these the honourable member himself, I have a soft-spot in my heart for the Broken. Hill miner. No matter what foolish things he does, I feel always inclined to deal leniently with him when I remember the circumstances under which he lives and works'. Unemployment r arises too largely from those conditions about which I have spoken. .A word as to high prices. I shall not retract one word I ever said, against men who exploit the people. There are men in this country who mouth about patriotism and fill their pockets, and I am not going to mince, words in my remarks' about them. They fall into the same class as those parasites on 'unionism of which I have spoken. They are a disgrace to the class to which they belong, and to society, which in the main is healthy. That great body of - public opinion in this country which partly expressed itself on 5th May last in favour of sane, rational governde- ment, will rejoice in the downfall of both those - sections-the men who live on the people and the men who prey upon unionism. They are both a curse to the co""try, and the sooner they are put out of it the better for the welfare of Australia. I would rejoice in the opportunity, if I had it, to deport both classes. The Government will do all in its power to push on with work that will give immediate relief to the people. I cannot credit that there is any actual want in Melbourne, but if there is, and there are means of relieving it, we will relieve it.",15
88,Mr MATHEWS,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Melbourne Ports) [12.19] - The Prime Minister sneered at the paucity of the arguments and suggestions of the deputation yesterday. Immediately they arrived in the room, at twenty-five minutes, to eleven, the Prime Minister said, "" Ladies and gentlemen, I must be out ""of here at ten minutes to eleven,"" so that the deputation was allowed exactly a quarter of an hour to explain the existence of unemployment and to offer suggestions to relieve it . In the face of that fact how can the Prime Minister say that there was a paucity of suggestions? How about the paucity of his own suggestions on the question today ? Prom start to finish his speech was wholly and solely a condemnation of unionism for the attitude it has taken up in the endeavour to benefit the conditions of the workers, and the Prime Minister makes that attitude an excuse for not attempting to alleviate the unemploymenb in our midst today. That is the sort of thing we have to expect from him; and it is quite worthy of him . ""We are at war, and the whole of the war ought to be financed out of borrowed money if it is necessary to use local taxation to keep the people in employment. But we are told by this Government and every State Government that the only way to square the finances is to economize, and their idea of economy is to throw thousands out of work. Australia, in the southern seas, is far away from the rest of the world, and we are not getting money expended here for supplying commodities to the troops. A cable was published recently to the effect that the Allies were i spending in America £2,000,000 per day for commodities required by the armies in Europe - By contrast, how few pounds are spent in Australia for the supply of commodities to our own men at the Front? The Prime Minister vesterday said to the deputation, "" Y o u don't want men to en- list, and you won't let them enlist. How, then, can you expect us to get the necessary commodities^ for the troops here?"" If the Ministry liked to' make inquiries, they would find that Australia is not manufacturing enough clothing,, underclothing, boots, saddlery, and other leather work to supply one division, let alone the whole of our 300.000 men at the Front, with goods which it , is essential for them to have. The dearth of employment here is practically economic conscription, bnt it is not men able to go to the Front who are being thrown out of work. ' Those who are being thrown out of work through the cry for .economy are men whom the military authorities will not accept for service, and women. We all know that at the .back of this policy is the desire of the Government and those who placed them in power to create in Australia such an economic position that men and women will be prepared to take any wages. The Prime Minister knows that the object of every strike instituted in this country by the workers' organizations is to better their conditions, and not to allow any in roads by .the employer, Government or private, upon the rights and privileges that they have obtained in the past. Yet during the whole course of his speech he threw on the workers' organizations the onus of responsibility for the want of employment in Australia today. He told the deputation yesterday that until every union with which he has conferred about ship-building agreed to the conditions he had laid down no attempt would be made to build a single ship in this country. He is endeavouring at one fell swoop to wipe out the whole of what has been achieved by the unions of the past. They must come down to his terms and accept his wishes, or there will be no work for them. I ask any man on the other side who at one time represented Labour, Is that the way to approach a body of mento say, "" You must come to my way before "" I will give you one day's employment""?",15
89,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,That is a grotesque travesty of the whole case.,16
90,Mr MATHEWS,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"We heard the Prime Minister make the statement yesterday that until the unions agreed to the conditions he laid down not one ship would be built here. What a remark from the brains of Australia, or, as some people would have us believe, from the brains of the Empire-that the workers of Australia will get no work until they agree to the whole of the conditions laid down by the man who today is the Prime Minister of Australia We know the Government are keeping back the manufacture of commodities required by the men at the Front, for the very purpose of creating dissension, yet the Prime Minister tells us that he cannot do anything. I can give him many suggestions. Instead of whittling down the expenditure by Commonwealth and State Governments, the Government ought to go on with necessary construction and provide money for the States to - encourage necessary production. The Victorian Government state that they have to economize because they cannot go on to the loan market to raise' the money necessary to carry on the railway works that they require. They are crippling their railway facilities by economizing, as they call it , and the reason they give is that 'the Federal Parliament has control of finance and will not allow them to borrow. It is the duty of the Federal Government to provide the States with the necessary money. If they cannot do this, they should say to the British Government, "" We in Australia are doing our share, but we are in a different position from any one else. We are not keeping our men and women employed in manufacturing the commodities necessary for the war. You must not make a scapegoat of us. You must assist us, and you should, and shall, provide money,, seeing that we are doing, our full share in the present Honourable members opposite laugh, and I quite understand the position. attitude is, "" I ' m all right, Jack; damn you! It does not matter about you a b it so long as we are getting all the meals we want."" I do not want to become dramatic, but there are men and women outside in regular work who have not much consideration for those who are not in regular work, or out of work altogether. I quite understand the feeling of many, honourable members here; but I say, without fear of contradiction, that the Government - oould be preparing for shipbuilding if they intend to go on with it . If they do not intend to place obstacles in the way, and then to blame the workers' associations, they should immediately make preparations here to tear down the establishment at the Naval DepSt to make provision to build more ships there, and they could get on with the work at the Naval Base. We want timber, and, therefore, they could say to the millowners, "" Put up more mills."" There are a lot of mills closed down in Victoria, particularly in the district of the honourable member for Flinders, and the Government could say to the mill-owners, "" Re-open the mills you have closed, and begin to prepare the timber for,the ships."" The Prime Minister uttered a sneer about the munition workers. He referred to people who prate of peace, and want to increase the manufacture of death-dealing commodities. That was a cheap and unnecessary sneer, but we say that we pay for every cartridge that is fired. Other nations are getting the manufacture of their own commodities, but we are told that the formation of the cartridge has been altered, necessitating the alteration Mr Mathews. of the sight, because the trajectory of the new rifle is very low. They tell us that we cannot make the cartridges here, because we have not the aluminium essential to their manufacture. If that is so, the Australian Government should demand from, the British Government a supply of the aluminium necessary to manufacture all the cartridges required to supply our own men at the Front, instead of allowing men and women to b« thrown out of work. The onus is on the Government to overcome difficulties, not to look for them. I know all about the labour unrest, but not a word has been said about the scounfight."" drels who are dragging excessive profits out of the pockets of the people during Their the war. Is there as much harm in men and women endeavouring to improve their conditions as there is in men making large profits out of the war? The Government come down with a Bill to extract about £400,000 per annum from these exploiters, although the Prime Minister himself condemns them. That Bill , as he knows,, is altogether inadequate as an instrument of taxation on war-time profits. , Mr TUDOR - And even that Bill is thrown overboard now.",16
91,Mr MATHEWS,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"There are men who ought to be made to disgorge their profits, because there are cases of unemployment caused by the raising of the prices of commodities. These people should have their profits extracted from them to give work to those who have been thrown out of work, and the price of commodities should be regulated by the Government I do not say that they have done nothing in that direction, but much more could be done if they so desired. v Plans and specifications have already been prepared, and are available in the Works Department, and work could be begun tomorrow, or at the very latest next week, if the Government would give the necessary order to the Minister for Works and Railways. He would not need to f r it t e r money away upon works that would not be useful. It is possible for him to undertake necessary works. The building and other trades in Melbourne are at present in a very bad condition. The Minister for Works and Railways might, if he chose, give employment to hundreds of men at the Flinders Naval Base, or in clearing away structures at Williamstown, in order to prepare for shipbuilding.",17
92,Mr BOYD,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,-The place is no good for shipbuilding even if these structures were removed.,18
93,Mr MATHEWS,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"The honourable member for Henty says that the place is no good for shipbuilding, but I am not talking of the building of 10,000-ton boats, but of the construction of boats that were suggested some time ago of about 3,000 tons.",18
94,Mr BOYD,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,The place is not suitable for boats of that size.,18
95,Mr MATHEWS,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"- I haye been told that it is. I have been told by men who have worked at the trade, and who are not merely theorists, that boats of 3,000 tons could be b u i lt and launched at Williamstown. These .are suggestions I am making which, if adopted, would provide immediate employment, for a' great many.",18
96,Mr BOYD,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,The practical men the honourable member refers to have suggested that we should cut into the bank of the river to make shipbuilding yards.,18
97,Mr MATHEWS,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,They have told me that boats of the size I have referred to could be built at Williamstown.,18
98,Mr WEST,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,Neve r mind ! ' We can do this work in Sydney !,18
99,Mr MATHEWS,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I wish the honourable member for East Sydney would not raise the provincial cry. I have done my best to prevent that. The question is too serious for such talk. We are told that we have not the necessary shipping, but we have shipping on the coast which is used, not in the interests of Australia, but in the interests of .the capitalistic section. It is being used now to get together stores of coal, not for the purpose of assisting the miners, but in order that the employers may"" be prepared for some fancied labour troubles in the future. These ships could be used for the carriage of general cargo. We know that we must have shipping to transport the commodities we produce, and I say that the Government have no right to threaten any one that they will not build ships in this country unless those who wil l do the practical work of building them are prepared to accept their terms. Shipbuilding should be undertaken because ships are essential for the transport of our produce, not only in the interests of the workers of the community, but of the Conservatives on the other side who represent all the moneyed interests in Australia.",18

101,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,ParramattaMinister for the Navy) [12.33] - I rise at the earliest possible moment to try to remove the impression the honourable member is seeking to create as to the conditions imposed by - the Prime Minister in connection with shipbuilding. Before doing so I should like to pay the honourable member for Melbourne Ports the compliment of saying that he di d at least get upon practical ground in making suggestions which I shall take care axe investigated with a view to seeing whether their adoption' might give relief to the unemployed.,18
102,Mr MAHONY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I could give the right honourable gentleman one suggestion by which he might employ 2,000 men in his own Department. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I know something about the honourable member's suggestions. It is the easiest possible thing in the world to put men to work. I could put 2,000 men to work at the Cockatoo Island Dock, as the honourable member for Dalley suggests, but I should be only throwing public money away in doing so until we are ready.",18
103,Mr MAHONY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,If I have an opportunity to speak I shall let the House know whether the honourable gentleman would or hot.,18
104,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,I want to say further that work is being done at the dock now at a greater cost than it should be. The honourable member for Dalley may make what he pleases out of that.,18
105,Mr MAHONY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,On account of the rotten management. Mr JOSE PH COOK -^ t is so easy to abuse the management.,18
106,Mr MAHONY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,It is easy for the right honourable gentleman to abuse the workers.,18
107,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I should like to give the honourable member some information. He does not appear to know what is going on. I am always ready to meet the honourable member. I have in my hand particulars of what looks like an undoubted case of the adoption of the "" go slow "" principle at Cockatoo Island. This has reference to a case the honourable member came to see me about the other day. I obtained this information for him . By a simple change in the control of a particular work, I am informed the difference in the cost of that work was the difference between 29s. and 12s - 9d. per cubic yard.",18

109,Mr JOSEPH,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"COOK - Excavation . I - say that if my information be correct it is that damnable kind of thing that is causing unemploymenb in the country, You cannot have private employment if those who wish to give it cannot make some profit out of it for themselves as an incentive to giving employment. Now let us see what are the conditions which the Prime Minister is seeking to impose regarding shipping - He proposes this, and only this: That in t-he making of the standards the men shall have as much say as the management. His proposal is to appoinjt a Board i u connection with every work, on which there shall be a representative of Labour and a representative of the management. If the two cannot agree he proposes .that they shall appoint an arbitrator, and that, failing the appointment of an arbitrator by them, the - Government shall appoint one for them.",19
110,Mr CONSIDINE,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,The same old thing - carrying.,19
111,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,Can the honourable member for Barrier suggest anything fairer than that?,19
112,Mr CONSIDUTE,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I suggest that the Government representative would reflect the opinions of the Government, and I do not accuse them of having any sympathy with the workers.",19
113,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"It is that k in d of silly tripe that is causing the men outside to suffer, and is responsible for a good deal of distress in the community.",19
114,Mr MAHONY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,The honourable gentleman's troubles about the men.,19
115,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I shall not bother about the honourable member for Dalley. He knows better than to talk like that. He knows that only the other day I ordered the construction of storehouses at the Cockatoo Island Dock, and at a very greatly increased cost, for the purpose of providing work for unem- . ployed carpenters. My own advisers had turned the scheme down on the score that the cost was too great, but those unemployed men came to see me, and I gave them'the work.",19
116,Mr MAHONY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,That is the honourable gentleman's side of the matter. . The House will hear our side later - on.,19
117,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"There is no other side to this matter. I gave .these men the work. ' They are today doing the work, and all I get from the honourable member for Dalley is a sneer for what I have done.",19
118,Mr MAHONY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,I should like to be able to sneer as well as the right honourable gentleman does.,19
119,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,The honourable . member for Cook says that nothing is being done.,19
120,Mr JH CATTS,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,Ver y little.,19
121,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,May I remind the honourable member of the load the Government are carrying today?,19
122,Mr JH CATTS,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,Unemploymen t and high prices have existed from the moment the present Government came into office.,19
123,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,Of course. Why bother about that ? That goes with out saying.,19
124,Mr JH CATTS,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"It does, certainly.",19
125,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,I remind the honourable member and the public generally of the load the Government are What would become of the rabbiters today but for the action the Government are taking?,19
126,Mr BLAKELEY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,The rabbiters are out of work.,19
127,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Some , of them may be, but they would all be out of work but for the fact that the Government are keeping them in work. There are £500,000 worth of rabbits stored in our store-houses today, and the Government are advancing money to keep the rabbiters at work.",19
128,Mr BLAKELEY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,But the right honourable gentleman turned down my proposition.,19
129,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Never ' min d the honourable member's proposition. We are talking about unemployment just now. The honourable member would refer to some details of it , and I am speaking on the main question. There is, further, the zinc industry and the interests of the tanners, the shearers, and the agricultural labourers. The Government have today upon their shoulders the task of keeping in employment those engaged in the main industries of the country, and but for the action they are taking and the responsibilities they are incurring, this country would be pretty well brought up standing.",19
130,Mr FENTON,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,That is only natural in the circumstances.,20
131,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,Of course it. is only natural.. But is that any reason why we sliould be accused of doing nothing? The honourable member for Cook said that we were doing nothing.,20
132,Mr JH CATTS,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,I did not. that the. Government were doing very little.,20
133,Mr BLAKELEY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"The action taken, in connection with most of the matters to which the right honourable gentleman has referred has been at the instigation of the. Home authorities, and not upon the initiative of this Government.",20
134,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I see. There is to be no m e r it for anything we may do; May I suggest that the present Commonwealth Government are carrying about.as much as they can carry today in the way of financial obligations and responsibilities for keeping the industries of the country going. If anything more can be done in facilitating the construction of public works, I hope we shall be able to do it , but I hope that the responsibilities will not rest mainly on the shoulders of the Federal Government. Our opportunities for providing employment are limited, and the best has been done that could be done. It is idle for honourable members to get up here and say we should employ men at this or the other work if they do not make some reasonable and economic proposal by which we may do so.",20
135,Mr JH CATTS,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,Why do the Government propose to shut down works at the Federal Capital?,20
136,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Because we want the money that would be expended upon those works for more urgent purposes at the present time. Every pound spent in expenditure which might be avoided represents a pound which should be expended in connection with undertakings which cannot be avoided. Every pound wasted upon an uneconomic ship or an uneconomic enterprise of any kind tends only to create, and not to prevent, unemployment. Honourable members opposite know that just as well as I do, but they talk of the Government doing this, that, or the other irrespective of the cost of the works suggested or their utility. The first thing to do before embarking on a ship-building enterprise is to see that our ships, when built, will have a chance of competing successfully in the markets of the world with the ships of other nations. Otherwise the whole scheme will break down. Our industry can only exist if our ships can be kept afloat alongside of those of pther nations all over the world. I said Mr MAHONY - Chea p labour",20
137,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,Chea p claptrap. That is what the honourable member is always talking.,20
138,Mr MAHONY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"F r o m the honourable, gentleman it is cheap.",20
139,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I know why the honourable member is making these in - . terjections, and in whose interests-they are-* made.",20
140,Mr MAHONY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Of course, in the in terests of the workers",20
141,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"In the interests of the workers with a. full mouthful. I shall be able to talk with, the honourable, member and the workers at the dockyard. He need, not worry about them here. But the first thing to be done in connection with, our ship-building scheme is to lay down lines which will insure that the in dustry shall succeed. This Government intends to do that, no matter what criticism may come from honourable members opposite.",20
142,Mr JH CATTS,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,The Government are looking for a quarrel with the unions. That is what they are looking for.,20
143,Mr WALLACE,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,What do the Government estimate will be the cost per ton of building these ships?,20
144,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"We have many estimates, and they are all extremely high.",20
145,Mr WALLACE,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,Do they exceed £ 4 0 per ton ?,20
146,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"They do. They are a great deal higher than that figure. We should be lucky, indeed, if we could get steel ships for £ 4 0 per ton. The honourable member may rest assured that the Government wish to set this industry going. The work is well worth doing, apart from every other consideration. It is necessary that it should be done. But the first thing to do is to insure that the industry shall not be broken down at its very inception by unnecessary cost. Let us put the matter on a proper economio basis, not on the basis of cheap labour of which the honourable member speaks. That is not contemplated, and the unions know that it is not. The honourable member can get no man who attended the conference to say that that is our objective. It is lef t to tliose outside to make intelligent criticisms of what occurs inside that gathering. I wish to say to my honourable friends, in reply to their interjections, that if a secret ballot were taken tomorrow, I believe our terms would be accepted by every union.",20
147,Mr TUDOR,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,It is a secret ballot.,21
148,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,Is it? honourable member does not know anything about the matter.,21
149,Mr TUDOR,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,I do. It has been a secret ballot.,21
150,Mr MAHONY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"The unions which voted openly have accepted the Government pro-posals, but those which have conducted secret ballots have turned them down. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I do not accept that statement, and I do not think it is correct. Notwithstanding all that has passed, I am very hopeful that even yet we shall be able to set this industry going, that a sufficient number of men will realise the responsibilities we have to carry and at the same time the opportunities confronting them, to enable them to accept the scheme in the spirit in which it is offered- a spirit of fair play all round, efficient work, and good pay for that work.",21
151,Mr BLAKELEY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Darling) [12.49] - I desire to say a few words on this motion. During my 'brief acquaintance with this House the statement has been made many times that the workers of Australia are such an unpatriotic, disloyal, and lazy crowd that they will strike on every opportunity.",21
152,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,Every word of that is a misrepresentation.,21
153,Mr BLAKELEY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,It is not.,21
154,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,Who made that statement ?,21
155,Mr BLAKELEY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"It has been made by the Prime Minister today, and on two occasions previously. Judging from speeches of honourable members the general consensus of opinion among them seems to be that the working classes of Australia are not prepared to work.",21
156,Mr SPEAKER,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,Order 1 honourable member resume his seat? must ask honourable members to recollect that the honourable member who is adI dressing the Chair is entitled to be heard without interruption. It is usual show more consideration to a new memwages ber.,21
157,Mr BLAKELEY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I do not require any more consideration than is extended to other honourable members. I repeat that the inference to be drawn from the speeches of honourable members opposite is that the workers of Australia strike at every opportunity. Now, it is a fact well known to most honourable members that the Australian worker compares favourably with any worker in the world-that he The does even more than does the average worker of the world. Yet most honourable members apparently lose sight of t h at fact. Good God! Can it be seriously suggested that the workers of Australia, strike for the mere f u n of striking ? That the man who throws down his tools and wanders about the streets of the city, returning home to find his stock of foodstuffs becoming more scanty every day, and to witness his children lacking necessary clothing-doe s so for mere sport? Certainly not. Whenever a strike is entered upon the men have some legitimate grievance. Personally, I was baptized in industrial strife at the age of thirteen years, and during my experience I have not known of a strike in which action was taken by the men without reasonable cause. The plight of the workers of Australia today is deplorable. Only this morning the Prime Minister told us that, these persons will not work. He said that whilst a deputation was waiting upon him in Melbourne, clamouring for employment, in New South Wales the men were refusing to work. It is utter rot for him to say that 5 per cent, of the workers control the other 95 per cent. Out upon such damnable nonsense! ; Mr FOWLER - I rise to a point of order. I would like to call your attention, sir,, to the language used by the honourable member, and to ask whether it is seemly that such words should be uttered here?",21
158,Mr SPEAKER,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I was just about to call the honourable member's attention the to the matter, though I had hoped that it opposite, was merely a passing slip.",21
159,Mr BLAKELEY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I withdraw, and apologize. The class which it is alleged is always striking is 11.1 per cent, worse Will the off today than it was in 1901, from which I period industrial trouble has been experienced in the Commonwealth. Of course, am now speaking of those workers who enjoy the awards of Arbitration Courts to and Wages Boards, and not of those whose have not been increased at all. The latter class are infinitely worse off. We have been agitating with a view to securing better conditions for years, but so far our efforts have not been, successful. One thing, however, is certain, namely, that in our midst today there is a commercial class who, flushed with tlieir political victory, are endeavouring to bring about industrial trouble. At the present time there is a gentleman journeying towards this city to confer with the Prime M in ister, who, for the past four months has been dragging his coat before every trade unionist in New South ""Wales, and inviting him to tread upon it . He is simply spoiling for a fight. Not only is Mr . Beeby spoiling for a fight, but so also is the Employers Federation. prick which it can administer to the working classes it has no hesitation in administering. I know of the misery and suffering which is caused by strikes, and I realise that most of the workers who participate in them have learnt fro m experience the sufferings which they involve. The Government should take immediate steps to provide work for the unemployed. We do not want charity from the National Government. We do not want a soup kitchen established. We want work. It was said by the Prime Minister yesterday that the deputationists who waited upon him would not allow the men to go to the war. When one sees a young, clean-shaven man walking along the streets one is not justified in concluding that he is eligible for military service. He may not be. There are a large number of individuals in our midst who cannot go to the Front. ",21
160,Mr BLAKELET,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"The figures are available to the honourable member at any time, and if he peruses them he will see noticethat there is a very large number of men who cannot go to the war. If he will add to these the numbers of their wives and children he will find that they make very formidable list. The honourable member for Cook has suggested that operations at the Federal Capital should be proceeded with. For that work we are informed no money is available, but it daily pay, including deferred pay. will be far more costly for the Governsuch ment to provide soup kitchens and charitpaid able doles than to proceed with reproducexists tive public works. There are many ways in which unemployment can be relieved in Australia. Between Melbourne and Sydfor ney, and between other points throughout Australia, our railway gauges need unifywhere ing. U n i for m it y is absolutely essential in this connection. The Commonwealth will have to undertake this work because the States are not carrying out their agreements.",22
161,Mr CORSER,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,They cannot undertake it because they have not the money.,22
162,Mr BLAKELEY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"The Commonwealth Government will ultimately have to undertake the work, and they could not do better than commence - it now. We have.the necessary plant on the east-west line. In a short time that plant-unles s it be utilized in the direction in which T suggest-wil l be left to rot. There are Every pin no railways in progress on which it can be employed, and the sooner it is utilized in widening or lessening the gauges of our railways throughout Australia the better.

Is it a fact that the English mail vid America did not leave Melbourne until this morning (Wednesday) ? 2. If so, why were the receiving-boxes in Melbourne closed at 5 o'clock yesterday (Tuesday) afternoon? The Deputy Postmaster-General, Melbourne, has now furnished the following replies:1. Yes. 2. In consequence of the receipt of a large inward English and Expeditionary mail on the 31st July, it was necessary for the United Kingdom, and American mails to be made up by the day staff, who were retained for three hours beyond tlieir usual hours of duty. This work could not have been done by the night staff, who were fully, employed on their current work, and no assistance would have been available from other sections in consequence of the largo incoming mail, which had also to be dealt with. It was not, therefore, practicable, under the circumstances, to give a later clearance than 5 p.m. It might, liowever, be added that subsequent, arrangements mad* with Sydney the following morning enabled supplementary mails to be made up closing, at 2 p.m. on the 1st instant, the public being notified by exhibiting notices outside the city offices, in addition to a number of business places, being specially advised by telephone.

This course would be preferable even to that giving power on the to the Governor General in Council to Capriextend the term for another five years. the A change of Ministers might take place at is it any time, and thus possibly cause the whole system to become disorganized..

186,Mr KELLY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Wentworth) [2.28] - I would suggest to the Minister the desirability of affording the House some opportunity in the future of considering on what basis the Oodnadatta line should be run. In the agreement with the South Australian Government, the State, authorities, I think, are not dealing quite fairly with the Commonwealth with regard to the charge for managing the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta section. At the same time we cannot overlook the fact that, if we have to carry the whole organization on our own shoulders for the sake of handling traffic for only a month or two in each year the expenditure will be particularly heavy. It would be far better if this traffic could be fitted in with the requirements of the northern railway system of South Australia, and thus ensure the more economical management of the Oodnadatta line. During the time that the Oodnadatta railway is in full traffic it is the policy of the South Australian Department to draw on the northern 3 f t . 6 in . system for all rolling-stock and railway staff required to deal with it . If - we had our own rolling-stock for that line, we could only use it for about one-sixth of each year.",25
187,Mr WATT,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Balaclava-Minister for Works and Railways) [2.30] - I think I can satisfy the honourable member as to the question he asks. The position about the Oodnadatta line is not an easy one to settle at this distance. I appreciate the views of the honourable member for Wakefield and the natural apprehension of the honourable member for Wentworth. What I propose to do is to have a look at this proposition, and I hope that I shall be accompanied at a suitable time by representatives of South Australia who know the history of the line best. I promise my honourable friends that we shall nob take over this line, which at present is being operated under an agrement by the State Governments, befpre Parliament has had an opportunity of debating the matter.",25

Mr Fenton .(Maribyrnong). [2.31]. - I desire to obtain some information from the Minister. As all honourable members know, the Commonwealth has a strip of land on either' side of the transcontinental line. I have been led to believe that so far as Western Australia is concerned there will be no interference with that land or with property thereon; in other words, that the Commonwealth will have sole control. But on the strip of land in South Australia. I understand that, when the agreement was being arranged between the two Governments, the State Government of the day did place some embargo .on the Commonwealth. Suppose that a town is established on either side of the border, and that a community settles there. If a State school is needed it will be quite the right thing that the State should come in and provide educational . facilities. Or certain businesses may be conducted on the Commonwealth land which will need to come under the purview of State officials and with in the province of State legislation. I would like to have a statement from the Minister that the Commonwealth property, and the leasing of land on either side of the line, will not be unduly interfered w it 1 or taxed, and that leaseholds will not be improperly harassed by any State.",25
189,Mr KELLY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"They cannot be harassed, except that the only invasion of the Commonwealth right is in the agreement itself, which restricts to the State the mining rights on the whole of this land.",25
190,Mr FENTON,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"That may be. Otherwise, for all propositions it is essentially under the control of the Commonwealth, except where educational facilities may have to be supplied, and then naturally we will call upon the State Government to provide them, even if the Commonwealth should have to pay something. I want to know what will be the position of lessees on the land, because undoubtedly at certain points small communities will be established. No doubt they will be contiguous to the line, and naturally they will look to the Commonwealth to protect them under certain conditions.",25
191,Mr WATT,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Balaclava-Minister for Works and Bailways) [2.33] - I have not had much opportunity to look at the law on this question since it was first raised in Committee. But the position in Western Australia is that we have been granted the land in fee-simple except for certain mining purposes, and that must be at the discretion of the Executive Council of the Commonwealth.",26
192,Mr WEST,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,It is something like a Crown grant.,26
193,Mr WATT,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"The strip of land is a quarter of a mile wide on each side of the line. In Western Australia there are no leases appreciably affected, if affected at all, which run along this narrow ribbon of land from Kalgoorlie to the border. In South Australia the situation is somewhat different. I am not in a position to assure the honourable member precisely what it means, but I take it broadly to mean that we get for all railway purposes that one-eighth of a mile strip on either side of the line and, by the way, some other land for watering purposes which may be required. .There has been some difficulty in settling whether the State or the Federal Administration is to decide as to the requirements. If land subsequently becomes suitable, and is settled by townships, then an alteration of the conditions of the grant is made. It looks as though the land for township purposes reverts to the State. Ab a later stage, perhaps, I may be able to give the honourable member full information about! this matter. Clause agreed to. Clauses 18 and 19 agreed to.

194,Mr HIGGS,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Capricornia) [2.35] - It may be convenient here,- as the Minister suggested in discussing the powers of the Commissioner, to refer to a power which - - I think ought to be given to him, and that is the power to provide land on lease, and housing accommodation to railway - employees.

201,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,Wakefield) [2.40] - The Minister knows that the agreement with South Australia for the transfer of the northern railway provides that the fares and the rates to be charged by the Commissioner shall not exceed those charged by South Australia.

I am hopeful that we shall run the other clauses through. Clause postponed. Clauses. 32 to 43 agreed to. Clause 44 (Carrying out of matters of policy).",27
207,Mr GREGORY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Dampier) [2.44] I . should like the Minister to make a statement regarding the relation between the powers of the Minister and the Commissioner under this and the following clause. When speaking on the second reading, I pointed out what, to my mind, is a dangerous feature in theB ill . It seems to me that we are giving the Minister too much direct control over the Commissioner, and are thus opening the door, to some extent, to the exercise of political influence in the administration, of our railways. The reason why Governments have so often failed in enterprises of this sort is that political influence has interfered, and I am afraid that the wording, of this elause gives' to the Minister a power of control that may prove injurious. Clause 45 must be read in conjunction with clause 44, and it says that the Minister may direct the Commissioner to make any alteration in any existing practice, or carry out any system or matter of policy. The Commissioner is to be paid for any such alteration that adversely. affectsthe accountsof the railways-; but: does not the 1 toll Minister think that the provision may allow some future occupant of his officenot the ideal administrator now in power - who - may be amenable to political in fluence, to interfere with the control of the Commissioner in a manner which cannot be beneficial to the interests of the Commonwealth?",27
208,Mr WATT,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Balaclava-Minister for Works and Railways') [2.47] - In my judgment,' these clauses are the most delicate part of the Bill . They constitute a k in d of bridge between the political control of former days and the practically independent control by a Commissioner of modern times. Who invented them, I do not know,, but in this State they, have been identified with Mr Shiels, and have been incorporated in a number of State Acts dealing with railway ad-ministration. Broadly speaking, the Commissioner will control the railway property and sendees, and will have large responsibilities and definite duties. But Parliaments have said-,. "" We cannot hand overthese large assets and responsibilities to a. permanent official' whose voice is not heard in Parliament.""'",27
209,Mr SPEJTCE,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Ne w South Wales did that, nnd found that it was a mistake. Mi'. WATT - Yes . It had. to draw back and frame its railway laws on lines similar to these that we are now adopting. In Victoria, sections similar to. these have been operating for twenty or twenty-five years; their effect being to provide a common meeting ground for Commissioner and Minister, to the satisfaction of Parliament' and the public. There has been no abuse under them, a check against abuse being, provided in ihe provisions themselves. A Minister will not have power at his own pleasure to order a Commissioner to do what he likes, but if , after a dispute about policy, the Minister determines that effect shall be given to his wishes, the Governor General in Council will have the right to provide fpr that. The Minister will have to obtain the consent of his colleagues to do what he wishes, and an Order in Council will then be issued instructing the Commissioner to do what is desired. If the carrying out of the Minister's policy is disadvantageous to the railway from a cash point, of view, the Treasury will have to make up any difference. It has been .found in practice that no Ministry will wantonly play fast and loose with railway administration wben it has to foot the bill. These clauses differ slightly from the provisions in some of the State Acts. The Victorian Parliament decided that if an. alteration insisted on by the Minister involved a decrease of revenue or an in crease of expenditure, the Treasury would have to make up the difference. It may be, however, that a policy having either effect would, in the end, be beneficial to the railways, and I think for that reason that the wording of this clause is better than that of the State Acts. The clause says that if a financial disadvantage is suffered by this change imposed by the Minister, the Treasury shall pay. These clauses provide checks and create a genuine equipoise of the responsibility properly resting on the Commissioner and the powers of the Minister responsible to Parliament.",27
210,Mr KELLY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Does the Minister think that the Auditor-General is the best authority to settle the question of disadvantage? The Auditor-General is an expert in accounting. He knows what expenditure has taken place, and what revenue has been received, but is he, by virtue of his office, qualified to pronounce a determination upon a business proposition involving, perhaps, immediate losses and future gains?",28
211,Mr WATT,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I see the honourable member's point. I am not prepared to say that the Auditor-General is the ideal official to deal with the ramifications of railway policy, but I know of no otlier official who could be better intrusted with this responsibility. The Auditor-General is the statutory buffer between an A d ministration and. Parliament, .and I cannot suggest any one better qualified to give the necessary certificate. We must presume reasonable honesty and fair dealing.",28
212,Mr KELLY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,An opinion on a business proposition is valuable only when it is that of an expert.,28
213,Mr WATT,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,The _ Auditor-General does this work in Victoria.,28
214,Mr KELLY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"In Victoria, the Auditor General has merely to decide whether losses have been made; he has not to deal with the future effect of a policy.",28

216,Mr LECKIE,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Indi ) [ 2 . 5 3 ] - I am still not satisfied with this clause. It seems to give to the Commissioner an opportunity to obtain payment from the Consolidated Revenue for expenditure which should be debited against the railways. It might be that the Commissioner, finding that three trains a week did not pay, would, of his own motion, reduce the service to one .train, and the Minister might say, "" This w i ll not do. Y o u must run three trains."" Then the Commissioner might 'reply, ' "" I will run three trains, but the loss must be met out of the Consolidated Revenue."" Thus the - Commissioner might reduce services or interfere witli. conditions of employment with the object of getting payment from the Consolidated Revenue.",28
217,Mr RLLEY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,Such a 'Commissioner would not be likely to secure re-appointment at the end of his term.,28
218,Mr WATT,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,And might be suspended.,28
219,Mr LECKIE,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Perhaps I have put an extreme case; but it might happen that Parliament might say that certain accommodation should be provided for workers, or certain conditions given to employees. The Commissioner might reply, "" I am quite willing that this shall be done, but any expense to which the Department is .put thereby must be paid out of the general revenue."" He might multiply those cases over a year or two, and in the end most of the revenue of the line would be coming out of general revenue instead of from the earnings of the system.  low .the Commissioner to spend money that way, just as he liked, j",28

221,Mr LECKIE,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"It would be very easy for the Commissioner to make concessions at the dictation of the Minister, and then ask Parliament to pay for it . If this applied to any one year, it would be all right, but if continued over several years, the lines, instead of showing ;a loss, might show a profit, on paper.",28
222,Mr WATT,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,The honourable member need not worry; all the earnings of line will be on paper for some years.,29
223,Mr LECKIE,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"But this Bill is vide a system of control for all time, and the Minister should not institute a sysgreater tem that may be used to the detriment the Commonwealth in order to bolster the railway accounts,, and, with the help of South Australian and Western Austracontrol lian influence, to endeavour to show to the people of Australia that the line is paying when, in reality, it is not.",29
224,Mr KELLY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Wentworth) [2.57] The honourable member for Indi has vinced me that this clause should be agreed to. When he commenced his remarks I was inclined to think that perhaps there was a good deal in his objection, because, undoubtedly, the Commisshall Subject sioner would be able to transfer to the in Treasury the financial responsibility for extra facilities required on the line. I remind the honourable member that he ' has fallen into an error, firstly, in overwages, looking the fact that this line is never for that purpose. going to pay, and that Parliament will have to foot the bill in any case, and, secondly, because he does not know our brethren from South Australia Western Australia. I assure the honourable member that our brethren from those States, however .much they may be united on all questions of domestic policy, are on all matters affecting the welfare their own States, whether to the advantof age or disadvantage of the Commonof wealth, united as one man.

225,Mr LAMOND,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Illawarra) [3.0] - I have no wish to delay the passage of Bill , but I do desire to enter a protest against the extensive powers given to Minister under this provision. From the interjection of the Minister, it is evident that he, having the power of pension to hold over the Commissioner, addition to other control, will be able force the Commissioner to afford facilities that ought not to be afforded. If there exists that solid Western Australian South Australian phalanx to which the honourable member for Wentworth referred, the Minister will require to walk carefully, in view of the fact united vote may be against him at any the time when the management of the sys»tem does not please the two States interto proested. It seems to me that there is in these clauses a return to political control than exists in any State Railway of Act at the present time. In New South up Wales the various amendments made in that way have considerably weakened the of the railways, and have not in creased their efficiency. I protest against this power of political interference with the management of the railways, particularly in connection with a line that is connot likely to pay for some years. Clause agreed to.

B y this clause the Commissioner is given certain powers to employ persons and to pay them salaries and wages. And then the classification which embodies the rates of wages and appointments,, has to be dealt with in laws. They are called regulations under other Acts, but are called by-laws under Railways Acts.

The question is whether employees on these railways are to receive the benefit of the Commonwealth (Public Service) Arbitration Act, and the Minister has not made the matter clear. An y ceedings taken uuder this measure for compensation are initiated and taken against the Commissioner. does not appear in the proceedings in way. The question is whether officers the employ of the Commonwealth railhave ways are to be employees of the Crown employees of the Commissioner; if they are to be employees of the Commissioner seniority alone. they will not get the benefit of the monwealth (Public Service) Arbitration Act. It is quite clear that the Committee is divided as to whether they should get this benefit, but I should like to see divided in fact as it is divided in appearwho ance on the question of whether these railway employees are to get that",30

No doubt the Minister has already found bythat the officers who have been temporarily employed iD the railway service of the Commonwealth, and who have been to taken from the various State railway and staffs, are very capable men. One of my men reasons for moving this ameudment, which I hope. the Minister will accept, is the fact that the following regulation has been is the view of the drawn up : In making the appointments to the staff preference shall be given in each grade to persons holding positions therein as provided (a) In respect to the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway preference shall b« given to persons employed therein according to seniority in the service. proI am asking that men shall not be appointed to the permanent staff from the temporary staff on the simple ground of The Crown seniority, but that merit should also be any considered.

At present, as soon as a man has shown his capacity for the work, he has to go, and, in my opinion, much of the mismanagement in the Post Office is due to the movements of temporary men. If we allow history to guide us we see that the system has proved a failure, and, in any case, it causes a lot of heartburning.

The obligation should not be cast on the Commissioner to say how long a temporary employee shall remain. If there be no limitation we shall have these temporary men, after a few years' service, making a claim for a permanent classification, and' this would build up, in all probability, a new set of public servants, and leave the door open to the exercise of influence. Under the present law, temporary employees are restricted to temporary positions, though, of course, a period of six months may be a little short, and twelve months might prove the more advantageous. ought, however, to be some limitation to relieve the Commissioner from responsibility, and afford him the opportunity to perfect the permanent staff. I am afraid that, unless there is some such clause, the Commissioner may find himself trammelled in the exercise of a free. hand.",33
260,Mr MAHONY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Dalley) [3.34] - The Minister would be well advised to with draw this provision, the retention of which would really hamper the Commissioner in the discharge of his duties, rather than, as the honourable member for Wimmera suggests, give him a free hand. At the very moment that the Commissioner has got these men trained and can depend upon them, they have to be got r i d of. No business man in any part of the world would run his business on those lines, and surely the Commissioner will run the rail ways on commercial lines in the highest interests of the Commonwealth. The best example we can follow is that of the commercial community, and the only standard they have is that of efficiency. If a man is an efficient servant they retain his services; if not, lie goes. The Minister would be wise to withdraw the provision.",33
261,Mr ARCHIBALD,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Hindmarsh) [3.36] - I strongly urge the Minister to drop the proviso, although I can understand the reason it was put in the Bill . It is a Victorian patent, and is not in any South Australian or Western Australian Railways Act , but there was repeated agitation in South Australia to have this Melbourne patent brought into force there.' It had its origin in the old Trades H all agitation for the unemployed. Their idea was that it was unfair thati some men should have the ' luck to get temporary railway employment and others should be l e ft walking about idle. .They argued that it was fair to turn men out of the Department after six months, whether they were suitable or not, and give, the other fellow"" a cut. To be logical, if it is such a wonderful practice, we should legislate to compel every private employer to follow it , but it is ridiculous on its face. The Railways Commissioner may get a very efficient man whom he does not want to lose, and he may not care whether he retains others or not, but under this provision the efficient man would have to travel, and the Commissioner would .probably get a far less usef u l man. If a private employer picks up There ihe good man he keeps him, and the Railway Department loses all chance of get-j ting him again. There is absolutely nothing to justify this provision except the Labour howl to give an opportunity to those who are unemployed to obtain the jobs of those who are employed.",33
262,Mr FINLAYSON,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Brisbane) [3.39] If we are to have an efficient Bailways Department, this restriction on the right of the Commissioner to employ the men he thinks best qualified to render good service is most dangerous. The Commonwealth railways are likely for a considerable period to be isolated, and it will be scarcely worth a good man's while to go to them for a six months' job. The alteration the Minister suggests is an advantage, but the whole clause is so destructive of efficiency that the Commissioner might well be left to exercise his discretion as to whether a man is suitable or not. If he is not, he should not be there a week, .and if he is, his services should not be dispensed with. The more the Commissioner is lef t to his own discretion in this matter the better' ib will be for the efficient working of our lines.",34
263,Mr CORSER,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Wide Bay) [3.41] - The honourable member for Brisbane has stated the very reason why the.clause should be retained. If temporary work is available a considerable distance away, the Commissioner may want to send to it a good man from the central depot, and put in his place a temporary hand who is beyond the statutory age which would allow him to go on the permanent staff. W it h out this provision the Railways Commissioner would be debarred from appointing many men to temporary work, and numbers who are over the age would be prevented from obtaining it .",34
264,Mr KELLY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,Nothing prevents the Commissioner from putting a man on temporarily. We want him to have the discretion to keep him on.,34
265,Mr CORSER,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,Has he not that discretion ?,34
266,Mr KELLY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,Not under this proviso.,34
267,Mr CORSER,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"If the Commissioner finds that a man is an efficient officer'after he has been employed for six months, and he is under the statutory age, can he put him on the permanent staff?",34
268,Mr WATT,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"In order to do that under this Bill , he has to increase the number of permanent officers.",34
269,Mr CORSER,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Would he not do so, if necessary ?",34
270,Mr WATT,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Balaclava-Minister for Works and Railways) [3.42] - The Commissioner might not get the consent of the Minister to do so. This provision is not inforce in Soutli Australia or Western [31] Australia; but it is in Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland. In New South Wales it is more stringent. There six months is the' maximum time for supernumerary employees, and there must be a full six months' break. The' theory is, as the honourable member for Hindmarsh says, to make the work go round, but, as I am reminded by the honourable member for Kooyong, there is another reason;. Temporary employment used to be the side door into the Service in Victoria. If a man bad been continuously employed for five or six years, there was an agitation to make him permanent, and Acts were often passed conferring that privilege upon men, while others were let in by ballot selection later on. I see no fear of thab in this case, and there is probably a geographical reason why we should not retain the provision. It is a "" toss-up "" whether the Committee retains it or not, but I am going to vote for it .",34

"" Provided that the Minister may direct that in respect of any grade no person shall be employed as a temporary employee for a longer period than six months, or in exceptional cases, nine months."" That would leave the discretion absolutely with the Railways Commissioner.",34
273,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Flinders) [ 3 . 4 6 ] - I think the object the honourable member for Wentworth has in view would be better served by striking out the whole of this clause, because in clause 47, in a general provision, the Commissioner is given complete discretion as to all kinds of employment, and may employ any person - If clause 55 be agreed to, even though the proviso be left out, the effect may be to hamper the administration of the Commissioner under clause 47.",34
274,Mr KELLY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Wentworth) [3.47] - I ' ask leave to withdraw my amendment, and suggest to honourable members who think as I do on this matter that they should negative the clause as it stands.

My object must be perfectly clear, but I do not know whether I shall achieve it properly by this amendment ",35
278,Mr WATT,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"The honourable member proposes to leave out too much, because there are occasions when it is necessary to take roads. We had to do it at Port Augusta.",35
279,Mr FINLAYSON,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"- I . object very strongly to the inclusion in this clause of the words "" public parks and recreation grounds."" I protest against the Com- ' Mr , FINLAYSON monwealth having any power whatever interfere, for railway purposes, with public parks and recreation grounds. Lands Acquisition Act, which is referred to in this clause, clearly defines that such of thing. areas shall not be included in lands that may be acquired by the Commonwealth. This is the definition of "" Land "" in the Lands Acquisition Act : "" Land"" includes any estate or interest in land (legal or equitable), and any easement, right, power, or privilege over, in, connection with land, and includes Crown but does not include public parks vested ander the control of municipal or local authorities, and dedicated to or reserved for - creation of the people, or such other dedicated to or reserved for the use and enjoyment of the people as have been certified by proclamation.",35
280,Mr KELLY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Would not the honourable member's amendment cover such areas as 0 stock reserves, for instance?",35
281,Mr FINLAYSON,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I was coming to that. Large areas of country lands axe frequently reserved as timber and water reserves. It would, I admit, be foolish to refuse to give railway rights over such areas, but the clause under consideration is so worded that it covers specifically public parks and recreation grounds, and that is what I object to.",35
282,Mr WATT,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"I have realized the sentimental objection with respect to parks, and have safeguarded it partly by requiring Ministerial consent in such cases. If necessary, it might be provided that before anything of this kind was done a report should be made to Parliament, and honourable members would then haye an opportunity of objecting to any proposal that might be made. If I undertake to embody such a provision as that in the clause, perhaps it will suit the honourable member's purpose.",35
283,Mr FINLAYSON,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"That would certainly be a considerable advantage. The Minister has no intention, I believe, of encroaching upon public parks and recreation reserves?",35

The have but added to the reasons why I protest against any repetition of this kind",35
286,Mr WATT,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Sobe r sentiment in Melbourne approves of those instances, but given some fanatical sentiment does not.",35
287,Mr FINLAYSON,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"It is not fanaticism that seeks to preserve open spaces for or in the people. There are far too few of land, them in our towns and cities at the prein or sent time. I protest against any power the rebeing given to either a State or the Comlands monwealth Government to interfere with' public parks and recreation reserves. I am told that it would not be possible to get from Flinders-street station to any of the eastern suburbs of Melbourne without going through some of the lands that were previously park lands. That raises the question whether Flinders-street station is in the right place at all for a railway station.",35
288,Mr WATT,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,That is a sample of the considerations we find ourselves against in dealing with this question.,36
289,Mr FINLAYSON,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"If park lands are not encroached upon to such an extent as to destroy their utility, there may not be a great deal of objection, but honourable members may not be aware that authorities on town planning are all agreed that the Flinders-street railway station is in the wrong place.",36

T think that this provision will amply safeguard the interests of the Crown.",37
305,Dr MALONEY,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"Melbourne) [4.16] I hope that the Committee will accept the amendment. I propose to cite one example to show how necessary its enactment is. A man named James Munn obtained his life's ambition, namely, to be secretary of the Trades H all Council. He was injured in that 'terrible accident known as the Eichmond railway accident. He settled with the Railways Commissioners for some £ 4 0 odd. His mind was so deranged, and he was so injured by the shock that he was not properly examined by the medicalmen representing the Railway Department, to receive such a small sum. I do not think that he had a private medical man to examine him. He committed suicide within three days of obtaining his life's ambition. I might add that shell shock is almost similar to railway shock. Mr James Page, possibly the greatest authority on railway shock in the European world, states in his lectures that if a medical man ever finds a spinal complaint or a nervous disorder which he cannot diagnose, it will be well to go into the back history of the patient, even if he should have to go back twenty years, to see if the patient had been in a railway accident.

' We are now asked to take bigger step, and to relinquish control of what at the beginning will be a big busivision ness undertaking, and ultimately will grow to huge proportions. To my mind, the working of the Arbitration Court has not been such as to afford much hope that its of determinations regarding railway matters will conduce either to the satisfaction of the employees of the Commonwealth or - to the efliciency of the Service.

330,Mr WATT,DISTURBANCE ATPARLIAMENT,"If this principle were outside the existing law, and this amendment were introducing it for conthe first time, the observations of the honourable member would have my complete concurrence, but we have operated this principle ever since 1911, because Arbitration (Public Service) Act debut fines the Public Service of the Commona wealth as including '' the Public Service the Northern Territory, the territory in of the Seat of Government, and the serAs honvice of any public institution or author it y of the Commonwealth.""
