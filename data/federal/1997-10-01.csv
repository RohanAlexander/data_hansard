2,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Australian Meat and stock Industry Bill 1997 and associated bills is to provide a legislative framework to facilitate the move from statutory to new company structures and operational arrangetine ments for the Australian red meat and livebeing addressed. stock industry. The new arrangements are a major step forward, advancing industry towards management of its own affairs and, importantly, increasing efficiency and competitiveness in structuring this industry continue as a world leader. This reform is focused on the future needs of industry. Background The government is committed to improving the overall international competitiveness of Australian industry. We are particularly keen to do so in our important agricultural indusfor tries. Unless we continue to improve productralian tivity and cost efficiency throughout the food supply chain, we will lose ground against our international competitors and will not be able to maximise our national wealth, export opportunities and value enhancing potential. The meat and livestock industry earns Australia, on average, about three billion export dollars per year. We need to set our targets for achievement at a higher level. As a single agricultural commodity export earner for Australia, red meat and li vestock ranks third after wheat and wool. The potential of the industry is considerable. However, to realise this potential, we need to deal with a range of inefficiencies, including high costs in the processing sector. In 1994, the Industry Commission inquiry into the performance of the meat processing industry confirmed the importance of achieving and maintaining improvements and competitive efficiencies. No-one can contest these simple objectives. The commission found that Australia was not able to capitalise on its comparative production price advantage because the industry's processing sector was operating at significantly higher cost levels than the processing sectors of our major competitors. The commission, at the time it put forward its report, found that Australia was losing market share in almost all its major export markets. It is not just these barriers in the Liveprocessing sector which are impeding the meat industry's capacity to be competitive in world markets, but other costs associated with Australia's labour market, waterfront, quaranand meat inspection processes are also Honourable members will no doubt agree that we must have a vision for the future and that reform in these key areas is vital to the to long-term viability of Australia's meat and livestock industry. This government is tackling these necessary reforms, and significant initiatives are already under way. For example, in the key area of industrial relations, the government has put the Workplace Relations all Act in place and, as a consequence, award simplification test cases have been formulated examination by a full bench of the AusIndustrial Relations Commission. One of the test cases includes the red meat processing industry and the particular issue of the tally system. The outcome of these cases will have particular importance for the industry. The response to the Industry Commission's 1994 report was the establishment of the Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1995 which allowed for some institutional restructuring, particularly in relation to priorities and policy direction. The act was designed to commence the process of engaging industry to accept a greater role in self-determination. This bill, in effect, takes the major final steps towards empowerment by providing the industry with a structure which offers ownership and management of its own affairs. Review of current arrangements By the end of 1995, it was clear that beef producers were suffering from the effects of a major drought and other significant international market factors which forced saleyard prices down to very low levels with consequential reduced returns to producers. Furthermore, other red meat producers and other sectors .of the industry were also facing problems. The government instigated a review of the current institutional arrangements to determine whether early action might address at least some of the meat and livestock industry'S problems. To that end, a joint industry and government meat and livestock industry reform task force was established in 1996. The task force reviewed the structural arrangements, the financial management and operational effectiveness of the present statutory bodies. It also pinpointed key industry policy and program issues for early action by government and industry. The task force found that market and industry circumstances had changed since the establishment of the Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1995. The task force found that the current statutory arrangements, which had worked well in the past, needed to be adjusted to deliver what industry required for the future. Prevailing and future commercial realities demand a structure which can deliver more flexible and focused commercial programs and operations. A sense of industry ownership and deeper involvement by levypaying stakeholders is also required. Working from these findings, the task force report offered a wide range of recommendations based on two underlying principles. The first was that the meat industry in Australia must move towards a more self-regulated, responsible and market driven operation. The second was that the role of government must move to one side, with a more clearly defined set of core functions for industry, same time improving strategic alliances with and within industry for the delivery of these functions. The report also suggested that significant savings could be achieved by changing the current structures and levyfunded functions and making the provision of services fully contestable and transparent to the. industry stakeholders. Finally, the report advanced proposals for government on joint industrygovernment policy and program. actions. These proposals cover a broad range of joint actions that, in large part, cross stateCommonwealth responsibilities and those of industry. Many. aspects of these proposals are already being addressed by Commonwealth and state agencies in direct consultations with industry. A number of recommendations were made on the need for uniformity in regulatory legislation and administration across Australia. A whole of government approach is essential to ensure an integrated and consistent basis for meat safety and other regulations and to provide a national regulatory underpinning for industry driven quality assurance and selfregulation schemes. I intend to continue to advance these issues with my colleagues on the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand, ARMCANZ. New arrangements The government decided on new arrangements following extensive consultations with all parts of Australia's vast and divergent meat and livestock industry. Full consensus has not been possible and is not possible. In an industry as diverse as this one, this is not surprising. I am pleased to say, however, there is. broad agreement on major issues and each sector is in the process of implementing the changes sought. These included the need for a non-government, commercially based organisation; the necessity for industry to manage its own affairs; a more hard-headed approach to how levy-payer moneys are spent; and separately accountable beef and sheepmeat marketing and promotion divisions and separately accountable research and development divisions, within a commercially based while at the organisation. Another key area of agreement is that joint industry functions, such as research and development, food safety and quality, market intelligence and market access issues, animal health and welfare, crisis management, eating quality standards, and Ausmeat should be dealt with cooperatively and collectively, and be adequately funded and serviced. The industry is now focused on their collective responsibility in scoping projects and programs within each of the joint function areas. This is fundamental and very important. The new structures will consist of a new producer-owned service delivery company, limited by guarantee under the Corporations Law, to provide a range of services to the industry, including professional guidance. The role of the company needs to be recognised, more so than the fact that it will be producer owned. The company will replace the statutory authorities of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation (AMLC) and the Meat Research Corporation (MRC). The company will be accessible to all sectors within the industry in every sense, including service delivery, professional guidance and advice. All sectors will independently enter into contracts with the company for specific services. Importantly, the company will be a fully professional organisation which will be able to develop initiatives and proposals and advise industry and government on key issues. There will be separate companies, limited by guarantee, for the meat processors, livestock exporters and for the red meat advisory council, which I will discuss shortly. There will be a memorandum of understanding between industry sectors and government to ensure cooperation in the overall interests of the red meat industry. There will be a commitment to the principles of a meat industry strategic plan and collective activities under genuine partnership arrangements. This bill is designed to free the industry from the legislative constraints imposed upon statutory bodies. The new, privately owned structure will allow industry to take appropriate steps towards: 1. Increasing industry's role in self-determination and self-regulation, in a commercially oriented environment; 2. Enhancing industry's capacity to determine and address areas of market failure; 3. Progressive implementation and facilitation of future industry agreed structural and other reforms; 4. Encouraging inclusion of all parties through willing partnerships, as well as separate contractual arrangements; 5. Improving industry cooperation, principally through empowering industry leadership, with rapid development of sound policy decisions and cooperative mechanisms; 6. Minimising government intervention while at the same time ensuring continuing and appropriate representation, governance, accountability and crises management arrangements; together with, 7. Providing clear ownership by levy payers and non-statutory contributors, and appropriate participation in decision making processes and resultant benefits. The new arrangements will empower the industry peak councils to take leadership roles. The peak councils are expected to be as broadly representative of their sectors' interests as possible, bearing in mind that there will always be dissenters and detractors of any systems put in place. Under voluntary systems, it is rarely possible to have full representation. Members of each sector should seek to make their views and concerns known to the peak councils. It is the responsibility of each and every participant of the industry to make their views known and seek to influence industry representation where appropriate. A requirement of what we are doing is that the relevant representative bodies be open to all views and embrace genuine representative responsibility. Peak councils will carry responsibility for decisions on levels of levies and non-statutory funding for the new service delivery company. They will be responsible, among other things, for the development of their sector's input into the meat industry strategic plan and for the implementation of that plan. To be able to effectively carry out the new responsibilities which will be required of them, the peak councils will need to be adequately funded so that they can have access to the professional expertise they will require. A primary new source of funding for peak councils will be income earned from investment of industry reserves. We must approach this issue practically and sensibly, according to the needs and responsibilities of each sector or agency. The 'red meat advisory council', which may operate under another name, is primarily to provide advice to government on issues affecting the whole of industry. It is proposed that the advisory council be incorporated as a company limited by guarantee with directors being the chairs of each of the six 'peak councils who will be voting members, and representatives of the processor and livestock exporter companies who will be participants. It will also draw, as appropriate and when required, on advisers from government and other involved expert areas of the industry. The framework in which the advisory council will operate will be agreed in the MOU. Its functions will include: advice to the minister; custodianship of the MOU and the meat industry strategic plan (the MISP); coordination and development of, and assessment of performance against, the industry strategic plan; being the trustees (within a deed of trust) for industry reserves currently held by the statutory corporations, and ensure the investment of these moneys by a reputable and reliable trust fund manager; administer arrangements to fund peak councils including the distribution (from investment of reserves) to peak councils; provide an interface for resolving sectoral differences or problems in a way which does not adversely affect industry but in a way which promotes the image and purpose of the industry. The terms of the council's custodianship of the industry reserves will be determined jointly by industry and government. The principal requirements will be that the funds be used for the benefit of industry as a whole, be managed transparently in a mannerconsistent with an industry developed strategic plan, and be based on accepted commercial practice. It is envisaged the returns on investments would be used primarily to fund peak councils and, in a small part, to defray the costs of running the council. Levies, charges and other fUlu:ling Under present arrangements, industry levies and charges primarily go towards funding the industry's three statutory bodies.,.......,.theALMC, the MRC, and the meat industry council. Other agencies which receive funding from industry levies and charges iI}clude the National Residue Survey (NRS), the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation (RIRDC), the National Cattle Disease Eradication (NCDE) program and the Australian Animal Health Council (AAHC). Under the new arrangements, contributions will be sourced from various industry sectors, either on a statutory or a non-statutory basis. The collection of statutory levies will still be based on the present system but with changes allowing fora transaction levy on sheep, lambs and goats to replace the livestock slaughter levy previously paid by processors, and a separate transaction levy component on grain fed cattle. The transaction levy approach for sheep, lambs and goats was adopted at the request of a clear majority of industry whose submission met all of the requirements of the government's levy principles. A similar request was also submitted by the grain fed cattle industry sector for a separate cattle transaction levy. Again this submission met each of the of funds government's levy principles. The existing levy and charge impOSItIOn acts have been modified to provide for clear sectoral ownership. Processors and livestock exporters will contribute on a non-statutory basis. To accommodate the non-statutory nature of the funding, the now separate processor and exporter levies will be set at zero, provided these sectors meet their share of whole of industry obligations under the new arrangements. There will be no changes to current levy rates until the new arrangements, including formal agreement on the nature and extent of processor and livestock exporter contributions, are fully in place and contractually deliverable. Should the non-statutory contributions processors and livestock exporters fail to meet agreed . funding levelsÂ· for joint industry functions, and as specifically agreed by these two sectors, the government has their prior agreement to maintain levies at a required level to ensure that there is adequate funding. The buffalo industry sector has chosen use RIRDC to meet its collective research development programs and will not be contributing to the new service delivery company. Separate levy legislation will provide for direct buffalo industry sector contributions to transferred RIRDC and continued contribution by this sector to the NRS andÂ· NCDE. The government will continue to match industry R&D commitments. Matching funds to will continue on a dollar for dollar basis on eligible expenditure up to the maximum matching of 0.5 per cent of the industry's gross value of production. However, to qualify for matching funding for levy monies, contributing groups will need to meet specific as a whole. eligibility criteria. MOU and deed of grants The bill recognises that much of the prescriptive detail for flow of levy funds and management of reserves will be set out deed of grant. The deed of grant will be implemented between the government and the producer owned service delivery company. The deed will set out the conditions upon which levy monies and matching funds are passed to the company and how those funds may be applied. It will also set out the minimal accountability requirements enable me to meet my responsibilities under the Audit Act 1901. The MOU will primarily be between indusboard try peak bodies and also the government. Where appropriate and where they have will, identified responsibility, the service delivery company and other entities will be required be signatories. The document will consist a statement of principles and supporting schedules clearly outlining the new arrangetrading ments to which industry sectors have agreed. It will also outline intended joint function areas, core function areas and set out the guiding principles for the operation of the meat advisory council. by Assets and liabilities In consultation with industry and appropriate central commonwealth agencies I will determine the most appropriate placement of the assets and liabilities of the ALMC and the MRC. The legislative provisions to effect the transfer of such assets and liabilities to private to companies is provided for in the Australian and Meat and Live-stock Industry (Repeals and Consequential Provisions) Bill 1997. Some of the industry reserves will be to the new service delivery company to offset liabilities which exist at the time of transfer and to meet start-up capital requirements. A full due diligence exercise will be conducted for accountability purposes ensure all assets and liabilities are identified prior to transfer. Start-up capital will also be provided to the processor and livestock exporter companies. I will, in consultation with industry, determine how the balance of reserves will be used to benefit the industry Role of government, ministerial powers and accountability The role of government in the new arrangein a ments will be minimal, but will remain necessary while taxpayer monies are involved. Ministerial powers of intervention and mechanisms to guarantee appropriate standards of governance and accountability to parliament and levy payers will be retained through the combination of legislation-including the Corporations Law-regulation, appropriation, that deeds of grant and the industry MOU. The Commonwealth will not be a member of any of the new companies, nor will it have representation or carry any liability in relation to their operations. The government however, continue to fulfil its responsibility. The government will also continue to to assist industry through working to ensure the of economic framework provides for a genuinely competitive environment and that the global environment does not disadvantage our competitive advantages. The government will continue to maintain a strong presence in areas of food safety and hygiene, research and red development, industry adjustment processes, training and education delivery, market access negotiations, competition and contestability, workplace reform, and infrastructure. Legislative provisions The legislative package consists of this, the principal bill, and sixteen associated principal bill makes provision for some staging by proclamation of implementation. This is critical because many of the mechanisms which will underpin effective and efficient industry management, the creation of representative corporations, the development of industry contractual arrangements and negotiations by industry leaders, must be completed before the current legislation is repealed and levies adjusted. These activities are well advanced. The legislation provides for the continued management of existing export licences, export quotas and enforcement powers. At present these functions are managed by the ALMC and paid for by levy payers. They will now transfer to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, including the provision for full cost recovery for the administration of licences and quotas. Provision is made in the bill for the secretary of DPIE to have regard to policies formulated by prescribed industry bodies when exercising licensing and quota powers. Provision is also made for levy funds for marketing and promotion activities and R&D functions to flow to the new service delivery company. There is also provision for the government to identify those organisations which, after meeting prescribed conditions, will be recognised as eligible donors for the purpose of Commonwealth matching funding on eligible R&D expenditure within the service delivery company. The principal legislation makes provision for ministerial direction, but only in situations of emergency and where the national interest is involved. The power of direction is limited to matters for which the Commonwealth has authority under the constitution. The new structural arrangements impact directly on other legislation, including the meat industry'S present levies and charges acts. The Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry (Repeals and Consequential Provisions) Bill 1997 makes provision to repeal or amend relevant parts of the affected acts. In addition, a new set of levy and charge bills has been drafted to accommodate the change to the nature of future contributions. The bills. The changes are as follows: the Cattle Export Charges Act 1990 will be replaced by two new cattle export charge acts which deal separately with producers and exporters. This allows for subsequent reduction of the export sector levy components to zero when that sector delivers on its funding commitments under the new partnership arrangements. the Live-stock Export Charge Act 1977 will be replaced by two new livestock export charges acts which deal separately with producers and exporters. This will also allow for subsequent reduction of the export sector components to zero. the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Act 1964 will be replaced by a Live-stock Transactions Levy Act and a Live-stock Slaughter (Processors) Levy Act to allow for the separation of producers' and processors' fundirtg and for the processors' funding to move to zero levy rates. the particular requirements of the buffalo industry will be met by new buffalo export charge and slaughter levy acts. Separate levy acts are needed because the buffalo industry will retain slaughter levy and export charge arrangements. Contributions from the buffalo industry will continue to go to RIRDC, the NRS and the NCDE as at present. the Beef Production Levy Act 1990 will be amended to allow for the processors' funding to move to zero levy rates. the new act replacing the Cattle Transaction Levy Act 1995 will provide for the imposition of separate levy components for grass fed and grain fed cattle producers to support their individual contributions to the new service delivery company, as well as continued funding to the NCDE and AAHC. a revised set of national residue survey bills has been included in this package to allow for continuation of the provision of producer linked payments on cattle, buffalo, sheep, lambs and goats. In all cases, the promotion, marketing, R&D and program specific components will be specifically identified. Provisions will ensure collections of levies and voluntary contributions relating to any particular sector will be clearly and transparently identifiable. Collection arrangements and cost recovery for these levies will remain as they are at present. National eating quality standards scheme I have long promoted the need for a proper meat grading system in this country. I expect the new service delivery company to maintain the high priority being given to the early introduction of the proposed national eating quality standards scheme and further expects funding for this initiative to be of a high priority for the industry sectors. As they say, if you like to eat, you are involved in agriculture. One thing that we really can do thatwill benefit the consumers of this nation and beef producers-or meat producers of all persuasions-at the same time is to ensure that we have in place a mechanism which means that the consumer can be reassured as to the eating quality of whatever it is that they are purchasing. Support for producers' marketing initiatives I have asked the new service delivery company to give careful consideration to ways to assist groups of producers who wish to pursue various marketing initiatives. Such initiatives would include the development of brands and the development of niche markets and a means by which innovation and initiatives can reap rewards. Finally, I would like to repeat that the legislation package I have just outlined will facilitate the reshaping and refocusing of the Australian red meat and livestock industry. The new statutory arrangements will: empower industry; reduce government involvement; achieve a more focused and cost efficient service delivery; provide a more responsive structure capable of adapting to rapidly evolving competition and customer needs; and encourage the development of systems and structures which promote the culture of industry cooperation and a sense of corporate behaviour in developing and ensuring the future prosperity of the Australian red meat industry. These new arrangements represent a radical move to industry self-determination. The changes will be carefully implemented to ensure that structures, relationships and operations are corporate in their nature and have proper and workable settings and control measures. Since the announcement of the government's decision, industry has had time to appreciate the historic opportunities being offered to it and acknowledged that the package will accommodate most, if not all, of what the various sectors have been seeking. All sectors have assured me that they accept the decisions taken and that they will get behind them to ensure their effective implementation. Above all, industry has recognised that the new arrangements are offering a necessary opportunity to bring about a fundamental cultural change. Rather than relying on government involvement and legislated instruments, the package offers industry control and ownership of its own destiny. I commend the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr MCMullan) adjourned.

11,Mr ANDERSON,CATTLE TRANSACTIONS LEVY BILL,"Gwydir-Minister for Primary Industries and Energy) (10.04 a.m.)I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to impose levies payable by producers on transactions involving sheep, lambs and goats. This bill will replace the levy imposed on the sheepmeat and goat industries by the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Act 1964, which provided for levies at the point of slaughter and was paid for by processors. The levies will be used to fund the new industry service delivery company, disease eradication and animal health for the sheepmeat, wool and goat industries. In the light of decisions sors and live exporters to move to non-statutory levies, and for reasons of simplicity, equity and transparency, the Sheepmeat Council of Australia and the Goat Industry Council of Australia proposed a transaction levy be introduced in lieu of a slaughter 'pass-back' levy. The Sheepmeat Council of Australia has demonstrated this is clearly the majority industry decision, including support of this approach by the Wool Council of Australia. The transaction levy under this bill will closely parallel the existing transaction levy that has operated successfully in the cattle sector for many years. By aligning industry collection mechanisms with those already existing for cattle, meat industry levy tions are effectively standardised. It is this standardised approach that has assisted in gathering strong support. The bill also makes provision for exemptions in such circumstances as are prescribed by regulation to provide the flexibilityiri the future to cater for industry decisions in relation to levy exemptions. Such regulations will be disallowable instruments and the industry, in seeking levy exemptions or concessions, will need to clearly demonstrate that the proposal has majority industry support and meets all the requirements of the government's levy principles. The Sheepmeat Council of Australia and the Goat Industry Council of Australia have requestedÂ· an exemption from levy for sheep, lambs and goats sold for $5.00 per head or less to cater for cases of genuine hardship. This exemption has met the requirements outlined above, and I intended to give effect to this and to any subsequent decisions that might be made through regulation.

NA AMENDMENT BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Ms Worth, for Dr Wooldridge, and read a first time. Second Reading",24
19,Ms WORTH,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Adelaide-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services) (10.15 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill amends provisions in the Health Insurance Act 1973, the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973, the National Health Act 1953 and the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Measures) Act 1995. The bill amends the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 to remove doubts about whether hedging contracts made incidental to the borrowings or investments of the Health Insurance Commission require ministerial approval. When section 36AA was inserted into the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973, it was not intended that such contracts would require ministerial approval. The bill also amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 ('the act'). The most significant changes will: allow the claiming and payment of Medicare benefits by means of electronic transmission. This will substantially improve access to Medicare services, especially for many people in rural and remote areas. Doctors will be able to electronically lodge claims for all Medicare services instead of only bulkbilled claims; eliminate unnecessary consideration by a Specialist Recognition Advisory Committee of questions relating to the continued recognition of a specialist or consultant physician, where recognition was intended to be short term for the purposes of a locum tenans or the specialist or consultant physician applies to have that status ended. This amendment is consistent with the government's policy to reduce the extent to which regulatory provisions intrude on the conduct of business and the professions; allow optometrists to charge in excess of the schedule fee in circumstances to be specified in the optometrical undertaking. A revised undertaking will make exceptions in respect of domiciliary visits-as is currently the case-and those occasions where an optometrist attends a patient on the first occasion and the client had attended another optometrist in the previous two years; extend the application of subsection 10(1) to a professional service rendered during a 'domestic journey'. A domestic journey will include all forms of domestic travel whether prior to or at the end of an international flight. The provision would enable a person who leaves Australia for an international destination but who, before arrival, is required to return to Australia due to ill health to claim Medicare benefits for any professional services; inform the direction and management by the Commonwealth, states and territories of the immunisation programs by releasing de-identified data for research purposes from the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register. The Privacy Commission has confirmed that the release of information from the register is not in conflict with privacy principles; insert a new clause 128C providing a penalty for charging public patients for the provision of public hospital services in prescribed circumstances. It will be an offence for a medical practitioner where a patient is known to be a public patient to raise a charge or receive any payment for a public hospital service in the circumstances as set out in regulations made under this section and provides a penalty of 50 penalty units; and insert a new subsection 130(4A) which corrects anomalies in the existing secrecy provision (section 130), which make the necessary transmission of confidential information in specific circumstances. It will allow the return of information relating to a Medicare claim to the claim:ant or practitioner who provided information associated with the claim, without the permission of other persons whose information is associated with the claim. Mr Deputy Speaker, this bill also makes some minor but important amendments to the National Health Act 1953 governing the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, PBS. Firstly, it introduces a system which will enable a private hospital or residential care facility to be reimbursed for the administration of some pharmaceutical benefits to its patients or residents from the institution's own stocks, in order to obviate the need for a prescription for the pharmaceutical benefits. The system will apply to pharmaceutical benefits determined by the minister to be appropriate for these arrangements and will come into operation on 1 May 1998. Secondly, it provides for the appointment of an additional member of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to represent the interests of consumers. Thirdly, it amends the secrecy provisions, to complement similar amendments being made to the Health Insurance Act 1973, to correct an anomaly which inhibits the necessary transmission of confidential information in certain circumstances. The bill also. makes a number of minor technical amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973 and to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Measures) Act 1995. Ipresent the signed explanatory memorandum to this bill. Debate (on motion by Mr MCMullan) adjourned. NA MANAGEMENT BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 30 September, on motion by Mr Ronaldson: That the bill be now read a second time.",24
20,Mr LEO MCLEAY,SYDNEY AIRPORT DEMAND,"Before I rose to speak on the Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill I was sitting here contemplating the terrible damage that has been done by Sydney airport to the people in my electorate and to the people of my previous electorate of Grayndler. I was first elected to public life in 1971 as a councillor on Marrickville Council on a policy of reducing aircraft noise. It is appalling that 26 years later I am still in parliament talking about the atrocious effect that Sydney airport has on the people of my electorate. Unfortunately, that airport was never really planned. When it became the principal airport for Sydney, no-one looked ahead to the day when air transport might be the usual way of moving people between Australian cities and overseas. Nobody looked ahead and nobody listened to the growing complaints of residents. This lack of interest can largely be attributthe ed to one factor: the residents of the suburbs around the airport were, for the most part, working class. They did not carry the weight of being in marginal seats. They did not have access to the media. They were not the rich and powerful. The airport kept growing and evolving and the planes kept getting bigger and noisier and, unfortunately, far more frequent. The growth of a very centrally and conveniently located airport was in the interests of who could afford to use the facility and in the interests of the owners of airlines and the bureaucrats responsible for building and maintaining the airport. This very powerful lobby group won hands down every time. The airport only emerged as a major issue once the planes became of such a size and frequency that they started flying low over suburbs which were of upper or middle class. These people had access to the media and lived in marginal seats. Suddenly the noise and pollution became an issue and suddenly governments started focusing on the problems caused by Sydney airport. I do not expect miracles and the people of my electorate do not expect miracles. There is no expectation on my part or, I think, on the part of most of my constituents that Sydney airport will one day be packed up and taken away and that the site will be turned into parkland or a marina development. Indeed, many of my constituents work at the airport. It is a very significant local employer and should remain that way. But what the people of my electorate do expect is a fair and just outcome for the noise and pollution that they have put up with over the years. I speak particularly of my current electorate and the residents of the suburbs of Earlwood and Kingsgrove, who are suffering under the new flight path regime instituted by the Howard government. I cannot gloss over the decision of my own party to construct the third runway at Kingsford Smith airport. I was vocal in my opposition to this decision as were a number of other Labor members whose electorates surrounded the airport. That decision, however, was carried out with the full support of then opposition, the now government. The current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the former Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Sharp, were the ones who were saying we should expand Sydney airport and we should do it quickly. They fully endorsed that course of action until it became obvious that the optimum flight paths for using parallel runways at Sydney airport would take the traffic over their electorates. What a turnaround! From all espousing the virtues of a third runway and even being supportive of raising the airport curfew, the Liberal Party and its members of parliament went full circle. By the time the election came around we had the Prime Minister saying to the electors of Lowe, 'If you vote for Mr Zammit' - the current member for Lowe-'you will have no more aircraft noise. If you want aircraft noise, you should keep on voting for Labor's candidate. If you want your property values to go up, you should vote for Mr Zammit.' Unfortunately, the people of Lowe took the Prime Minister on his word and they voted for Mr Zammit. They believed the Prime Minister when he said that there would be no planes flying over the electorate of Lowe under a Liberal government. They were sucked in. The Prime Minister has not stopped the planes flying over Lowe. But I do note that he has stopped them flying over his own electorate-self-interest will always out. The Prime Minister has just moved the noise around so that more people suffer from the effects of the airport. Those suffering at the moment include the residents of Earlwood and Kingsgrove in my electorate who now have a great many flights skimming over their rooftops any time from 5 .30 a.m. until midnight seven days a week. Even more alarming to all those people living around Sydney airport was the decision to go back to basics over the location of a second Sydney airport. For over 20 years we have been looking at a site for a second Sydney airport. The Fraser government in the long distant past instituted the major airport needs of Sydney inquiry to look at where we should have an airport. Finally, after the Labor government made the disgraceful decision about the third runway they decided on Badgerys Creek as the preferred site for the second airport for Sydney as part 'of that package. Without any forewarning after the last election, particularly to the voters of Hughes, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development suddenly dragged out a Holsworthy option and put it forward as a possible airport site. This sop to a group of Liberal Party supporters and the Lawrence Hargrave project delayed yet again any real progress towards a second Sydney airport. It was another red herring. thrown into the ring to distract anyone who was interested from the real game-the game of getting a second airport into the Sydney region and thereby ameliorating the effects of aircraft noise and pollution on the people of the inner west and south-west of Sydney. Finally, a few weeks ago the government came out and confirmed what everybody already knew-Holsworthy was a stupid proposition and Badgerys Creek was the only viable site left in the Sydney region for a second Sydney airport. This was the position we had come to in the Labor Party many years earlier. Badgerys Creek will provide a solution for the increasing problems with Kingsford Smith airport that is just and fair to all Sydney siders. It will also, like Kingsford Smith, generate a great deal of employment where it is needed out in the western suburbs. But in the same way that justice delayed is justice denied, the delaying of the construction of Badgerys Creek will deny the people of my electorate and those surrounding Sydney airport any hope of an improved quality of life or even a halt to the deterioration of their current quality of life. While we await a longer term solution, Kingsford Smith should be managed to ensure that the least possible noise and pollution to the fewest number of people is achieved. One key aspect of such a management plan is to limit the number of take-offs and landings to ensure that there is not continued growth at Sydney airport. The plan put forward in the Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill 1997 simply revisits the proposals in the Sydney Airport (Regulation of Movements) Bill 1996, which was put forward in this House last year by my colleague the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) and me. The member for Grayndler and I proposed a cap on aircraft. movements of 80 movements an hour into and out of Kingsford Smith airport. This would hold traffic at Sydney airport at around its current levels. Many of course would tell you that such a cap is not necessary-those people who advocated the third runway and those people who advocated lifting the curfew. They believe that the airport should be utilised to its limit-and that limit is being talked as being up to as many as 120 movements an hour, two movements a minute, one movement every 30 seconds. They also suggest the lifting of the curfew. The more bizarre of them even suggest a fourth runway. These same people are quick to advocate no second airport for Sydney. They seem convinced that, if they keep ignoring the problems associated with Kingsford Smith airport, these problems will go away. They are happy to see the difficulty experienced by those in the inner west exacerbated by increasing the use of this site, which I might say is one of the smallest site areas of any large international airport in the world. Without some artificial limit being placed on the number of aircraft movements, there will be no pressure to address the real aviation needs of the Sydney region. Already we have seen the projections passed that were made some five years ago about when Sydney airport would saturate. With the exponential growth that you are seeing in this countryboth international tourism into and out of Australia, and the attitude of Australians of moving around the country via aircraft rather than via cars, buses and trains as people used to do-there is going to be more and more demand on Sydney airport. The deregulation of the airline industry put in place by the previous Labor government has seen aircraft fares reduce and come within the range of ordinary working people. This has seen the use of aircraft skyrocket. Yet another set of short-term fixes would be put in place if the people who have the attitude that Sydney should get bigger and bigger are the ones who win. There is a real danger with the approach to the 2000 Olympics-when the facilities at Sydney airport will be pushed to the absolute limit-that people will say, 'We have coped with Olympics. Let's leave it there and let's do nothing.' If the government had shown some leadership on this issue rather than dangling the Holsworthy red herring, which is something that amazed everyone, we would have seen a start on the facilities at Badgerys Creek and probably seen them in place to deal with some of the overload in the year 2000. But we saw nothing. We saw the government cause 18 months of delay once again. On behalf of my constituents, the people of Watson, I support this legislation wholeheartedly. I think the government should have been a little bit more generous and dealt with the legislation of the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) and me last year, or indeed done what the minister said he would, which was introduce legislation last year to do just ,this. But better late than never. This legislation will go some way to assisting the residents of the electorate of Watson, and particularly those of the suburbs of Earlwood and Kingsgrove, to at least maintain some standard of comfort rather than have it further eroded. But the government should not stop here. The government should announce that it will be starting work on a second airport at Badgerys Creek immediately. If the government was fair dinkum it would provide an injection of funds from the Federation Fund to kickstart this project and thus assure the people of Sydney an aviation infrastructure capable of taking them into the 21st century and reassure the people of my electorate their problems will not continue to escalate. If the government has money available to build a railway from Adelaide to Darwin then surely there should be money for a genuine infrastructure program which will be used and of benefit to Australia rather than a bit of cargo cult for the voters in the Northern Territory. Enough is enough! The government must get on with building Sydney's second airport. This legislation goes some way to at least making that a more urgent matter because, by capping the movements at Sydney, we will ensure that people have to focus on the future rather than continuing to have ad hoc decisions at Sydney which will cause that airport to get bigger, noisier and nastier. It would be stupid, as I said earlier, for any member who represents the airport to say that it should be closed. It is a very significant generator of work for the people of my electorate and I have never argued that Sydney airport should be closed. We should tame this beast, and we should tame it now, but we should ensure also that the work that it provides stays there for the people who live around it. I also think that those people out in the western suburbs who were originally proponents of Badgerys Creek, and have now all of a sudden become opponents of it, should start to think about the people that they represent who need jobs, as well as the nimby approach, because as the Mayor of Liverpool has said, Badgerys Creek airport will become the single most significant generator of jobs in the western suburbs of Sydney that we have seen in the last 50 years. It will provide work and it will provide work for ordinary working-class people, which is what is needed out in the western suburbs. But we must tame Kingsford-Smith. This legislation goes some way to doing it. I commend the government for that, but I condemn the government for taking so long to get to this piece of legislation. I condemn the government for not starting on Badgerys Creek yet. By condemning the current government I also do not give any comfort to my colleagues who held this project up either. The previous Labor government was wrong in building the third runway. The previous Labor government was wrong in not getting a start on Badgerys Creek, although it did make the final decision to build the airport, and it did acquire the land. The current government has sold a large site adjacent to the airport which will make it very difficult to keep up with some of the plans that should occur at Badgerys Creek. To conclude my remarks, this legislation will at least say to the people of my electorate that the beast has been tamed a little, and there will be some certainty put back into their lives. I could make some remarks about the government's phoney program of sharing the noise, but I do not think that is all that constructive. I will just complete my remarks by picking up on a matter regarding the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit), who the government has sold out with great distinction. The member for Lowe, in his remarks, mentioned a stunt he got up to by writing to all the local councils and members about his press release. All I will say to the member for Lowe is: stop the stunts, get out there and try to exercise some influence on your government. You got elected on the phoney promise of no planes over Lowe. When there are no planes over Lowe, then he can hold his head up high. He has been sold out by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), he has sold out his own people and all he can get up to is stunts. I think that probably shows about the level of the member for Lowe.",26
21,Mr VAILE,SYDNEY AIRPORT DEMAND,"The Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill 1997 delivers on another commitment that has been made by the coalition. Certainly we accept the support that we have been receiving from members of the opposition, although I noted there has been a little bit of a division in the opposition camp with regard to the development of Badgerys Creek. I acknowledge the contribution of the member for Watson (Mr MCLeay) in support of that option and would say in defence of the government's actions on the EIS process that at least we did that. We went through that rigorous EIS process with Holsworthy to make sure that the decision to exclude it was a justifiable decision and to make sure that the decision on Sydney's second airport was justified on solid grounds. We can move forward now to the completion of that process with Badgerys Creek. In listening to the debate last night, I noted that there is still some division between some members of the opposition with regard to the proposal to build Sydney's second airport at Badgerys Creek, but I note the very positive comments of the member for Watson. The bill that we are debating is a delivery of a coalition commitment. It provides certainty for operators. Everybody knows what is going on. It establishes a maximum limit on aircraft movements at KSA to 80 movements per hour while introducing a slot management system. I suppose in discussing these matters everybody has their own individual concerns and most of them are born out of representing their constituencies. The opposition speakers we have been listening to obviously have strong feelings one way or the other. We know that the deVelopment and management of the KSA airport has been a very vexed issue for the Labor Party and the seats around it. We heard the member for Watson say that he never agreed with the establishment of the parallel runway. As a representative of regional Australia. I, too, was keen to see in this slot management system an acknowledgment of the important role that regional airlines play in New South Wales. I understand that they have been given a regional airline slot pool, which has been introduced in this bill as well. The opposition are complaining about the time it has taken the government to make more progress or to get the development of a second Sydney airport started. The Labor Party in governmerit had 13 years to tackle this problem. They could not sort it out internally. It is public knowledge that there are concerns from some of the members in the government about the EIS process with Holsworthy, but the decision was taken as soon as the results of the EIS were out. The government promised to open the eastwest runway if elected to government. We have done that. The government promised a more equitable distribution of the aircraft noise problem. We have done that. The government promised a review of the flight paths for Mascot airport, and we have done that. In opposition the coalition was committed to capping aircraft movements to 80 per hour and in government the coalition is implementing this promise. Eighty movements an hour equates to approximately 500,000 movements per year. This is in excess of Sydney's 353,000 movement limit which is specified in the long-term operating plan. Under Labor, 50 per cent of the movements were over the suburbs north of the airport. These residents never got a break at all. The coalition has already cut these movements by 33 per cent. The target is to cut it further around 17 per cent. Under the coalition, 17 per cent of aircraft movements will be to the north, 15 per cent to the west, 13 per cent to the east and 55 per cent will be to the south and over water. What is being done here is exactly what we set out to do-that is, to create a more equitable situation not only for the movement of aircraft in and out of KSA but also for the distribution of noise. We are a government that has inherited a problem that we are dealing with. To be criticised for not dealing with it more expeditiously, I think, is a bit disingenuous of the opposition. There has been positive action to deal with the surrounding suburbs around KSA in an equitable way. We have put those measures in place. The slot system is the means by which the cap can be monitored. The implementation of the slot system will be Â·beneficial to all users of the airport. It is designed to alleviate congestion in a non-discriminatory way. While the bill sets out the general framework for the slot system the detail, to be determined by the slot manager, will be contained in adisallowable instrument. The slot system will be fully operative by March 1998. The slot system is consistent with worldwide practice. The slot management system is used at approximately 130 airports around the world. The system being implemented in Australia is based on the lATA model with some modifications that reflect the particular conditions that exist at KSA-for instance, as I alluded to earlier, protection for regional services, better access to slots for new entrants, and the introduction of compliance mechanisms. They are all important elements of what we are attempting to achieve here, and I think it should be recognised. It is important to recognise the right of those regional operators to also have access to KSA. All those commuters have an expectation and a right of quick access to the business community in Sydney and should not be penalised because of their smaller aircraft. It is an important element of this bill. The slot system forces airlines to move away from cluster scheduling where flights to are scheduled to arrive and depart and are beyond the capacity of the airport to support. Cluster scheduling can be claimed therefore, particularly at peak times, to be the root cause of the delays experienced at KSA, which is the flip side of the problems. It has been criticised over the years for the low number of hourly movements in comparison to international standards. The 80 movements per hour is not presently being met at KSA. There will be opportunities for new entrants to obtain slots during all operational hours. This includes peak times. There is a general expectation that there will be a degree of competition for any slots available during peak periods. Potential new entrants will have equal access with their established competitors on a fifty-fifty split. KSA is one of the fairest airports around the world in this area and is consistent with a deregulated aviation industry. At most, other airport incumbents get first go at the slots available. The bill establishes a slot manager, which is envisaged to be a company formed by Sydney airport and Australian airlines or operators using the airport, which will administer the allocation and compliance. As I have already noted, special arrangements are going to be put in place by the government for regional airlines. We are committed to providing services to regional New South Wales. The needs of regional New South Wales will be preserved by the use of ring fencing whereby KSA regional airline services have their own slot pool. Existing regional services will be guaranteed a regional slot. These slots cannot be sold or swapped to interstate or international services. So that is locking in opportunity for continuity of regional services in and out of KSA so they do not get elbowed out, so to speak, by the larger operators. It would be difficult to put a cap on aircraft movements without some sort of effective compliance mechanism to ensure that it was not abused or misused in other ways. This is the crucial element of the slot management system. The aim is to promote efficient scheduling performance. There will be steep fines for non-compliance. Delays at KSA will be now more open to scrutiny as the slot system introduces a clear set of criteria for flight movements. The maximum penalties are fairly hefty-for a no-slot movement and an off-slot movement, the penalty is $220,000 and $110,000 respectively. A no-slot movement is the most serious breach, and it jeopardises the cap and disrupts other airport users who have applied for a slot. So, if you have an airline operator who just does not tum up, does not utilise the slot they have been allocated, it means that someone else has missed out, the whole schedule has been put out of whack. That is how critical the timing will be in the operation of the slot management system. To make sure these companies and airline operators are focused on what is trying to be achieved here, the compliance measures will be implemented. The coalition is a government of action, unlike Labor, which did nothing but create anxiety and stress for the people of Sydney for those 13 years. I note that the member for  know whether he has actually spoken on this bill. . ",29
22,Mr VAILE,SYDNEY AIRPORT DEMAND,"Not yet, but I am sure he is going to and I am sure the member for Chifley will probably be at variance with some of his colleagues with regard to the development of the airport at western Sydney. But you can rest assured that this government will deliver on alleviating the problems as far as the second airport in the Sydney basin is concerned. We will not be vacillating on this the way the Labor Party has done. In the last 18 the months we have become used to listening to the opposition talk about what they were going to do if they had got another term in government. This is just another one of those areas. It took a long time for them to try to address the problem with the parallel runway at KSA. They went through the process of identifying Badgerys Creek. We heard the member for Watson criticise the decisions that have been made by his former government for not getting on with the job. This government is at least going through a rigorous process of eliminating Holsworthy first, and now we will move forward with the job of developing a second airport in Sydney. We will not muck about and wait for 13 years to pander to different interests in some of our electorates, as we have seen happen around KSA. We will get on with the job so there is certainty in what is going to happen in aviation in Australia. The implementation of the slot management system and the guarantee of 80 movements per hour will create a lot more certainty for the travelling public, inbound international tourism and the businesses that operate in and around KSA, particularly the airline operators, and will provide other competitors with the opportunity to get into that slot management system. But, just as importantly, it will provide the opportunity for regional travellers within New South Wales to have what they perceive as their reasonable right to access the Kingsford Smith airport in Sydney when they need to get in there and, subsequently, do their business in the city. In closing, it good to see a majority of opposition members supporting this bill.  little surprised at the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile). I was expecting a more with it. spirited bid for a ministerial bench in that speech of his. Mr Lee-He has obviously got land transsay. port.  transport. I have to say I have a little money on him. I am not going to quit yet, but I did expect a more spirited defence. want to pick up one thing-that is, all opposition members support the Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill. I am a little to surprised that he is suggesting they do not. fact, I think the honourable member for ber Grayndler (Mr Albanese) and the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) are be commended for being the instigators this bill. I do not think that there can be any member of this House who does not have some sympathy for the plight of constituents who reside, for example, in the electorates Grayndler, Watson or Barton. Mr Lee-Or Lowe.  terms of the way their lives are changed by airport noise. Mr Hockey-Or North Sydney.  extraordinary to see the lengths that this government goes to to protect the citizens Bennelong and other electorates on the North Shore. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you may be aware, the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) thought he was launching some pleted, vicious attack on me in purporting to make some great revelations to the House about statements I have made in this place in supexactly port of Badgerys Creek. For the record, also think the most nerve-racking time for me as a new member in this place was talking to my party units who had had a history, dating back to to Galston airport, of being opposed to an airport in western Sydney and my advocating that we should in fact look at having an is airport in western Sydney. In 1985, in looking at the way things have developed, an airport for Badgerys Creek was, in retrospect or am a hindsight, a 1980s issue. Mr Hockey-You went to the last election  I think you will find that I have quite a bit to In western Sydney it is true that an overwhelming proportion of the population supported an airport at Badgerys Creek. I bit of have some sympathy with the comments of the member for Watson, who said that it is a I do pity they did not get on and build it. The truth is that the proposal started off as a general airport. The runway was extended allow a certain class of aeroplane to use it In but not all aeroplanes. Indeed, I well rememthe comments by, I think, one of the state premiers at the time, who said that Badgerys to Creek would only be required, looking at of airport demand, in the year 2010. I have certainly changed my position. I make no apology for that. Indeed, it is not something new to my constituents or new in of the western suburbs of Sydney. But what is the reason for me wanting to change my position on Badgerys Creek? Firstly, I think it is fair to say that the proposal for the third runway and the flawed EIS at the time not only disturbed a lot of people in the inner city but started to raise doubts in the people of the western suburbs the efficacy of an airport at Badgerys Creek. I remember a number of meetings that of Labor members from the western suburbs of Sydney had during 1995. There was complete agreement that, when we went into the next election-that is, the 1996 election-the three studies that we had promised would be comthe flight paths would be available, there would be a high degree of community consultation and every citizen would know how that airport would actually affect I them. History shows of course that this was not done, and I must say that it left people like me well and truly isolated. I have already referred to a meeting at Memorial Hall during the election period, which {was genuinely informed the member for Lindsay, Jackie Kelly, was invited to attend. For the record, Jackie has said that she was never invited and I accept that. But we did have the former Senator Woods come along. Do people remember Senator Woods, of travelrorts and a few other things? What did former Senator Woods say at that meeting? He said that the coalition stood for an open, transparent and publicly accountable EIS process. More than that, as the inner city community groups had been funded by Labor, the relevant groups in western Sydney would also be funded by the coalition. Have we had an open, transparent and accountable EIS process? Of course we have not. Other speakers have referred to the Holsworthy episode, fiasco, whatever you want to call it. I thought it was really interesting as part of upholding this open, transparent and accountable EIS process, we suppressed the information which would allow us to examine what led the government to abandon Holsworthy and refine down its sole solution to Badgerys Creek. Does the honourable member for North Sydney believe this is accountable, open and transparent? He really does swallow the government's propaganda lines to a degree that I did not think was possible. Mr Lee-He has been part and parcel of it.  obviously correct there. He has been part and parcel of it. But let me just talk about noise. I think there was nothing more criticised in the third runway EIS than the use of Australian ANEF standards. They were totally discredited. But what standards are we using in the Badgerys Creek EIS? The very same standards. Even by the time of the last election, people in my part of western Sydney knew that 24 hours was never going to be a goer. Then we have issues of air quality. It is true-and the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield) will confirm thisthat in western Sydney we have an extraordinarily high incidence of asthma. That affects not only people of my age but, of course, young children. What do we have in terms of fine particle pollution in the EIS? Th-re is absolutely no mention of the US standard of 2.5 microns. That is not mentioned in the EIS at all. Why should I raise that? That is the fine particle pollution that lodges and remains in the lungs of people who come in contact with it. I hope that the new fine particle pollution standard currently being negotiated by the federal government with the states does include a 2.5 micron standard because I think, of all things, this alone probably will rule it out. The EIS does not address ozone pollution. Is the honourable member for North Sydney not concerned about ozone? There is the issue of the remaining stands of the Cumberland Plain woodland and, of course, the 31 endangered species that are in the flight path of the proposed airport. Also in the EIS are the figures that show, under the various options, that, the dramatic decrease in the value of houses to people. For an airport that is alleged to traumatise cows only, it is surprising that the bam value is going to drop by as much, under one option, as $61 million. The member for North Sydney probably does not even flinch at $61 million, given the value of houses in his electorate. But I remind him that in western Sydney these houses represent the life savings of battling families. This is the way we have traditionally saved. People's prized assets-their family homesare going to dramatically decrease in value. I have said all along-and I have sometimes been criticised for it-that, since the change of government, the real people who are capable of influencing the government on this issue of Badgerys Creek are not the member for Greenway, although he has always been in that fight, or me or even the member for Prospect, Mrs Crosio. The real keys to Badgerys Creek are the government members like the member for Lindsay. What is her position on Badgerys Creek? We cannot quite work it out. Certainly, Danna Vale left us in no doubt about where she stood in relation to Holsworthy. Apparently, options A and C are not acceptable to the member for Lindsay, but she apparently has no problems with option B, although she has already conceded she may very well lose her seat over it-and I think that is right. There is Kerry Bartlett, the member for Macquarie. What is his position? My understanding is that he will go with the flow, whatever the government decides, or whatever the member for North Sydney instructs him to say. We are offering a reward for the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron) on what his position is. But I make no apology for saying that I will respond to what I see are the needs and aspirations of my constituents. That is a bare minimum position for any member. Yes, it is true, I have changed my position on Badgerys Creek. Mr Hockey-Ha, hal The big change!  I have never denied that. But you go around as though I have kept this as some super secret from my constituents. It is also true that WESROC, representing regional organisations of councils, has come out against Badgerys Creek. Of all the councils in western Sydney that belong to WESROC-and they all belong-the only council that supports Badgerys Creek is Liverpool. Mr Hockey-What about Penrith?  erys Creek, as well as Blacktown, Parramatta, Merrylands, CampbelltownMr Mossfield-Camden.  able member for Greenway for reminding me of that. Time is running out on me, I regret to say.",31
23,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SYDNEY AIRPORT DEMAND,"I suggest you ignore the member for North Sydney.  always attempted to follow your injunctions and, in trying to accede to your injunction, I do so but I admit to a great deal of difficulty. The Liberal Party are saying that they have this EIS process. I want to remind them that they promised an open process, a transparent process and an accountable process, and they are wimping out on these issues. If they believe that they can get Badgerys Creek up in this way, I believe that they will fail.. I say again that those who are in a position to greatly influence the outcome of the government's decision on Badgerys Creek in the western suburbs of Sydney are the members for Lindsay, Parramatta and Macquarie. I am sure that, as the campaign gets under way led by an alliance of councils in western Sydney, increasingly they will be asked to stand up for their constituents. If I could just finish, because I have only a minute left, by repeating: it is not fair for the member for Lyne to suggest that there is some split on the issue of the bill before us. In fact, all opposition members not only support the bill but also understand what led the member for Grayndler and the member for Watson to take the initiative on this matter that has led to this legislation. We in western Sydney regret what a lot of constituents have had to put up with in electorates surrounding Kingsford Smith airport. I say with great respect that no member really is entitled to say to us in western Sydney, 'Well, you know, you've got to put up with noise pollution. You've got to put up with pollution.' We are not going to cop it. Prevailing attitudes to airports have changed. Whilst I believe it is an urgent necessity to seek relief from Kingsford Smith airport, I am not convinced that Badgerys Creek is a solution in the 1990s and beyond.",34
24,Mr ALBANESE,SYDNEY AIRPORT DEMAND,"I am certainly pleased to support the principles embodied in this Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill 1997, given that it arose from a private member's bill moved by me in this House and seconded by the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay). All I can say is that it is about time. It is about time that this government started to make some genuine decisions and progress about Kingsford Smith airport and what it will do about the hundreds of thousands of residents that are affected by its ever increasing noise. This is a government characterised by prevarication, delay and an avoidance of making the tough decisions. The delay in this bi1I is symptomatic of the lack of leadership from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that we have seen on a range of issues. Ever since the coalition came to government, it has been delaying action on the Sydney airport problem.Â· Despite Holsworthy. being a clearly unsuitable site-coming second last in the last EIS process-the. government set up a process so as to delay the decision about the second Sydney airport for yet another year. Despite clear election promises to introduce a cap of 80 movements an hour, the government did not raise the issue until this month, 18 months into office. It took a private member's bill from the opposition to put this issue on the agenda. For a whole year, the government has tried to avoid having a debate on my private member's bill before this House. Its delaying tactics take a toll not only on the credibility of this government but in more real ways on the people who have to live under Sydney airport's flight path. These people have been kept waiting over this period by this government's indecision. I first made the demand for a cap in my private member's bill, the Sydney Airport (Regulation of Movements) Bill 1996, which was introduced and had its first reading on 4 November 1996. The second reading was on 18 November. After the government failed to respond to this challenge and decided to delay the decision, I made repeated calls for the cap, including in the grievance debate on 10 February 1997 and in a speech concerning the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1997 on 18 March 1997. On 19 June 1997, the member for Watson and I tried to suspend standing orders to bring on the debate regarding the Sydney Airport (Regulation of Movements) Bill. I raised the issue again in the debate on the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997 on 26 June 1997. Why were we so concerned about pursuing this? Because Kingsford Smith airport accounts for 49 per cent of all passenger traffic in Australia, and this level of passenger traffic is on the increase. In 1965-66, 2.6 million passengers passed through this airport; in 1995-96, 20.3 million passengers passed through the same airport. This figure is expected to double by the year 2009, with an estimated 40.4 million passengers expected to pass through Sydney. Currently, residents who live around Kingsford Smith airport experience up to 753 aircraft movements per day. By 1999-2000, they will have to experience an average of 866 aircraft movements per day. Added to this, as we all know, Sydney airport-and my electorate-is surrounded by the most densely populated urban area of Australia. A recent Airservices Australia report stated that the number of people living in the 20 ANEF contour range has increased from 68,380 to 116,860. That is over 100,000 people per day putting up with a substantial level of aircraft noise. By and large they are not the people on the far North Shore of Sydney, I might remind my Labor colleagues; by and large they are working people in inner city electorates who have voted Labor their whole lives. That is why we need a solution to this issue. No doubt aircraft noise will continue to increase until a second Sydney airport in the Sydney basin-which is the only place it can be-is built. Kingsford Smith airport, of course, is continuing to expand. This government's decision to delay the building of the second international airport has also been taken in a period when they have supported the expansion of international facilities at Kingsford Smith airport. Ironically, the decision to expand KSA has been the only decision the government has made with regard to the airport issue that has not involved delaying tactics. On 19 J,une 1997, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works announced that the international terminal at KSA should be upgraded at a cost of $350 million. On 29 August 1997, Senator Robert Hill, Minis-er for the Environment, concluded that an EIS for the expansion of the international terminal at Kingsford Smith airport was not required. So I say to my colleagues on both sides of the House: let us not have any of this nonsense about people being concerned about people around the inner city and not being concerned with Sydney West; we are getting an expansion of facilities and an expansion of flights without an EIS. Interestingly, however, the Public Works Committee noted in their final recommendation that: Any further development of Sydney airport should have appropriate environmental clearances before being referred to the committee. In that, the Public Works Committee is clearly stating its dissatisfaction with the government's crash-through approach on this issue. The com-ittee was clearly concerned about subjecting the residents around Sydney airport to increased noise and pollution, even if John Sharp and Senator Hill were not. The committee also noted that, because no decision had yet been made on the location of a second Sydney airport, the expansion of KSA had to occur. Why has a decision not been made about the second Sydney airport, despite the commitment of the government, prior to the election, to build a second Sydney airport, despite the fact that there was an obvious growing need for a second Sydney airport and despite the fact that the previous Labor government had already allocated $306 million for airport development at Badgerys Creek, $21 million for a control tower and firefighting services, $23 million for environmental safeguards, $480 million for roads, $17 million for a rail corridor and had already spent $152 million on land acquisitions around Badgerys Creek? Despite all this, what we had wasÂ· a delay in the EIS process because of the Holsworthy fiasco. That delay has meant an expansion at Sydney airport. We all know that Holsworthy was never seriously a contender. It had already been considered and knocked over. However, the government proceeded with the sham and told us all it considered Holsworthy a potential site. The government was becoming famous for its delaying tactics when, in the budget of 20 August 1996, it allocated $21 million for the EIS for the Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy second airport options. When the draft EIS was released, of course we all knew that Holsworthy had been excluded, but at a cost of delay to the second Sydney airport, at a cost of an ever increasing expansion at Sydney airport and at a cost of millions of dollars to the taxpayer. We are now back at the point at which we were in March 1996. All this has achieved is the alienation of thousands of people in southwestern Sydney around Holsworthy airport. How can we trust this government's commitments to solving the problem at Kingsford Smith airport when the only real, concrete action we see is the expansion of facilities at Kingsford Smith airport? The other issues which have come before the Sydney Airport Community Forumchaired by the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey)-unfortunately have also been ignored by this government. We have seen the movement of the threshold on the third runway where a clear decision by the Sydney Airport Community Forum was knocked over by the previous Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the member for Hume (Mr Sharp). We have seen the long-term operating plan proceed. I do not argue that everything in the long-term operating plan is bad, because clearly it is not. Clearly, aircraft noise has been an ever increasing problem over decades at Sydney airport, and clearly no government, Labor or conservative, can say it has a proud record on these issues, because I do not believe any of them have. Let me say that the main problem I see with the long-term operating plan is the number of take-offs to the north, which it clearly favours, rather than take-offs to the south. They are clearly favoured for one reason and one reason only: if a plane takes off to the north, it can veer to the west all over the western parts of my electorate, the Ashfield municipality, and all over the electorate of Lowe whereas if it lands from the north it has to fly over the electorate of Bennelong. It seems to me that the priority of this government has been to protect the residents of the North Shore of Sydney at the expense of the residents to the immediate north of the airport. There have been a number of other issues brought up by the Sydney Airport Community Forum which are yet to be addressed. There is the issue of those people closest to the airport. I say to the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson), who spoke last night about the terrible noise that people in Turramurra suffer, that those same planes are a hell of a lot lower when they are over Sydenham than when they are over Turramurra. And hearing is not related to income. People who cannot afford to live at Turramurra-they would probably like to but have to live in weatherboard houses in Sydenham-do not have different hearing from the people in Turramurra. They are the same planes; they are just 10 times noisier when they are over the residents of Sydenham and St Peters. The member for North Sydney and others to their credit have visited Sydenham and shown a genuine sympathy f9r the residents around the Sydenham-St Peters area. I congratulate the member for North Sydney and thank him for his efforts on behalf of those residents which I believe have been very genuine. But the fact is that the residents of Sydenham are still waiting for two major questions to be answered. They are waiting to hear about the issue of those people who are living in weatherboard houses which cannot be insulated. They live in weatherboard houses because they are living in the suburb with probably the lowest income in Sydney. The average income is certainly a lot lower than the electorates of Prospect or Greenway. They have the cheapest houses in Sydenham. I can assure honourable members that in the inner west housing boom that is going on prices are not increasing in Sydenham and St Peters. What is happening is that the houses cannot be insulated and they are just being left as a result of the government's failure make a decision. The government should make a decision regarding those residences. We have a buy-out program that has been approved unanimously by the Sydney Airport Community Forum and those residents deserve certainty. We have heard a lot over the last couple of days about the government's commitment to small business. But I say to Peter Reith or anyone else in the government, 'Go down, to Sydenham, just as Lindsay Tanner, the shadow minister, has done twice since the election and have a look at the boarded up shops there.' If you acquire a whole suburb of 151 houses, you knock them over literallydemolish the houses-and you are left with a park, it is not surprising that the news agent, the chemist and the local stores all close; and those people deserve compensation. Yes, the Labor Party acquired those houses and, yes, that was a great program, because you cannot leave people living in an over-40 ANEF noise zone. The former minister showed his ignorance of the issue. Perhaps he should have come down to Sydenham. I invite the member for Lowe, Paul Zammit, to come down. I am sure that I can organise one week living in Sydenham in one of these houses free of charge for any MP or adviser on the other side of the House. I will even give them TA-which the government is concerned about-out of my own pocket to live there for a week and argue that those houses should not have been demolished and that people should not have been given compensation and allowed to live in first world conditions. Last night I was amazed that the member for Bradfield praised the former transport minister for the personal time and effort he had put in in visiting the people of Pymble. The member for Bradfield said: Despite his extremely busy schedule-and, despite... the very secure margin of Bradfield in ... returning a Liberal member-he was even prepared to see individual members of my electorate who were concerned and on the verge of psychological despair over airport noise. Dear, dear! The people from Turramurra suffering from psychological despair. In 18 to months the former minister did not come to Sydenham, my electorate or to the area which is most affected. The shadow transport minister, two visits; government, zero. I ask whoever the incoming transport minister is to come to my electorate, sit down and talk to the people there and experience what the noise is. I say to people on my own side of the House, to Labor members, or any other MP who supported the third runway, 'Come and stand in Yelverton Street, Sydenham and tell me it was a good decision.' And none of them have. All the economic rationalists from whatever side of politics cannot defend the decision to build the third runway. I want to conclude by talking about Sydney West airport and the need for it to be built. I want to quote the report of the New South Wales Labor government's Standing Committee on Public Works, chaired by Paul Crittenden. It is a great report, entitled Report on State Infrastructure Requirements for Sydney West Airport. In the executive summary it says: SWA offers Western Sydney the opportunity to secure a commercially viable international airport with an associated commercial/industrial complex that will complement and reinforce other economic development catalysts planned for the region. These projects represent a strategic infrastructure network that will significantly enhance the region's tive base, create jobs and provide opportunities for residential development in the SWA Sub-Region. This report outlines the measures needed to ensure that the environmental impact on residents of Sydney West are minimised. Noone who lives in or represents the area, noone who has experienced the trauma of Sydney airport, is about repeating the exercise or transferring the problem to Sydney West airport. It is important that there is a proper EIS and that the problems are not repeated. I support the residents of Sydney's western suburbs in seeking to ensure that the chaos around Sydney airport is not repeated. We do need to get a bit fair dinkum about this debate and to point out that the members around Sydney airport are not saying, 'No aircraft noise.' That is the lunatics in the No Aircraft Noise Party. We are not saying, 'Shut Sydney airport.' I have never said that. It would be opportunistic and I would be probably get a bigger swing if I did say that. But I am not saying that, because it is unrealistic-just as it is unrealistic to argue that Sydney does not need a second airport. In my view, it is worse than unrealistic to argue for airports at places like Goulburn and Williamstown, because that mea.ns an expanded Kingsford Smith airport. There is only one option, and it is now Badgerys Creek airport, as we have argued since the election. To give one figure from the draft EIS, the maximum number of people who will be living in the 20 ANEC range around Badgerys Creek is 3,000. There are over 120,000 people around Sydney airport. Compare apples with apples and not apples with oranges. What we need to do in terms of Sydney West airport is ensute that the mistakes are not repeated. )""/ I conclude by saying that the member for Bradfield suggested, in quoting me' out of context from an article, that I had said: 'Only a Labor or a Liberal government could fix the problem.' I did say that during the'eleCtion campaign, because I do not believe tHat the No Aircraft Noise Party or independents can solve anything. I am a big political' party person, and I believe that only governments, not individuals, provide real solution,s. He competiquoted me out of context, but he did not mention who wrote the article. It was Chris Falvey-John Sharp's adviser. So he has quoted it as an independent source. (Time expired)",34
25,Mr RONALDSON,SYDNEY AIRPORT DEMAND,"Ballarat-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development) (11.25 a.m.)-in reply-It was a fascinating evening last night and has been an even more fascinating morning. Those people listening in the gallery today would wonder whether indeed the ALP supported this Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill 1997. I can tell them that in actual fact they do, which may well surprise them, given the nature of the debate. Indeed, the shadow minister for transport, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), said that it was a good bill. I congratulate him on that, but I will not be congratulating him on much else that was said during the debate. The one thing that needs to be remembered in this debate is that we went to the last election with a policy of a cap of 80 movements per hour and, as with every election promise that we have made in relation to Sydney airport, we have kept to it. We have developed an agreed means with industry about how to give effect to that cap of 80 movements per hour. With the greatest respect to the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese), who was playing catch-up politics with his private member's bill, I suspect that it might actually have been a bit of a preselection ploy-that is what we reckon on this side of the House-that he needed to be seen to be doing something. But all his bill did was meet half of our election commitment. What he did not do was have the mechanism for the implementation. So :hehad a bit of paper, which was our election policy, and he said, 'Right. I've got that through. I'll put it on the table and I'll walk away.' Where - as the mechanism? Nowhere at all. He avoided the hard issue: the mechanism for the implementation. It was catch-up politics. He took our election campaign policy but did not have the means or the wherewithal to put in place the mechanism for. the implementation. At the end of the day, that meant that it was a first come first serve basis, which was going to be absolutely inappropriate and disastrous for the Sydney airport. The point to remember about our long-term operating plan for Sydney is that it meets our commitment to maximise flights over water and non-residential land and to more equitably share the noise generated by the airport. It is a fair policy that has been implemented by this government. Indeed, the assertion that there would be no flights over Bennelong was just a bit more cheapjack politics from those on the other side. The member for Grayndler knows that it is not true. It was absolutely untrue, a bit of a gee-up to keep the pot boiling but with no basis at all. Indeed, this plan is about sharing aircraft noise and about getting away from the funnelling across specific residential areas that was done by the previous government. The targets for the plan should be known by those opposite. They made no reference to it. They wanted to avoid the issue. They did not want to make the acknowledgments. The targets for the plan are 55 per cent of movements to the south-basically Botany Bay17 per cent to the north, 15 per cent to the west and 13 per cent to the east. It is sharing the noise. But what did the Labor Party have? They had over 50 per cent of movements over suburbs north of the airport. As the member for Grayndler knows acutely, the residents north of the airport never got a break under the Labor Party. We have already cut it to 33 per cent and, as he well knows, our target is to cut it to 17 per cent. The utter hypocrisy of the Labor Party, both before this debate and during it, is absolutely mind blowing. They went to the last election, as the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) and the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) know, with not one commitment to a cap. Mr Albanese-I wasn't here then.",38
26,Mr RONALDSON,SYDNEY AIRPORT DEMAND,"Oh! In AFL terms, that is the big free kick, the big handball: 'I wasn't here.' You poor little dear! What did you do about it before you got here? You let the residents of Sydenham boil and stew in aircraft noise. What have you done since you got here? You have done even less for the residents of Sydenham since you got here. What Labor promised at the last election was more of the same-nonstop jets on parallel runways such that the suburb of Sydenham was needlessly demolished at a cost of $30 million. Let us forget the cost. Let us talk about the people of Sydenham. Let us talk about the mums and the dads and the kids of Sydenham who, because of the ALP, went through sheer hell. What are we going to do? We have cut that from over 50 per cent, and our target is to cut it down to around 17 per cent. That is good for the people of Sydenham, who have been through sheer hell. I want to talk briefly about Badgerys Creek. This government is fully committed to building a second major airport for Sydney to a full international standard as a matter of priority, subject to an appropriate EIS process. The EIS process will be very different from Laurie's EIS process. We all remember that, don't we? What a deceptive little number that EIS process was from the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton). We are doing it. It will be transparent. It will result in the right decision. We are absolutely firmly committed to it. Mr Zammit-It's 'Lauriegate'.",39
27,Mr RONALDSON,SYDNEY AIRPORT DEMAND,'Lauriegate' indeed. I want to turn to a couple of matters raised by the member for Melbourne. I will give him his due and say that he was very quick in the first minute of his speech on this matter to say that the Labor Party supported the bill. Mr Albanese-It's our bill.,39
28,Mr RONALDSON,SYDNEY AIRPORT DEMAND,"Oh! We have the poor little possum back again with some more comments about it. You weren't there, and then you were there,and then you weren't there. You are all over the. place, Anthony. You know that you are all over the place. You are not a bad bloke on a personal level, but you are all over the place with this. You do not know whether 'you are coming or going. It is just extraordinary. We had the member for Melbourne pleading the case forÂ· the people of Sydenham: 'I have been there, and I have heard it, and I have seen it.' Do you know who caused it? The Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party destroyed Sydenham, and here we have the shadow minister crying crocodile tears for the people of Sydenham. He went on to criticise the long-term operating plan, which is providing relief for the very people that he was talking about.",40
29,Mr CADMAN,SYDNEY AIRPORT DEMAND,They started pulling their houses down.,40
30,Mr RONALDSON,SYDNEY AIRPORT DEMAND,"Indeed. They were the ones that put $30 million into pull people's houses down. They did absolutely nothing about it. I have a question for the member for Melbourne. What is fair about destroying the suburb of Sydenham? What is fair about that? Mr Albanese--:--Madam Deputy.Speaker, on a point of order",40
31,Mr CADMAN,SYDNEY AIRPORT DEMAND,"Frivolous, I can tell. Look at the smile on his face. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-I hope it is not a frivolous point of order. Mr Albanese--:--Of course it will not be, Madam Deputy Speaker. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-I will judge that. Mr Albanese--:--As the parliamentary secrehe tary knows full well, what is fair about leaving people in noise affected areas? That is what this government would suggest. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! Resume your seat.",40
32,Mr RONALDSON,SYDNEY AIRPORT DEMAND,"What is fair about making one group of residents the virtual sole receivers of airport noise? There is nothing fair about that at all. I think the comment from the former Minister for Transport ;and Regional Development, the member for Hume (Mr Sharp), in this House on 29 May probably sums up what this is all about He said: The real winners in this are people directly to the north of the airport-people in the Labor stronghold suburbs of Sydenharn, Marrickville, Stanmore, Petersham, St Peters, Leichhardt and Drummoyne, who were unfairly treated by Labor in government and who are being treated faidy by the coalition in government. . That summed it up lock, stock and barrel. I would like to give enormous credit to the member for North Sydney, the member for Lowe, the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) and the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile). I would like to thank them on behalf of their constituents .and the people of Sydney for doing the right thing with aterrible problem. They have done it and they have delivered. I would now like to tum to the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland). I really felt desperately sorry for the member for Barton. He said that he basically agreed. In fact, his words were: There is not a lot that the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) has said with which I disagree. When that is the Labor Party and this is the government, that is code for: 'I agree with every single thing that you said.' Mr Albanese--:--It's olir bill.",40
33,Mr RONALDSON,SYDNEY AIRPORT DEMAND,"I am going to talk about Backflip Bob soon, so you ought to hang around and listen to that. Basically, the member for Barton said that everything the member for North Sydney said was right. So that means it is a fair plan. Labor is hypocritical. It is hypocritical on Badgerys Creek. Indeed, as raised by the member for North Sydney, Backflip Bob does not know whether is coming or going. We thank the member for Barton for supporting your comments in relation to that-very generous. He said: The position of the Australian Labor Party is to support the construction of a second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek. I will continue the quote-it is not my quote-from the member for Barton: As the actress said to the bishop, 'Just do it.' Thht ;brings me to the next point. We all knqwthat Bishop Bob Carr hasgone off the boit The impotent Bishop Bob is either unWilling or unable toÂ· 'just do it'. We then had the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio). It is a shame that Hansard cannot record my facial expression. But, for the benefit of Hansard, there is a look of horror ort my face inÂ· relation to the member for Prospect. This is the very person who stood up here last night and attacked the Badgerys Creek proposal. But she was quite happy to be part of a Labor government which promised to fast track an international 24-hour airport on the same site-the one andÂ· the same. It is amazing what happens when you go from here on the government benches to there on the opposition benches. We had the same thing from the member for Chifley (Mr Price)-Hopalong Cassidy. He hopped from the government across to the opposition and totally changed every single thing he had said about Badgerys Creek in the space of about 35 seconds. After 13 years he changed in 35 seconds. Over he went. He completely changed what he said. As I said before, we are going to have a transparent EIS process. Those members should know that. I have already spoken about the member for Grayndler. I am not going to talk any more about that because I want to turn to the New South Wales Labor Party, the New South Wales ALP government-the great hypocrites in the debate about Badgerys Creek. The member for North Sydney mentioned some of this last night, but I will take the opportunity to do so as well. On 28 November 1994: State Labor has a strategy to build Badgerys airport by the end of 1997. On 10 May 1995: Fast tracking Sydney west airport will create thousands of new construction and service industry jobs in Sydney's west. Thousands of jobs in Sydney's west, yet the state ALP wants to destroy jobs, destroy the economy, destroy tourism, destroy exports. You name it, they want to destroy it. Backflip Bob. The Daily Telegraph of 21 May: Mr Carr said that Badgerys Creek was the best site for a second airport and the government needed to set the plan in motion immediately. I will quote the member for Kingsford-Smith too-this is fairly interesting: The major beneficiaries of these developments are the people of western Sydney. There will be a significant direct and indirect employment opportunity available in western Sydney and Macarthur region flowing out of these works. The establishment of a major airport is also likely to attract other industries to the region, again with consequent employment opportunities for western Sydney. But who has been driving the anti-Badgerys Creek process? Minister Knowles and a few of the ones that are sort of weaseling around over on the other side there, giving Knowles a bit of a push along: 'Go on, mate. Go on, you do it. We can't say much al?out it because we're fully compromised on this, but you go and do it.' Within minutes. of the Holsworthy decision being made, the New South Wales planning minister, Craig Knowles, said that the New South Wales state ALP government would at all costs be opposing Badgerys Creek. Who is going to pay for that? Not Backflip Bob. You know who is going. to pay for it as well as I do. The New South Wales taxpayers are going to pay for this. They are going to pay dearly for it if you continue to oppose it. Of course, all this happened when Backflip Bob was overseas. Knowles came out and said, 'We're going to put our full resources into opposing Badgerys Creek.' Premier Carr has got to make it quite clear, once and for all, whether he does or does not support Badgerys Creek. Roger, you know that as well as I do. He either puts Knowles Creek down or he supports him. If he is going to support him, he had better come clean and tell the people of New South Wales. And he ought to tell you guys as well. At the moment your strict policy is Badgerys Creek-you know it as well as I do-but Backflip Bob and Knowles are trying to squeeze it. Let us have a look at what this means. Let us cut to the quick on this and look at what it means. It means quite simply that, if you do not proceed with the second airport, Bob Carr needs to explain to all those voters in Labor's inner city heartland that this is code for lifting the curfew, lifting the cap of 80 movements per hour, building a fourth runway and squeezing more than 60 million passengers into Sydney airport-three times more than there are now.

It is sealed, lit and has navigational aids. It is an approved landing area. I have landed at the airstrip to attend to official duties in Texas, Inglewood and at Waroo and Terrica. These locations are all within a maximum driving time of 30 minutes from Orungal. There are no airstrips located closer to these centres that are of a comparable standard to Orungal. The owner of the Orungal property is a registered commercial pilot who has been flying me on the occasions I have landed at the airstrip.

37,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I wish today to associate myself with the remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in this debate and to support the second reading amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). I will be more general and briefer in my remarks than usual, given the lengthy list of speakers on our side and our undertaking to the government and publicly to ensure that the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 goes from the House to the Senate by the end of October. I hope to participate in the consideration in detail stage of the debate, which will occur after the Joint Statutory Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund reports on 27 October, by which time this House and the members of it leases, will have had the chance to contemplate the submissions made to that committee, the evidence received and the committee's report. At the heart of our attitude to the bill before the House today is the desire to make native title processes more certain, to make the act more workable, to make sure that the act is fair, and to make sure that the act is predictable. They are the hallmarks that the Leader of the Opposition has set down for our consideration of this bill. We want to see a native title process which is more certain, fair and workable. In my own case, I take part in this debate as a member of the parliament when the Native Title Act 1993 was passed by this House; as a Western Australian whose state, in practical terms, is the state most affected by the provisions of the Native Title Act; and as the shadow minister for resources and energy. The starting point for this debate is the Mabo No. 2 decision of the High Court of June 1992. The essential element of that decision by the High Court was that native title was recognised as a common law property right-a legal property right. That raised fundamental property and constitutional questions for the parliament to respond to. The subsequent High Court decision in the Wik case, which made the point that native title is not extinguished by pastoral leases, has seen this set of amendments come to the House. The key starting point is native title being recognised by the High Court as a fundamental property right. One of the difficulties that the then government and this parliament faced in 1993 was that this recognition came a couple of hundred years too late. In comparable jurisdictions such as the United States of America, Canada and New Zealand, the notion of a native title property right had been recognised much earlier. What this parliament and the previous government had to do was to grapple with the insertion of a legal property right into our property law framework 200 years after the event, and try to grapple with that in a much more compressed timetable. The High Court also made the point in the Mabo case that, whilst it was open for native title to be extinguished by valid government activity with an intention to so extinguish, there was no right of compensation at common law. However, any extinguishment had to be consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. That was a view that the High Court took by a majority of six to one. i It is interesting to make the point that it was only by a four to three majority that the High Court in Mabo No. 2 said that compensation was not payable for any extinguishment of native title from inception. In other words, the High Court was one vote away from saying that native title, however so extinguished from the first moment of European settlement in this place, was compensatable. That is an important point which I will come to subsequently. So what the parliament had to do then and what the parliament has to do now is to work through a fundamental property right. There is one of two ways that the parliament or a government can go: either you can say, 'Let us leave it to the courts,' or you can say, 'Let us try to find some statutory process to manage this fundamental property right.' That was the attitude that the previous government took and that saw the enactment of the Native Title Act of 1993 through this parliament. If this parliament wants to legislate, this parliament can legislate only if it finds a valid head of power. In this area, given that until the decision of the High Court in Mabo No. 2 property rights had effectively been managed by state and territory jurisdictions, you need to find a Commonwealth head of power. There are only two Commonwealth heads of power that this parliament can resort to in this matter: the external affairs power and the race power as a consequence of the referendum change in 1967. So what are the limitations that the parliament then and the parliament now finds upon itself? It is dealing with a fundamental property right. It has got limited Commonwealth power and, therefore, constitutional limitations and implications. And, in a practical sense, it has to find a statutory regime which is attractive enough to the parties concerned to use it, because it remains open to any party to go to the courts to pursue a common law claim for native title. So, in addition to grappling with constitutional problems and in addition to grappling with a fundamental property right, you have to make the process attractive enough so that people want to use it. It is also desirable ensure that whatever process you establish encourages agreement rather than litigation. So they are some of the legal hurdles and some of the practical hurdles which this parliament now finds before it. The Native Title Act of 1993 has seen good outcomes and some bad outcomes. think the best outcome is the Yandicoogina agreement entered into between Hamersley Iron, a company operating in the north-west of Western Australia, and threelocal Aborigi2 nal tribal groups who formed a corporation, the Gumala Aboriginal Corporation, to reprewas sent them. The end result of the agreement between Hamersley Iron and the Aboriginal communities represented by that corporation sees a $705 million iron ore development go ahead, a maximum $60 million royalty stream to that Aboriginal community and, most law importantly, commitments to ensure that investment which goes to that Aboriginal community is an investment by way of jobs, by way of training, by way of community infrastructure and by way of improvements education. I think that is the best example of a regiontion al agreement that we have. On the other hand, you have the worse aspect of the Native Act of 1993, which has seen only one out of 600 claims proceed through the tribunal. In reference to a visit that I and the Leader of the Opposition made recently to Kalgoorlie, the Leader of the Opposition made the point in his speech that Kalgoorlie is perhaps the worse example where we see multiple claims, overlapping claims and an uncertain So on the one hand we see a good utilisation of regional agreements and on the other hand we see the need to massively improve processes. How do we fix this process? do we on the one hand continue to encourage regional agreements with those organisations that have the resources to do it and on the other hand fix the processes? This gets to heart or the fundamentals of the bill that the government has placed before the House. The great difficulty for this House and the parliament is that the government's bill does not make it better; the government's makes it worse. The government's bill has to serious constitutional question marks attached to it, will raise serious questions of just compensation and will encourage common law claims and the pursuit of claims before federal courts, state supreme courts and the High Court rather than discourage them. So some the solution which the government has put I before the parliament will make it worse rather than make it better. I alluded earlier to the compensation point and I said that the High Court in Mabo No. was one vote away from saying that native title, however so extinguished, from inception compensatable. If you have a look at what the High Court has recently said on compensation for property law entitlements, and a case that it has currently before it, it is clear that the High Court is in a mood to view very seriously the extinguishment Â·of property entitlements and to apply a very rigorous the test so far as compensation is concerned. The most recent example we have seen coming out of the High Court was the comin pensation decision in respect of Coronation Hill. The High Court currently has before it a case dealing with Western Mining Corporaand the expropriation by the Commonwealth of petroleum exploration permits in the Title Timor Gap, expropriated by the Commonwealth to help enable the Australia-Indonesia zone of cooperation to go ahead in the Timor Sea. It will be interesting to see how that case is handled by the High Court, but there is now the question that the High Court these days is treating very seriously the notion of just compensation for the expropriation of process. property Jaw entitlements. The view which has been expressed by the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and is reflected by How the amendment which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has placed before the House outlines our view of the very serious constitutional and legal difficulties attached to this the bill. Our view has been sustained in recent days by the public release of a legal opinion prepared by the Australian Law Reform for Commission. As the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) last night described it on the ABC, bill the Australian Law Reform Commission is an 'independent, impartial and objective body'. What has the Australian Law Reform Commission had to say about the government's native title bill? It is not as if the government has been rushing off its feet to make this public, but on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald on Monday there is a reference to the Australian Law Reform Commission's opinion on the government's native title bill. The Sydney Morning Herald reports as follows: The submission, obtained by the Herald, said the Wik plan to effectively extinguish native title on pastoral leases is unconstitutional and ""will yield more, not less, litigation and compound uncertainty and lack of confidence in Australian real property law"". Most damaging for the government, it says the compensation payable would cripple taxpayers and hinder rather than promote mining development. It goes on to quote the opinion of the Law Reform Commission: The compensation implications of the bill are potentially so substantial that the Government ought to think very carefully before making such a large scale commitment of taxpayers' funds ... You do not need to go much further than paragraphs 1.7 and 4.10 of the Australian Law Reform Commission's comments on the Native Title Amendment Bill. At paragraph 1.7 the commission says: . . . the mechanism by which legal certainty for non-exclusive leaseholders is to be achieved will almost certainly fail on the grounds that it will yield more, not less, litigation and compound uncertainty and lack of confidence in Australian real property law. At paragraph 4.10 the commission, in respect of the compensation point, goes on to say: The Commission considers that the compensation implications of the Bill are potentially so substantial that the Government ought to think very carefully before making such a large scale commitment of taxpayers funds to the extinguishment of the property and cultural rights of indigenous Australians. The view reflected by the opposition's amendment is buttressed and supported by the Australian Law Reform Commission's opinion and view. The other day, in the course of debate, the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) referred to an article that I had written for the Australian Gas Association's quarterly journal where I made the point-quite openly-that on our side we regarded the Native Title Act 1993 as not producing a perfect result. 'jI'he member for Cowan referred to this asÂ· iff this were somehow a stinging point. I would) like to draw his and the House's attention, to a speech I gave to the Australian Petroleum Producers and Exploration Association in April of this year, shortly after I became shadow minister for resources, where under the heading of 'Native Title' I said: The opposition will work in the national interest to seek an !j.cceptable outcome to native title, .Kim Beazley has made that clear both publicly and privately. The Native Title Act of 1993 is not perfect. However, when you are breaking new legislative ground, as we did with native title, that willaImost always be the case. As well, Federal Court and subsequent Tribunal decisions since have not helped the process or the procedures. Our proposed 1995 amendments reflected our own recognition that the Act was not perfect and that the procedures and processes needed to be improved and made more workable. These were not dealt with before the dissolution of Parliament and the election. One of the reasons the Act is not perfect is that the Senate amendments to the original Bill are imperfect. As Kim Beazley has said, we don't have a dog in the manger attitude to this issue, unlike the then Coalition Opposition, who in 1993 walked away in the Senate, leaving the Bill to the Greens CYVA) and Democrats. There is a clear national interest in an amendment Bill in the main being supported by both major political parties. That was the case in 1993, and it is the case now. If, however, you go down the extinguishment path, you will end up in the High Court forever, tying up development forever. There is in my view a better way through-we need a better, more workable process which will provide certainty and validity and which is fair to all the stakeholders. Those comments are reflected in the contributions made by the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. On our side we are committed to making sure the procedures under this act are clear, efficient and timely, but they will not be achieved in the form of the bill that the government has presented to the House. I'\'will conclude my remarks by quoting brieflyÂ· from the speech made by the Leader of tl1e 'Opposition on 21 September when he opened the debate for the opposition. He had this tp say: \ . The Wik case is a common law claim. It has been in the courts since June 1993. It is still there, mattei- of substance related to it yet to be determined.' That is four years down the track. Think of the 600 or so claims currently registered with the tribunal. The collapse, in the face of High Court challenge, of a badly amended act . . . by an unthinking government, would see all those cases, and more, clogging up our courts indefinitely. The pastoral industry might survive such a scenario but not the mining industry. The bill that the government has put before the House will not make matters better but make matters worse. It is a recipe for uncertainty, it is a recipe for multiple claims before the High Court and it is a recipe for massively clogging up the system altogether. The government should pay heed to the second reading amendment which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has placed before the House and should ensure that these matters are uppermost in its mind when it comes to, I hope, a proper, full, objective and fair consideration of these matters in the Senate.",43
38,Mr DONDAS,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I have listened with a great deal of interest to what the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) had to say on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997, but I can only take into consideration all that has been said before in regard to native title amendment and the bill that is before us. I would say to the honourable member for Perth: you as part of the team got it very wrong in 1993 when the Prime Minister of the day clearly enunciated in his second reading speech that pastoral leases extinguished native title. You all voted on it. Mr Stephen Smith-And you are going to make it worse, mate.",47
39,Mr DONDAS,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I am not making it worse. I am just saying that you were wrong then and you are wrong now. You will not let, and you will not give, the to-point plan of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), which is now being translated into legislation, an opportunity to work. It does give me a great deal of pleasure to rise this afternoon to discuss this very important piece of reforming legislation. The amendments will fix the diabolical mess left by the Labor Party in relation to the state of the land tenure system in this country. We all know with that in 1992 the High Court ruled in the landmark Mabo case that indigenous Australians' native title to land has always existed under common law. The High Court declared that native title held by indigenous people may survive, regardless of new laws enacted by a colonising government. Of course, the Mabo case specifically related to the Murray ISlands. However, the court noted that common law is the same across Australia and, therefore, native title may still exist on the mainland as well. This judgment by the High Court threw all existing land tenure systems in Australia into total disarray. Confusion reigned as to the status of leases held by pastoralists, miners and indigenous people, and there was concern about the ruling's impact on future development and access. The High Court's Mabo ruling dictated that the parliament issue an urgent and comprehensive legislative response in order to restore certainty. The Labor government acted when it introduced the Natiye Title Act in 1993, the most illconceived piece of legislation I think Australia has ever seen. In 1993 the coalition consistently declared the legislation unworkable and incomplete. I stand here today speaking on these amendments as proof that the opinion has sadly been proved correct. Four years and 600 native title claims later there has been only one determination of native title on mainland Australia. Meanwhile, thousands of honest hard working Australians have had their lives turned upside down by claims over their family farms and property. Companies wanting to develop land which would benefit this country's economy have had projects halted indefinitely by native title claims. Major developments in the Northern Territory worth hundreds of millions of dollars have had native title claims slapped on them and so cannot proceed. The Native Title Act was in urgent need of reform even before the coalition came to government. Once elected, the Prime Minister made it one of his priorities to fix this mess and appointed his parliamentary secretary, Senator Nick Minchin, to undertake a review of the act with a view to restoring certainty for both indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. The government started work on the amendments to the act immediately and waited with interest to see how the result of the Wik decision would affect the government's position. In December last year the High Court complicated matters further with the Wik ruling, which determined that pastoral leases do not necessarily extinguish native title. The government is determined to react responsibly to the challenges this ruling presents. The bill before the House today will reduce the uncertainties regarding land tenure, simplify the whole process in determining the existence of native title, improve the workability of the act, and increase the community's understanding of native title issues and processes. This bill is a result of the Prime Minister's and Senator Minchin's extensive consultation process. They have worked tirelessly to ensure that all interested parties have been consulted on the amendments proposed. At this point I would like to acknowledge the role the Northern Territory government played in these negotiations. I commend their efforts to ensure the situation in the territory was always prominent in the minds of those preparing this legislation. Out of these consulAffairs, tations came the government's 10-point plan which this legislation incorporates. Before commenting on the implications of this legislation for my constituents, I would like to remind honourable members of the exemplary record the Northern Territory has in the field of land rights for Aboriginal people. I got a bit sick of hearing from those Labor members opposite that the territory government is racist, and I think this is an opportune time to inform members of the real situation in the territory. Forty-eight per cent of the territory is covered by the title granted under the Aboriginal land rights act. That is almost 700,000 square kilometres of the Northern Territory. An Aboriginal benefits trust account allows for the progressive purchase of land throughout the territory, up to $20 million'per year. There is $1.4 billion in the Indigenous Land Fund, which should be sufficient to address the land needs of Aboriginal people. The Northern Territory already has community living areas. legislation which has resulted in living areaS for Aboriginals being excised from' pastoral properties. The tellitory has a comprehensive and effective sacr-d sites legislation, the single most important issue for traditional Aborigines. Aborigines have a statutory access regime in place for access to pastor-l lands for traditional activities like hunting and fishing. There is also a separate regime in place to allow access to sacred sites. The territory provides for the co-management of parks. There are now parks under joint control that would meet an international benchmark. In addition to these points, I would also like to add that, since the introduction of the Aboriginal land rights legislation, Aboriginal groups in the Northern Territory have been paid some $350 million in royalties. The evidence shows that the territory already has in place the mechanisms for recognition of indigenous people's traditional links with the land. Despite ATSIC spending $90 million of Commonwealth money on native title claims, the act has not delivered any tangible benefits to Aboriginal Australians. In fact, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Senator John Herron, has informed me that the state of Aboriginal affairs under Labor did not result in any gains in the area of Aboriginal health. There may have been gains in the area of land claims, but I have been informed by the minister that 30 per cent of Aboriginal children in Alice Springs still suffer from malnutrition. Meanwhile, someone in ATSIC decides that $90 million is better spent on land claims. This is why it is so important that the coalition government has a policy of quarantining ATSIC funds for health, housing and education programs, as it is clearly not always their priority. In addition to the 48 per cent of the territory already granted to Aboriginal groups, there are now extensive native title claims ovef our towns, beaches, public parks and the coa&t1ine. How can we forget the chaos that exists over the status of our pastoral leases? The 1previous Labor government developed the Native Title Act on the assumption that pastotalleases extinguished native title. The former Prime Minister stated that the government's view was 'under the common law, past valid freehold and leasehold grants extinguish native title. There is therefore no obstacle or hindrance to the renewal of pastoral leases in the future.' The High Court's Wik ruling proved him wrong. The Labor government's native title legislation was drafted on the assertion that less than 36 per cent of Australia's vacant crown land could be claimed. The Wik decision means that 78.6 per cent of Australia can now be claimed. State and territory governments will be able to legislate to allow the continuation and the protection of all existing activities defined primary production under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. These activities can be carried out without interference of native title holders. The coalition has worked very hard to fix the mess left by the Labor Party and this legislation is good for the territory. It addresses the concerns that territorians have about land tenure and delivers appropriate returns to Aborigines. The package guarantees the validity of any acts or grants issued on vacant crown land between the passage of the 1993 Native Title Act and the Wik decision. The territory government, acting in good faith, issued some exploration licences on the previously accepted premise that a pastoral lease extinguished native title, and these remain valid. State and territory governments will be able to confirm that native title is extinguished by 'exclusive' tenures like freehold, commercial and public works in existence on or before 1 January 1994. It is this provision that will ensure that most parts of the current claims over Darwin and Alice Springs will fail. Agricultural leases are also covered to the extent that, where it is reasonable to suggest through the purpose of the grant or the nature of the land use, exclusive possession is assumed. Any current or former pastoral lease conferring exclusive possession would also be included. Land grants from the Northern Territory government to bodies such as town councils would extinguish native title, meaning our parks and reserves could not be claimed. This legislation ensures that the provision of government services like pipelines, roads, railways and municipal services may not be impeded by native title claims. There will be a continuation of statutory access rights for native title claimants. This does not conflict with the current access rights enjoyed by Aborigines as a result of territory legislation. One of the most controversial aspects of Labor's legislation was the right to negotiate provisions in respect of mining and certain compulsory acquisitions. The right to negotiate has delayed many important commercial and mining developments Australia-wide. There have been no gains for Aboriginal people at the grassroots level through the as right to negotiate. It. often seems to be the case that Aboriginal land councils are more interested in achieving the right to negotiate for extraordinary amounts of financial compensation than in securing native title to land. A higher registration test will be required for claimants seeking the right to negotiate on future mining activity. Proof of attachment to a particular piece of land will have to be provided and claimants will not be able to impede mining exploration as there will be no negotiations on exploration licences. There will only be one right to negotiate per project. States and territories will be able to introduce their own mining regimes for dealing with land under their jurisdiction as long as the access rights of native title holders are not compromised. There will be no right to negotiate over vacant crown land outside towns and cities required for government type infrastructure. This is good news for high population growth areas like the territory as it means the government will have the ability to plan for schools, health clinics and powerlines with certainty. The ability of the territory government to regulate and manage airspace plus surface, subsurface and offshore waters would be put beyond doubt. The native title claim in Alice al capital, will be increased as a result of this framing of the legislation, rather than it benefiting consolidated revenue. As the commission concludes, it is seriously concerned: . . . that the government has . . . underestimated extent of compensation that will fall due as a consequence of the Bill. So there are two reasons for concern in relation to these issues that relate to the way in which what were previously grazing properties will be able to operate in the future should this legislation have effect. Firstly, there is an environmental concern which hitherto has been suppressed, despite advice to this government by its key biodiversity advisory body. Secondly, there is the cost of it, and the transfer of wealth from taxpayers to a handful of rich pastoralistsnot ordinary farmers. This has been suppressed as a consequence of the Attorney's suppression of the Australian Law Reform Commission. So there have been two acts of suppression, two acts of cover-urone on the environmental front, one on the Attorney's front-both designed to withhold from the Australian public the full implications of what this legislation intends. This legislation does not give either certainty or fairness. It is legislation which has been brought forward without proper consultation with those who wish this government well in finding a solution, and that includes the opposition. There is no interest in finding, with those of us on the other side, an effective outcome that benefits all stakeholders in this particular complexity. It now increasingly seems to be the case that we have a government that will not open its ears to independent critical comment, including comment that goes to the constitutionality, the legal validity and the compensation in the bill, or to the on-the-ground effects, particularly the environmental consequences. More than that, not only does it wish its own ears to remain deaf but also it wishes the Australian community to have its ears remain deaf. So we have the wise monkey approach: we have hear no evil and' see no evil, but we have a government that is perfectly prepared to speak the evil, and to speak it repe.ateclly. It is prepared to malign those who raise; any criticisms about the way it approaches this matter, and it is prepared to use language which is entirely inappropriate in terms of its the hostility and the conflict it is preparedJo stir up within the Australian community on this matter. ' So we get no certainty . We will find ourselves mired in more litigation. We find the cost to be underestimated. We find the government unprepared to recognise the impact this will have on the environment. We find an unwillingness on the part of the government to allow the work of those who have a critical and public role to play in Australia's. community debate. Those who are tasked with these responsibilities by government-the Biological Diversity Advisory Council and the Law Reform Commissionare having their work suppressed, and the Australian community is prevented from hearing what they are entitled to have put before them so they may put their views on these important public matters. Because of the way in which we are seeking to facilitate the conclusion of this debate within a reasonable time, I recognise that I should cut short my remarks at this point. I will conclude by saying that this government is mired in cover-ups of its own making which go not merely to its morality but also to public policy, and which now show the full impact of the malice that is behind it. The government is not prepared to deal with matters that we in opposition have been talking about for a longtime, which they have been criticising as coming from a partial commentator, whereas the fact is the impartial commentators who would otherwise have spoken have had their mouths silenced, quite improperly, by this government in a way which smacks of cover-up. Indeed, particularly given the pecuniary interests of certain front-bench members of this government, it almost suggests the smell of corruption.",47
40,Mr COBB,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"It is doubtful if there has ever been a more controversial, divisive, costly and relatively nonproductive decision in the history of the High Court in this country. I do not say that lightly. I represent a rural electorate. I represent Aboriginal people than anybody else in southregistered, east Australia. I have lived throughÂ· this debate over the last few years at the coalface, so to speak. There may be some of us who do not like the High Court decision, but it is now the of this country. Native title is now part of common law, and we must live with that and work with it. That is what I believe this reflects quite accurately. In 1992 the Mabo decision was brought they down by the High Court and they went on say that native title may exist on mainland Australia. In December 1996, the High Court brought down what is known as the Wik decision whereby they said that native title may exist on pastoral leases, and that was surprise to everybody. Even the present opposition did not factor that into their nal native title bill. Native title still has not been precisely defined by the High Court. I will use words of the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) when he made his second reading speech on this present bill. He said: Despite more than 3112 years of the operation of current act, for most of Australia we do not know where native title exists and, if it does, identity of the native title holders or the nature their rights. Of course we have to have rules for all this work, and this present bill clarifies these and adds some additional provisions to deal with the new concept of coexisting native title on pastoral lease land. Up until now there has been an expectation out there-especially amongst Aboriginal purchase people-that native title, including on pastoral leases, virtually equates to ownership. It not, of course. But as a result of this the Aboriginal industry has hurled money at making claim after ridiculous claim. There has been no limit on the size of the claim and of money. who may be registered. We have overlapping claims. One poor fellow with a mining lease in Western Australia has 26 overlapping claims on his mining lease. I am told that if you add up the size of land involved in all these claims it amounts to 143 per cent of the Australian land mass. more Six hundred and twelve claims have been over $100 million in legal fees has been wasted and we still do not have one square centimetre of native title land owned by Aboriginal people in Australia. In fact, there has only been one of the 612 claims law resolved and that was for a few acres of land our at Crescent Head on the North Coast of New South Wales and that was immediately sold bill back to the people who occupy the land. The land councils are forever claiming that want funds for quite proper activities that to need to be done amongst the Aboriginal people. But they have gone totally berserk on paying lawyers to chase frivolous native title claims. The Cape York Land Council is spending in excess of $12 million doing that a now. The Kimberley Land Council has spent in excess of $12 million. Even in New South origiWales, up to 30 June this year, the New South Wales Land Council has spent $4,433,475, including $2 million last year-a the total waste of money in the main. The red soil country around Brewarrina, Bourke and Wanaaring in my electorate where claims have been put in is selling for an the average of $8 an acre. It means that, if they yet had put that money into buying the land, they the could own in excess of 550,000 acres now of and own it outright. Even if native title were granted-and it will not be on the claims that have been put in so far-all they can do is go rules onto the land and hold a corroboree, which nobody is interested in doing in New South Wales, throw a line in the Darling River to fish or spear a goanna or something like that. Whereas if the money had been spent to the land like every other Australian, they could own the land outright. Money is does being wasted. It has caused incredible anguish, particularly amongst the landowners throughout my electorate, and it has set reconciliation back years. It is a wicked waste There is a myth afoot in this country that Aboriginal people own little or no land. The 1996 census showed that there are 353,000 Aborigines in Australia-that is, 2 per cent of the the population-and they owned 15.3 per cent of the land mass or 117 million hectares of land in Australia. That is greater in size the total land mass of New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory or-if we can take an overseas example-greater than the land mass of Northern Ireland, Scotland, England, Wales, France and Germany, both East and West, put together. On top of this there is a certain amount of private land ownership. They own 341 properties and the last 200 that were purchased had an average value of $454,000 for the land alone. For example, that alone is more than double the land value of the property that I own. So we are not talking about insubstantial properties. In addition to all this,the New South Wales government puts aside 71J2 per cent of land tax collected to purchase properties. On those properties they also own all mineral rights, except for gold and silver, as well as oil and coal, and they get royalties from any mining conducted on those properties. There is also the indigenous land fund which is worth $1,289 million in 1994-95 dollar terms. The money put aside from that alone would purchase 100 farms for Aboriginal people every year forever-farms worth twice the value of my own property, for example. There have been other sources of funding. For example, the Northern Territory mining royalties to Aboriginal people now amount to more than $350 million. Under this legislation before the parliament today, 78.6 per cent of the Australian land mass is available for claim under native title legislation. One wonders if we have our priorities right. I saw a recent Medical Journal of Australia article on death rates in the Northern Territory. The most common cause of death amongst Aboriginal females was homicide. The most common cause of death amongst Aboriginal males was car accidents, closely followed by homicide, and the premature deaths of Aboriginal infants were four times the Australian average. It is an absolute disgrace. These are the sorts of things that we should reasons. be concentrating on and debating in this country today. But I see that ATSIC just recently funded an extra $80,000 to put a than challenge up against the Hindmarsh Island Bridge legislation, which everybody knows has absolutely no chance whatsoever of succeeding. It is doomed to fail, and $80,000 is totally wasted when they could be spending money in these proper areas that desperately need funding. My point'on this bill is that the High Court decision was supposed to deliver something benefiCial to Aboriginal people. So far it has delivered virtually nothing--certainly nothing on mainland Australia. In fact, it has wasted many millions of dollars. It has become an instrument of divisiveness. If you look at it objectively, it has become a curse to Aboriginal people in diverting these large sums of money to chasing ephemeral rainbows. I want to talk about pastoral leases, particularly those in New South Wales. The High Court said in the Wik decision that unless you have exclusive possession on leasehold land then native title may exist on leasehold land. This has caused much angst in New South Wales, but there has been a total misunderstanding of what the High Court said by both sides of the argument-Aboriginal on one side and pastoralists on the other. The New South Wales Farmers Association has attacked the coalition quite unfairly, I think, in calling us 'spineless, gutless, shallow' and just about every other colourful adjective that you can think of. I believe that they have whipped some people into an unnecessary frenzy on this. They have been asking for the grazing leases in the Western Division of New South Wales to be included in the schedule. They have done that almost to the exclusion of all other debate about the bill. There are a couple of points I would make. The schedule never existed until the coalition invented it, and it is attached to this bill. Of course, if the grazing leases are listed in the schedule, there is the belief that this makes them exempt from native title claims. That is true only if all sides of the debate accept that they should be in the schedule for proper There is a lot of legal advice around that there is some doubt as to whether these leases should be in the schedule. The New South Wales government's legal advice on two occasions said that they should not be scheduled. The Commonwealth took its own legal advice' from Professor Butt, an expert in property law who works in the law department' at the University of Sydney, and Grahame Tanna, who is the Principal Solicitor of the ,Attorney-General's Department. They clearly said in their legal advice to us that Western Division grazing leases do not confer a right of exclusive possession and should not be included in the schedule. We asked the New South Wales Farmers Association to get some legal opinion on this. They have eventually come before us with four opinions, but those four opinionsÂ· have some doubt about them. For example, the first opinion from David Bennett QC said in the conclusion: In these circumstances it is simply not possible to express with anything resembling certainty what view the High Court will take in relation to leases under the Western Lands Act. Further on in his conclusion, when talking about granting exclusive possession, he said: . . . the prospects of the High Court taking that view must be regarded as fairly evenly balanced. The second opinion that they obtained was from Peter MCEwen QC. Regarding the conclusions he had come to, he said: I have done so on the basis of relatively limited information. He also said: ... it is not possible to prognosticate the view Courtthat is, the High Courtwould take when applying the principles enunciated in Wik to leases under the Western Lands Act with certainty or precision. The third opinion they put to us was from Dennis Rose QC who said that the leases should be scheduled but the arguments he seemed to use were the very arguments that were rejected by the High Court majority judges in the Wik decision. To some extent, that is also valid for Sek Hume's opinion, who was the fourth QC that the New South Wales Farmers Association put before us. On balance, with all this conflicting legal advice, it would have been quite silly for us to schedule those leases, as the New South Wales Farmers Association wanted. I can understand and appreciate why they would want them scheduled. However, to do so would have destroyed the credibility of the schedule. It would have invited the other states who did not try this on to also have their leases which were excluded from the schedule included, and that would have collapsed the schedule. You may as well have taken out your Tippex, whited out whatever it was that was listed there and written in 'Australia', if that was the attitude. Also, it would have given the Labor Party a classic case to vote against everything in the Senate. Even if it had passed the Senatewhich it would not have-you would have immediately had a High Court challenge on the validity of the schedule. That would have delayed getting certainty into Western Division pastoral leases for many months, which is against the good interests of the people who occupy grazing leases in the Western Division who have been subject, in many cases, to a great degree of anguish and uncertainty. The New South Wales Farmers Association have said that we are going to need 5,000 test cases in the Western Division to resolve this. I believe that that is a gross exaggeration and not true. They have also said that we will see paralysis of agricultural production. Again, I do not believe that is true at all. They have said that, if it can be shown that the grazing the leases should be added to the schedule later on, it cannot be done. Again, I believe that is not true. If it is shown that grazing leases do extinguish native title, as I believe many of them would, then they can be added to the schedule later on. They have also used a Queensland comparison, saying that Queensland leases were included on the schedule where New South Wales comparable leases were not. Again, that is not quite correct. The small number of grazing homestead perpetual leases-small in area; I think it amounts to about 12.7 per cent of the state-are quite different from Western Division grazing leases. They have the right to apply to freehold the leases. They have the right to turn them into cultivation leases without permission. Their rents are calculated on the unimproved capital value instead of the livestock carrying capacity and so on. They are quite different leases from New South Wales grazing leases. Having said all that about the schedulebecause it has been such a contentious area-I do say that the bill, which is based on the 10point plan that we present to the parliament today, will fix everything that the New South Wales farmers want. There will be certainty returned to grazing because the primary production rights of the leaseholder predominate 100 per cent over the native title rights, even if they are shown to exist on some New South Wales grazing leases. No-one can come on to your property and interfere in any way whatsoever with your legitimate activities. Even if you want to do other things in the future-if you can get permission, as you have to do now, to carry on cultivation activity, agricultural activity, tourist activity, or even running a helicopter flying school base if you wish-if that conflicts with the native title right, then we have made provision in this bill that the native title right can be bought out and compensation paid to the native title holders. The cost of the compensation will be picked up 75 per cent by the Commonwealth government and 25 per cent by the state government. So the farmer, the pastoralist, the grazier will have no expense whatsoever. In fact, we will pick up 100 per cent of the cost of legal aid, if it is needed at any stage, for test cases to be run. I believe you would probably want only one or two and you could just about solve the problem in the Western Division in the future. I do believe that if we can get this bill through virtually .unamended and have it all finished by Christmas then this time next year all the difficulty and sorrow and everything else that has been associated with the present native title bill will have evaporated, because most of the claims in the Western Division, if not all of them as I have seen them, just cannot stand up. They will fail the registration test. Under our registration test you have got to have a proper identification of the area and proper maps. You have got to have a proper identification of the native title claim group under section 190 and you have got to have a proper description of the native title you are claiming for. It must be presented on a fc;tctual basis and you must have a prima facie case. Mineral rights are not included. Also, the physical connection with the land must be established. I will just read this: The Registrar must be satisfied that at least one member of the native title claim group currently has or previously had a traditional physical connection with the area covered by the application. This connection must amount to more than a transitory access or intermittent non-native title access. In other words, your grandfather cannot just have held a picnic there in 1920, or your relatives cannot have come in on a motorbike from South Australia, or you cannot just claim you have had a spiritual connection with the land. You must be able to establish a physical connection. I would have liked to have seen that a bit tighter, but I believe it is far superior to what exists in the present act and it will largely solve the problem. Overall, I do believe this legislation reflects accurately what the High Court wanted and it respects both sides of the debate. (Time expired)",54
41,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"It is with some sorrow that I rise to speak in this debate. I say that because I believe that the thrust of this bill is an endeavour to tum the clock back. I think it was with some pride that, in the last couple of years, Australia as a nation has sought to make a statement that it really wanted to deliver and develop the concept of one nation-a nation committed to doing something for the betterment of all Australians irrespective of their background. In that context, I say that I very much support the thrust of the second reading amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Mr Evans. The problem for the House today is that the thrust of this bill is really an endeavour by the Howard government to force a debate about Wik and native title, and it is a guise to launch a major attack on some of the most needy and disadvantaged people in our nation. That really is what the thrust of the bill is about-turning the clock back and walking away from the needs of the most'disadvantaged of this nation. Fdr . . many years Aboriginals and Torres Strait Iilanders were the people who were out of sight and out of mind. They very much sought the help of many members of the Howard government. But the Howard government considered them out of sight and out of mind, and had the capacity to tum their backs on the needs of the most disadvantaged people in the nation while they feathered their own nests in government. My position is that I think the Australian community at large is of the view that it is no longer possible to argue that they are the forgotten Australians. The tide has turned. It is not just the alarming issues of poor health, appalling living standards, shocking education levels and the lack of employment that have kept indigenous Australians in the public consciousness. The broader Australian community has come to look with pride on the expressions of a unique and vibrant culture which has correctly attracted international attention through artists and musicians and people such as Yothu Yindi and Christine Anu. Wherever we go as a nation now we stand with some pride when weÂ· consider the achievements of our indigenous people. But the problem with this government is that it likes to embrace the Olympic champions, the international artists and the international musicians, but when it comes to the nitty gritty of really trying to do something about the most disadvantaged in the community, it wants to drive a wedge between mainstream Australia and those in the most disadvantaged places in Australia. I take, for example, Yothu Yindi in particular. Through their songs they have popularised the ambitions and struggles of indigenous Australians for land rights as an expression of their culture. Long years of deprivation, dispossession, abuse and neglect have left enduring scars, and so they ought to. None of us can be proud of those scars, but it comes back to an endeavour and a commitment to actually do something to ensure that we overcome those scars in the future. But, despite those scars, a vibrant culture is attracting the attention and support of the wider Australian community and the world. The Howard government has got to understand that, with respect to this debate, not only are Australian eyes on the HQuse of Representatives today but also, more importantly, the international community is monitoring what happens with respect to this bill. I suggest that the government's mishandling of the debate over Wik will reverberate around the world. No longer does Australia walk tall internationally. We have a Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) who has no international standing at all. The debate about Wik will further diminish Australia's standing internationally. I refer, for example, to the action in part of the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) which I suggest is part of a pattern of activity which reveals that this government see native title as an intrusion-an encumbrance-which they want to get rid of any way they can if at all possible. It is a problem that they want to sweep under the carpet because they are not committed to doing something to assist the indigenous people-some of the most disadvantaged people in this nation. It really is a massive irony that this government is acting firmly and resolutely against property rights just because the property holders, on this occasion, are not white. That is what it is all about-property rights for the white community but not for those with black faces. The Liberal and National parties, after all, . are the parties that trumpet their core ideological belief in property rights-yes, property rights for the whites but not the blacks. The Liberal and National parties, after all, are the parties which strut the Australian political stage declaiming their belief in law and order. In the Wik decision, the High Court, I would suggest, has decisively ruled that, yes, all Australians are entitled to property rights whether they have a black face or a white face. The High Court decision recognises the property rights-and correctly so-of indigenous Australians. The government might not like it, some pastoralists might not like it, some miners might not like it, but it is the law of the land and so it ought to be. It is the only way forward for Australia-a sense of security, a sense of opportunity for all Australians. Yes, the ruling might be inconvenient to the coalition government. That is why they are prepared to ignore the High Court decision as they run off to church and profess that they want to do something about the disadvantaged in this country. But, when it comes to making hard decisions and taking decisive actions, real problem is that they will go missing in action in the same way that they have historically gone missing in action when it comes to leadership, commitment and a willingness to do something. I suggest that the government's pig-headed attitude to Wik may actually become a very costly enterprise to Australia at a time when we need stability and security so as investment and create jobs. I refer to the Australian Law Reform Commission and the fact that it has pointed out and warned that the government's plans for native title will not deliver legal certainty but only deliver very costly litigation-all the way back to the High Court. My colleague the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, Mr Melham, has correctly tried to constructively argue this same case through the long months of public debate about these amendments, but the government, for some strange reason, has turned a deaf ear to these warnings. I might also say that the government has become very sensitive when it comes to the Wik bill because there is not a favourable legal opinion lodged with the joint committee on native title except-and we are not surprised-for the legal opinion from the Attorney-General's Department, from an Attorney-General who has a huge question mark over his head today not only with respect to. his future capacity to serve in Howard government but also, more importantly, with respect to his standing in the legal community. And that is not to be dismissed. It is a major problem for the government and it is a major problem for law and order in Australia. One of the greatest strengths of the Native Title Act as it now stands is that, wherever possible, it minimises the role of lawyers and it minimises the adversarial system of the courts. The Native Title Act, as it now stands, allows for a resolution of differences in a non-adversarial, informal setting with emphasis on mediation. The coalition now wishes to undermine this important process and introduce a costly legal process. Litigation will not only hurt indigenous Australia but hurt the mining and farming the communities and the wider economic interests of this nation. This is what this is all about: not just the needs, aspirations and rights of the Australian indigenous community but also the economic needs of a great nation-the Australian nation-a nation that ought to be committed to ensuring that we all have the same rights, irrespective of whether they are property rights or opportunities for decent to attract health, education and training. The right to negotiate, I suggest, has been a key part of the Native Title Act and it has been the opposition's contention all along that the decision to extinguish this right will be constitutionally invalid. I believe that this right to negotiate is a crucial element in allowing meaningful input by indigenous people into real decision making-a sense of emancipation and encouragement to participate-about the development of their communities, their lands and their futures. Since the right to negotiate was established, we have seen the indigenous community come up with some creative uses of this newfound right. Win-win solutions for all Australians have been the end result of that right to negotiate, especially, for example, the negotiated regional agreements which have put a heavy emphasis on a range of core needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. My commitment to native title is based on the a strong belief that we can only expect to achieve this important goal of reconciliation if we see native title as being part of a wider package which fronts up to the other stark problems that the indigenous community faces in Australia as we approach the 21st century. Regional agreements front up to exactly that issue. People negotiate, through regional agreements, ways to resolve crucial health, education, housing and job issues for indigenous Australians. The ability to come up with regional agreements, based on the right to negotiate, has empowered many indigenous communities with the right to determine, often for the first time, their own priorities. A to have some control of the future will, in time, impact on the stark statistics which confront us when we look at the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population. I refer to these statistics today because, as far as I am concerned, you cannot separate the Wik debate and the issue of native title from your commitment to do something about the basic issues of health, education and jobs. Reconciliation and an effective Native Title Act should be used by all sides-yes, all sides-to ensure that, as we go into the 21st century, we develop acceptable and effective plans to resolve the stark statistics of Aborigibeing nallife. The release of the findings of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander survey in 1995 has widened our knowledge of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population. The survey shows that, while a high incidence of health problems such as asthma, hearing problems, heart problems and diabetes were widely reported, access to health care, especially in rural areas, was severely limited. Aboriginal people start life smaller and finish it earlier, with the life expectancy for indigenous females at about 62 years compared to an Australian average of 81 and the life expectancy for indigenous males at 57 compared to an Australian average of 75. At any age, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are more than twice as likely to die as non-Aboriginal people. At the most crucial age of 25 to 44, the risk is five times greater. But not all the Aboriginal health statistics are gloomy. The death rate from cardiovascular disease has declined among Aboriginal males. Death from lung cancer is declining among Aboriginal men, although not among women. Alcohol related deaths are declining sharply as are male deaths from car accidents and homicide. The infant mortality rate continues to decline, but its rate of decline appears to have slowed. Many of the health problems I have talked about can be tackled if we work with local communities to improve the standard of Aboriginal housing, which is an acute problem. An indigenous family is 20 times more likely to be homeless than a non-indigenous right family and four times more likely to be in overcrowded accommodation. At least a quarter of the community lives in unsatisfactory housing. In rural areas, this proportion is roughly one in three. Overcrowding is particularly acute in rural areas where one household in three comprises six or more people, and three-quarters of these households had three bedrooms or fewer. In rural areas, about 40 per cent of these houses require major repair or replacement. I am pleased to say that I have witnessed a number of places in Queensland, confronted with those difficulties, where this issue is now effectively tackled by local Aboriginal communities. The communities are using the local housing crisis to provide new skills and to create job and training opportunities for their people and, in doing so, are resolving health problems for their old and young people. Just outside of Townsville is the Shalom College which is run by the remarkable Uniting Church minister, Shayne Blackman, who has trained young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the skills to build appropriate housing in rural areas. As part of the hands-on training at Shalom College, the teenagers and young adults have built nursing homes for their elders and classroom facilities for the younger people attending Shalom College's primary and secondary school. It is about practical outcomes because they have a sense of capacity and opportunity. There are a number of other examples that I could refer to today, but time does not permit. Mr Deputy Speaker, I suggest to you that there are solutions. But the biggest problem confronting indigenous Australia is employment. In some localities, the unemployment rate exceeds 50 per cent but, in the early 1990s, employment opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people grew more rapidly than non-indigenous employment. This was largely due to the major expansion by the Labor Party of the community development employment projects scheme, under which participants have the opportunity to work on community projects funded by forgone unemployment benefits. Most of the CDEP work was low skill and part time and, overwhelmingly, it was rural and remote based. Because of the lack of jobs, the lack of education and the lack of skills, the annual income that indigenous Australians earn is very low. Three-fifths of people aged 15 or over receive $12,000 or less, while one in nine receive more than $25,000 per annum. Government payments are clearly the main source of income. In conclusion, I suggest that the Wik ruling provided new and vital opportunities for indigenous Australians to confront their major social problems, their unemploym-nt problems and the need to skill and train their people for new jobs that could be created by the rights invested in indigenous Australians by the Wik decision. If we are to allow Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to create new opportunities for themselves, the Howard government should not be actively campaigning to undermine the High Court's Wik decision. The government should act with respect for both the High Court rulings and the newly revived property rights of the first Australians. Some people on the other side might not like it, but the indigenous Australians are the first Australians and they have some rights and entitlements. The High Court has recognised them. It is about time the other side of the House recognised and respected the right of the High Court to make such decisions. The Wik ruling can bea godsend for all. I know the 'God squad' on the other side of the House do not have a lot of respect for the High Court when it comes to hard decisions. The Wik decision provides a path to help the reconciliation process, a path to help to resolve two centuries of dis empowerment which has created the awful statistics which are all too often repeated in discussions about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The time has come to take the hand off the prayer book, the hand off the heart; and to actually do something. Get your hands dirty. Respect the High Court decision, empower the indigenous people, respect the fact that in Australia black people as well as white people are entitled to property rights. Give them the capacity to further develop themselves-Give them the capacity to negotiate local arrangements and to do something in a practical way about health, education and the all important employment issues of jobs and training. Take your head out of the sand, stand on your high heels and actually do something rather than just talk about it.",58
42,Mr SLIPPER,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"The speech just delivered by the shadow minister, the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), who is at the table, is undoubtedly one of the most offensive, odious and outrageous speeches ever to be uttered in this place. There is no doubt whatsoever that Aboriginal people are disadvantaged. There is no doubt that much needs to be done to bring their state of health up to the standard of those in the general community. We were treated by the shadow minister to a range of Aboriginal health statistics. They were sad statistics. Quite often those statistics were correct. The shadow minister has the hide, the audacity, to come in here in relation to the Native Title Amendment Bill and refer to those matters. The shadow minister is a member of a party which, for 13 years, controlled the treasury benches in Australia. For 13 years, that government did absolutely nothing. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has referred the current reference into Aboriginal health to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, which I chaired before my appointment as Government Whip by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). The government is absolutely determined to make sure that Aboriginal health and other disadvantage are redressed. The former government spent taxpayers' dollars and loads of this parliament's time talking about the problems of Aborigines and talking about native title but, at the end of the day, Aboriginal health, housing, infant mortality and educational standards remained as they always have been, and that situation is totally unacceptable. I think the Australian people will reject the hypocrisy of the now opposition. They had the hide to criticise this government when this is the first government to do anything. The shadow minister also suggested that we are trying to destroy the High Court decisions in Mabo and Wik. There is no doubt that, prior to the Mabo No.2 decision in 1992, nobody thought that native title survived. We all believed that the concept of terra nullius was in fact the law. When the High Court brought down the Mabo decision, it obviously exploded the certainty in land law that was previously there, and the former government brought in the Native Title Act. We then pointed out that that Native Title Act was an unworkable response to the High Court decision. When one listens to speakers from the Labor Party, one would think that that particular piece of legislation is a paragon of virtue. We, in opposition, pointed out that the Native Title Act 1993 was not going to work. Up until the present time, some 612 applications have been lodged before the National Native Tribunal and only one mainland determination has been made. We have listened to opposition speakers saying how the legislation before the House will destroy the workability of the Native Title Act. What an absolutely sick joke! The Native Title Act has no workability whatsoever. What is more, one of the basic fundamentals on which the act was predicated was exploded when the High Court brought down its deci$ion in the Wik case. It is interesting to look at what the then Prime Minister Keating had to say in the parliament on 16 November 1993 in his second reading speech on the then Native Title Bill: I draw attention also to the recording in the preamble of the bill of the government's view' that under the common law past valid freehold and leasehold grants extinguish native title. There is therefore no obstacle or hindrance to renewal of pastoral leases in the future, whether validated already valid. . There it is was in black and white in the preamble to the legislation. The then Senator Gareth Evans, when talking about preambles said: We all understand these days the role that preambles have in legislation as an interpretive tool for the courts and as a useful way of expressing the intended scope of legislation. The parliament, in the preamble to the Native Title Act, expressed the view that native title was extinguished by leasehold and freehold grants but, obviously, the court decided otherwise. This government accepts the decision in the Mabo case. We also accept the decision in the Wik case, but this legislation seeks to make the Wik decision more workable. Justice Michael Kirby, one of the judges in that case, pointed out that the decision in Wik could well bring about uncertainty. This government has had to redress the uncertainty delivered by the High Court. It is quite wrong for the honourable member for Batman to suggest that this government has had a pig-headed attitude to Wik. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Senator Minchin) ought to be congratulated for the exemplary way in which he has consulted with all stakeholders in Australia on achieving a situation which means that we are able to bring this bill before the parliament. He has consulted with pastoralists, miners, the indigenous community and with the general community. He ought to be praised for bringing forward this measured response which will seek to reduce uncertainty. It will improve the workability of native title processes and find a balance among the interests of all parties and it will, most importantly, maintain respect for native title. The government said in its election policy that it would amend the Native Title Act to improve its workability, and this legislation before the chamber is the delivery of yet another election promise. Far from those people opposite coming in here and seeking to condemn and criticise this government for this bill, they ought to sit back and say that this is another occasion or when we did not create the problem but we accept the responsibility to fix it up. This legislation is balanced, reasonable and takes into account the needs of pastoralists, miners and the general community, as well as the Aboriginal community. I want at this stage to refer briefly to the allegations made by the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) against the Attorney General (Mr Williams) in relation to the Australian Law Reform Commission. lt ought to be recognised that the Australian Law Reform Commission operates on references given to it by the Attorney-General. The shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), was Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in the last parliament. I have to concede that he was a pretty good chairman. Mr Tanner-Hear, hear!",62
43,Mr SLIPPER,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"The member for Melbourne interjects. He was a much better chairman of that committee than he is shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs. Both the Attorney-General and I were members of that committee. There was a report brought down in relation to the Australian Law Reform Commission and the chairman, the honourable member for Banks, signed off on that report which indicated that the commission ought only be able to operate in accordance with references given to it by the Attorney-General. With respect to the Australian Law Reform Commission, we have a gratuitous act by the commission in seeking to buy into the Wik issue and native title. There was no reference given by the minister. The Australian Law Reform Commission takes an extraordinary amount of time in many cases to report on references given to it by the Attorney-General of the day. Yet, despite that, it was able to find within its resources the time to put together a submission on Wik. The Attorney-General has pointed out that the Australian Law Reform Commission is supposed to act on references given to it by the Attorney-General. That is the position which was confirmed by a committee chaired by the Labor shadow minister in the last parliament. lt has always been the position. Simply put, what has been said is that the Australian Law Reform Commission, in this instance, have overstepped the mark. They have forgotten what their legislation says. They have bought into something where they do not belong. They do not currently have any reference in relation to native title, yet they have decided to put aside the references given by successive Attorneys-General and intrude into something which is not currently their responsibility. I think that is very unacceptable and most regrettable. The honourable member for Banks uttered a few things in his speech that indicated what was wrong with the former government. He showed how out of touch the former government was and the opposition now is with the community. He was divisive. It is very clear that the honourable member for Banks listens only to certain interest groups and does not consider the interests of mainstream Australia. The honourable member for Banks even managed to suggest somehow that the Native Title Act is workable. How on earth could anyone suggest that the Native Title Act is workable when there have been 612 applications lodged, yet only one determination by the National Native Title Tribunal with respect to mainland Australia? We all know about the paralysis that has hit economic development as a result of the Native Title Act and because of spurious and multiple claims over the same piece of property. What this government has done is bring down a situation which will reduce uncertainty. We want to improve the workability of native title processes. We seek to find an appropriate balance among the interests of all parties and we aim to maintain respect for native title. One would have thought that the opposition would have said to the government, 'Thank you very much for fixing up the mess that we created in 1993.' But, regrettably, we find that once again the opposition are playing politics. They are showing simply how irrelevant they are. lt is curious to look at the comments made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) in the second reading debate on the bill. This really is the understatement of the year. He said: There are some problems that were created in the aftermath of the Wik decision. We, on the opposition side, are fully prepared to cooperate in their redress ... I call< upon the shadow minister to put up or shut up. Is he going to cooperate? Is the Labor Party going to cooperate? .Are they going to urge their senators to collaborate in making sure that we are able to fix up the appalling situation. in relation to native title that we inherited upon attaining government in March 1993? Are they going to do that, or are they going to do what speaker after speaker has said in this particular place? They are seeking to frustrate this attempt by this government to bring our 10-point plan to fruition, a 10-point plan that is fair not only to Aborigines but also to other sections of the community. Mr Tanner interjecting",64
44,Mr SLIPPER,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member for Melbourne ought to be ashamed of himself. Once I used to think that he was a person who had some ability. Clearly, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) is still concerned about the member for Melbourne. On this issue the member for Melbourne is totally wrong. He ought to support the position enunciated by the government. As I said, we had the Mabo decision in 1992, we had the Native Title Act in 1993 which, I might add, was opposed by the then opposition at the time, and then we had the Wik decision brought down this year. This government has not rushed into a quick fix solution with respect to Wik. As I said, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister has consulted widely right across the Australian community with a view to obtaining a balance. I pointed out that he has spoken to pastoralists, indigenous interests, states and territories and also to industry. These proposals currently before the parliament seek to achieve a number of outcomes. Those outcomes include legal validity for acts done between the commencement of the Native Title Act in January 1994 and the Wik decision on the assumption that pastoral leases and other tenures extinguished native title. The proposals also seek toÂ· restore certainty to pastoralists so that they can carry on primary production activities. We seek to have respect for native title, preserving the principle of native title as established in the Mabo case in allowing claims to proceed. Of course, that explodes the suggestions made by the honourable member for Batman who tries to point out that we are seeking to destroy the Mabo and Wik decisions. The proposals also will confirm the common law relating to native title and, in particular, that it is extinguished by current and historical freehold, residential leases, commercial leases, and those agricultural and pastoral leases providing exclusive possession. We also aim to improve workability through removing impediments to developing and building on the government's proposed amendments to improve the processes of the Native Title Act 1993. The proposals also include devolution to the states and territories and, in particular, allowing for alternative state and territory processes for granting mining leases on pastoral lease land. We also aim for a speedy and sustainable resolution of concerns and uncertainty. Some people were not happy with what the Prime Minister included in the to-point plan. It is interesting that some people said that the government did not go far enough and others said that the government went too far. That probably indicates that the government has it exactly right. The Prime Minister has shown exemplary leadership in relation to Wik. It would be very easy for us to rush off and urge wholesale extinguishment of native title by pastoral leases. It would have been easy for us to be populists and to go out there and say what many people wanted to hear. But the Prime Minister on this issue, as on the guns issue, and as on so many other issues, has shown himself to be a statesman. He has been prepared to spend an inordinate amount of time working out a position which is fair and equitable to all sides. That is why I am particularly proud to support this legislation which is currently before the House. Some people have said that there ought to be wholesale extinguishment. I can understand the superficial attractiveness of that approach. However, to have blanket extinguishment would undermine the very certainty and security sought to be brought about by this legislation. Our pastoralists, in particular, would be affected in a number of ways. Were we to go down the extinguishment road there would be legal problems, and it would considerably increase the likelihood. of a successful constitutional challenge to the validity .of the legislation. Claims, of course, would not disappear, they would simply manifest themselves as claims for compensation. There would be more time lost and there would be more paralysis. There would be substantial compensation paid for extinguishing native title. The courts, on a case by case basis, would have to decide what compensation would be paid in individual circumstances and there could be millions if not billions of dollars paid out. Also, one really has to be practical in politics. Life is not the art of the possible, is the art of the attainable. While we achieved a massive majority in the last election-the people of Australia resoundingly voted for the Howard coalition government-regrettably, owing to vagaries in the Senate voting system, we did not obtain a similar majority in the upper house. As a government we had to be aware that we must bring in reforms to the Native Title Act but it was important that, if they were going to be workable, if they were going to come into effect, we get them through the upper house. It was made very clear by the. Labor Party and by the minor parties in the Senate that, were we to go down the wholesale extinguishment road, our legislation would be unlikely to be passed by the Senate and there would be an indefinite continuity of uncertainty. There are very many proposals in this legislation of a technical nature which substantially improve the workability of the Native Title Act, and there was no point in our making a great big noise and bringing forward proposals for wholesale extinguishment which would have resulted in increased legal cases. It would have resulted in an enormous amount of financial outlay, even if we could have got the proposals through the parliament. But it is obvious we would not have got them through the parliament and so there really is a very practical as well as a moral reason for not proceeding down the road of wholesale extinguishment. Also, there were downsides for the Australian community generally if we were to go down the road of wholesale extinguishment. It would risk the reconciliation process. The honourable member for Batman said that we were not committed to reconciliation. That is absolutely untrue. This government and ministers have pointed out that we are committed to the reconciliation of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians, and I think the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) would agree that this is a bipartisan approach. . The honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) actually sits on the national council with respect to reconciliation. So it is quite wrong, it is very dishonest-and I am pleased it to see that the member for Melbourne is nodding-to suggest that this government does not support the principle of reconciliation. As far as our international reputation is concerned, it would also have been damaged were we to go down the road of wholesale extinguishment. To sum up, as time is short, this is a very important piece of legislation. We are seeking through this legislation to fix up a problem which was left to us by our predecessors. This bill is balanced, it is fair, it is workable, it is equitable and it will be to the benefit of the indigenous people of Australia. It will also be to the benefit of miners; it will be to the benefit of the tourist industry and also of pastoralists. So this bill is a win/win/win/win situation. Those opposite stand condemned for their negativity, for their failure in government to do anything about Aboriginal people and for their bringing to Australia the Native Title Act, which has proven so far to be absolutely and completely unworkable. (Time expired)",65
45,Ms HANSON,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"Today this House will debate whether we are to be one people belonging to one nation or many peoples belonging to many nations. For many years Australia has been divided through policies of multiculturalism and an unfair view of history that have led to the impractical, discriminatory and stupid notion of land rights, and special treatment for so-called minorities at the .expense of everyone else. Today you may very well collude to enshrine that division despite even the previous Prime Minister's view of past validated freehold grants, residential, commercial, pastoral, agricultural and validated crown actions extinguishing native title. This extinguishment should be extended to cover vacant crown land as well. There is a need to put the High Court back into its rightful place. of interpreting the law, not creatirig the law. We must question who is running the country when seven judges, not elected by the people, presume to make such monumental decisions. It is imperative that the people of Australia understand that native title is, as is said, the 'thin edge of the wedge'. In conjunction with the Canadian government, the indigenous people of Canada have recently created Nunavut, a separate indigenous state within the nation of Canada. Originally, Nunavut was to be a tract of semiautonomous land of some two million square kilometres. However, a further deal was done and the two million square kilometres of semi-autonomous land of this state within a state became 350,000 square. kilometres of freehold land. This will be formalised in 1999, and will in effect leave Canada with another country bigger than the state of Victoria within its borders. It is imperative that the Australian people know and understand the international forces driving the Aboriginal industry and the flawed and divisive concept of native title. It is crucial to realise that the underlying blueprint and inspiration behind the creation of a separate indigenous nation within Canada and the impending creation of an Aboriginal nation within our own country is the United Nations Draft Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Australian people, and through them the parliament, must be given the widest possible opportunity to understand the massive and irrevocable changes to Australia that will occur when this United Nations treaty, like so many before it, is ratified and implemented-as always, to the detriment of ordinary Australians. The report Indigenous peoples and environmental management: a review of Canadian regional agreements and their potential application to Australia, part 1, by Richardson and others, states: The Canadian experience is one strategy that Aboriginals might use to resolve the issues raised by the creation of native title in Australia. In the words of Mick Dodson, ATSIC Social Justice Commissioner, on 25 October 1996: We believe that in the process of adopting the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, time is on the side of Indigenous peoples. We continue to believe that through perseverance with this process, it will be possible to achieve consensus on the provisions of the declaration, as it presently stands. Or let me quote Peter Jull, a former adviser to the Canadian Prime Minister and now a research fellow of the Northern Australian Research Unit and consultant to the Central Land Council, who said: Nunavut has prophetic meaning when viewed in an international context. It heralds a new world order. A hunter-gatherer people, with a stubborn sustainable development philosophy and no visible modem industrial economy, are taking over one-fifth of the world's second largest nation state. Such a breakthrough provides practical inspiration for other indigenous peoples. This does not mean it should be copied precisely elsewhere, but it can be usefully studied as a precedent. There is an undeniable link between the events in Australia and Canada. The man who was the architect of Nunavut in Canada is now living in Brisbane, and planning a Nunavut for Australia. There is no doubt the long-term goal of the Aboriginal industry is to create a separate indigenous nation within Australia: a separate country that the allegedly gUilty non-Aboriginal Australians will pay for. This is a clear and indisputable fact that will disturb all Australians who believe we are working for the future as one people. The concept and general understanding of 'indigenous' has been created with dubious purpose and dangerous intent. The tr.ue and much broader meaning of 'indigenous' is not generally understood, and as it stands it is meant to confuse and deceive. It is most important for us all to be Austral9 ians. How long you or your ancestors may have been here is irrelevant. It is a flawed argument to essentially suggest that some people are more Australian than others when some of us were born here and others have chosen to become Australians--either we are equal in all things or equal in none. When what is indigenous, what is Australian and levels of Aboriginality are mixed with the fact that the greater majority of so-called indigenous people are of mixed ancestry, often with only small percentages of Aboriginal blood, confusion of identity and entitlement reigns supreme. What is certain however is that, to progress together as one people, we must all be treated equally and not separated for special treatment. In Australia, Aborigines comprise less than two per cent of our population yet, under native title, they will claim perhaps as much as 75 per cent of land that is supposed to belong to us all. It is beyond belief to even consider giving less than two per cent of the population of Australia a stranglehold over 75 per cent of Australia, yet that is the issue before us. It is true that many Aboriginal people are not working and that they are living in appalling conditions. The current situation, with the corrupt and inefficient activities of ATSIC, does not allow much opportunity for improving their lifestyle. However, they do not have a monopoly on being disadvantaged, as it is also true that a million other Australians are not working and, although they feel little hope for the future, no-one is giving them land. Rather, you are taking the land that belongs to us all and making it the sole property of the few. I am accused of trying to tum back the clock to the 1950s but the government, by refusing to extinguish so-called native title, turning the clock back to the 1780s. Those who fear fairness and decency applying for everyone call me a racist, but by embracing so-called native title this government and its predecessors are advocating the ownership of land purely based on race. Let me remind members of this House of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. Section of that act makes it unlawful for a person to do any act involving a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise on an equal footing of any human right or fundamental freedom. Section 10 of the act provides that if, by reason of a law of the Commonwealth, state or territory, persons of a particular race, the first group, do not enjoy a. right that is enjoyed by persons of another race, the second group, or enjoy a right to a more limited extent then, notwithstanding that law, the first group are to enjoy the right to the same extent as the second group. The noble intent of the act has however been nobbled by section 8 which allows special measures for ethnic and racial groups and hence discrimination against white Australians. We must be one nation. We must not have an Aboriginal or any other nation within our nation. The path of native title will eventually divide Australia into many nations of varying ethnicities: an Aboriginal nation will be just the beginning. We must extinguish native title, without penalty to the Australian taxpayer, through an amendment to the Australian constitution. This should be put to the Australian people in the form of a referendum to be held concurrently with the next federal election. If I had the opportunity to move an amendment to the Native Title Bill, I would move that consideration of the bill be deferred until the electors of Australia are given the opportunity to express their opinion by way of referendum. If our country must face division, let the people have their rightful chance to stop it.",66
46,Mr WAKELIN,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"On the evening of Thursday, 25 November 1993 I is rose in this House to oppose the Native Title Bill, as it then was. I asked the assembled members of this house a question: could it be that once again regional Australia had been asked to carry the heaviest load? Over those intervening years the answer has reverberated a very clear yes. That evening in Canberra in 1993, I pleaded with the parliament to understand that the ideas and the concepts they were playing around with were highly dangerous. The legislation that the government was supporting would divide this nation and the Aboriginal people of Australia would not gain one iota from the passage of that bill. Unfortunately, and I say this with no sense of pleasure, I believe that I was right. That evening my arguments were intended for the ears of Labor's then regional members. One characteristic shared by those honourable members at that time is that at the subsequent election they were unceremoniously thrown from office partly because of, I believe, the betrayal in that summer of 1993. The disastrous effects of the astonishing judgment of the High Court of Australia in the 1996 Wik decision and the deceit of the Keating-Beazley government in passing the Native Title Act have engulfed all quarters of our nation, not simply the entire regional section of the parliamentary Labor Party. Let us look at the native title impact on Australia today. The facts are obvious. Seventy-eight per cent of Australia is potentially subject to native title claim. That is undisputed. There has been only one negotiated successful claim in five years despite $88.8 million worth of funding through the representative bodies. I understand that is something like 600 claims and that everyone is aware of the overlapping claims issue. For instance, in my own electorate of Grey there is more native title claimed than actually exists. The most obvious effect has been the shutdown of minerals and resource development in this country. Already, in the three years from the Mabo judgment, offshore mining increased as a percentage of mining activity by Australian companies from 27 per cent to 41 per cent as Australia's miners were forced to halt activity in their own country. This is equivalent to around $486 million flying out of Australia in a single year. Yet Labor's Special Minister for State, the then member for Robertson, Frank Walker, now replaced by my colleague Jim Lloyd, told the House, 'I think that those who are suggesting that there will be some loss of investment are simply wrong.' Were that were so. Our farmers have been devastated by the High Court's decision and the subsequent acts of the Commonwealth. Even advocates such as Rick Farley, who many believe sold out his fellow farmers in 1993, have been forced to admit that farmers have been stymied by the Native Title Act. The Wik decision of last year has exacerbated such concerns. I come to the impact on my own electorate of Grey. By its very nature, my electorate has borne the brunt of much of the uncertainty of native title, remembering that it is 92 per cent of the land mass of South Australia. To be truthful, I wonder if my very presence in this parliament did not prejudice the efforts of my electorate to get a decent hearing from the previous government. Would they have had such disregard for the people of the north of South Australia if there had been a Labor member for Grey at the time? Regrettably the answer is yes for even the protestations of the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) who was dumped by the ALP for his efforts was unable to shift the Keating-Beazley mind-set. The farmers of Grey have been frightened, intimidated and provoked by the legal advocates of native title-advocates who are usually not Aboriginal; they are usually from Adelaide or Sydney and have no interest in the productive use of pastoral land.",68

49,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Attorney-General. I refer the Attomey-General to his claims that the Australian Law Reform Commission has no power to comment on the Native Title Bill because it has no current terms of reference directly on that subject. Why then did the Prime Minister's parliamentary secretary, Senator Minchin, involve the commission in discussing native title amendments from early 1996-a period of over 12 months-including by writing to the commission on 3 July this year on the bill? Exactly when, and in what circumstances, did the Attorney-General first learn that Senator Minchin and the government have been using the commission as a source of advice on amendments to the Native Title Act? Mr Ross Cameron- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My point of order relates to standing order No. 142, which states that ministers are responsible to this House for matters over which they have public responsibility. Ministers explicitly are not responsible for statements made by senators in the other place on this or any other subject.",70
50,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order.,70
51,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition refers to my claim that the Law Reform Commission has no power. The Law Reform Commission must itself think the same because, under the previous government, it sought a reference on native title, which was declined. Earlier this year, there was correspondence in relation to the subject of new references. The commission sought another reference on the subject of native title', and it was not given. I cannot answer for'the in:. volvement of Senator Minchin; I do not know. Mr Crean-When did you find out about it; that's all you were asked.",70
52,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What I can say is that the submission that went to the Wik task force was not, to my knowledge, sought by the Wik task force, except in so far as it was sending out copies of the bill for comment. This all goes to an allegation that we are seeking to suppress the opinion of the Law Reform Commission. Mr Rose, the President of the Australian Law Reform Commission, does not seem to think that that was what was occurring. There was no direction given. There was no suggestion that any direction would be given that their opinion not be provided to the Wik task force or to the parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title. In the discussions that the acting secretary of my department had with the president of the commission, it was left on the basis that it was ultimately the commission's decision whether or not to comment on the Native Title Bill. But, if they were to do so, they knew that it was my view that they would be doing so without statutory authority. I would have been remiss in my duties as Attorney General, responsible for the Law Reform Commission, if I had not drawn that to the commission's attention. Let me just say that it is not the content of the submission which is in issue. My position would be exactly the same whether the position was favourable or unfavourable. I expressed similar concerns in relation to a submission that the commission made to another committee of this House, in this case on copyright law. You have also raised the issue of why I only raised concerns about this submission, and some of the interjections seem to be directed at that. I was not, in fact, aware until earlier this week that the commission has been making submissions on a wide range of issues that are unrelated to any current reference. I was not aware of this practice when I initially wrote to the president to put my view that making submissions on matters not the subject of an existing reference required my authority.",70
53,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And you would give a direction.,71
54,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Why, I ask the opposition, did the Law Reform Commission not advise on the Native Title Bill 1993? Why did they not advise on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1995? Why did they not advise on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996? Why did they not offer advice to the parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund inquiry into the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act? The opposition has rushed off to the Clerk of the Senate and sought advice on the conduct ofMr Martin Ferguson-He's a better lawyer than you.",71
55,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me respond to the member for Batman by saying that my understanding is that the Clerk of the Senate has no legal qualifications. I question the judgment of the clerk in rushing out on Monday two opinions based on hypothetical facts. The second of the opinions actually refers to me. So the set of facts in the first letter was not hypothetical at all; he was intending to refer to the situation regarding me, the commission and the committee. What he advised on was not fact. What I have done is endeavour to ascertain the situation on the basis of a proper statement of the facts. I have sought advice. The Chief General Counsel has advised that I am perfectly correct in asserting that the commission has no power under its act to offer a submission on a matter on which it has no current reference, in particular on the Native Title Bill. I also sought advice on the true situation regarding the discussion between the acting secretary to my department and the president of the commission. The acting secretary has, as a result of that discussion, decided the commission would not offer a submission. Mr Gareth Evans-He didn't have much choice, did he?",71
56,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He did have a choice. Let me just tell you what the acting secretary has told me. He said: I told himthat is, the presidentthat he was ""at a cross-roads""-the Commission could go forward with the submission to the PIC and he would receive an ""unhappy letter"" from the Attorney. Or they could not go forward, and he would not receive any letter-instead he and I could sit down and try to work out a set of ground rules relating to submissions which would satisfy all the parties. AR expressed concern that I might wish to suggest that the Commission should be limited to only making submissions on matters relating to current references. I told himthat is, the acting secretary told himthat it was not my wish to be so restrictive. I then suggested to AR that he think about what I had said to him and that I would call him later in the day. In fact, I was not able to speak to him until the following day, when he indicated to me that the Commission would not be going ahead with its submission. Conversation was generally quiet and friendly. You might say, 'Well, what would the Clerk of the Senate have said if he had known those facts?' Let me tell you that the Chief General Counsel says that there is no suggestion of a breach of the Parliamentary Privileges Act on those events. You have been running around for the last four days raising issues in the Senate. Yesterday you did not even ask me one question on the subject. You did not have one question. You allowed it to be asked in the Senate where they do not have the facts. I had the facts. You let them go on. This can now be seen for what it is: it is really just an exercise in attempting to smear and besmirch. I reject it.",71
57,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I have a supplementary question. My supplementary question to the Attorney-General is: then in your view that conversation that you had with the assistant commissioner does not constitute an effort to influence him?",71

60,Mrs GALLUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of criticism of Australia's greenhouse position? Has the criticism led to a reconsideration of the government's position?,72
61,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My attention has been drawn to a report in today's Australian of some criticism made of Australia's position by Denmark. I will take the opportunity in replying to the honourable member for Hindmarsh to mention to the House that Denmark's environment minister, Mr Sven Auken, has criticised Australia's claims for what he describes as 'special consideration'. Let me start by saying that Australia is not seeking special consideration; Australia is merely seeking fair consideration. I Labor Party is once again siding with foreign criticism, as they always do. They always side with foreign criticism. Whenever the Australian national interest is at stake they always agree with those who criticise Australia. But may I take the opportunity of saying that, of all those who might choose to criticise Australia's position, Denmark is in a particularly vulnerable position. The reason that Denmark is in a particularly vulnerable position is that Denmark herself is part of some special arrangements that exist. For example, Danish statistics relating to emissions claim that emissions of CO 2 fell by 0.5 per cent in 1996. However-and this is the interesting part, Mr SPEAKER - this was achieved by deducting 13 million tonnes of emissions from energy exports to Norway and Sweden. Denmark's electricity, therefore, went into a black hole. While they talk about Nordic power sharing, neither Norway nor Sweden counted the emissions either. So, somehow or other, some of the European countries who, with Labor Party support here, adopt this self-righteous position and point the finger at Australia and say that Australia is asking for special treatment, themselves have some extraordinary special arrangements. According to my advice, if we adopted the Danish method we could all get our figures down but the environment would be no better off. Mr Speaker, can I say to DenlIlark, can I say to the energy minister of Denmark, and can I say to all the supporters of the Danish position who sit opposite that we are sticking up for the Australian national interest. What is involved in this greenhouse gas debate is a threat to 90,000 Australian jobs. What is involved in this greenhouse debate is an attempt by the Australian government to stick up for the Australian interest. Those who criticise our stance and those opposite who support the critics of our stance are doing the Australian national interest in the eye. What I am arguing for, what I will continue to argue for and what. my government will continue to argue for is a fair deal for Australia: not a special deal for Australia, not a Labor deal for Australia but a fair deal for Australia; a deal that will protect Australian industry and, even more importantly, protect notice the and generate Australian jobs. Native Title: Australian Law Reform Commission",72
62,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice. Did the Attorney-General personally authorise the tabling of the Australian Law Reform Commission's 1996 annual report which lists 24 wide-ranging submissions made that year by the commission to various government agencies and parliamentary inquiries, consistent with a tradition going CO 2 back 21 years? Will the Attorney-General confirm that, since the commission had already written a lengthy report on the Native Title Amendment Bill in response to Senator Minchin's letter in July, no further resources would have been necessary to prepare a submission to the parliamentary committee? Isn't it true that the only reason you stopped the commission making a public submission to the parliamentary committee was that the government did not want the commission's criticism of the bill to become public, and that the Pfime Minister would have ensured that you h-d absolutely no future in the governpayment ment if you hadn't?",72

What I was aware of was that the commission had made submissions on a should number of issues, but I did not know that they were making submissions on matters on a which they had no current reference and which they had delivered no report. I only became aware of that earlier this week. I became aware of their submission to the Wik task force only after they had delivered it. I did not know that beforehand. When I did find out about that, I queried it. My concern has always been, having been a member the 1994 Melham committee that said that the outlook?

67,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I understand that this has matter has been raised by the senator in another place today. The Remuneration Tribunal has determined that senators and members are entitled to a capital city travelling allowance when staying overnight in a capital city. In making his claims for travel allowance, Senator Sherry has consisnews. tently specified 'Hobart' in relation to Tasthe mania. The Remuneration Tribunal does not define a capital city.

72,Mr RANDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer explain the significance of recent indicators on imports, housing approvals and retail trade? of What do they indicate about the economic",73
73,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The honourable job. member will be aware that retail turnover figures for August released yesterday were better than expected following a very large per cent rise in July. Although there was a 0.4 per cent fall, the trend growth rate in August was 0.6 per cent-the highest monthly growth rate for two years. Trend retail turnwas particularly strong in South Australia-0.7 per cent for each of the last three months. Throughout Australia only the ACT performed better. The pick-up in imports in August also points to strengthening activity. Total exports of goods and services reached a record high in August, growing by rate of three per cent in the month. The Drake International hirings intention survey also released today presents more good It reveals that employment is now on up, led by Australia's hospitality, sales and business services sectors. Drake also had good news for South Australia. South Australnight is is 'now back in hiring mode' with job opportunities forecast to increase by 1.6 cent over the next quarter. The pick up retail trades and employment in the state South Australia will be very much welcomed by the South Australian government, led Premier John Olsen. Building approvals in August also showed a strong 13.5 per cent rise, suggesting that underlying conditions in the housing sector remain firm. Strong increases in approvals were recorded both for houses and mediumstances density buildings. On Monday, I also referred to the fact that housing afford ability is at best for years. I suggested that some senators and members who did not own houses could perhaps think about getting back into the housing market. I suggested that the Bedouin from Burnie, Senator Sherry, might be someinto body who should buy a house. We mw fuxl matter? out that Senator Sherry does have a house-it is his office in Burnie. Senator Sherry both lives and works in the building, which is his home and his office. That means, according to Senator Sherry, that if he is not at the office he is away from home. He can claim an away from home allowance every time he leaves the office. Most people claim pay to go to the office. Senator Sherry claims pay to leave the office. We know that, in leaving the office, Senator Sherry spends some 140 nights in a place calls Hobart--49 kilometres away at Opossum Bay. So we have weekend at Burnie and then we have week days with mum in Opossum he Bay. Senator Sherry claims $300 to stay with mum at Opossum Bay while he is mentary business. Can you imagine the kind of welcome he gets? He gets paid $300 to go home to mum's. Can you imagine the welthe come? 'Oh Possum!' she says; 'Oh Possum, me you're home!' On Sunday, the Leader of Opposition said, 'If Labor people are rorting, Labor people go.' It is time for Senator Sherry. Native Title: Australian Law Reform Commission",73

I refer to the minister's question time response that his TA and charter claims were made 'in good faith and in the spirit of the guidelines' - later changed to 'no deliberate or systemic error'. Has the minister checked his travel records he and have these checks revealed any further errors? Will the minister now table his travel records for the second half of 1996-97?

I have answered more than 25 questions which have found nothing for the opposition. I will continue to answer your questions, but if you have got an allegation, why don't you make that allegation come up front with it? At the same time, don't you say it out of the privilege of last parliament? I have got nothing to hide. .. Through your briefing of the media yesterclay you started to bring a third party into an innocent person, a good ordinary person, a person I have used as a commercial pilot on four orfive occasions.

Capital Gains Tax: Rollover Relief",74
78,Mr BARTLETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the House of initiatives by the government to provide rollover relief from capital gains tax for Australian small business? Who will be eligible for thisÂ· relief?,75
79,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Before this government was elected, it said that it would introduce a family tax package. We did. Before this government was elected, we said we would reduce the provisional tax uplift factor. We did. We said that we would reduce the fringe benefits tax compliance burden. And we did. We said that we would give small business capital gains tax rollover relief. And we did. We delivered on all of those tax commitments that we had put to the Australian people before the last election. In relation to capital gains tax rollover relief, we said that where a small business sold an asset to buy another or sold a business to buy another. the capital gain should allow it to be rolled over capital gains tax free. The Labor Party had never thought about small business in this way before. Not only did we deliver-we delivered in full, on time. What is more, it is not just rollover relief for small business, it is not just allowing you to rollover in relation to an asset or a business while you are in the business of business; we also wanted to allow small business people to rollover into their retirement. For many small business people all of their savings go into their business. They ought to have the opportunity when they retire to come out and have that capital gains tax free - quite often We moved an amendment to allow a $500,000 waiver of capital gain in relation to small business rolling over in retirement. Who do you think tried to stop that coming into effect? The Australian Labor Party, led by it- Senator Nick Sherry in the Senate. Get a load of this: he thought it was too generous to allow small business people to rollover into retirement! He probably thinks, 'Why don't small business people go home and stay with If you mum and claim money to do so?' The Australian Labor Party tried to put a test in relation to that which would include personal assets over $5,000 to disqualify small business people from getting that relief. For 13 years the Australian Labor Party sat in office and what did they do for the small business community of Australia? Nothing! You get a government which is elected on a platform, which comes into introduce its tax plans on time and in full, and what does the Australian Labor Party do? It tries to stop it, led by Senator Sherry. You will - ecall also the Leader of the Opposition said in this place that the Labor Party would support the government in reducing concessionality for high income earners in relation to superannuation. But he was overruled in the Senate, wasn'the. He was overruled by? Senator Sherry. Senator Sherry overruled you once; it is time you overruled him. Tell him: when Labor people rort, Labor people go, and if you cannot do it, get somebody in that office who can. NA",75
80,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Before calling the next question, I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of the parliamentary delegation from the United Kingdom. On behalf of the House I extend a very warm welcome to our guests. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Minister for Veterans' Affairs: Travelling Allowance",75
81,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Minister, I refer to your statement yesterday, and I quote: a charter will return to its base when I have been dropped off at a point . . . That is the dead leg. Minister, on the weekend of 19 and 20 October, at a cost of $1,690, you chartered a round trip originating in Brisbane, overnighting at Orungal, then back to Brisbane, where you have said you took a commercial flight to Canberra. Why did that charter then return to Dalby at Commonwealth expense? Given you were not on the flight, Minister, can you guarantee that this was a genuine dead leg and that no-one else was taken back to Dalby? .",75
82,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This is just another one of those baseless allegations to try to smear me. I will not be diverted by your smears and your innuendo from doing my job. Mr Crean-Are you going to answer it? You said you'd answer it.,76
83,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Hotham!,76
84,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me read to the House the entitlement that I have. As a minister I have an entitlement to use a charter aircraft in connection with ministerial duties in circumstances where scheduled services are not available or where the use of scheduled services would not enable the minister to keep an official commitment. In addition, members representing electorates of more than 10,000 square kilometres are entitled to use charter transport within and for service of their electorate. The member for Hotham asked me about the charter. I cannot recall exactly the fine detail of that charter. Whether it returned to Dalby, I am not quite sure. Maybe the charter originated in Dalby. I do not know. That may have been the charter operator's home base. I could find out for you. But if you have got an allegation, make the allegation and come up with it! Age Pension: Family Farms",76
85,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Is the minister aware that many farm businesses, which at the best of times can support only one family, are having to support two because the current asset test arrangements applying to the age pension discourage older farmers from gifting ownership of the family farm to the younger generation? Would the minister please outline to the House the changes to the gifting provisions relating to the transfer of ownership of the family farm, as announced recently by the Prime Minister and the minister in the AgricultureAdvancing Australia package?",76
86,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I know it is of great importance to him and to many other members. The gifting arrangements are a new policy and they are part of AgricultureAdvancing Australia. It sees the government delivering on a long standing commitment to address a very real need: the welfare need of aged farmers and the very difficult circumstances which have confronted Australian farmers over the last decade or so. The fact is that there are thousands of older farmers living on farms with the next generation, and sometimes the generation after that-their sons and daughters, and sometimes their grandchildren-where that farm can no longer provide what ordinary Australians would regard as a decent standard of living for more than one family. And certainly not for two or three, as is sometimes the case. Many of those farms once would have been able to, but relentlessly declining terms of trade have overcome many farm families, despite the sector's legendary reputation for improving productivity and doing the job more effectively. Many of these people find that they are just unable to live decently, yet they cannot access the age pension because of the way in which the asset tests impacts on them. Our policy will enable farmers in this situation to transfer ownership of the family farm to a younger generation who are actively involved in running the business and then to receive the age pension immediately instead of, as currently applies, five years down the road. This will benefit not just those older farmers but also the younger generation taking over. They will be able to pick up the reins, relieved of a substantial financial pressure. They will be in a better position, so will those farms and so will the national economy. This is a carefully targeted package which is not available to wealthy farmers but which will be of real value to those many, many hard-pressed farmers out there in real need. I would be particularly interested to know just what conclusions about this gifting provision my opposite number, the shadow minister for primary industries, has now reached. His reaction to this package, which was so widely welcomed by the farm leaders in this country, was that it was a cruel hoax and constituted a few things which were a pale imitation of what they had in place. It would be interesting to know what his attitude is now. I think it is time we started to gain a bit an impression for the benefit of rural Australians as to where he is up to in his policy formation. It is 19 months since they lost their position. I think Australia's farmers would like to know a bit about it. We know a couple of things. He has been out there saying that the Leader of the Opposition has given them a blank page on which to start setting out a rural policy. In fact, he recently said, 'Kim Beazley has given me a total blank sheet.' It is probably very much like the one they took to the last election. It was a blank sheet. There was nothing on it. They did not have a primary industry policy. He quoted the Leader of the Opposition as having said, 'Rural and regional Australia is at the heart of Labor's comeback.' He said that he sees it as a 'huge charter and a challenge to rebuild credibility', whatever that means. We have a blank page here. This is their policy. I wonder, Mr Speaker, could we table the Labor Party's rural policy? Could I have your permission to table it? Filling in the gaps would be a very worthwhile exercise on the part of my opposite number over there because we need to know what it is about. All we know at the moment is that, from his reaction to this package, which has been so widely welcomed in rural Australia, the blank page will not have on it gifting, farm management deposits, farm family restart, Farmbis or anything else that is in the AAA package, the AgricultureAdvancing Australia package, because he says that it is just a cruel hoax. Nursing Home Fees",76
87,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Will the Minister for Family Services advise a retired constituent of mine whose elderly, seriously ill husband resides in a nursing home what she should do to offset the effect of the increases in daily fees on their joint disposable income which may affect her capacity to maintain the family home? Is this the type of complaint that Senator Campbell was referring to on the 7.30 Report last evening?",77
88,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I cannot comment in detail on the honourable member's question. I would be happy to take the detail of that and come back to him with an answer. What of I do want to say is that the aged care reform policy this government has put into place, which is implemented today and which means this government will start rebuilding the nursing home sector in this country today, is designed to protect financially disadvantaged people in the community. The bill also has within it a hardship provision. The 'key plank of this policy is that no person in this country who cannot afford to pay bonds or who cannot afford to pay fees will be asked to do so. People who are financially disadvantaged or who cannot afford to pay will be protected by this legislation. Small Business",77
89,Mr RICHARD EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Minister, what reaction has there been to the government's small business policy announced yesterday? What will this additional protection mean for small businesses? Will it lead to more costly court cases as some have claimed? What is the government's actual objective with this new initiative? Mr Kelvin Thomson- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: House of Representatives Practice, third edition, at page 517 says: . . . questions without notice which are substantially the same as questions already on the Notice Paper are not permissible. I draw your attention to question No. 2321 to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business seeking his response to community andbusiness sector reaction to the government's announcement yesterday of its response to the fair trading inquiry.",77
90,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is in order. There are differences.,77
91,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If I were in the opposition I would be pretty worried to hear about the endorsements that we got for the small business statement. They are some of the strongest statements in support of a government policy initiative that I have seen in a decade or more. In fact, if you look at the Service Station Association press release, their heading reads 'Federal government's ""new deal"" a winner for small business'. They described it as the 'most comprehensive small business package in history' . Marcus Kollington said: Â· . . thousands of service stations would be saved from closure and their employees saved from unemployment. The MTAA said: The Federal Government has acted in a decisive manner which shows genuine leadership. They said: These are the most exciting decisions made on behalf of small business for many decades. I like this one; this is true and an important statement-Michael Delaney, well known to all in this House, a person of long standing political experience, said: The Coalition Government has returned to its and remembered the ""forgotten people"" of small business. Absolutely right. The heading of the Australian Small Business Association was 'The policy passes small business test with flying colours'. The heading of the Australian Retailers Association was 'Retailers welcome government proposals'. Bob Gardini is a name associated with the franchising business. He is the one who gave you a report telling you what to do. You failed to do it. When he read our package, this was his heading: 'Historic day for small business'-a very authoritative one. The Australian Petroleum Agents and Distributors Association said it: Â· .. welcomes the ""New Deal:Fair Deal"" package Â· .. and congratulates the Government in producing a well balanced and focused initiative. The package deals with the problems that APADA and other small business participants have identified for many years. It went on to say: Â· . . the . . . reforms can be expected to change dramatically the operating environment for small business, and for the better. It is a long list but it is worth hearing. This government has been very interested in, and worked hard with, the Pharmacy Gui-d. This is what they said: . Â· .. the Government's willingness to keep faith with the small business community by deciding to undertake a range of forthright and excellent public policy measures to address the disadvantage small business proprietors have faced for decades, is a credit to the Prime Minister . . . . And quite right they were to say that. Theythat is, small business employers-look at the consequences of the policy and say: This can only lead to better work relations, the growth of the small.business sector and an increase in employment for young Australians. That is good news really for everybody. Part of the reaction we have had is that small business now has the confidence to go out and give people jobs, to grow their business and to really get this country going. Mr Tanner-What did VECCI say?",78
92,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"ACCI, the federal bodyMr Tanner-No, VECCI.",78
93,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not mind talking about roots VECCI. ACCI's heading was 'Strong response to fair trading report'. Trevor Griffin is the well-respected Attorney-General in South Australia. I was very interested to hear his remarks on our proposal to change the Trade Practices Act, because there will be a bit of commentary from certain interests on that. Trevor has a very well-deserved reputation and he said this about the unconscionable conduct measure: Â· . . the Federal Government's decision will be met with wide ranging support from small business and is something in relation to which I can indicate my personal sympathy. That is high praise from a very experienced Attorney-General at the state level. Even Senator Andrew Murray from the Democrats says that 'this package is welcome in many' respects and shows what can be done' . Yes, VECCI had their concerns, but they also said: Â· .. VECCI endorses most of Peter Reith's action plan to protect small business . . . I am pleased they say that, because they represent a lot of small businesses. I would like and encourage them to look very closely at the trade practices change because we think it is a fair deal and it is very good for the vast majority of people who are the constituents of that organisation. From the office of the Minister for Small Business in Victoria, Louise Asher said that she strongly supported a special meeting of territory and state ministers- That was on retail tenancy, which is another very important part of the package. Wherever you look, there have been very positive responses to the government's package. I just want to conclude by correcting an answer that I gave yesterday. I am afraid I do appear to have slightly misled the House. I said that Labor had in their last set of initiatives-in fact, their 17 last initiatives-in one way or another proposed a review, a committee or whatever. Actually, I was not quite right because when they were talking about retail tenancies yesterday I thought I had better get out their latest statement on these very issues. This one is a sort of Labor policy statement on small business. I said there were 17 reviews. This has been issued whilst Labor has been in opposition, so this is their latest policy---,-but one, which I will come back to. The headline under the name of the Leader of the Opposition is that the Labor Party today announced it would conduct a complete review of its small business policy. Nursing Home Fees",78
94,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Family Services. Has the minister seen reports that from today nursing homes intend charging up to $98,000 in entry fees? Is the minister aware that for most elderly people the only way they can pay such large sums is to sell their homes? Why should thousands of elderly Australians have to pay nearly $100,000 to get a nursing home bed?",79
95,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government is extending Labor's hostel policy introduced in 1988, 10 years ago almost, whereby the amount providers can charge is not prescribed. It was not prescribed under their policy. This is an issue for agreement between the resident and the aged care facility. It has never been prescribed by government. It will not be by this government; it was not by their government. Ms Macklin-Ninety-eight thousand dollars.",79
96,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Jagajaga has asked her question.,79
97,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There are many people, contrary to the shadow minister's allegations, in hostels today who have dementia, who are very frail. They are in hostels. They are paying bonds. They have been paying bonds for the last 10 years. They have not been able to look after their own affairs. They have had to have their families, their legal advisers or the guardianship boards in each of the states and territories, look after their interests. The policy has worked well in hostels. Nothing will change in that respect when it is transferred to nursing homes as well. The government will, however, be monitoring the new arrangements, and we will act firmly if there is any sign of providers abusing this system. What we have done is establish a complaints hotline in every state and territory in this country, something Labor never did in their hostel policy. In addition to that, we have established a complaints committee in every state and territory in this country. That is why I am amazed at the hypocrisy of the shadow minister for aged care. She feigns despair, when she was part of the government which introduced the same policy for hostels. Furthermore, let me remind the House that it was Labor which allowed hostels to charge any level of additional daily fee they wanted to. They could take everything from the resident over and above the pension and the little bit of money a pensioner could earn before their pension was affected. If they earned $20, under their policy the hostels could take $10 of that money. That was the kind of policy that that mob over there introduced when they were in government. We have put a stop to that. Basically, Labor failed. They failed the aged sector in this country. They failed the frail elderly in this country. Labor left the state of many nursing homes in total decay, and we are cleaning up their mess. Retail Tenancies",79
98,Mr REID,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. In the very positive reaction from the small business community, their industry associations and the media to the government's fair trading reform package, it has been implied in some predictable quarters that we are not addressing business conduct issues in the retail tenancy area. Can you please inform the House what actions the government is taking to assist small retailers experiencing retail tenancy problems?",79
99,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member again for his work and also for his question. I must say that I was rather surprised that the opposition made some comments about what they claim to be the inadequacy of our package when it comes to retail tenancy issues, but I would have to say that I have been in their situation before. If the government does something really good, the pressure is on you to find something in it that you do not like so you can at least be an opposition for the sake of being an opposition. But I tell you what: you picked the wrong issue. It is quite remarkable that opposition members should have said what they said yesterday-namely, that the package was inadequate in respect of retail tenancies-because this is not a new issue. This issue has been around awhile. In fact, it was on your plate when you were in government. I think it is timely that we remind you of the things that you said when you were in government. In fact we might even remind you of what you have been saying in opposition. Before I do that, let me say that we have taken very strong action when it comes to the question of retail tenancies. We have done that which Labor was never prepared to dothat is, exercise some national leadership on this issue. We have been prepared to get the parties together, set some benchmarks and set up a process to get the state and territory ministers together. We had another classic yesterday. In the shadow minister's response to my ministerial statement. on legislation to amend the Trade Practices Act, he said, 'I want to wait and see. the legislation to see whether or not they are tinkering around the edges.' Three and a half hours later, we brought in the legislation. There was egg on your face again. This issue has been around before. When Labor responded to this issue of retail tenancy matters, the then small business minister, Mr Beddall, s a i d : , Given that this issue covers state and 'territory responsibilities, the government proposes to have this matter referred by the Minister for Small Business and Customs to the proposed Commonwealth-State ministerial meeting. Mr Beddall-We did.",80
100,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is right. Now you are arguing for more, and I will give you some more.",80
101,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,80
102,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I like the interjections, thank you very much. Ask me about travel allowances. Here is another quote: The former Small Business Minister, Senator Schacht, said in April this year, ""Under the constitution, retail tenancies themselves are a matter for the state, so there is a matter of getting good legislation at the state level."" That is in more recent times. But only two weeks ago, the Leader of the Opposition was saying that we needed to get the states onside on the retailing issue. This is what he said: Of course, all the states have got to be gotten in the basket for decent, decent treatment. I know your problems go way beyond that and many of them are with local government. There's not a great deal we can do about that at the federal level, but we ought to do what we can. We are doing what we can, and I tell you what: it is a lot more than you ever proposed to do when you were in government. So do not give us this cant and hypocrisy that the package does not go far enough. This package has left you absolutely for dead, left you in our wake, left you irrelevant, as you have been on this issue for many years. Just to add final insult to your policy position, after you had your review when you went into opposition, you turned up with a statement of so-called policy principles. It is a one-pager and it has seven principles. Yesterday, you said that retail tenancy was the No. 1 issue that we had failed to properly address. Here is your piece of paper. Tell me where on this you have any proposal in respect of retail tenancies. I can tell you the answer: absolutely nowhere. There it is. Mr Martin- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Given that the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business is collecting pieces of paper in respect of his bill that was introduct:!- yesterday and inviting us to comment about the devil in the detail, I seek leave to table a press release that points out there is devil in the detail, in that it does not do what he claims it does. Leave not granted. Small Business: Tax Minimisation",80
103,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister and it also concerns a matter affecting small business. Will the Prime Minister explain why he has apparently now ruled out absolutely accepting any proposal from the tax office to stop small business minimising or avoiding tax through the use of trusts? Can he explain to this House why some small businesses should be allowed to minimise or avoid tax entirely because they operate through trusts, while the bulk of the small business community operates through companies and pays corporate tax? Prime Minister, why shouldn't there be a level tax playing field for all small and medium size businesses, regardless of the legal vehicles they use to operate a business?",81
104,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is quite apparent that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition 1s not only deprived of relevance but also deprived of advice and deprived of attendance at this House because, after question time yesterday, I made it perfectly clear that some of the press reports which had appeared in relation to this matter, particularly those so vigorously taken up by the Australian Financial Review, were quite wrong. What I made clear was that we were not going to make changes to taxation and we were not going to make changes to the general body of law that would significantly disadvantage the small business community. In fact, in a remark which I made in the party room, which was incorrectly reported in the newspapers, I said that we were not going to take any action to bankrupt small business. Obviously, the abuse of trusts, the use of trusts under the taxation system, is something that ought to attract the attention of any responsible government. I want to make it clear to the parliament and to the Australian community that, in addressing the issue of taxation reform, we intend to match the test of fairness to all of the Australian people. In addressing the issue of taxation reform, we will build a taxation system for the 21st century that will generate jobs, promote exports and attract investment. It is very interesting that I should be asked a question about taxation by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, because it is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition who really wants a GST. He was dropped upon from a great height by the Leader of the Opposition within a couple of hours of making that statement. The longer this debate goes on about taxation, just as you were made irrelevant and left in our wake on small business reform, so you will be made irrelevant and left in our wake on the issue of taxation reform. Your response to the challenge of taxation reform is to say that all you have to do is fiddle at the edges and that basically the system is okay. You had 13 years to fix Australia's taxation system; you made it worse. Now, 18 months into opposition, what is your response to the challenge of taxation reform, which is the greatest single area of economic reform that is needed in Australia to take us into the 21st century? Your response is to say that no reform at all is needed. Let me simply say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the taxation reform proposals that we will bring out will give to the Australian community, to the business community and to the ordinary taxpayers of Australia a modem, fair, incentive-driven system that will promote jobs, will attract investment and will free the exporters of Australia from the crippling burden of an old fashioned, ramshackle, out-of-date wholesale sales tax system.",81
105,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. I do ask the Prime Minister: will he clarify, because he didn't in his statement yesterday, whether it is the case that he proposes to exempt small business from any change to the taxation law which would treat trusts in the same way as companies for taxation purposes?",81
106,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,82
107,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is in order.,82
108,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am perfectly happy to repeat everything I have just said to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I am perfectly happy to do that. I know you are a mile behind on taxation reform, you are a mile behind on small business reform and, after the tipple of Sherry that you have had at question time today, you are a mile behind on travel rorts too. Indonesia: Forest Fires",82
109,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Trade and Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs. What assistance has Australia offered the Indonesian government to help tackle the increasing environmental and human toll as a result of smog enveloping a large part of South-East Asia from forest fires on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Borneo? Will Australia be offering longer term support and expertise in emergency and technical assistance, given Australia's long history of bushfires?",82
110,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Fisher for his question on this important issue involving the horrific firestorm in Indonesia and the smog which has settled over a great deal of South-East Asia. I am now pleased to announce that the federal government is doubling its assistance to the Indonesian people and Indonesian government with regard to this circumstance. An additional $1 million for the provision of a package of aerial water bombing services to Indonesia has been approved following consultations involving Minister Downer, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in New York; the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Andrew Thomson; AusAID; and other organisations involved in this matter. Following consultations with the Indonesians, and that was most necessary to make this a worthwhile response, it has been agreed that, due to limited water availability and poor visibility for flying",82
111,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,New South Wales has offered assistance for weeks.,82
112,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You might' joke about this but this involves human lives, Australian and Indonesian. Whilst, I will concede you at least know where Opossum Point and Opossum Bay are, you might otherwise remain silent on this issue. The federal government has been moving, in consultation with the Indonesians, as quickly as we can in relation to these matters. I want to make it clear the aircraft will not be deployed against the large fires burning in Kalimantan and Sumatra but will be used for a specific role requested by the Indonesians. It has been agreed that our water-bombing aircraft can be more effectively using containing newly emerged spot fires in eastern Indonesia. I am pleased to say that the South Australian Country Fire Service will be providing this function as the contracting body and moving through that body so there is a clear-cut change of command to utilise aircraft, which will also involve maritime and other units. There are quite strong safety and related concerns in relation to this smog problem. It has only been after a careful examinationbut a quick examination-of the requests that the Australian government has agreed to this. It does reflect the very positive bilateral relationship that Australia has with Indonesia and our desire to provide what we can, realistically and reasonably, to help tum the tide in the extraordinary situation which has settled over too much of South-East Asia. Small Business: Tax Minimisation",82
113,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Did the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Carmody, clear with you or your office before it was delivered his speech of 10 September which advocated taxing trusts for everyone in the same manner as companies? Did you or your office approve that speech in the knowledge that it contained that section relating to the taxation of trusts?",82
114,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He could well have, and, if he did, I would have said to him he is quite entitled to make that speech. He is quite entitled to put forward views in relation to tax, and I have put forward similar views myself. The Prime Minister just stood here and said quite clearly that he is prepared to look at the issue of taxation of trusts. We have m:ade it clear, in response to the matters that wer- raised by the member for Gellibrand before the election in relation to high wealth individuals, that we will be publishing a position paper in relation to trusts looking at the treatment and the taxation of trusts. That will be coming out shortly, and we will be putting that out for public discussion. Mr Gareth Evans-Have you said anything about a small business plan?",82
115,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Come on; don't interject. The old Clarence Darrow is over there asking these penetrating questions at the end of question time when they have given up asking about travel rorts. It is pretty noticeable, isn't it? There have been no questions about travel rorts today. I wonder why that is? It is because all roads lead to Opossum Bay, to Senator Sherry down there at Opossum Bay claiming that the taxpayers should pay him $300 a night to stay with mum. That is what is happening. We have the Leader of the Opposition here, and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition",83
116,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I take a point of order, Mr Speaker. Might I draw your attention to the question of relevance and the relationship to the taxation of trusts. I suggest that the bow is getting a little long.",83
117,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The Treasurer is canvassing a very wide tapestry.,83
118,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have here the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition who were in control of the travel allowances of Senator Mal Colston in 1983. They overruled legal opinion and said he needed to be counselled. They set him on a 10-year career. The Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition-and I have said this before-the 1983 Mal Colston defence team, cannot ask a question because they know they are deeply implicated in all of this. I tell you, there is one question before. this parliament today: does the Leader of the Opposition have the ability to sack Senator Sherry? That is the great question that is before this parliament today. If you do not have the strength to do that, old son, you do not have the strength to do anything.",83
119,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have a supplementary question, Mr Speaker. The supplementary question to the Treasurer goes back to the question he did not complete answering: what are his views on the exemption of small business from any new taxation regime treating trusts in the same way as companies?",83
120,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is out of order. Child Support,83
121,Mrs GASH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security. After years of neglect and no action on the sensitive subject of child support, many non-custodial parents in my electorate of Gilmore are relieved to hear that this government has had the guts to make some very necessary changes that will make life more bearable for both parents and their children. Could the minister advise those parents in Gilmore, and throughout Australia, just who will benefit from these much needed reforms?",83
122,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question. This is a matter of very considerable interest on this side of the House. Yesterday the government announced some important reforms to the child support scheme to take effect in 199899. The package represents a balanced approach, and it focuses on the interests of children and the balance of responsibility between both parents and fairness to taxpayers generally. The fact is that there are 155,000 payees who will benefit from the introduction of a minimum child support payment of $260 a year. This initiative will reinforce the message that parents have primary responsibility for the financial support of their children. Three hundred thousand payers will pay less child support as a result of an increase in the exempt income amount, and 96,000 payees will have some of this reduction offset through increased family payments. The additional relief. will be provided to blended families through allowing child support payments to be taken into account for family payment purposes. Furthermore, the amount of income the payee will be allowed to earn before it affects child support will be significantly reduced. The non-agency payments in arrears received with the first regular payment of child support will be treated in the same way as other child support under the maintenance income test. Other reforms include allowing parents to use the most recent taxable income assessment for the calculation of child support and broadening the income base to ensure that payers are not avoiding their responsibilities through minimisation. Further administrative reforms will be introduced to the Child Support Agency to build on the significant reforms that have already been made. We recognise that these measures are a second important step in the process of child support reform, and that continued consultation is required. I can assure the honourable member and members such as her who are interested in this matter that we will be seeking to inform at the next stage. I am sure honourable members will be very pleased to note that, after 13 years of inactivity by the former government, this is a government prepared to address these sensitive issues. Civil Aviation Safety Authority: Dismissal of Chief Executive",83
123,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Do you endorse the dismissal of Civil Aviation Safety Authority Chief Executive LeRoy Keith by the four new CASA board members who have all signed secret resignation deals with the former minister for transport?,84
124,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, it is my understanding that it is a matter for the board under an act of parliament which, in relation to the powers of the board, has not been materially, if at all, altered from the act put place by the government of the party of which you are currently a member. It enables me to contrast the magnificent reforms that have been achieved by my government in the area of transport, and particularly in the area of aviation. For the first time we have brought a bit of fairness and justice to the noiseafflicted people of the city of Sydney, instead of dumping all of that noise that Laurie Brereton did over all those Labor voters in the inner suburbs of Sydney. One of the interesting things about our reforms for Sydney airport is that the greatest beneficiaries have been people living in safe Labor seats. It is the people of Petersham, Leichhardt, Newtown and Stanmore who have really benefited. I think a few chardonnay socialists live in those suburbs now and a regular columnist of newspapers like the Sydney Morning Herald. It does not alter the fact that we have delivered a fair deal to the residents of Sydney and that is but one of the many transport reforms that has been carried out by my government. It is my understanding that it is a matter for the board and, gee, that was a wasted question, wasn't it? Members of Parliament: Accountability",84
125,Mr ANDREW,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question without notice is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister detail to the House the steps that have been put in place to improve the accountability of members of parliament? Are there any further steps that should be undertaken?,84
126,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I could start answering that question by saying that the text for today is: why doesn't Kim Beazley have the guts to sack Nick Sherry? That is the text for today, Mr Speaker. If you think that I am endeavouring to impose",84
127,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,84
128,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This bloke opposite is very, very sensitive. The member for Hotham really did you a great service when he started this little exercise. For the Leader of the Opposition and those who sit opposite-who by the volume of their interjection merely proclaim their sensitivity on this issue-let me remind them that the standard that I have in just asked of the Leader of the Opposition is not only a standard that I endorse but interestingly enough it is also a standard that has come out of the mouth of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. This is what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition so helpfully and so lovingly had to say at a doorstop this morning as he arrived at Parliament House, and I ask everybody to listen to it: There is no doubt that we were quite likely to suffer a little bit of collateral damage with all the flak flying aroundyou are not wrong, Gareth, and it gets even betterand as Kim Beazley made absolutely clear from outset, to the extent that any of our people, whether politiciansÂ· or staffers were involved in doing anything wrong, they would have to bear the quences. What we have demonstrated is that this bloke who, by any measure of the men and women in the streets of Australia and the clubs and pubs of Australia, has absolutely and shamelessly rorted the system. To suggest that Opossum Bay, with its gentle streams wandering sheep apparently meandering down the main street of Hobart, is really part of city of Hobart is like suggesting that Katoommember ba and Blackheath are part of the city of Sydney. The reality is that you have been caught out on this. You have demonstrated deplorable double standards. You have sought to impugn the decency of members who sit opposite. contrast with your gutless low standard, we have been prepared to enforce standards. have been prepared to endure the difficulties personally and otherwise in relation to the action that I took last week. I took that action because I knew it was necessary to uphold and proclaim greater standards. At the first test of leadership on the issue of standards, the Leader of the Opposition has fallen over. No, worse than that; he has not even got into the starting blocks on the question. He shows no guts. He is without principle on this issue. He has demonstrated double standards and on that note, Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Minister for Veterans' Affairs: Travelling Allowance",84
129,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"On the day of 19 October I commenced a charter Brisbane after a media commitment and a veterans' engagement in Brisbane. The flight later. went on to Dalby for an official commitment. I was then joined by my staff member to fly to Stanthorpe, where I had a meeting with fruit growers and a function at a retirement home. The charter then continued on to Orungal because I had a speaking engagement in the Texas that night. Early the following morning, at approximately 7.30 a.m., the charter flight departed for Brisbane with me and a member conseof my staff on board. I disembarked in Brisbane to catch a flight to Canberra in order to is a keep afternoon commitments. A member of my staff continued on the flight to Dalby, which was in any case heading back to its base at Orungal, near Texas. It was a dead leg anyway. The stop at Dalby was offered by the and pilot at no extra cost to the Commonwealth. This in fact saved the Commonwealth the cost the of a self-drive hire car to return the staff to Dalby from Brisbane. Allowing for relocation expenses, this cost would have been in the order of $200. In addition, Mr Speaker, let me put to bed one of the other baseless allegations raised by the member for Hotham yesterday. Yesterday By he claimed that my travel allowance claim records revealed a negative capital city claim I record for the second six months of 1996-97. What has emerged since is that the travel claims referred to by the member for Hotham only included claims for the travel up to and including 6 May 1997. This was clearly stated in the DAS report from which the member for Hotham no doubt derived his statistics. So the figure was for 4Y2 months, not six months, in the second half of the financial year. Secondly, DAS has since advised me that the figure of 37 nights quoted by the member for Hotham in support of his baseless allegation was incorrect. It was actually 38 nights. Once again, your allegations are baseless and have vanished into the morning mist. As for the member for Corio, I heard your interjections, during some of my answers, talking about visiting my daughter in Brisbane. You are a grub. Say it out of the House! Mr O'Connor- Mr Speaker, I claim to flight in have been misrepresented.",85
130,Mr SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,I will address the matter Native Title: Australian Law Reform Commission,85
131,Mr WILLIAMS,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,In my answer to the question from the member for Banks I omitted to deal with that part of the question that related to contact between me and the Prime Minister. It is understandable when you hear what I have to say. The only contact between the Prime Minister and me that I am aware of at all in relation to the issue occurred on Monday when I drew to his attention a Sydney Morning Herald article. The only contact between my office and his office prior to this week in relation to the issue was referred to by the Prime Minister in an answer on Tuesday.,85
132,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,What about an apology from Simon Crean? Mr Crean-Here he is!,86
133,Mr SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,The member for Hotham is extending my patience in displaying that material. You know the forms of the House. You are under warning. You must reflect on what happened last week. Minister for Veterans' Affairs: Travelling Allowance,86
134,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Mr Speaker, I do apologise to the member for Corio. I was referring to the member for Prospect-and she knows it. NA Child Support Scheme: Committee Report  aware that the report of an examination of the operation and effectiveness of the child support scheme was tabled in November 1994 and some changes were announced in question time. In the absence of a full response the recommendations of the committee and, in view of the public interest in the matter, would you be prepared to write to the relevant ministers requesting that a full response be now made to the report's recommendations?",86
135,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I thank the honourable member for Chifley for his question. I will inquire into the matter and advise you further privately. NA,86
136,Mr GARETH EVANS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, I seek leave to make a personal explanation.",86
137,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepr(,(sented?",86
138,Mr GARETH EVANS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I do, MrSpeaker. At the end of question time, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) quoted partially from the transcript of my doorstop this morning and drew from that the implication that I was saying that Senator Sherry was wrong. I draw the attention of the House to the next question which I answered, which was specifically on the subject of Senator Sherry, when I said: Not a single one of the allegations that I have seen against Senator Sherry in the public domain have suggested that his individual claims were other than entirely justified, that he was where he said he was and that he was acting within the rules. And until someone comes up with some evidence to the contrary on that, I think that's the last we should be hearing of Senator Sherry.",86
139,Mrs CROSIO,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, I seek leave to make a personal explanation.",86
140,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,86
141,Mrs CROSIO,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I do, Mr Speaker, most grievously. This morning, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Ronaldson), in summing up the Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill 1997, said about me that I, the member for Prospect, was 'the same person who has always supported the fast tracking of Badgerys Creek.' I believe that if he checks his facts he will see that I have objected to Badgerys Creek from February of 1986. I always have and will continue to to object. I have always been consistent. That is certainly not his run-up for a ministerial position in this Howard failed government. NA Jetset Users Forum",86
142,Mr LEO MCLEAY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Watson) (3.37 p.m.)Mr Speaker, last week you wrote to members-and Madam President wrote to senators-asking for the various parties to appoint people to Ii Jetset Users Forum, the first meeting of which is scheduled for tomorrow. My office was advised last week by the staff of the former Minister for Administrative Services(Mr Jull) that they would be participating in that forum. I noticed from the list of peopleÂ·Â·who are on the agenda to attend the forum tomorrow that there is no representative of the Minister for Administrative Services. As that minister's office and department have a very significant interface between the Jetset Users Forum and Jetset itself, it would seem that the circle would not be complete unless they were represented. On behalf of the House, would you write to the minister and ask either him or a senior representative of office and department to be present at that meeting and continue to be present at those meetings when they are held in the future?",86
143,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for Watson for his question. I have spoken informally this day to the minister acting as the Minister for Administrative Services. I understand that he will be attending the meeting tomorrow and will be making some remarks. I am not quite sure if he is going to be assisted by other staff, but arrangements are in hand for proper representation. Mr Ruddock-I'll make arrangements, Mr Speaker. Parliamentary Language",87
144,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Yesterday the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked a number of questions concerning use in the House of certain expressions to describe members and their actions. House of Representatives Practice on page 475 repeats the quotation from May indicating that 'good temper and moderation are characteristics of parliamentary language' - something that has been a little lacking sometimes over the last couple of days. The quotation goes on to say that 'parliamentary language is never more desirable than when canvassing the opinions and conduct of opponents in debate.' I commend those sentiments to all members. Relevance of Answers,87
145,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"On 29 September the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) asked me a question relating to the relevance of answers to questions without notice, referring to my statement of 26 May and earlier responses I had made to certain points of order taken during answers to questions. On 4 September 1997 I referred to my statement of 26 May in which I said that I intended to adopt a common sense approach to the application of relevance. I also indicated that if a question was lengthy and ranged over several matters it was open to a wider range of relevance in the answer. The fact that a lengthy question concluded with a specific limited question did not restrict an answer to only the specific concluding words; reference to matters raised his earlier in the question was also relevant. On 29 September, points of relevance were raised, for example, in a question, which takes up 24 lines of Hansard. The answer to the shortest question of that day, taking less than three lines, gave rise to no points of order. The matter is within my direct discretion, and I intend to continue to adopt what I see as a common sense approach to answering questions. Travelling Allowance",87
146,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"On 29 September, I was also asked a question by the honourable member for Cunningham concerning how certain travelling allowance information found its way into the public domain. I advise the House that I have made a formal inquiry to KPMG. KPMG has provided detailed advice on the stringent procedures which it has followed in protecting information about the project and private details of members. KPMG has given an assurance that it was not the source of the information referred to by the honourable member for Cunningham. I also advise the House that the Department of the House of Representatives is maintaining utmost confidentiality in this internal audit process, and no detailed information has been provided to the media. News Clipping Service",87
147,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I know news clipping services are of particular interest to the member for Chifley. On 25 September, he asked me again about the institution of a wider news clipping service for members of the House. A limited newspaper clipping service operates within the House, with an orientation towards the occupants of the chair. I have instructed that an additional six copies of this be made. Three will be placed in the government lobby for reference by government members and three will be placed in the opposition lobby for reference by non-government members. Investigations will continue into the provision of a wider service, and I understand that a number of members have privately commissioned an individual clipping service. Of course, this action is available to any member, including the member for Chifley. NA Travelling Allowance",87
148,Mr SPEAKER,PAPERS,"For the information of honourable members. I present the following papers: Travelling allowance payments to members of the House of Representatives for May and June, together with summary details of expenditure 199697, and Travelling allowance payments to staff of the Department of the House of Representatives at the Senior Officer level and above, for the financial year 1996-97. I have tabled those today, as I had intimated privately that I would do so. I understand there has been a delay in the tabling of the appropriate information in the Senate, and that may be tabled within the next day or so.",88
149,Mr REITH,PAPERS,Papers are tabled as listed in the schedule circulated to honourable members. Details of the papers will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings and Hansard. The schedule read as followsAustralian Postal Corporation Act-Australian Postal Corporation (Australia Post)-Report for 1996-97.

Civil Aviation Act-Civil Aviation Authority Safety Authority-Corporate plan 1996-97 'to 199899. . Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. NA Nursing Homes,88
150,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The government's failure to protect thousands of Australians from having to pay nearly $100,000 to enter a nursing home from today. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",88
151,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Jagajaga) (3.34 p.m.)From today,older Australians and their families will know what this Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) and this government are doing to nursing home care in this country. Today it gets real for this minister. From today, nursing home care will no longer be available to all Australians on the basis of their health need. From today, older Australians too frail and too sick to care for themselves will no longer be automatically guaranteed a bed in a nursing home as the means of getting the care they need. From today, the traumatic process of arranging nursing home care for an older relative has just become more traumatic. It is now clear that, from today, older frail Australians will be paying up to $98,000 to get a nursing home bed. Most people can find that sort of money only in one place: their family home. They do not have it tucked away somewhere else. They do not have it in their back pocket. They have it in one place: their family home. Their family home will have to be sold from today. This Howard government slashed more than half a billion dollars from aged care in the 1996 budget, and that is at the heart of the problem. Half a billion dollars has been taken from the aged. care budget. In order to make up this deficiency and to find the capital necessary, the Howard government has come up with this appalling user-pays system of new fees for nursing homes. This Howard government and this minister have introduced this up-front fee, the so-called accommodation bond. In November, the extra daily fee will begin. The extra daily fee is, of course, just a tax by another name. It really rubs salt into the wounds of older people. The money goes straight to the government, and the residents get no benefit from that payment whatsoever. This minister has been steadfast in her refusal to acknowledge the facts about where the money will come from to pay thisÂ· $98,000 entry fee. As the facts mount from today, she is looking more and more like King Canute in her efforts to deny the obvious. The money for the entry fee will come from the sale of people's homes. Let us just briefly walk through the facts one more time. The majority of people in nursing homes are pensioners. Pensioners, Minister! More than 70 per cent of pensioners have only one asset: their family home. Yes, there are exemptions-I am sure the minister will talk about them-when a spouse lives in the home. But the facts are that 90 per cent of the people who need to go into a nursing home live alone before they go into that nursing hClme. They will have to sell their family homes. You might like to say that nobody will be forced. This is the biggest playing with words that I have ever seen. Of course it is not compulsory, Minister, but where does compulsion end and coercion begin? The nursing homes will coerce older people to sell their homes so that they pay the $98,000 in entry fees. The fact is they will have to sell their homes. Let us not forget which people we are talking about here. This is a generation of people, unlike my generation, which has lived through the Great Depression and the Second World War. They have scrimped and saved to pay their bills to give their children-people of your and my generationadvantages that they never had. One of the major objectives of that generation, one of the major objectives of their lives, was to pay off the family home. Minister, part of the cruelty of this legislation is that you do not seem to understand the psychological impact of what you are doing to this generation of Australians. You are trashing the values of a generation. The action is arrogant and contemptuous in its failure to understand the impact it will have on older Australians and their families. Let me share one example with you. It comes from a personal friend of mine. I will not use her name because she would not want me to. Her mother and father have just gone through a very difficult time. Her father has very severe dementia and was becoming very violent towards her mother. They had to find a nursing home bed for her father. They went to many nursing homes in the local area-I think five or six. None of the nursing homes wanted to take this man because he is violent and disruptive. But something had to be done to protect the mother. They could not find a nursing home bed. Eventually, this man had to be committed. This family is saying to me, 'Imagine having to deal with a nursing home saying, ""No, we're not taking him. He's too difficult a patient. By the way, you haven't got $98,000 either. '"" This is because the mother is still living in the home. ""'You haven't got the money. He's too difficult a patient.'"" That is the sort of attitude that will take place in our nursing home system as a result of the changes that start today. I have another example. A letter came into my office from a lady who is 64 years of age. She has looked after her father, who is 90 years old, for three years. He has dementia. As she says in her letter: Try caring for a dementia stricken person for 3 weeks and tell me you can do it forever. I am on anti depressants for the first time in my life. I no longer have a life. Why should it end at 64? I was a healthy, active, alive person-not any more. 'Don't tell me that I won't have to sell my home because I have only been looking after my father for three years, not for 5 years.' This woman is not protected by your legislation. She will have to sell her home to get her father into a nursing home because she can no longer look after him. That will be the real effect on families of this abominable piece of legislation that has been introduced. But of course the tragedy and the farce of this legislation do not end there. We will eventually go from a system of care that guaranteed a place to people on the basis of their health needs to one where different levels of care will emerge, depending on how much people can pay. What an abomination. What an un-Australian way of looking after people in their last years of life. It is inevibecome table that raising money through the entry fee system will produce a system that reflects where the money comes from. In other words, it will reflect the capacity of nursing homes to tap into the value of people's homes. Nursing homes in wealthy areas-as this article in the Daily Telegraph clearly showswhere there are high property values will be able to get the $98,000. The government has talked about getting $1.5 billion from this system through the sale of people's homes. What about the nursing homes in poorer areas, in country towns or the poorer parts of our cities where they can only pay a smaller amount? As is made quite clear in the article in the Daily Telegraph, it is about to start; it bonds. will start today. There are places in Sydney that will charge only $30,000. Those places will, of course, end up as second-rate nursing homes. Those that charge $98,000 will be very nice, thanks very much. We have seen from the newspapers today that nursing homes are already saying that poorer areas and lower fees will go together. We have evidence, Minister, that you are responsible. This minister will stand condemned for introducing a two-tiered system into our nursing home care: one system for the rich and another much lesser system for the poor. Of course it will take time for these controof versial changes to work through the system. We know what that means, Minister. Over the next 12 months or so this generation of people who pay their $98,000 to get into a nursing home will not get anything for it because, unfortunately, it is the case that people do not live for a very long time in nursing homes. They will pay these huge upfront fees and get no benefit whatsoever. The nursing homes will not be upgraded in their lifetimes. They will have sold their homes, sold the one thing that they own, and will get no benefit whatsoever in their lifetimes. The government keeps trying to talk up a crisis in nursing home care to justify its actions. Minister, there is not a crisis yet but, sure as heck, one is coming. The way this government is going about these changes there will soon be a crisis in our nursing home system, because the other thing that has very clear in the newspapers today is that about 15 per cent of homes have failed the certification test. This brings in the big catch-22 in this legislation: the test that means that if you need capital to upgrade you definitely will not be able to get it because you cannot charge an accommodation bond. While it is true that substandard homes should never be condoned, this government has shown the height of irresponsibility by being willing to wash its hands of the problems it will create. The minister was quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald today saying: It is unfortunate. Some of those homes will close because of being unable to charge accommodation This minister is completely irresponsible because she has not allocated anything like enough money to make sure these nursing homes have the capital they need to upgrade. I am sure she will say that the government has allocated funds. Let me tell the public: it is $10 million, which might build 2'h nursing homes. That is all. Where will the people go who have to leave the 300 nursing homes which are expected to fail the inspection? Where will the nursing home residents go? This minister just wants to wash her hands it. She is not going to provide the funding for the 300 nursing homes that will close as a result of her incompetent legislation. Minister, you cannot walk away from the ripple effect that this is going to have throughout the whole nursing home sector. Where will the residents from the nursing homes that are closed go? Will they stay in public hospitals? They will not be able to stay in public hospitals. The Australian Medical Association are gOIng to put paid to that idea. They will not stand for nursing home patients staying in public hospitals. They wanted your legislation deferred for 10 years. That is how concerned they are about what will happen to public ho-pitals. Governments are elected to govern, not to shrug their shoulders and look away and say that it is up to market forces. That is what this minister is doing: leaving it to market forces; leaving it to user pays. If you have $98,000 it will be just fine for you. You will be able to get into a nursing home, you will be fine, you will be looked after. If you have got $30,000, you might get into a second-rate nursing home. But, if you have nothing, you go to the back of the queue. That will be the result of this minister's new legislation. Not only will they get nothing, but if they do manage to get into a nursing home they will get second-rate care. That is an abomination to the Australian people and something that we should be totally ashamed of.",88
152,Mrs MOYLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I welcome this opportunity to proudly mark the commencement of the government's aged care reforms. Today is the day when this government begins to rebuild Australia's nursing homes: a day that never dawned for Labor in the nearly 5,000 days that it was in government. For 5,000 days, Labor sat and watched the state of Australian nursing homes decline and deteriorate. Labor has no credibility whatsoever on this issue. The untruths and distortions spread by the opposition and vested interests have done nothing but scare and humiliate old people, making them political footballs. This debate today is the last-ditch effort by the shadow minister for scares to throw a bit more mud, spread a few more untruths",91
153,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable minister will refer to the member for Jagajaga by her correct title. Mr Brough-The member for scares. Ms Macklin-On a point of order: I ask the member, who is in the wrong place, to withdraw that remark. Mr Brough-I withdraw.",91
154,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Thank you. I caution the honourable member for Longman to be in his place if he wants to open his mouth, and he will still be out of order.",91
155,Mrs MOYLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The untruths and distortions spread by the opposition and vested interests have done nothing but scare and humiliate old people, turning them into political footballs. This debate today is the shadow minister's last-ditch effort to throw a got bit more mud, to spread a few more untruths to disgracefully scare some more elderly and frail Australians. From the very first day of this debate, all the opposition has done is play a totally divisive and negative game. That has been the sum total of the opposition's contribution to this debate on aged care. Not once have we had any acceptance of the parlous state of affairs that nursing homes were left in as a result of the funding system so badly neglected under Labor. Not once have we had any evidence that the shadow minister has been anywhere near some of the older nursing homes, particularly in her state, where a good proportion of nursing homes are simply old houses converted for the purpose. Until today, not once had we had any acknowledgment by the shadow minister of the totally inadequate funding provided for people with dementia under the current system, and the desperate need, as she highlighted-thus highlighting Labor's failure-to develop more appropriate funding and care for dementia patients. Not once have we had any acknowledgment that they even care about the 40 per cent of residents that share wards with four or more people, the 11 per cent of facilities that do not meet fire standards or the 15 per cent that do not meet health standards. Does the shadow minister deny these figures and the disgraceful stories behind such statistics? Her silence to date indicates such outrageous denial. Let me explain what these statistics mean, particularly for residents' quality of life. They mean that too many buildings have serious structural deficiencies. They mean that there are hazards which jeopardise residents' safety and security. They mean an unsafe working environment for staff. There are many institutional buildings with dark narrow corridors with inadequate lighting. This restricts residents' mobility, further hampering their capacity to enjoy a high quality of life. There are also small narrow toilets, perhaps shared between many residents. Some buildings have multiple storeys with no lifts, further restricting mobility. Some buildings have a sterile hospital-like environment which, despite the best efforts of the dedicated staff and providers, are far from homelike. Too many nursing home buildings are serious firetraps. There may be no firewalls, the fire exits could be blocked or even locked. The windows might not open, or perhaps the fire exits open to enclosed courtyards, not allowing residents to escape. There are too many people living in a room with four, six, eight or more beds. This means rows of beds sometimes less than a metre apart-bed after bed after bed. This cramped accommodation means no privacy. It means barely any room for personal belongings. Labor's response was an abject failure. It cut funding on capital expenditure while not allowing nursing home providers to charge bonds. The shadow minister was quite wrong when she said in the House that we have provided only $10 million. Ms MackIin-A year.",91
156,Mrs MOYLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have provided $10 million a year, that is correct, but you did say 'a year'; you just said $10 million. What Labor did in 1992-93 was allocate $45 million for nursing home capital purposes. By 1995-96, this dropped to $10.7 million-a 75 per cent reduction in capital funding. Even worse, only $2.7 million of that was for upgrading old and substandard services. The rest went to build new services. From such a parlous state it is no longer possible to keep placing bandaids on the problem. The wound is festering and it is getting worse. Rather than just ignore it, as Labor did, our reforms will fix it. Our reforms acknowledge that, in stark contrast to nursing home buildings, hostels generally offer a much better standard of accommodation. This is no accident. Labor's hostel policy introduced in 1988 and supported by us meant that hostels had an income stream to significantly finance their own upgrade and refurbishment. This income stream was called entry contributions and now accommodation bonds. Accommodation bonds across both hostels and nursing homes will provide an income stream of some $130 million each year after four years. This matches well with Professor Gregory's estimation that around $125 million a year is needed to bring the nursing home buildings up to reasonable community expectations. It is painfully obvious that the opposition had never had any intention of being a constructive player in this debate and has no understanding of the conditions of the buildings that many residents find themselves living in today. Let me take this opportunity to put some facts on the table, given the shadow minister has decided to ignore them. The reforms that we will implement today will deliver on a number of fronts. I will briefly mention just 10 of those points. Nursing home building quality will improve. People will be housed in a safe environment where they will have comfort and dignity in their most frail years. We will have improved funding for dementia. The new funding system will deliver a substantial increase to funding for dementiaabout a 30 per cent increase on average to a hostel resident with dementia. This will not relieve the financial strain on dementiaspecific facilities and improve access to dementia care. Higher levels of funding will be guaranteed for providers who care for financially disadvantaged people. Under the current system, providers receive a meagre subsidy of $3.50 per day for financially disadvantaged people. Under our system that amount will more than double to $7 a day and it will go to $12 a day if the provider cares for more than 40 per cent of financially disadvantaged residents. This will provide much greater support for providers in poorer areas and those who specialise in financially disadvantaged residents. We will also provide greater services in rural and remote areas. The special viability assistance funding was previously available only to nursing homes. This has been extended to hostels as well. Facilities in remote areas in particular tend to have higher proportions of financially disadvantaged residents and so will benefit greatly from the higher funding levels. In addition, facilities in rural and remote areas will be targeted by the government's capital grants program which provides additional assistance to help facilitates build or upgrade. For this $40 million was announced in the 1996 budget. Facilities can also choose to broaden the range of care they provide and be funded for. So residents will increasingly be able to stay in their own towns rather than move to get the care they need. That is very important to rural and remote areas. There will also be comprehensive access protection for financially disadvantaged people. Much stronger and clearer protection than ever existed in the past will ensure that older Australians get access to care according to their need, not according to their means. When the shadow minister was asked on radio in Perth this morning what the Labor Party would do if it were to lay down a policy, she said, 'We would make sure people get access according to their needs, not according to their means.' That is exactly what this policy does. All nursing homes and hostels will have to set aside a proportion of places for people who cannot afford to pay a bond. Providers will receive higher subsidies for those places. There are also new rules for the family home. For the first time, they are designed to protect spouses, dependent children, close family members and carers who received no special treatment under the system Labor had in place. The new accreditation arrangements, which will be supervised by an independent board, will ensure that all facilities meet standards. This will mean an improved quality of care and quality of life for all residents. The facilities that are failing these basic tests a stark reminder of Labor's neglect of the nursing home sector and its appalling report card in properly caring for our frail aged. The new system breaks down artificial barriers between nursing homes and hostels, and funds people according to their care need, not what sort of facility they happen to be in. The reforms introduce new and stronger consumer safeguards. We launched one of those products this morning which was very well received. These changes will ensure a system of quality care sustainable for the coming decades. It is important also to look at the needs of elderly people outside of residential care and to put the reforms into perspective. Not once have we heard any comment from the opposition on the need of the other sector of our older population. Not once have we had any acknowledgment that only seven to 10 per cent of older people rely on residential care. These people are the forgotten people from the previous government. But, finally, we have implemented many changes to assist people to retain their independence. We have established the Conference for Older Australians. We have established a healthy senior task force to develop programs and activities for older people in the community. In conclusion, the government's age care reform package will bring significant and lasting reform to nursing homes in a way that will make them viable and sustainable well into the future. It will ensure that frail older people will have equitable access to high standards of care and accommodation and that, as their care needs increase over time, they will not have to face the trauma of moving to another facility to get appropriate care. This package will introduce strong protections for consumers and create incentives for providers to continue to invest in maintenance and improvements to building stock. It will ensure that access to quality care is based on care need and not on means to pay. It is based on people's need, on the clinically assessed needs by the ACATS team-not on people's capacity to pay. These are some of the pillars upon which are our reforms are built, born of consultation and a responsible public policy approach-a far cry from what we get from the opposition, which is just a series of distortions and untruths day after day. I would just like to read out some of those endorsements. Betty Johnson, Australian Pensioners and Superannuants' Federation: Your concern for low income residents and your quick action is greatly appreciated. Dr Keith Woollard, Australian Medical Association: The aged care reforms... is one way which Australia can comeÂ· to terms with the massive increase in demand for quality accommodation and care of our ageing population. Now we have a government that is willing to make a tough decision that will ultimately benefit all aged care residents by providing proprietors of these facilities no excuse not to improve standards. Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association Ltd: Today's introduction of the aged care reforms is the culmination of many months of consultation between the Government, service providers, consumer organisations and unions. The resultant reform package will herald change in the delivery of aged care (and we are) confident that the changes will be for the better. Denis Jones, Australian Nursing Federation: Mrs Moylan has made a genuine effort to consult all groups involved in the massive overhaul of nursing homes. Ashleigh Lodge Private Nursing Home: We support your aged care reform package and appreciate the fact that you have listened to the sector and you have actually heard what we are saying. Political reporter, Fleur Bitcon, National Nine news coverage: The Aged Care Bill is the most important piece of legislation since the government and the Democrats combined to pass the industrial relations reform. Senator John Woodley, the Australian Democrats aged care spokesman: We now have an agreement which has the stamp of approval from the three main church providers of the aged care facilities. I am confident that improved package will deliver a better standard of care for Australia's ageing population. Finally, Mr Gary Johns, a former Labor minister, on PM: The policy is correct. We'd already done it in hostels. I think it would only be a matter of time, if we'd remained in government, that we would have imposed it for nursing homes as well. It's logical. It's fair. It's reasonable. The opposition have made themselves totally irrelevant in this debate. They are isolated in this debate. They chose to play outside the rules, they chose to play in an unfair way, and at the end of the day their tactics have utterly failed. Today we move forward to bring better care to Australia's frail aged; to build better buildings for them; to guarantee future care for an ever growing number of elderly population; and, more than anything, to underpin current and future Commonwealth aged care policy with security, dignity and compassion for the elderly in Australia today.",92
157,Mr WILTON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What an absolute load of garbage from a minister in her death throes. I can just see all the backbenchers in their offices wringing their hands and saying, 'Oh, no, she has done it again. Why doesn't she go? Why doesn't she just go?' Except for two: Patricia Mary Worth and Ian Douglas Macdonald, who will be saying, 'You beauty, she's done it again.' They will be wringing their hands with glee as they sit in their offices and watch such a poor and tawdry performance as the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) has just put in. This is a coalition which is racked by division and jealousy. This is a coalition which is at war over the spoils of a party which is in rapid decline. The corpses of Jull, MCGauran and Sharp are barely coldalthough some might well sayÂ· that they have suffered rigor mortis now for some 18 months",94
158,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The honourable member for Isaacs will refer to members by their correct titles.,94
159,Mr WILTON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will, Mr Deputy Speaker. And the vultures are hovering over them, just as they are over the trembling countenance of the minister who has just departed the chamthis ber, in the same way that she has left the aged in this country-high and dry. Let no-one say that those opposite have not been warned. The Labor Party, led by the champion of Australia's frail fraternity, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), has warned that these controversial aged care changes will devastate the residential aged care sector. But do not just take it from us, Mr Deputy Speaker, concerned and compassionate though we may be. Take a warning, departed Minister, from the Anglican Archbishop of Perth, the Most Reverend Dr Carnley, and also the Moderator of the Uniting Church in the minister's state of WA, Reverend Dunn, who called on the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to delay these disgraceful changes for 12 months. Not only that, but the archbishop raised the possibility of a hidden agenda which may favour what he called profit seekers in the aged care industry. But before I turn to the archbishop's warning on profit seekers, tempted though I may be to raise the likes of Doug Moran immediately, let me inform the House of why those opposite are seeking to implement these most heinous of changes. The government needs the money to pay for nursing home upgrades because it withdrew half a billion dollars from aged care in the 1996 budget. The government considers that this money can be found only in the most rotten and despicable of ways: by making aged people sell off their homes if they need to enter a nursing home. One of the fatal flaws of this legislation is that if nursing homes want to charge an entry fee and get access to this money then they have got to go through a process of being certified as having buildings of a reasonable standard. The catch-22 of this fatally flawed legislation is that nursing homes need to improve accommodation standards. If a nursing home has substandard buildings that need repair, it will fail the certification process and will, therefore, be unable to charge an entry fee and obviously be unable to fix itself up. Ms Ellis-It's stupid.",94
160,Mr WILTON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is stupid, as the member for Namadgi has rightly interjected. If this money is not going to needy nursing homes, then where is it going? Think the archbishop's warning. Think profit seekers. Think the likes of Doug Moran. The clear losers in all of this are the aged Australians in genuine need of nursing home care. The winners are the likes of Doug Moran and his Moran Health Care Group. This is the very same Doug Moran who boasted on the 7.30 Report earlier this year that he was the government's main adviser in the area of aged care. He also confirmed to the Sunday Age on 27 August that he had significant influence on the government's aged care policy. This same Doug Moran, who made $250 million out of aged care, putting him at No. 40 on the BRW top 200 rich list, has been in rapid expansion mode ever since in anticipation of the financial windfalls this legislation will bring his group. Of course this group was selected to privately develop five Victorian state government nursing homes and keep the profits. The same group is also developing a new nursing home in Rose .Bay in Sydney. The same group also goes under the name of Western Health Care Ltd in Western Australia where it is a large concern. It is opportune to again heed Reverend Carnley's warning-and I return to his letter to the Prime Minister dated 3 September 1997-where, in part, Reverend Carnley says: ... it may be that a hidden agenda is operating in relation to these matters which seek to diminish the role of not for profit providers by favouring the profit seekers in the industry. 1 think this kind of suggestion has a potential to explode into the most horrendous disruption of the industry. To return one last time to the Moran group, an extract from the Sunday Age of that same date, 27 August of this year, said: The Chief Executive Officer of the Moran Group, Mr Shane Moranthe rather incestuous company that it istold the Sunday Age that his company had increased its nursing home investments in the expectation that the government would introduce legislation. Asked if this was the case Mr Shane Moran said: 'I suppose so.' This is a damning indictment of the performance of this government and its intimate association with those who men of the cloth have suggested are profit seekers, who profit from being in bed with government-the same government that is forcing the aged to near debt just to get a bed. No doubt two tiers of care will result from these changes. A survey of Sydney nursing homes in yesterday's Daily Telegraph revealed a fee range of $30,000 to $90,000. The $30,000 fees were concentrated in the lower income areas of Sydney. Undoubtedly homes in those areas will have less money available to them. Many people in these areas will clearly be unable to afford entry fees, driving down the level of overall care. I want to draw the minister's attention to a well-known fact that seems to have escaped her, that being that hostels and nursing homes, until today, were in no way the same. Comparing hostels to nursing homes is like comparing hospitals to hotels because both have beds. It is like comparing bikes to semitrailers because both have wheels. Hostels were established to accommodateand I stress the word 'accommodate' - older people who made a deliberate decision to move into accommodation that offered a degree of supporter living. That they now contain a growing number of people who are increasingly frail is because they are growing older. Another fact that seems to have escap""ed this minister is that we all do grow old. But the key point is that residents of hostels have decided-and again I emphasise 'decided'-to sell up and move into hostels. That they may be frail now does not mean that they were frail or incapacitated when they decided to move into the hostel. Nursing homes, on the other hand, clearly are for seriously ill or seriously frail people who are unable to look after themselves. You do not go into a nursing home by choice, Minister. I know that is one of your favourite words, but it does not apply in this instance. People go into nursing homes when they are assessed as being unable to care for themselves. They are assessed by aged care assessment teams, usually comprising a doctor, nurse, social worker and perhaps a gerontologist. It was said on radio this morning that the government expect to raise $1.5 billion by coercing people to sell their homes. The minister says that Labor has run nursing homes down. Labor acknowledges that nursing homes needed money spent on them. Indeed, it was there in our own forward estimates. That is where the Liberals have made their half a billion dollar saving. When money needed to be put in they cut half a billion dollars out in last year's budget. They plan to generate some $1.5 billion by making people sell their homes, resulting in profits galore for people like Doug Moran, the government's self-confessed aged care adviser. That is where this money is going. Nursing home care under this government is allocated clearly on the basis of wealth, not health. This government might as well nail down the coffin lids of Australia's aged because they will certainly be dancing on the coalition's grave come the next election.",95
161,Mr BROUGH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have been absolutely appalled by the standard of argument put forward by the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) and the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton). Let us just look at some facts. The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) outlined the facts of this case, something that members opposite would not have a clue about. All they stand up here and do is belt rhetoric time and time again without once addressing the facts. Let us go back to 1988 when you introduced a payment to go into hostels, supported by this party. I happen to have been in the health care industry. Before I entered parliament I had the displeasure to go through some nursing homes and hostels. I could not understand why hostels seemed to be such wonderful places, such new pristine environments, which you would be happy to have one of your own live in. Then on the same day you would be forced into a nursing home which was dark, dingy, smelly, almost a fire hazard and a risk to people's health. That is what the opposition condemned them to. Here we are some nine years later, and what are they saying? We want more of the same. The facts are that when it comes to standards some people set low standards and fail to achieve them. This crowd does not even have standards in any form of any policy. We have seen that today in relation to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), the Clayton's opposition leader, who will not deal with his recalcitrant senator. We have seen it in relation to health care. We have seen it in relation to so many bills put before this House. Let us look at the real situation. In 1988, were there prudential arrangements for people entering into health care arrangements in hostels? No, not one damn thing was put up by this opposition when they were in government. Was there a cap-the $98,000 that the member for Jagajaga goes on about? I do not hear her saying too much now because there was no cap under her government. There were no safeguards. Where were their safeguards in 1988? Did they run away? No, they did not. Let us go on. Were there safeguards to prevent the sale of the family home to go into a hostel? There were no safeguards, none whatsoever, yet this government has introduced safeguards. Let us get away from the rhetoric and get into the truth, something that you do not mix very well with. What about a guarantee for low income earners? People like yourselves are so dedicated to the poor and the low income earners on the wharves and in the mines, those earning $90,000-odd plus perhaps, your dedicated workers, your union workers out there who are so necessarily in need of a health care place. What guarantee did you give to genuine low income earners? Absolutely none at all. Yet this government legislates that 25 per cent of places will be made available for those people. You stand condemned for what you did not do in the hostel industry in 1988. The fact is that the policy you introduced put money into the system which allowed for an increase in and an improvement in the standard of living of those people who had to go to hostels. The last member to speak for the opposition, the honourable member for Isaacs, almost quoted word for word the requirements to go into a nursing home. Let me tell you the requirements to enter into a hostel in my electorate of Longman, which are no different for any other electorate-that is, you must be assessed by an aged care assessment team which is organised by a doctor. You do not go into a hostel because you think that it great place to be; you go there because you are aged, frail or cannot look after yourself adequately in your own home. For some reason, you seem to think these people go in there for a picnic. It is just not true. I would like to paint a picture for you of nursing homes that, unfortunately, I have had the displeasure to visit and that, recently, some of my relatives have had the misfortune of also having to visit. I note that the member for Jagajaga has stood up here and proclaimed letters from people she does not want to mention, talking about the situations they were in. These are the descriptions of some of the nursing homes that are in Brisbane now. I notice the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) was chuckling away there before. Some of these are in his very electorate and he does not intend to do anything about it. Some of them were described as rabbit warrens, as fire traps, as very depressing. Is this the way we wish to see our elderly, frail population live out their dying years? I want to just paint this picture for you. You go into an old Queensland building, a very old building, a wooden building with dark, narrow hallways. They are cold. They are damp. You go into a small room and there, with the petition of nothing more than a curtain, are two frail old ladies. Mr Bevis-I've been there, Mal.",96
162,Mr BROUGH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, you have been there and you do not want to do anything about it. You are not interested in addressing it. You have seen the improvement in the hostel industry and you do not want to see it happen to the nursing home. Is that because you do not care, they are beyond caring about? Is that what it is? There is no political will, or is it there are no votes? Is that what it is-that is, there are votes in hostels but not in nursing homes? You stand up here in your pious fashion and tell us that you care about older Australians. You stand condemned by your own budget papers. The ALP capital funding of nursing homes in 1992-93 was $45 million, is a and you thought so much of them that, while you borrowed $76 billion to try to get this country somehow looking half decent while you failed us, you spent a miserable $10.7 million in your last year in government$10.7 million, not enough to buy one nursing home or one hostel. You should be disgusted with what you have done. The member for Jagajaga parades herself around this country scaring people, and that is an understatement. I went to a retirement village in my electorate some two or three weeks ago. A fellow said to me, 'I can'tget into a nursing home. They're going to charge me. I'm going to have to sell my house.' I said, ' Sir, have you ever applied to go to a nursing home?' 'No, but that's what I've heard from the member for Jagajaga.' She wants to stand there and scare the living daylights out of these people, people who have contributed to Australia for so many years and who deserve a fair go. All you can do is scare them into an early grave. The previous - ember said that we will be nailing down theIr coffins. You are dancing on their coffins as you attempt to scare them into oblivion. That is the appalling standard of the Labor Party. This minister has introduced the right legislation into this House to ensure that the measures that come into place today will ensure that my parents and some of us in this place who are unfortunate enough to find ourselves in nursing homes will be cared for in a quality environment. There will be standards. You have just stood up there today and said that nursing homes are going to close because we are going to impose standards-300 fail the test. Do you people in the gallery want to see your parents, and perhaps yourselves, condemned to living in a dark, damp, cold, unfriendly environment? Is that what you want-no personal contact in such an environment where the fire hazards are known? We are saying to you that we want this rectified, and this policy will ensure that it is done. You talk about people making money out of aged care. We are saying there needs to be more quality places, and not one bed will be reduced under this policy . You have three years in which to meet the standard. In that time, those places will be improved. The fact is that the member for Jagajaga has failed the Australian public as an adviser to the previous government. The previous government did not have the political will, did not manage to put any finances in this issue and now stands condemned. So the louder she is, the longer she bleats, the more she hopes that she is going to frighten people away from reality. Let us just recap the reality of it. In 1988, were there any safeguards by this Labor opposition? No. Were there any. standards? No. We have another man who has just arrived in the chamber who has no standards, and he has shown that all week. Did they put any money into it? No. They have not put any money into aged care. They have not put any standards into. aged care. They have not put any safeguards there. As for Australians having to sell their houses, I ask you this: what did you do to protect those frail people who had to move into hostels? Did you say to them that 25 per cent of places would be made available to the financially disadvantaged? No. Did you say to them that they did not have to sell their houses? No. The answer is no, no, no. You have failed. You failed in 1988 to put in the right safeguards, and you are failing today. You will continue to fail the Australian population. They deserve better and they are getting better from a coalition government that has the policies to deliver to the Australian public and to ensure that our families can live in the sort of comfort they deserve and demand in their old age. This minister is a credit to this government. The policies she has brought down will stand this government in good stead for many, many years to come. (Time expired)",97
163,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The discussion is concluded. QUESTIONS ON NOTICE: NA Native Title: Australian Law Reform Commission,98
164,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"by leave-I wish to add to an answer I gave yesterday. Yesterday, I responded to a question the Leader of the Opposition asked me about the report of the Australian Law Reform Commission on native title. In that answer, I indicated certain matters in relation to the question he asked. Since I gave that answer, which was based on advice I had received from my staff, my attention has been drawn to a seven-page minute paper sent to me in August in which there was a very general reference made to the Australian Law Reform Commission. That reads as follows: The Australian Law Reform Commission has submitted a critical submission addressing supposed breaches of international treaty obligations and questioning the constitutional basis of the legislation. That does not alter in any way the denials that I made in relation to any contact between me and the Attorney-General. NA AMENDMENT (MIGRATION AGENTS) BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Ruddock:, and read a first time. Second Reading",98
165,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is one of a package implementing the government's decision to move the migration advice industry towards voluntary self-regulation through a period of statutory self-regulation. The measures contained in the principal bill are consistent with the government's commitment to reduce unnecessary regulation of small business. At the same time, it maintains and strengthens consumer protection for those people in the community who are vulnerable to exploitation by unscrupulous or incompetent migration agents. The measures will also contribute to the integrity of the migration program by actively promoting an ethical and competent migration advice industry. A review of the existing scheme for registration of migration agents was commissioned by the government in June 1996. This scheme was the first regulatory arrangement to be reviewed by the Commonwealth as a party to the competition principles agreement. The review focused on the impact the scheme has had on consumer protection and on the costs of regulation borne by business. The review was conducted by a task force within my department and was guided by a reference group of independent experts chaired by Mr Ian Spicer, the former Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The reference group also included: Ms Pamela O'Neil, Chairperson of the Migration Agents Registration Board; Mr Ian Tonking, a Sydney barrister and consultant editor of the Australian Trade Practices Reporter; Ms Cheryl Webster, a grant-in-aid worker for Careforce, the Anglican Home Mission; Mr John Hodges, Queensland State President of the Migration Institute of Australia and a former immigration minister; and Ms Pauline Matthewson, National Committee Member of the Migration Institute of Australia. The review found that the existing scheme had achieved a measure of consumer protection. It also found that its credibility had strengthened somewhat in the time since the scheme was reviewed by the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Migration in 1995. The review found that the existing scheme had not adversely affected competition in the migration advice market, although it recognised that there was a need to improve competency standards in a way that would not affect the level of competition in the industry. In considering the findings of the review, the government concluded that, although it would be possible for the industry to be selfregulating in the future, this was not immediately achievable for two main reasons. The first reason is the vulnerability of the consumer group. This group may have difficulties making an informed choice about the quality of the migration advice they are purchasing. There is a history of exploitation of consumers of migration advice by a number of unscrupulous and unethical migration agents. The second reason is the fact that the migration advice industry is not yet 'mature', in the sense that there is limited cooperation occurring between the three main occupational groups and the Migration Institute of Australia. These occupational groups are lawyers, agents in the private sector of the industry, and agents in the voluntary sector. At present, the Migration Institute of Australia, as an industry association, covers only 10 per cent of registered agents. The government has decided to introduce a form of statutory self-regulation as an interim measure for two years, commencing on 21 March 1998. This bill will provide for the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to appoint the Migration Institute of Australia as the Migration Agents Registration Authority. The Migration Institute of Australia is willing to take on this role and strongly supports the government's intention to maintain a professional and ethical migration advice industry. The institute has acknowledged strengths in the areas of competency, education and ethics. However, it will require time and support to develop the infrastructure to undertake the full range of regulatory functions and to achieve coverage of the whole industry. The legislation before the House today will provide the necessary statutory backing for this to occur. In addition to the statutory backing provided by the principal bill, I intend to enter into a formal agreement with the Migration Institute of Australia. The agreement will spell out the details of how the institute will carry out its function as the Migration Agents Registration Authority and will include provisions in relation to: performance requirements; financial accountability; complaints handling and discipline processes referral of instances of unregistered practice and fraud to my department for investigation; and support to be provided by my department. The proposed scheme will be reviewed by the government before 21 March 2000. The review will determine the extent to which the Migration Institute of Australia has developed the capacity and infrastructure to undertake the role as industry regulator in a fully selfregulating environment. This bill retains all of the important elements of the existing scheme for registration of migration agents. For example, it will continue to be a mandatory requirement for all persons who wish to practise as migration agents, including members of the legal profession, to be registered. All applicants for registration will be required to satisfy the registration authority that they are of good character and have the necessary knowledge to give quality migration advice and assistance. As is now the case, unregistered practice will be an offence. My department will continue to rigorously investigate and pursue those who provide immigration advice without being registered. As with the existing scheme, the bill provides for the investigation of complaints made against migration agents who act in an unprofessional or unscrupulous manner. However, it will also introduce significant improvements in the complaints handling process to address the review's finding that the existing process was expensive, slow and insufficiently responsive to consumer concerns. For example, the bill provides for the registration authority to be able to refer a complainant and the relevant agent to a mediator. The intention is to enable the parties to a dispute to negotiate a mutually acceptable outcome without having to resort to lengthy and expensive disciplinary processes. The existing legislation allows for disciplinary action to be taken against an agent who, for example, is found to have breached the code of conduct or is found not to be a person of integrity. Such disciplinary action can take the form of a caution or the agent's registration can be suspended or cancelled. These sanctions will remain. This bill proposes changes to the way disciplinary action against agents who are also practising lawyers will be handled. The changes will make it possible for the Migration Institute of Australia to refer disciplinary matters involving lawyer agents to the relevant professional bodies for disciplinary action. This will place the responsibility for handling malpractice within the legal profession itself, where it properly belongs. The bill also proposes a number of new provisions aimed at strengthening consumer protection and improving the competence of agents. The present definition of 'immigration assistance' does not extend to migration advice given in relation to sponsorships or nominations. This means that a person can tary provide assistance and advice to potential sponsors or nominators without being required to be registered as a migration agent. Both the Joint Standing Committee on Migration and the recent review conducted by my departin ment recommended that this loophole be levels closed, noting that a growing number of of sponsors and nominees were effectively cases. unprotected from poor advice or unscrupulous practice. The government also recognises that travel agents, in advising non-citizen clients of need to have a visa for travel to and from Australia, could arguably be required register as migration agents under the existing scheme. This bill amends the definition 'immigration assistance' in a way which will clearly exclude the limited forms of assistance provided by travel agents and interpreters. The bill, therefore, removes an area of necessary regulation and uncertainty for tourism industry. The government wants ensure that all clients of migration agents fully protected by the legislation. Under the current arrangements, agents operating in the voluntary sector are not required to meet the same knowledge test for registration as agents operating in the private sector. Some of these agents have fully met the knowledge test and are recognised as highly competent and ethical practitioners. However, many have not. In practice, this has led to the development of two different will standards of competency in the industry, with some of the most vulnerable clients receiving a lower standard of service. The bill addresses this inequity by requiring all agents in the voluntary sector to fully the knowledge test in order to qualify for registration as a migration agent. many agents in the voluntary sector would be unable to meet the test without further educaof tion and training, the bill provides for a sixmonth period of grace to enable them to qualify. In addition, my department is making funding available for the provision of training courses to enable agents in the voluntary sector to obtain the level of knowledge required for full registration. At present, agents operating in the volunsector and providing their services free of charge are not required to pay a registration fee. The recent review of the existing scheme found that this arrangement resulted in agents in the private sector cross-subsidising agents the voluntary sector. It also found that fee were higher as a result because the cost processing a registration is the same in all The two charge bills included in this package reduce this cross-subsidy by ensuring that charges are imposed on voluntary sector the agents. The government proposes, however, that the regulations will provide a lower rate to of charge for voluntary sector agents in recognition of their lesser capacity to meet the of full costs of registration. At present, once an agent is registered, there are no incentives for them to maintain or improve their knowledge and professional uncompetency. Clients, therefore, have no way the of knowing whether an agent has made the to effort to keep abreast of changes to the are Migration Act and regulations. The bill contains provisions designed to improve the competency and ethical practice of all migration agents. From 21 March 1999, all agents seeking to re-register must demonstrate that they have met criteria in relation to undertaking continuing professional development. The details of this requirement will be set out in regulations. Agents who fail to meet this requirement be refused re-registration and will not be permitted to continue to practise in the industry until they reapply and meet the requirements. I am aware that this is a serious measure. It potentially affects the livelihood meet of some people in small business. But it is necessary both in the public interest and in Because the interests of consumers. Members would appreciate that the integrity the government's migration program can be compromised by unscrupulous and exploitative practice by migration agents. Currently, consumers have no guarantee that the agent they are paying to give them professional advice is, in fact, fully competent. If this requirement for continuing professional development has the effect of dissuading some agents from remaining in the industry because they do not wish to improve their practice, then the industry and the community would be better off without them. Two charge bills are being introduced in tandem with this bill. Together with the provisions in the principal bill, they will provide a more flexible vehicle for setting the level of fees applying to applications for registration. After appointment as the Migration Agents Registration Authority, the Migration Institute of Australia will be ised to collect fees on behalf of the Commonwealth. The principal bill includes an appropriation to the Migration Institute of Australia to ensure that it recovers the costs of running the new scheme. The Renewal Charge Bill will be repealed on 21 March 1999. After that time, renewal of agents' registration will no longer be automatic. Instead, agents will be required to apply for re-registration and meet the new continuing professional development requirements. The principal bill also includes a series of transitional arrangements. These are designed to enable a seamless transition to the new scheme. Agents who registered under the old scheme will continue to have their registration and renewal dates recognised by the new registration authority. Those who submitted their application for registration close to the expiry of the old scheme will be able to be registered by the new registration authority. In addition, unfinalised complaints and disciplinary processes will be able to be brought to completion by the new registration authority. In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that this package of bills provides a unique opportunity for government and the industry to work together to ensure the development of a competent, reputable and ethical migration advice industry. The government believes this will be of benefit both to consumers and the broader Australian community. I com:mend theÂ· bill to the House. I present the relevant explanatory memorandum.

168,Mr MILES,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (4.43 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The bill will insert rules in the income tax law to limit the circumstances in which trusts can deduct current year and prior year losses and debt deductions. The measures generally take effect from 9 May 1995. The government announced in the 1996-97 budget its intention to proceed with the previous government's 1995-96 budget announcement on 9 May 1995 that trust loss rules would be introduced. Consultation The government has consulted widely with taxpayers and tax professionals in developing the trust loss legislation. The government announced in the 1996-97 budget that several significant changes would be made to the previous government's draft legislation. Those changes were set out in a press release issued on budget night. Most of these changes were made in response to the concerns expressed by taxpayers and tax professionals about the previous government's proposed legislation. In announcing that it would go ahead with the measures, the government committed itself to consulting widely with taxpayers and tax the professionals before introducing legislation into the parliament. To this end, the government's draft of the legislation was released for public comment on 10 February 1997. A large number of submissions concerning the exposure draft were received. The government has considered these submissions and has taken them into account in finalising the legislation. The government has made many modifications to the measures in response to concerns raised in the submissions. One of the main concerns raised was about the application of the income injection test to family trusts. In response to this concern, the government announced in the 1997-98 budget that it would relax the application of the income injection test for family trusts but the definition of 'family member' would be narrowed from the 1997-98 budget time. Purpose of the trust loss measures The purpose of the trust loss measures is to restrict the recoupment of losses and other deductions of trusts in order to prevent the transfer of the tax benefit of the losses. This occurs when a person who did not bear the economic effect of the loss when it was incurred by the trust obtains a benefit as a result of the trust's ability to deduct the loss. The measures achieve this aim by examining whether there has been a change in underlying ownership or control of a trust or whether certain schemes have been entered into in order to take advantage of a trust's losses or other deductions. The tax law already contains tests which limit the deductibility of losses incurred by companies. The proposed rules that are to apply to trusts will differ in some respects from those that apply to companies, reflecting the different characteristics of trusts. Changes in ownership or control of a trust The tests to be satisfied before losses are deductible will vary depending on the type of trust. Each type of trust has to satisfy certain tests relating to ownership or control of the trust in order to be able to deduct prior and current year losses and debt deductions. For example, while fixed trusts will be subject to a continuity of ownership test, nonfamily discretionary trusts will be subject to continuity of ownership, continuity of control and pattern of distributions tests. This reflects the fact that it is. not possible to apply the same beneficial ownership test to discretionary trusts. Special rules will also apply to widely held unit trusts so that ownership will be tested generally only whereÂ· there are abnormal transactions. These rules will help to minimise compliance costs for these types of trusts. Also, a listed widely held unit trust can apply the same business testif it fails the continuity of ownership test. Special tracing rules are provided to overcome difficulties in monitoring ownership of trust interests where certain entities are posed between the loss trust and the underlying beneficiaries. A special tracing rule applies for family trusts. These tests do not apply to family trusts, some superannuation funds, deceased estates within a reasonable administration period and unit trusts with unit holders exempt from income tax. These trusts are called excepted trusts in the legislation. Income injection schemes If a trust is involved in an income injection scheme to take advantage of deductions, the income injection test may prevent the trust from making full use of the deductions. Under these schemes, income is injected into trusts with losses or other deductions so that no tax is payable on the income. This test applies to all trusts other than excepted trusts. However, the test does apply to family trusts in some circumstances. Family trusts Family trusts (as defined) that distribute only to members of the family group will generally not be affected by the proposed measures. The income injection test will generally apply to family trusts only where income is injected from outside the family group. A trust will become a family trust for the purposes of the measures if it makes a family trust election. A consequence of making the election is that a special tax; called family trust distribution tax, is payable where a family trust gives income or capital to persons who are not members of the family group. This tax will be levied at the top marginal rate applying to individuals, plus Medicare levy. - family trust distribution tax is an anti-avoidance measure designed to ensure thatÂ· the tax benefit of a family trust's losses cannot be transferred to non-family members. The government hopes the tax will never need to be paid. Drafting of the legislation The trust loss measures have been drafted so as to fit into the new income tax law being developed as part of the tax law improvement project. The proposed rules are lengthy but internecessarily so. For example, there are many different categories of trusts. One way of dealing with trust losses would be to have a few standard rules' that apply to all trusts. This would result in the rules themselves being unfair in their impact. Instead, different rules have been applied to the different categories of trusts, depending on their nature. The result is that the size of the legislation increases, but this is matched by an increase in the fairness of treatment. The length of the provisions has also been greatly affected by the changes made by the government in response to representations from taxpayers and tax professionals. This has resulted in a trade-off between simplicity and equity. Revenue gain The estimated gain to revenue from the proposed changes is $90 million in 1995-96, $185 million in 1996-97, $160 million in 1997-98, $75 million in 1998-99, $20 million in 1999-2000 and $20 million in 2000-200l. I commend the bill to the House. I also present the explanatory memorandum to this bill, the Family Trust Distribution Tax (Primary Liability) Bill 1997, the Family Trust Distribution Tax (Secondary Liability) Bill 1997 and the Medicare Levy Consequential Amendment (Trust Loss) Bill 1997, and provide copies for the House.

The bill makes a consequential amendment to the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to provide that the taxable income of a person for certain purposes includes an amount that is exempt from iricome tax because family trust distribution tax has been paid in relation to it. This ensures the income tax exemption for amounts on which the tax has been paid cannot be used as a tax planning tool to avoid the increased Medicare levy on certain high income earners who do not have private health insurance.

172,Mr MILES,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (4.55 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill will amend the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (the SIS Act). The SIS Act regulates the conduct of trustees of superannuation entities to ensure the prudent management of superannuation moneys. The amendments to the SIS Act will improve the flexibility of legislative requirements relating to the nature and timing of elections by superannuation funds to be regulated under the SIS Act. To be eligible to receive concessional taxation treatment a superannuation fund must elect to be regulated under the SIS Act. There are a number of steps involved in making an election, including lodging a standard form with the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner and ensuring that the fund has a trustee that is a constitutional corporation that the sole or primary purpose of the fund is the provision of old-age pensions. There are strict time limits within which superannuation funds must elect to be regulated. A superannuation fund, established after the commencement of the SIS Act, must make an election to be regulated at the same time that it comes into existence or shortly after that day. A superannuation fund that was in existence prior to the commencement of the SIS Act must have elected to be regulated at the latest by the beginning of the fund's 1995-96 year of income. A superannuation fund that was in the process of winding up after the commencement of its 1994-95 year of income could continue. to receive concessional taxation treatment without making an election to be regulated, provided they were wound up by 1 July 1995. Failure to elect within these strict time limits or to wind up by the prescribed date may result in the members of the fund suffering losses due to the removal of taxation concessions. In addition, given that there are a number of steps involved in making an election, a fund may inadvertently lodge a defective election. In this case, a fund is ineligible for taxation concessions until after they have made a valid election. This is despite the fact that the fund may have complied with the SIS Act and regulations in all respects apart from lodging a valid election. The commissioner previously dealt with the shortcomings in the, election process by temporarily modifying the SIS Act under section 333. However, the commissioner's temporary modification power expired on 1 July 1996. This bill amends the SIS Act to permanently reinstate the administrative flexibility which was previously achieved through the temporary modification declarations. In particular, the amendments will confer a discretion on the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to extend the time within which the lodgement of an election must be made with the commissioner and enable trustees to rectify inadverteptly invalid elections. The amendments will also address or restrictive timing requirements for funds established prior to the SIS regime or funds who were in the process of winding up. By overcoming these technical rigidities, the amendments will enable superannuation funds who would otherwise be deprived of concessional taxation treatment in certain years to obtain access to such treatment, without compromising the security of members' benefits or fund compliance with the retirement income standards. It is intended that the amendments will take effect retrospectively from 1 July 1996 to ensure that the eligibility for taxation concessions for funds in the period prior to amendment is not jeopardised. I commend the bill to the House and provide the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Laurie Ferguson adjourned.

Ordered that the reports be printed.",107
174,Mr TUCKEY,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The first report which I have tabled concerns the proposed Development of operational facilities at RAAF Base Learmonth, WA. The base is located North West Cape, WA, 1,235 kilometres north of Perth. The base covers an area approximately 2,550 hectares, situated on coastal plain between Cape Range and Exmouth Gulf. The nearest township, Exmouth, is 35 kilometres north of the base. RAAF Base Learmonth is a bare base, which forms part of a chain of defence airfields across northern Australia and is vital to 1997 the air defence of north-western Australia. The primary function of the base is to serve as a deployment base for combat aircraft in a contingency. The base was developed during the early 1970s and 1980s, and no further or major maintenance work has occurred since. The proposal examined by the committee involved the construction of: explosive ordnance loading aprons for fighter, strike and maritime patrol aircraftone apron will double as an explosive ordnance apron for transport aircraft; alert facilities for fighter aircraft; operational and technical support facilities; ordnance preparation facilities; a central emergency power station; rehabilitation of existing airfield pavements; airfield lighting equipment; and airfield lighting, engineering services and civil works. The estimated out-tum cost of the proposed work was $69 million. The committee has recommended that the work should proceed. After inspecting the base and conducting a public hearing at Exmouth, at which senior officers gave evidence, the committee concluded that there is a need for operational entifacilities at RAAF Base Learmonth to be upgraded to bring them into line with requiredesigned to enhance its capabilities for the deployment of fighter, strike and maritime aircraft in a safe and flexible manner. The proposal attracted interest from local government authorities who raised a number of issues relating to the use of the main runway for regular public transport aircraft as well as the siting of a number of facilities on within the civil aviation area. The downgrading of the runway's pavement of classification number by Defence was a the matter of concern, and the committee has recommended that Defence should enter into further discussions with the Shire of Exmouth about the practicalities of upgrading the pavement classification number of the runway. The project was the subject of an environmental impact assessment, and the report mentions a number of safeguards and precautions to be adopted during and after construction of the project. The second report I tabled covers the proposed Redevelopment of facilities for the 51st Battalion: Far North Queensland Regiment throughout Far North Queensland and the Torres Strait. By way of background, I should mention that this army unit, with its headquarters in Cairns, is a general reserve regional force surveillance unit. The role of the unit is to conduct reconnaisand sance and surveillance operations in the Cape York Peninsula, the gulf country and Torres Strait. Elements of the unit are widely dispersed over more than 20 locations throughout its area of operation, which covers 640,000 square kilometres. During any move towards conflict, FNQR would be a vital element of the first three layers of land defence. The unit's observation posts or reconnaissance patrols would be a vital source of initial strategic information which would provide early warning of any changing situation. Once other military forces are in place, the unit would operate in a zone well forward of any protected vital asset in Far North Queensland to provide a surveillance screen. Before addressing the specifics of the proposed work, the committee sought to establish if the unit has an assured future following the restructuring of the army. The committee was advised that this unit, the Pilbara Regiment and Norforce-all regional force surveillance units-have an assured future. The committee also sought to establish if the recruitment of reservists can be sustained. Again, Defence advised that a fundamental principle of recruitment is to recruit people from local communities who have specific knowledge and understanding of their areas and use this to support the surveillance capability. The history of the unit has been characterised by strong representation of members of local communities. At present, 40 per cent-200 members-of the unit are indigenous. It was also pointed out that the unit is currently manned to its full establishment. This is a good indication of the effectiveness of recruitment campaigns and a strong indicator of the support for the unit in Far North Queensland. The proposal involves the provision of facilities which will enhance the unit's ability to meet its operational commitments and will involve the redevelopment of some existing facilities and the provision of new facilities. This work will address current deficiencies such as non-functionality, size, non-compliance with building and occupational health safety standards and location. The proposal involves work at 22 locations. The committee concluded that based on the evidence the general lack of modem storage facilities and poor working conditions at headquarters, company headquarters and patrol locations are having an adverse impact on the ability of the unit to undertake assigned tasks. The proposed work encompasses: construction of a new facility on the Queerah Meatworks site in Cairns for the Regimental Headquarters, Administration Company, Alpha Company and 134 Regional Cadet Unit; new company facilities at Weipa; new platoon facilities at Atherton and Normanton; upgrading of existing platoon facilities at Innisfail and Bamaga; upgrading of the camp on Hom Island; upgrading of existing facilities at Normanby Street and the construction of new facilities at the naval fuel installation site on Thursday Island; and provision of secure storage for vehicles, boats and associated equipment at 14 patrol locations at Cooktown, Coen, Kowanyama, Aurukun, Pormpuraaw, Lockhart River, Cloncurry, Burketown, Mornington Island, Badu Island, Boigu Island, Yam Island, Darnley Island and York Island. The estimated out-turn cost of the proposed work is $22.5 million. The committee has re.commended that the work should proceed. The committee sought to establish if there will be' opportunities for the local construction industry to be involved in the project. The committee was advised that elements of the project will be packaged to maximise opportunities for involvement by locally based companies. Normal tendering processes will be followed. I commend both reports to the House. NA Second Reading Debate resumed.",107
175,Mr WAKELIN,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I was making the point earlier that the pastoralists bf Grey have been intimidated and provoked by the legal advocates of native title; advocates who are not usually Aboriginal, are usually from Adelaide or Sydney and who have no interest in the productive use of pastoral land. Despite the bitter words of the Democrat senators in the other place, I am proud to include myself amongst the occupation of those people from the land. The pastoralists have been held to ransom. The legislation before us should clarify their position and protect their right to continue to make the soil of this land productive. There is no doubt that the new act and the changes go some way towards that. The miners of Grey have been caught in the inadequacies of the Native Title Act. The larger exploration and development companies have been warned off vast tracts of my electorate and millions of dollars worth of opportunity has disappeared. Perhaps the worse treatment has been meted out to the opal miners of Grey. These men and women and the communities they live in-places like Andamooka, Coober Pedy, Marla and Mintabie-have seen their means of earning a living frozen while the native title process creaks through its many stages. The South Australian authorities are unable to register a precious stones claim since the Wik High Court decision on Lambina pastoral. lease. It has generated such frustration that there has been talk of violence and shootings. I do not say these things lightly. They are a reminder of the frustration and the real dollar and cents cost of native title to people of modest means and the families and communities of my region. I spent much of the past 18 months putting forward the demands of the miners to the government. They have been put, I must say, civilly and reasonably, but they are, nevertheless, demands. I believe that with the passage of the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 we 1997 will see a genuine improvement in the situation in the far north of my electorate. I understand that the same stance taken by the Commonwealth on the opal fields of New South Wales has been taken by the Commonwealth on this issue. This legislation should allow for the resolution of that frustration to the benefit of those people in my electorate. I come to the state of Aboriginal Australia. It would be absolutely wrong to suggest the reforms at hand are in some way a zero sum gain trade-off between Aborigines and other Australians as if improving the lot of farmers and miners is only made possible by the disadvantage of Aborigines. After all, more than one in 20 of my constituents is Aboriginal, compared with the electorate of the member for Banks (Mr Melham). I understand only one in 250 of his constituents is Aboriginal. I was able to visit the communities of Oak Valley, Ceduna and the ButtIingarra community at Whyalla not two weeks ago, in the company of the admirable senator the Hon. John Herron, Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. Those constituents of mine do not want the feelgood romanticism of native title as it is represented by the ALP: they want running water, reasonable health, English literacy and employment opportunities. More and more, many Aboriginal people are beginning to understand the folly of welfare. They want opportunities, not handouts-an option that was clearly denied to far too many of them under the hypocritical Labor Party and an option that is attainable and is being attained under this government. As the ALP should know, mining royalty payments to Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory alone have totalled $350 million in the past 20 years. The ALP subscribes to far too many myths about this country's past. I am reminded that three years ago I had to strongly differ with the claim of the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) during the debate on the land fund bill that the Aborigines of Central Australia were only there because they had been pushed off better land in Australia. As I told the member for Charlton at the time, the land he talked so derisively of is top cattle country. You might think it would only be Pitjantjatjara country. People have lived on that land for many thousands of years and they do not appreciate being told that their home and their land is a wasteland and of inferior quality to any other land in the country. It is ironic that the inalienable freehold title of the Pitjantjatjara land offers, under its current administration, less land access for Aboriginal people in the way that they would like to have access than the previous pastoral leases. I come to reconciliation. The myths of the concept of reconciliation abound in this debate-one might even describe it as a mantra for the opposition benches. I believe that the central tenet of reconciliation-the idea that there is a gaping hole in the spiritual life of this nation that can be remedied only by prolonged apologising by white Australia-is not only an insult to this nation and its people but a dead-end for Aboriginal people. It is a road to nowhere and its pursuit is undoubtedly to the disadvantage of Aboriginal people. Until we recognise that history is just thathistory-and until we ask all Australians to take responsibility for the here and now, we can never be one people and our nation will still be divided, one Australian against another, to the detriment of ourselves and our nation. In fact, over the years that I have been in this place I have sadly come to the conclusion that the ALP has a vested interest in continuing division in a rather self-righteous way. I move to the alliance against reform. Perhaps the mqst intriguing part of this ongoing debate is the distinct difference between the submissions of those who maintain that the Native Title Act is serving this nation well and those who recognise its inadequacies. Firstly, those who oppose the government's reforms provide no alternative solutions to the problems we confront. Let us remind ourselves: we have had over 600 claims, one of which was successful-that is, if you want to call the exchange of money for some building blocks a success. That is the situation with native title in Australia: $88.8 million spent and in effect I would say no successful native title claims in mainland Australia. If that is success, please let us think again. Secondly, the submissions of the opposed tend to be glossy, lavish and come from individual groups from Sydney and Melbourne almost exclusive1y--certainly from metropolitan Australia. To be frank, I have had a gutful of the self-righteous academics and the many Christian church leaders telling me-and by implication the people I represent-what is going on in rural and regional Australia. I have sent a standard response to such correspondence asking that they come out to my part of the world and actually see the reality of Aborigines and rural people that is threatened by the present Native Title Act. I have asked them to come and speak with Aborigines, farmers and miners. I have not had a single response to my invitation. There is none so blind as he who refuses to see. To balance that, I must add the encouragement that I felt when I read an account by Bishop Malcolm, an Aboriginal bishop, who made the comment that if we must go down the track of reliving our history-however coloured that may be in all its descriptionsAboriginal people will need to acknowledge the acts of violence against the white people as much as the white people will need to acknowledge the acts of violence against Aboriginal people. On the ALP's position, I have already touched on the negligent role played by the ALP and those of the party who once sought to speak on behalf of regional and rural communities. There is no voice for the regions in the ALP caucus in this parliament, and that lack of voice is reflected in the ALP stance on these reforms. The fact that the member for Banks has been allowed to run his ideological agenda at the expense of the people of the regions is a disgrace. Those who have not stood up to him and sought a different, less biased viewpoint should hang their heads in shame. Those metropolitan Australians who are such vociferous opponents of this bill and yet hide behind the reality that the land they own and occupy is immune from any aspect of native title or the Native Title Act are nothing but hypocrites, and their opinions should be viewed as such. I tum now to the legislation at hand. I spent the past 18 months working closely with the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) and others in coordination with Senator Minchin. I would be lying if I said that those negotiations were at all times amicable and I would be dishonest if I said that I did not have some continuing concerns. Those concerns include the priority given by this legislation to representative bodies in the right to negotiate process. I still have doubt about the capabilities of those bodies in such a process-doubts that I am sure are shared .by the member for the Northern Territory, who knows better than most the adversarial approach often taken by these bodies. In my electorate, the Aboriginal legal rights movement holds considerable sway. Its correspondence with miners in the region is notorious, as are its draft budgets which it bills miners for before exploration licences granted. In order to clear a tenement area, it is expected that an applicant will provide for two anthropologists, one male and one female, at $600 a day; eight traditional owners at $250 a day; an interpreter at $350 a day; a vehicle at $125 a day; fuel costs; hire of GPS equipment at $320 a week; food at $40 per person a day; travel costs; and accommodation plus a 15 per cent administration fee. That is simply amazing, especially for a body that has received almost $5 million in taxpayer funding over the past five years. If that is the sort of attitude struck by such a powerful representative body, then I must doubt the capacity of such bodies to manage the right to negotiate process. There are obviously significant problems with the Native Title Act as it stands. This bill will go a good way towards remedying those problems. Many of the uninformed may criticise my stance as somehow racist or naive. While it may be naive to believe that we should not divide Australia on the basis of the colour of people's skin, surely there can be no other acceptable moral choice. In closing, I would like to speak of an incident I encountered before I was a member of this House. I was out in the Piijantjatjara land with the now Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) whose interest in Aboriginal affairs is long standing. As a lowly candidate at the time, I was quietly listening along with many of the elders of Ernabella or Pukatja. On my way back to the airfield, I travelled with one of the elders. Mter 15 or 20 minutes of silence, he quietly asked me, 'Are you related to them Wakelins at Port Adelaide?' I told him I was, that my son was at the football club and that my nephews were also footballers. In no time at all we were deep in conversation on the merits of Port Adelaide. He told me of a recent match played in Alice Springs that many of the people of Ernabella had gone to see. A centralian team was playing the Port Adelaide football team. The Ernabella people were barracking with the best, not for the almost wholly Aboriginal centralian team, but for Port Adelaide. Why? are Because they shared the Ernabella football club's colours. There was no racial divide, no bitter history, no talk of hate or despair. There were just people sharing in a common love of football. That kind of attitude must characterise our future direction for the benefit of all Australians and that attitude is reflected in the provisions of this just bill. I commend this bill to the House.",109
176,Mr OKEEFE,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"The contribution from the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) to the debate on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 saddens me, and I will say a little about why in just a moment. We are coming in this discussion of the Wik legislation to what, hopefully, will be the culmination of what has been in modem times a 30-year attelllpt to grant to Australia's Aboriginal people the dignity of ownership of the land and the right to negotiate that goes with that land. The Mabo decision of the High Court, subsequently further clarified by the Wik decision of the High Court, has made it very clear that there is only one way that this final stage can go. I think that was eminently well summed up by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in his contribution in this debate the other day when he said: The government must come to understand that native title rights are a reality and that they here to stay. They have been recognised by the High Court as fundamental legal property rights and are entitled to the same respect and protection as the property rights of non-indigenous Australians. I think that is at the heart of the debate over this bill and that is why Labor wants to make substantial changes to the bill. We believe that this bill contains several measures which are a last-ditch attempt, either by subterfuge or quite openly, to extinguish native title as it has been decreed by the High Court. That being the case, we cannot accept it. The member for Grey and others before him have said that the government and the nation should be focusing their efforts on eradicating the dreadful inequality in the treatment of Aboriginal people in Australia, particularly those living outside mainstream areas, and of non-indigenous people in relation to schools, health facilities, roads, transport and all the other things that go with our life and government investment in our life. I agree with that, but the point that I make is that we need to move on from this point about the ownership of the land and the right to negotiate. Back when the Hawke government was first elected it was called the power of veto and back when Whitlam tried to tackle it it was simply called land rights. The principles of the decision of the High Court have been opposed by the coalition at every step since Gough Whitlam tried to give it effect in 1972- Even now when the High Court has given up on the politicians and has responded in two decisions clarifying that there is a land right and that, provided certain conditions are met, that land right stands, we have this last-ditch attempt to extinguish native title as it has been granted by the High Court. Can I relate two or three instances in my experience as the member for Burke which have fortified my opinions and judgments on this issue. In 1986, not long after I was elected to parliament, I travelled as part of a delegation to Kakadu and witnessed the start of what was supposed to be a grand new era: the approval of the uranium mine and the package of dollar compensation that went with it. Everybody at the time believed that are that money would produce opportunities in one form or other. I went back to Kakadu last year, 10 years after the event, to look at other issues related to the expansion of mining. I found that, $20 million down the road, alcoholism and Aboriginal illiteracy were worse. We did not even have an Aboriginal school teacher for grade 6 kids, for heaven's sake! We did not have a hostel where kids coming in from outlying districts, sometimes travelling for anything up to two hours across the bush to school, could stay in the town. It became very clear to me that this is not about money. I have to commend, in particular, the Australian mining industry. For the first year or so of our time in opposition I had the portfolio of resources and energy and I had a lot to do with the mining companies, including quite active participation in the negotiation of the solution at Century Zinc in Queensland. The Australian mining industry has impressed me; they too know that this is not about dollars. They know it is about negotiating: negotiating jobs, negotiating a role, negotiating dignity in partnership with the mining ventures. We have seen a lot of examples of this falling into place. I observe, for instance, the recent publication from the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the June quarter 1997 entitled Actual and Expected Private Mineral Exploration. It starts off by saying that the upward trend in exploration expenditure since the June quarter 1993 continued in the June quarter 1997. Here is physical evidence from the ABSthat all these claims that native title is scaring away miners areÂ· just that-junk claims. The evidence from ABS is that it has been a consistent upward trend from the day the act came in. I think it ought to be exposed for that. What is at the heart of this is that year resistance to the concept of ownership of the land for these people. That was the first experience that I wanted to relate to you-the visit to Kakadu. The other was much closer to my home base at Kyneton. In the bicentennial year of 1988 the then Shire of Metcalfe, a small rural council, which was amalgamated but does not exist any more, as its contribution to the bicentenissue nial year commissioned a woman-I apoloshould be doing. gise to the House, I forget her name-to do a history of the Metcalfe Shire. This area about 100 kilometres north of Melbourne. is just south of Bendigo for those who wonder where it might be. That history, when it was tabled and sented, shocked me. I had expected the normal thing you get in a shire history: these are the people who settled here first; this who became the mayor; this is how the I admit, mayor's family have carried on right down through the last 100 years-all stuff that we have with a history that starts in 1850. But this woman went right back and she gave a deploringly vivid account of the systematic poisoning, hunting and driving out of the Aboriginal community that existed in quite large numbers in central Victoria prior to the 1840s. I read that. A couple of weeks later I was at one of annual art displays held in the Macedon Ranges, which is in my electorate. It is quite a large annual display and gets a very big turnout. With this in my mind, I was giving an opening speech. I had looked at all the exhibits and I noticed not one painting or photograph that in any way tried to depict anything prior to 1850. In the following year, I was very pleased to see that a couple of artists had had a go at trying to represent what might have been happening in our area. Near Lancefield we have a hole in the ground-a quarry that was used by our indigenous people, about 30,000 years ago it is estimated, for quarrying and making implements for cooking and hunting. That stone has been found in Indonesia and has been traded in other places in the world. We have no idea how it got there, but we know that this is one of three quarries in the world that have this 30history and it is obviously very significant. I guess what I am saying is that it came as a shock to me to be confronted with the reality of what had happened, and we have to recognise this. We have to amend this legislation and once and for all recognise what the High Court has said. The High Court is right. Of course it is right. We should recognise what is right, put it in place, close down the and move on and do the things we all I will pick up on a comment the member is for Grey made before when he deplored the It fact that regional MPs within the Labor caucus were not expressing a different view from the view of the member for Banks (Mr preMelham), Labor's spokesman on Aboriginal affairs, and we were not straightening him out. Let me say, as one of Labor's regional is members-and there are not many of us left, after the last election; there are only two or three of us who actually survived, but the wonderful I am one of themMr Martin Ferguson-And proud of it.",112
177,Mr OKEEFE,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"Absolutely proud of it. I do not see my role as knocking over the member for Banks; I see my role as using his extraordinary understanding of this-and I want to come back to this-and the extraordinary understanding of the Deputy Leader of the the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) of this to work my way through the issues for my people in regional Victoria and elsewhere. I have found that I can get up at a Rotary club or RSL club anywhere in regional Australia and explain Mabo, explain Wik, explain land rights and get not only what I call a positive response but also what we know in this place as a ripper response, because it is the first time these people have heard the other side of the story. I blame the coalition for that. the first time they are hearing the other side of the story. When they hear it they can relate to it and they can understand it. As shadow minister for primary industries, I want to say a couple of things in the time left available to me about farming, this whole process in this House and my attitude to the bill as it relates to the comments of the National Farmers Federation. One of the things that has absolutely disappointed me in this last 12 months is that John Howard, the Prime Minister, made the big statement in April, 'I will have this bill in the House before Easter.' Do you all remember that? 'We are going to get this through quickly. We are going to get it off the table.' Six months later it has finally arrived and it has been juiced up for another purpose. Mr Martin Ferguson-How many ministers later?",113
178,Mr OKEEFE,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"Several ministers later, too. It has been juiced up for another purpose. It is going to be used as an election platform: Labor versus the coalition; Labor is trying to close down country Australia; Labor is trying to give these Aboriginal people these land rights. That is what is going on here now. We went to the Prime Minister in November last year, and we made the point that Gareth Evans-I hope he is not listening to this-who I would say is probably the smartest legal brain in this House by a long way, and Daryl Melham, a former public defender in New South Wales who knows his law, have gone right through this whole Native Title Act 1993, and they know exactly what the High Court meant. They know exactly what the provisions mean. That was on offer to John Howard. The offer was made by Labor. We are prepared to sit down and take you through the intricacies and produce a bill for the parliament that will amend the Native Title Act and provide all the players with the certainty they are looking for. The Prime Minister was not interested. So don't anybody talk about bipartisanship on the part of Labor. The offer was made and he was not interested, because he knew that any decent bipartisan settlement would not satisfy the National Party. He is absolutely right It is about that. So we were never in a position where we could get legislation through on Wik that satisfied the National Party and met the needs of the two major parties. I will challenge John Howard right now to. defy or deny a single word that I have just said. Mr Beazley put that offer on the table. It could have all been over and done with by now. He could have actually met his objective of having this bill in here last Easter, but that is not the way it has gone. In respect of the areas relating to pastoral leases, let me say again that I agree-I think Kim Beazley summarised our position very well-with what he had to say in his opening response to the Prime Minister's tabling document. It is true, in our view, that the measures which moved towards redefining what is meant by a 'lease' and redefining what is meant by 'farming activities' represent a massive overreach of what was defined by the leases when they were issued by the state governments and what is meant by a 'grazing lease'. To expand that definition so that it covers a whole lot of things that were not intended when the lease was issued is, in fact, a granting of a new lease which expands the nature of the title and therefore extinguishes the rights of the Aboriginal people who would otherwise qualify. I keep making that point. That is an overreach we cannot support. To use the tax act definition of farming for what essentially is a grazing lease, again, is a massive overreach and it does represent a clear curtailment of the common law rights of indigenous people. All it will do is finish up in the High Court. What is the point of our bringing a bill through this House, even if Labor went along with it, knowing very well that it would not stand up before the High Court and that we would be right back into that iO-year process of uncertainty? That is why we are moving our amendments. We understand what will stack up. I go back to that fundamental statement that Mr Beazley made: The government must come to understand that native title rights are a reality and that they are here to stay. They have been recognised by the High Court as fundamental legal property rights and are entitled to the same respect and protection as the property rights of non-indigenous Australians. In my view, that simple two-sentence paragraph sums up this whole debate. It is that fact that the coalition have refused to accept for 30 years. I ask them to put an end to it tonight. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Befote I call the next speaker, I wish to draw to the attention of the members of the House, in particular the member for Burke, standing order No. 80, which says: No Member may refer to any other Member by name, but only by the name of the electoral division he or she represents. It is a very unambiguous standing order. I ask all members to comply with it. I did not interrupt the member's speech because he was not using the names of members in an inflammatory or antagonistic way. However, that is not an excuse. I just did not want to interrupt his speech. But, if any other members do not refer to members by their division, I shall interrupt them.",114
179,Mr LIEBERMAN,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"Indi) (5.47 p.m.}-I am very happy to have an opportunity to speak on this very important legislation, the Native Title Amendment Bill, which the government has introduced in order that it may deliver on a commitment it made to the Australian people, both indigenous and non-indigenous, during the election and, of course, that it may also deal with some very important problems that have to be resolved following the unsatisfactory legislation introduced by the Keating government in 1993. The legislation that the government has introduced has a number of important objectives. First of all, it will reduce uncertainty. I was interested to hear the speech of the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), which I regret was a grave misrepresentation of this bill. It was an opportunist speech designed to cause people concern and to inflame those in the community who do not have a full knowledge of all the details. The facts will catch up with the member as the debate ensues. There is great uncertainty, and this legislation is designed to address that. It is also designed to improve the workability of the native title process and to find a balance in the interests of all the parties. I congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and Senator Minchin, his parliamentary secretary, members of the government committee and others who have worked very hard to bring all the parties together in this very complex issue in order to find a balance in the interests of all the parties-something that will benefit Australia in the future. Contrary to what the member for Burke was quite wrongly representing, this legislation is designed to maintain respect under the law for native title as determined by the High Court. If we study the words of the member for Burke in his contribution just a few moments ago, the conclusion would have to be made, if we were not aware of what the bill intends to do, that it was going to take away the native title rights and abolish the Mabo common law judgment. That is absolutely untrue. I want to say from the outset that the government has reiterated and confirms in this legislation, if you study it closely, that it is committed to respecting the native title rights of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders, as this parliament should. That is an absolute commitment and this legislation is designed to deliver that. The government takes the view that the common law judgment of the High Court in Mabo, delivered some five years ago now, was a very important day for indigenous Australians and was recognition at last of the struggle of Eddie Mabo's family to have recognition of their common law rights in respect of the Mabo lands. The coalition government does not in any shape or form intend to be associated with the words of the member for Burke or to allow him to get away with the misrepresentation that this legislation is designed to destroy that judgment. It is quite the reverse. I would like to record that I have a special interest in this issue not only as a member of the parliament but also as the Chair of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I am very proud to be the chair and to try to advance the interests of indigenous people and also to help bring about a better understanding of this great country between indigenous and nonindigenous Australians. I want to mention that my family does have a very small number of shares in mining companies in Australia. I have disclosed those, of course; under the requirements of members' interests. I felt that I should mention that I have them because, obviously, part of this debate involves the activities of exploration and mining in Australia. Whilst my shares are very minute, nevertheless I felt it was my duty to just mention that I have that interest because mining and exploration are part of Australia's economic activity and are very important to its future. I am very concerned to ensure that Australia does have a vibrant, modern mining industry to go into the next millennium. I also want to mention that I have seen the operation of the Keating Native Title Act 1993 in my own electorate of Indi. Members would know of the claim that is referred to throughout Australia now as the Yorta Yorta claim. It covers a substantial part of my electorate in north-east Victoria-not only a large mass of land in north-east Victoria but also the rivers and streams, and one of them is the great river, the Murray River. So you can imagine how much interest has been engendered in the constituency I represent and in my own mind about the workings of the Keating Native Title Act and how it has impacted on the lives and the communities of the indigenous people in my electorate. Based on the Yorta Yorta's view of what the Mabo decision means, the processes of the Federal Court, the Native Title Tribunal and the registrars that were set out in the 1993 Keating legislation-which this bill amendshave defied, if you like, the best efforts of everybody to bring everybody together. The conciliation and consultative process failed. I think it is fair for me to say that the judge presiding in those areas finished up saying that it was absolutely impossible to bring the parties together because of the uncertainties of the legislation and the competing claims. As a result of that, regretfully, that case is now before the Federal Court and there are various estimates on the duration of that case, but it is estimated in some legal quarters that it will take five years to determine. So for members of the opposition who spawned the 1993 legislation-and we had the member for Burke representing them a moment ago-to tell this House and the community that the native title legislation they brought in is good legislation and is working well in the interests of all indigenous people is quite absurd. I just wish the truth would come out and people would come down and analyse the Yorta Yorta issue to see how it is operating. There are hundreds of claims now across Australia. More than 70 per cent of Australia's land mass is subject to a potential claim. Sadly for the indigenous people, I think only one claim has been settled in the five years the Keating legislation has been in operation. As chair of the committee and as an Australian, I express my alarm at the damage that that inadequate, unsatisfactory legislation is causing our Australian indigenous people. It has heightened their expectation in some quarters. It has led to these massive, frightening legal sagas. These cases are just rolling on and on and on for years and years at huge cost. Regretfully, in some areas of our community, this has caused division between Australians-indigenous and non-indigenous-because some people, rightly or wrongly, have felt threatened by applications for native title, and the Yorta Yorta claim is no exception. People from various backgrounds and communities have felt antagonism, and some disrespect has been developing between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians as a result of the way in which the 1993 Labor Party legislation has failed Australians. It has let them down. I feel very strongly about that because, let us face it, it is hard enough for indigenous people. They face great disadvantages in our country, and all of us care very much about how we can resolve their problems, help them and bring all Australians together. It is our duty-as legislators who are honoured to be in the parliament now and who will be honoured to come here in the future-to do that. It really makes me angry to think that the disadvantages and difficulties of our indigenous people have been heightened by the failure of the Keating legislation. For any member of the Labor Party to stand up and belittle the Prime Minister's efforts to resolve those difficulties, to put obstacles in his way and to misrepresent his work is shameful. I believe that what they are doing is capitalising on the political heat that has generated from such irresponsible statements, and it is not in the interests of indigenous people, non-indigenous people or Australia for them to get away with it. This legislation is an opportunity for people to be non-party political and to work together to resolve the mess that the Labor Party created in bringing in legislation which it said would do certain things but has not. For example, the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, in his own preamble to the 1993 legislation, declared that pastoral leases extinguish common law native title. As a result, many people accepted that, came together and agreed to compromise. In some sense, they supported the 1993 legislation. As it has transpired, that statement about the question of extinguishment by pastoral lease is under a legal cloud and it needs to be addressed to give certainty. No caring Australian could argue against that principle. It needs to be addressed openly, transparently and in a positive way to remove uncertainty. What do we find? We find the opposition-responsible for the legal problem and the mess that they have put on the shoulders of indigenous and nonindigenous Australians-trying to capitalise as politicians by continuing to divide and confuse. I think that is shameful. The next point I want to make is that, if you study the systems of land tenure in Australia since white settlement, you will see that there has always been a need for people in the public interest to compromise so that when you have legislation like this, which attempts to settle the differences between competing interests and parties, you should balance it against the historical performance of land tenure systems in Australia. When the freehold systems were developed-first of all, the common law-general law titles of Australia and then followed by the Torrens system of title giving indefeatable titles-there were always qualifications about the rights of the Crown. It was always stated that the Crown would be paramount in certain respects. After Federation, the Australian constitution provided that the taking of people's property by the Commonwealth had to be accompanied by adequate ccompensation and could not be taken unless there was adequate compensation. But the right to take property has been set out quite clearly in the constitution since Federation. All the states also have power to take property from property owners. In some cases, the states do not have to pay adequate compensation, although most of the state parliaments have passed legislation acknowledging that adequate compensation should be paid. But take water, for example, which is one would of the issues involved in the Yorta Yorta claim. The rights of Australian freeholders to water have been severely curtailed by the parliaments. It is important that water be managed properly in the public interest because it is a finite resource. In fact, in Victoria, my state, 50 per cent of our water resource is already consumed by the existing residents, and commercial and farming activities in that state. So it is a very precious commodity. Years ago, Alfred Deakin in Victoria was the pioneer of water legislation which eventually led to the Victorian parliament actually confiscating-might I say without compensation at all-the water rights of freehold people in Australia. Ground water, underwater water reserves, and water in water courses, rivers, creeks and the like now belong to the Crown. Previously, some title owners would have had some claim to them. Similarly with minerals: the history of land tenure systems in Australia has acknowledged that it is in the public interest that the elected parliaments, state and federal, have control over those mineral resources that are below the surface in this country. So it is that freehold owners of land in this country do not have the right to prevent exploration or to stop mining. They have certain inputs into the process which are set out in state acts of parliament dealing with access, compensation, disturbance of soil and perhaps royalties in some cases. But the minerals are owned by the Crown, not by the individual freeholders. I make these comments simply to put in context the Labor Party attack on this legislation, which is designed to do things that are absolutely urgent and which does not take away the common law rights of indigenous people as set out in the High Court judgment. Nevertheless, the indigenous people should be judged in the light of the fact that all other property owners in Australia since white settlement have had to give up some of their rights-under their freehold rights or otherwise-because public policy has determined it appropriate that the management of resources be vested in the Crown in certain ways. I feel it is important to point that out because it does diminish the worth of the contributions made by Labor Party members who are trying to argue that this legislation does awful things. It does not at all. It reduces uncertainty, which has to be done because we cannot go on the way we are due to the failure of the 1993 legislation of the Labor government. It improves the workability of the process of determining whether native title exists or not. And that has to be done to help bring people together, to stop confrontation. It finds a balance, using wisdom, insight and judgment--'--but a correct judgment-amongst the interests of all of the parties designed to bring them together. Finally, and most importantly, it maintains respect for native title as determined by the High Court in the Mabo decision. It does not extinguish those rights. Furthermore, at the end of the period under the legislation when the statutory framework for dealing with these claims expires, it preserves the common law rights of people to make claims for native title under the judgment of the Mabo decision of the High Court. That has to be recognised as being a very responsible approach being taken by the government. I would also like to mention-for those people who are attempting to show that indigenous people are being stripped of their rights-that the Aboriginal people in Australia have already been provided through a system of freehold, leasehold or crown land with some 15.3 per cent of the land surface of Australia. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people represent some two per cent of Australia's total population. They have already a 15.3 per centMr Bevis-They have too much already, have they?",115
180,Mr LIEBERMAN,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"No, I did not say that. It is interesting to hear the interjection from the member for Brisbane. Do you see the divisive nature of the interjection? I do not say that at all. I have just spent a number of minutes explaining that this legislation preserves the right of indigenous people to apply for further land under the Mabo judgment. I have just pointed out that this legislation preserves that. But I am also pointing out, in answer to some of the propaganda from the Labor Party, that indigenous people in Australia already have 15.3 per cent of the land. I welcome the opportunity for them to make further claims under the Mabo common law judgment. (Time expired)",118
181,Mr BEVIS,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I thought the contribution of the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) was short in a number of areas but most notably in any consideration of social justice. I am sorry he ran out of time because I would have liked him to elaborate on the point he was making about the percentage of population to the percentage of area of land. He might like to extrapolate that and tell us what inference he was drawing in that contribution. But, sadly, time ran out for him. Unfortunately, time for members of the opposition in this debate is going to be even more curtailed. Because there are so many members of the opposition who want to speak on this legislation, we have been asked to cut our contributions roughly in half. I will endeavour to cover the key issues of concern in the time available. This debate on the Native Title Amendment Bill, the High Court decision on Wik, the High Court decision on Mabo and the earlier native title legislation has not been conducted in some policy vacuum, social vacuum or social equity vacuum. It has not been conducted in tenns of the legalese of land ownership; it has been conducted against a background. of social inequality and prejudice that is unparalleled in the history of the Australian people. It would be foolish to address this issue without acknowledging some of those events. There has been a systematic discrimination against Aboriginal and Islander people for the last 200 years which cannot be compared to the problems beset by any other group in this community. Yes, there are many groups in the community, and individuals particularly, who have a disadvantage from one perspective or another, but there is no other group which has been systematically discriminated against by the state over many years. This is not a political point; it happens to have been a fact of life for all political persuasions over the course of democratic governments in this century and, prior to that, colonial government. There has been systematic discrimination. The horrific thing is how recent that systematic discrimination has continued. In the state of Queensland, for example, it has only been in the last 20 to 24 years that Aboriginal and Islander people have been allowed to work for a wage and keep it. Until the mid1970s, Aboriginal and Islander people who worked side by side with anyone else in a full award paying job were not allowed to get an award wage. The state government, through legislation, took the money from them and put it into an account-not their account; a state Treasury run account. To this day, the millions of dollars that were taken from those people have never been returned to themsome are still alive-or their families. That systematic deprivation of economic liberty was not imposed upon any other individuals in our society at any time. But, in the state of Queensland, Aboriginal and Islander people were denied the opportunity to ever get any economic independence in our society. It is a matter of some shame that successive Queensland governments have been unable to properly address the question of the wages that were stolen by law, but nonetheless stolen, from those people. No other group has been systematically rounded up and located in reserves. In a former life when I was an official in the Queensland Teachers Union, I had the opportunity to visit the schools and to see the conditions of life of people living in the Gulf, around the Cape and on the islands. The conditions which those people were forced to live in were a disgrace. What was even more of a disgrace was the way the state government at that time-in about 1981 and 1982-took some glee out of the hardship that those people suffered. I can remember standing on the jetty on Thursday Island watching the supply boat that was owned by the state government, the Melbidir, come into port on Thursday Island while they ferried the young girls-only the young girls-from the island out to the boat to be entertainment for the public servants on that ship. I stood there on that jetty and watched in absolute disbelief. This is not South Mrica. This is not the United States 200 years ago. This is Queensland not even 20 years ago. No group in our community has been so systematically stripped of their dignity or systematically murdered, as has been the case with Aboriginals and Islanders. I am advised that the last time someone was shot with no charges being laid against the person who fired the gun that killed the person who was doing no hann-if we exclude things such as deaths in custody-was in the early 1950s in the Northern Territory. No other group in our community has hadtheir children stolen from them. Every member of this House has read, or at least had the opportunity to read, the excellent report on the stolen generation. No group in our society has suffered the systematic attack on the very fabric of their life-their family, their loved ones and the people closest to them--other than the Aboriginal and Islander people. The shame of it is that it was done by authority of the state, That is the background in which this debate has occurred. It is patent nonsense for people like the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) to stand here and tell us that we should treat everyone the same, to draw a line in the sand and pretend that yesterday we were all equal and therefore everyone should be treated equally tomorrow. It is peddled either by people who are ignorant or by people who are racist. It seems to me. that they are the only two options you have in analysing that. Let me now quickly tum to some of the provisions that are before us, having made some comments about the background. There has been a lot of debate in the community and some in this House about the rights of people with land ownership and how the wishes of Aboriginal and Islander people in respect of the Wik High Court decision will somehow affect people's ownership rights. I have spoken to a lot of people in my electorate and around Brisbane about this. There is a great deal of surprise when you tell people that the pastoralists we are talking ahout do not actually own the land. They have never bought it. They do not own it today. They have never owned it at any time in their life. Their parents did not own it. No-one has owned it. It has been leased; it has been rented. There is a perception in the community, which some in this debate are happy to continue to foster, that these people are pastoralists-but they may be third, fourth or fifth generation pastoralists-and that that land is theirs because they have paid for it, they have bought it and they have a freehold in the same way that people in my electorate in Brisbane know and feel they own the house that they bought and are living in. That is not the case, but the view that the indigenous people have set out in relation to freehold land should be noted for the record. I am referring to a document put out in June this year by ATSIC on issues for indigenous peoples. In this document they said: . . . it is accepted that private residential leases extinguish native title ... That is plain enough. The Aboriginal and Islander people are not contesting that. It is about time a bit of honesty entered this debate and people understood that we are not talking about freehold. In this particular area, we are talking about pastoral leases and leasehold land. What have the indigenous groups said about that? The document that was prepared in relation to the Wik decision earlier this year says this about pastoral leases: If there is a need to clarify the ability of pastoralists to carry out development activities under their leases, the NIWG policy position is that it is prepared to support appropriate legislative confirmation of the existing legal rights of pastoralists under their leases. The NIWG is the National Indigenous Working Group. What is wrong with that? They are saying that they are quite happy to legislate and put into the law an acknowledgment that the rights people have under their leases will be enshrined in the statutes. That seems to me to be quite reasonable. But the problem with it is that a lot of those people who have got leases have done things beyond the rights of their lease. Pastoralists haveÂ· gone beyond their legal rights. They have rented the property-in very many cases for not much payment-and, having done that for many years and enjoyed the land as if it was theirs in freehold, they now want you to believe they should have the rights of freehold. They have been caught out by the Wik decision. Their past practices of exceeding their rights as tenants-their past practice of doing more than their lease allows them to do-have now been brought into question. The High Court has said and the Aboriginal and Islander community have said that they are happy to support a view wherein those rights extinguish native title rights to the extent of any inconsistency, but that does not mean that Aboriginal and Islander people have no rights at all on that land, because leasehold rights are not the same as freehold. They do not afford unfettered opportunity to do what you like with the property. It is a freehold grants and lease . There are people who are leaseholders who want to tum their lease rights into ownership rights and they want to do that at the expense of Aboriginal and Islander people. They want to do it at the expense of common law rights that those Aboriginal and Islander people have as determined by the High Court. That is fundamentally wrong. Mr Lieberman-But you said in 1993 that native title was extinguished by pastoral lease.",118
182,Mr BEVIS,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"Let me go to the comments of your Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer): 'Bucket loads of extinguishment in the 10-point plan.' They were the Deputy Prime Minister's words. That is what your own Deputy Prime Minister describes this as being. People who have freehold land are entitled to the rights of freehold land. People who have leasehold land are entitled to a different set of rights. The Wik decision made it plain that, where the two rights clash, the pastoralist lease rights prevail, and the Aboriginal and Islander community have accepted that. But that is not good enough for the conservatives in this parliament. That is not good enough for people like the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman). The member for Indi wants to strip these people of those rights. He wants to say to someone who is a leaseholder, 'We will give you the same sorts of rights as if you owned it.' In fact, they are going one better because, if you happen to be lucky enough to have a lease which is next to vacant crown land, this legislation is actually going to say that you can extend into that vacant crown land. Aboriginal and Islander claims over vacant crown land that is adjacent to the lease are going to be wiped out. Under this arrangement, the leaseholders are being given more power than if they owned the land. They are actually now going to have a claim over adjacent vacant land by wiping out the rights of indigenous people over that vacant crown land. That is a disgrace. I have used up the time that I was asked to restrict myself to, but there are a couple of points I want to make very quickly. The exposure in the last few days of the Law Reform Commission's views on this legislation should ring alarm bells in the minds of everyone in the government, even if they do not like what the High Court has said. Even if they want to extinguish the Aboriginal and Islander title, they should understand the folly of what they are embarking on. There will be one winner out of this legislaexploration tion going through the parliament and that will be the lawyers. This is their bonanza. Do not worry about the year 2000 fund; the year 2000 fund will pale into insignificance. Over the course of the next few years, this will be the lawyers' bonanza and the government will have created it because they will not heed the advice of people who have been involved in negotiations on this for some years, nor will they heed the advice of people such as the Law Reform Commission. I quickly want to mention the tax act definition of primary production that has been thrown in here. Mr Deputy Speaker; do you know why the government has decided to define primary industries broadly under the tax act definition? It is precisely because of what I said before: the government knows that there are a lot of pastoralists out there who have breached their leases and have done things that they were not entitled to do. So to cover that, they are going to introduce a new definition. They are now going to legislate to enable those pastoralists to do whatever it is the tax act says is primary industry, even if they never had the right to do that in the past under their lease. And that is fair play-fair play against a group of indigenous people who have got a High Court decision that says otherwise! There are two final things that I will quickly say. I listened to a comment earlier in the debate from one of the government members about how mining has been devastated as a result of the High Court decision and our earlier native title. Yesterday, the ABS figures for actual and expected private mineral exploration came out. Members on the other side were making an argument that suited their political purpose; these are the facts. I am quoting from the document released just yesterday. It says: The upward trend in exploration expenditure since the June quarter 1993 continued to the June quarter 1997. In other words, in precisely the four-year period in which members of the government say that investors have been running away from us and that the mining industry is being destroyed, the ABS tells us' that mining has gone up again in the last quarter as it has right through from June 1993. So no more of the scare tactics about how we are frightening away investment. We are not. The legislation you are putting through, the uncertainty it will create, and the field day it will provide for solicitors are what will provide the uncertainty. If there is a downturn in that figure next year, it will not be as a result of our legislation or the High Court's decision; it will be as a result of your own uncertainty. The very last thing I want to say is to quote a source I do not usually use, the editorial of the Brisbane Courier-Mail. Today the Brisbane Courier-Mail, in a very timely intervention in this debate, had an editorial in which they referred to a number of things, including the comments made by the Law Reform Commission. The editorial said: . . . an important and independent group of expert lawyers considers that the legislation to implement the Prime Minister's 10-point plan is constitutionally suspect. The parliamentary committee and Parliament may pretend that advice does not exist. Everyone el-e will know, however, that the Government's proposals, if adopted, will be challenged in the High Court. The one thing that we can be sure of is that it will take years to determine whether any new law is valid. The to-point plan will not produce the certainty everyone desires. It went on: The Prime Minister has lost sight of that aim, in his determination to wind back the impact of native title claims. He has gone too far in bending to the demands of the National Party for ""virtual"" extinguishment of native title. He has failed to recognise that pandering to those who want to overturn the High Court's decisions in Mabo and Wik will not work in the long run. Aborigines are not going to give up their struggle for land rights even if they lose this particular battle. It cOl).cluded by saying: Some changes to the Native Title Act are essential. But the Government is wrong to try to remove such native title rights as may be recognised under existing common law and the Native Title Act. Besides, if the ALRC is right, this legislation will probably fail. And sadly, that is what will happen, at great cost to this nation, both in dollars and in social cohesion.",121
183,Mr RANDALL,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I have been waiting for some time to talk on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997. This government has set out to do what the previous government could not do, which is to address the myriad problems that are contained within the flawed legislation of the Native Title Act 1993, commonly known as the Mabo act. It is nearly four years now since we have seen an act which was supposed to benefit the indigenous people of Australia but which has benefited nobody but wealthy lawyers-on that point I agree with the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis )-bureaucrats and those from the industry. It is a matter of history now that the existing legislation has seen only one determination of native title in this country. That is pretty extraordinary for an act which has been in force for over four years. As I have said in this place before, over 1,383 applications have been lodged with the Native Title Tribunal. Of those, 596 were claimant applications. In support of those claimant applications, ATSIC has spent $90 million in legal fees-$90 million to deliver zero. In fact, while I am talking about that, it makes me wonder about the judicious handling of some of these funds from ATSICthe sum of $16 billion over the last 12 years, over $1 billion a year, and yet we are told that 30 per cent of children in Alice Springs suffer from malnutrition. The decision to spend this sort of money, $90 million on the 600 claims, was made by ATSIC's own economic section, so I think they have got their priorities wrong. The opposition have said they will cooperate with the government in terms of greater certainty for stakeholders, for greater workability and for timely resolution of disputes. In fact, I sat and listened to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in his response to this bill's introduction. He has acknowledged that the 1993 act needed remedial attention; that if they had remained in governmenttypically, in their old 14th year-they would have got around to it. But we know that they did not. It is unworkable and it has to be dealt with. We see this bill being attacked for some apparent unconstitutionality. I have boiled it down to three main reasons that the Labor Party oppose this bill. They are opposing it for these reasons: the racial discrimination clause, the right to negotiate clause, and sunset clause. There are otherÂ· aspects, they are the three main issues that the Labor Party seem to be taking up with this 1997 bill. The ALP alleges that requiring the claimants to be more accountable in their claims and the fact that claims are of one particular racial group constitute racism and contravene the Racial Discrimination Act-hence its attack on its constitutionality. It is a pretty long bow, pretty spurious. In fact, says that, because it does not satisfy the Racial Discrimination Act, it would be subject to High Court attacks and therefore struck down. Quite honestly, I think that the opposiattacked tion know that that is not true. In fact, say its constitutionality is flawed because a dilution, as I said, of the group's rights, do they not have the same accountability? Are they not required to be accountable? We would say, using the pendulum analogy, that the rights have swung to one particular racial group. In fact, the Prime Minister Howard) has said on many occasions that the rights have swung far too far. This legislation brings the situation back to a more cohesive and a fairer middle ground. This legislation not racially discriminatory. In legal advice the government from the Attorney-General's is doing. Department, several opinions state that this legislation is not discriminatory. In fact, it goes to the fact that the Australian Labor Party is trying to turn this into a race debate, as we saw the member for Banks (Mr Melham) do in the Northern Territory recent election. Until it can be proven otherwise-there was the introduction of Mabo in 1993-there is no precedent that this matter is racially discrimiThis natory. In fact, it is just posturing from the Australian Labor Party. There is no eviwas dence-it is only conjecture and hearsayLegal that any of these matters would be proven be racially discriminatory. If the industry groups were interested delivering real title, they would not jump this as a racial issue. The previous speaker spent half his time talking about past injustasked ices. We all agree that there have been many past injustices, not only to one particular the racial group but to many groups, including but women and orphans. What we are saying is that that is wrong and these things must not proceed. I believe this bill addresses real fairness in terms of Aboriginal rights. Instead of continuing to turn this into a race debate-which those in the opposition seem to do every time they get up-and saying that this legislation is racist, they really should concentrate on legitimate racial concerns. If you cry wolf over this bill, people will not the ALP believe you in the future. I address the Law Reform Commissi()n's criticism of this bill in their draft which was waved around today. Alan Rose, who has the constitutionality of this bill-as they was said by the Attorney-General (Mr Wilit is liams )-was a former employee of that but department. He is a former disgruntled lawyer of the Attorney-General's Department. In fact, he is obviously one of the Labor Lawyers; he belongs to the Labor Lawyers association. He is an acolyte acting on behalf of the Labor  doing their bidding. He knows that he comes from one philosophical viewpoint. If you want to go out and get an opinion on any matter is from a QC, those who interpret the law can to interpret it their way. This is what Mr Rose The Attorney-General's advice to the just government is that the bill is not unconstitutional. In fact, his chief counsel has told him that this bill certainly does not contravene the Racial Discrimination Act and that it is constitutional. In fact, as has been said earlier today, the Law Reform Commission should look at matters which are put before it by the government, as it is in its terms of reference. has been pointed out on many occasions. The member for Banks agreed, when he the chair of the Standing Committee on and Constitutional Affairs in the previto ous parliament, that the Law Reform Commission should address their terms of referin ence, not have a roving brief. But here they on have gone off and decided to submit their views on native title, which they were not to do. They did not have these terms of reference. There are many negative submis. sions, and they have already been put to the joint committee on native title, which is currently having hearings. If the Law Reform Commission is clearly going outside its brief, it would be interesting to know if it has misused its funds in doing so-by going outside of its brief and seeking extra work which is not part of its terms of reference. In fact, I hope that in the next Senate estimates committee hearings somebody asks just that question: is the commission awash with personnel and funds so that it can have this roving brief? While I am talking about lawyers and the interest in this Native Title Bill, I feel pelled to refer to Mr Ian Viner QC, who is also a member of the Reconciliation Council and a lawyer who defends Aboriginal claims. As a member of the Reconciliation Council, he gets his sitting fee as a lawyer. He has a vested interest in defending these claims. As a former minister in this parliament, he continues to get his superannuation. He should declare this and let us know that he has a commercial interest in this. He should stop milking it for his own commercial want. I agree with those who say that native title is about justice, social cohesion, welfare and cultural identity, but you cannot just talk about those matters and leave out the economic realities that native title has ered either social justice or economic justice. So to people like Ian Viner, I say: cut the rhetoric and support a government which is going to do something about the certainty for all. For example, in my own state of Western Australia-the state most affected by native title-around 82 per cent is under some form of native title claim. Much has been said about the cost to the mining industry since this act came in. We know that the mining industry not only contributes huge amounts to Australia's export economy but creates jobs. Some say that there is growth despite the native title problem, and I am sure that is in many areas, but it is also true that it is holding up the whole matter of certainty in the mining industry. That goes towards Australia's national interest and jobs for people who are desperately seeking work. We say that you should take all these matters into account rather than be diverted on some of the more spurious allegations. It is vitalto our economic development. I will give you an example: the Mirriuwang - Gajerrong case, which is currently in the Kimberleys. This case is holding up the second stage of development on the Ord River dam project. This project is worth untold millions,Â· not only to the state of Western Australia but to Australia. There are people laying spurious claims over that area. They know that they do not have a legitimate title right to that area but they think that, if they com- can register an interest, there is a good chance, by being involved in the right to negotiate, of some sort of financial settlement, if it is settled before it can be decided in legislation. This is true of a number of projects north of the 26th parallel, especially in Western Australia. They have just been held up because of the overlapping claims and the unholy interest in being registered as having a claim and the right to negotiate and what that does. What has been achieved so far? All we have seen is the granting of one title, and that was at Crescent Head in New South Wales. Unbelievably, that was outside of this legislation-an agreed title-and it was paid out at not deliv150 per cent of its real value. We have seen numerous compensation claims paid out. For example, the Anaconda mining project in Western Australia recently negotiated a claim with the local claimants. But, by agreeing to a claim outside any legal framework, the legitimacy of that claim is thrown into doubt in relation to its absolute land title. In other words, you can negotiate an agreement over a particular mining area, but at some time in the future you will again have a problem when either that particular agreement finishes or that mining tenement finishes. This is because native title has not been decided even though there might have true been a commercial agreement. That does not give certainty to anybody, especially future generations of claimants. The only certainty is negotiation within the framework of the legislation. We are addressing this by ensuring that all claims can be made through the act. This simplified act will be there to ensure legitimacy and certainty for all time. As I have said, we have seen overlapping claims which do not appear to resolve anything; all they do is create a huge bureaucratiC backlog. The opposition's biggest stumbling point in this is, as I have said, the right to negotiate provision, which contributes to the problem with overlapping claims. In relation to the right to negotiate, let me say that I could not believe it when the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) said the right to negotiate was in common law. It is not. The right to negotiate was never part of the 1993 act. It was referred to in the preamble-just as Keating referred to the fact that there was no native title over pastoral leases-but the opposition always sought to treat it as a core part of the legisladrainage tion. I can assure this House that there is no common law right over areas that have been part of a claim. That point really needs to sink in, because the Leader of the Opposition came into this House and said that there is a common law right over this land, which is just not true. In fact, when challenged later by the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), conceded that that is the case, but that at some time in the future there may be a common law right. Saying that there may be a common law right is a lot different from saying there is a common law right. The Labour Party really should get this right. They should understand that they are misleading the people of Australia by telling them that people who lay a claim have a common law right over that land. It is just not true. Currently, the structure of the right to negotiate provision is inefficient because it allows multiple groups and overlapping claims. Our amendments to the right to negotiate provisions will streamline the process so that unnecessary delays are eliminated while maintaining the protection of the legitimate interests of the native title holders and claimants. But nothing can be done until the right to negotiate provision is addressed, because everybody loses out; the claimants themselves experience delays. In fact, as I have said, no claims have been settled other than the one in New South Wales, which was negotiated. The Aboriginals are missing out. I can assure you that they individually tell us that they are pretty angry that they cannot determine these matters on their behalf. We have seen the farce involving Century Zinc where a large number of people claimed the same area. The right to negotiate was sorted out, but the actual claim on the land was not. I have to laugh when I hear people talking about this being a pastoral lease issue. It is not. There are 66 claims over crown reserves, reserves and road reserves in one city in my electorate of Swan, and yet people think it is just an agricultural or pastoral lease situation. It is not. The City of Belmont has all these claims over its parks and reserves. For example, because of the right to negotiate provision, at Forster Park in Belmont, if the council wants to extend a toilet block, they have to enter into negotiation provisions with the local Aboriginal claimants, which is totally ridiculous. We know that there are overlapping claims in Perth. Not only are there three overlapping claims on the Perth airport, but there is another overlapping claim which starts north of Perth in Gidgegannup and goes right down to the south-west of Western Australia. Part of my backyard was part of a claim. When the council tried to put sewerage in my backyard, which is near the Swan River, they were not allowed to do it because it was subject to a native title claim. They had to go down to the front, to my road. When they say your backyard is not claimable, that is just not true. There are many other examples of vexatious claims. We have to be suspicious about the motives, because there is more money in the right to negotiate than there is in awarding native title. This point has been made on many occasions. You will get far more out of the right to negotiate than you will get out of the awarding of title. The threshold test needs to apply immediately so as to strike out these vexatious claims. The ALP's willingness to have Aboriginal claimants involved too early in the process will cause problems because it stalls a tion for all parties. Strangely, the ALP agrees that, even though it may be discriminatory, the registration or the threshold test should tightened up-this is because they realise the inefficiency of multiple claims-but they want the right to negotiate to continue to run parallel with the registration test. The threshold test will determine whether, under the original Mabo legislation, there was a legitimate claim. We know that the legitimate claim test is that claimants have had a continuous association with the land over a long period of time. But this has to be a physical attachment to the land, not a spiritual attachment. As Judith Watson, a former Labor member in Western Australia, said in relation to the Yackabindie nickel project, the planes could not fly over the project because the spirits would be entering heaven and that would contravene some right. That is crazy. How high would a plane have to fly over the project before it did not contravene a right? I want to move to the matter of the sunset clause. The ALP's third major disagreement with our legislation is the sunset clause will come into effect six years after implementation of this legislation. point out that claimants can go to the Federal Court if their claims are rejected by the tribunal. If, after the amount of publicity, claim has not been made in the six-year period, I will be most surprised if people not continue to find and resurrect pieces land that were not found in that six-year period. The lO-point plan legitimately delivers native title to the claimants, and certainly the landand leaseholders. It has brought the act and the spirit of native title back to the middle ground. Hopefully, we will begin see more indigenous people gain from the changes to the act. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Tanner) adin journed.

184,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Hon. G.H. resolu- Adams}- Mr Speaker has received advice from the Chief National Party Whip that he has nominated Mr MCGauran to be a member be of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in place of Mr Marek. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Fahey, and read a first time. Second Reading",126
185,Mr FAHEY,AIRPORTS LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Airports Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 will facilitate the sale of the remaining federal airports by amending the Airports (Transitional) Act 1996, the Airports Act 1996 and the Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986. On 1 July, the government executed the airport leases for the sale of the three phase which 1 airports-Melbourne, Brisbane and Perththe and the new owners took over running of I should those airports on 2 July 1997. It is a matter of public record that these sales represented a further major step forward a in the micro-economic reform agenda for the aviation sector. The sale of long-term leases do over three of our major airports enables of world's best practice to be brought to the management and operation of Australia's major airports and facilitates future capital to investment on a commercial basis. In this regard I had previously announced to that the new lessees of Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth airports are contractually committed to long-term development obligations-including substantial investment commitments core airport infrastructure-totalling over half a billion dollars over the next 10 years. Moreover, this investment is being made under a post-privatisation pricing which will see a real decline in aeronautical service charges over the next five years line with expected productivity improvements at these airports. Innovative management practices are al1 ready becoming evident with the announceal ment by the new Melbourne airport lessees that rebates of up to 50 per cent on aeronautiwhile cal charges are available to airlines, on applilocal cation, offering new services cent for those increasing frequency of existing services to and from Melbourne airport. Available on a decreasing scale for three provide years, the aim of this measure, with direct benefits to the travelling public, is to lower operating costs for start-up services and facilitate the growth of services considered viable in the longer term. The sale of the Sydney basin airports, which ar- Kingsford Smith, Hoxton Park, Bankstown, and Camden airports, will place only after completion of an environgovernment's mental assessment of options for the site the second Sydney airport and when the transferred government has effectively addressed noise issues relating to Sydney airport. Under this phase of the sales program, regular public transport (RPT) and al aviation (GA) airports are to be disposed of. It is proposed, as for phase 1 sales, the eight RPT airports at Adelaide, Alice Springs, Canberra, Coolangatta, Darwin, Hobart, Launceston and Townsville will be sold by long-term leasehold. Each lease would be 50 years with an option for an additional years. These sales can, of course, be undertakthose en under the existing provisions of the Airment ports (Transitional) Act 1996 and will be subject to the same Commonwealth regulatory controls that apply to the phase 1 airports provided for under the Airports Act 1996 and ment. associated regulations. On this occasion, however, the government wishes to have the flexibility of offering five GA airports at Archerfield, Essendon, J andakot, Moorabbin, and Parafield and two RPT airports at Mount Isa and Tennant Creek for freehold disposal. A freehold disposal of these airports, however, requires amendments to be made to the Airports regime (Transitional) Act 1996. Before I turn to the specifics of the proin posed amendments I would like to briefly elaborate on the reasons for the government's decision. While the airports included in phase were all airports of national and internationsignificance, the 15 airports in phase 2 are diverse. Some are major national airports others are principally of regional and significance, many with a large general and up to 30 per aviation base. Freehold sale of the general aviation airports and the smaller regional airports will greater opportunities for those airports to be integrated into the policy and planning frameworks of state and local authorities. The to sites would cease to be Commonwealth places and in the future the states and territories would assume the responsibility for planning and environment controls on the airports. This is logical and consistent with the take practice adopted under the previous aerodrome local ownership for program where some 230 local airports were under freehold title to local owners, a number of which are far larger in terms of revenue and aircraft traffic volumes than 10 some of those now being proposed to be five generdisposed of by freehold sale. Unlike the major airports, these airports are principally intrastate in their traffic and their non-aviation activities are more locally orientated, with a local community focus and . impact. A freehold sale of these airports for provides an opportunity for a strengthened 49 association with local community interestsbest placed to influence the developand operation of the airports in a manner conducive to fulfilling regional aspirations-without a Commonwealth overlay of as controls in the areas of planning and environExisting Commonwealth controls over safe operations, flight paths and aircraft noise the would be unaffected, but the question of how an airport's operations interlink and interact the with the community in which it is located would become a matter for the state or territory concerned. The Commonwealth will require, however, before an airport is sold . freehold that the relevant state government undertakes to ensure that state or territory local laws do not jeopardise continued airport operations and that the core airport site will be restricted to continued use as such. The Commonwealth wants to ensure that any airport sold freehold continues to be used as an airport, and is reserving the option of leasing any of these airports if the required assurances are not forthcoming from the relevant state or territory governments. As mentioned earlier, in order to allow for freehold sale of some of the phase 2 airports it is necessary to amend the Airports (Transitional) Act 1996. Those amendments are contained in schedule 1 to the bill and their main provisions are to facilitate the transfer of: land from the Federal Airports Corporation to the purchaser; the assets, liabilities, contracts and employees directly to the purchaser following the transfer of land; and the relevant staff at each of the airports to the purchaser. As for the phase 1 sales, it will be important that the jobs and entitlements of FAC staff at the airports to be sold will not be threatened by the disposal process. Therefore, whether the airports are to be leased or sold, staff and management will be transferred to the relevant airport entity immediately upon sale. Existing awards, enterprise agreements and contracts of employment will transmit to the new airport lessees or airport entity which will ensure that airport staff retain key terms and conditions of employment and entitlements to accrued benefits following their transfer. Following the transfer of staff, the terms and conditions of their employment, as contained in awards, enterprise agreements and contracts of employment, will be able to be varied only according to the terms of those agreements. There are two minor amendments to the stamp duty provisions in the Airports (Transitional) Act. Firstly, item 14 of the bill provides that, post sale, an entity is not liable stamp duty in respect of an instrument which was executed by the FAC before sale. This is an extension of the existing provisions under section 47 of the Airports (Transitional) Act in regard to a leasehold disposal. Its purpose is to ensure that an airport company does not and become liable to pay stamp duty in respect of an instrument to which the FAC was party and which was formerly exempt from duty. Any alteration to the instrument after sale which would attract stamp duty is not exempted by this provision. Secondly, item 15 of the bill is to extend the application of section 48 of the Airports (Transitional) Act to freehold entities. Section 48 ensures that stamp duty is payable in circumstances where the sale is affected by making of a declaration vesting the freehold in the airport entity. That section provides that, where stamp duty would have otherwise been payable, it is not exempt just because the transfer of the airport was affected by a ministerial declaration. There is one minor amendment, item 16, to the special income tax rules in the legislation and that is to extend to a freehold entity the power of the minister to make a declaration that the Income Tax Assessment Act applies to the FAC as though it had received payment for the disposal. This provision was used in the phase 1 sales to declare the value for tax purposes on the assets disposed by the FAC. As for the phase 1 sales, I am not proposing to utilise the determination provisions available in sections 49,50 and 51 of the Airports (Transitional) Act. For the purposes of their bids, prospective purchasers will be advised that they should value the airports on the basis of depreciation arrangements that are consistent with those outlined in the Treasurer's press release of 4 August 1997. This bill also contains amendments to the Airports Act 1996 which are proposed to streamline the regulatory regime for the leased federal airports. Schedule 2 of the bill covers four main areas, which I will deal with in turn. Firstly, section 5 of the Airports Act specifically defines a joint-user airport as Canberra, Darwin and Townsville. The Departto ment of Defence is currently considering the nature of its operations at Canberra Airport and the status of the airport may change in the future. The bill will amend section 5 of the Airports Act to enable a regulation to be made declaring that Canberra would no longer be a joint-user airport at such time as the Department of Defence chooses to cease operating at that airport. Secondly, section 33 of the Airports Act provides that an airport lessee company cannot enter into an airport management agreement with another person unless that person is both approved in writing by the minister and a qualified company within the meaning gi ven under the act. The Airports Act also provides that the minister cannot approve an airport management company if it breaches ownership restrictions under the act. Since the ownership restrictions in part 3 of the act already apply to an airport management company, the provision is unnecessary and so the bill provides for the requirement to be repealed. In its place the Minister for Transport and Regional Development will retain a simple power to determine by disallowable instrument whether a specific agreement is, or is not, an airport management agreement, and to not approve any agreements if there are concerns with them. The government wishes to take advantage of the benefits that foreign management expertise can bring to Australia's airports, but it remains important that any structures designed to circumvent the public policy objectives of the legislation can be denied. Thirdly, section 192 of the act provides that the minister may determine that each airport service provided at an airport will be a declared service for the purposes of the access regime set out in part lIlA of the Trade Practices Act 1974, except to the extent to which a service is the subject of an access undertaking given within 12 months after the airport is leased to the private sector. The bill proposes to give authority to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, to determine by disallowable instrument which activities at an airport fit within the relevant definition of an 'airport service' as a result of a determination by the minister. This amendment will ensure that the ACCC has the capacity to clarify situations where doubt arises about the scope of an 'airport service' that has been declared as a result of the minister's determination. Fourthly, subsection 242(1) of the Airports Act provides for applications to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of certain decisions made by the minister. Those decisions concern the approval of master plans, major development plans and environment strategies, including variations to master plans and major development plans and environment strategies. Under the act, the airport lessee is required to undertake wide public consultation prior to submitting draft master plans, major development plans and environment strategies to the minister for approval. The minister then either approves or refuses to approve the draft plans having regard to the matters to be considered as set out in the act, including: whether an airport development would assist airport users; how the airport and surrounding areas are affected; comments made by interested and affected parties as part of the public consultation process; and the environmental impact. These procedures are comprehensive and permit soundly based decisions to be made by the minister. The amendments ensure that . these decisions will be open to the scrutiny of the parliament. The minister is required to prepare and table in both houses of parliament a statement about these decisions, except to the extent that the commercial interests of a person would be substantially prejudiced. This will also bring these provisions into line with planning processes under state law. In addition to these four changes, the bill will insert a number of notes to existing sections of the Airports Act to clarify the way in which state law applies to airport activities. Schedule 3 of the bill extends the corporation's functions to include assisting in the sale of a federal airport by way of freehold disposal. This removes any ambiguity as to whether the corporation is empowered to assist in the disposal of its assets by this means and provides the board with an assurance that they are clearly operating within their responsibilities. The additional amendment to section 41 of the FAC Act clarifies that information obtained by the government under a ministerial direction given before the commencement of the amendment may be used after its commencement. This ensures that there is no perceived legal impediment to using the information in connection with any freehold sales. In conclusion, I would like to note that the government's airport sales process and the post-sale regulatory regime, which has been put in place, is making Australia a world leader in airport ownership and management. It provides the opportunity for the utilisation of private sector investment and expertise at Australia's airports. There is already a great deal of investor interest in the next tranche of airports, particularly in regional areas. The proposed measures outlined in this bill will maximise the opportunities for the development of regional airports and will provide a more streamlined and effective regulatory regime. Given the need to provide certainty to airport bidders and airport users, it is essential that this legislation be passed in the current sittings to meet the airport sales timetable. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Debate (on motion by Dr Theophanous) adjourned. AUDITOR-GENERAL BILL 1996 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with amendments. Ordered that the amendments be taken into consideration at forthwith. Senate's amendments(1) Clause 15, page 10 (after line 10), at the end of the clause, add: (3) For the purposes of this section, an Agency is taken not to include any persons who are employed or engaged under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984 and who are allocated to the Agency by regulations for the purposes of the definition of Agency in section 5 of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1996. (2) Clause 37, page 23 (after line 17), after subclause (2), insert: . (2A) The Attorney-General must not issue a certificate in respect of information quested of the Auditor-General by a House of the Parliament, a committee of a House of the Parliament or a joint committee of both Houses of the Parliament. Motion (by Mr Fahey) agreed to: That amendment No.1 be agreed to.",126
186,Mr FAHEY,AIRPORTS LEGISLATION,"I move: That Senate amendment No.2 be disagreed to. This amendment to clause 37, page 23, after subclause (2), seeks to include the words 'The Attorney-General must not issue a certificate in respect of information requested of the Auditor-General by a House of the Parliament, a committee of a House of the Parliament or a joint committee of both Houses of the Parliament'. The House of Representatives does not accept the amendment for two reasons. First, it is the proper role of the elected executive to bear responsibility for preventing damage to the public interest. It is the executive which will be held accountable to the parliament and ultimately to the electorate for its performance in that regard. Secondly, the framework of clause 37, as amended by the Senate, would provide scope for the Auditor-General to be drawn in as an unwitting party to the often political issues that members and senators may wish to pursue. I have some difficulties in understanding why the Labor Party came to the conclusion they did in the debate on this particular amendment in the Senate. I note that Senator Cook stated in his remarks on this amendment: ... it is possible to construct scenarios in which some matter may be being sought to be inquired of by a parliamentary committee which does border on the national interest or directly impinge on the national interest or some state secret. He went on to say that it is generally the case that parliamentary committees are made up in the majority by members of the government and, therefore, the government would act to protect the national interest, to protect national interest issues. I think that clearly indicates what this particular section is all about as it restands in the bill before it was amended by the Senate and it perhaps indicates what the Senate had in mind in seeking to amend it. Clause 37 of the bill is specifically relevant to those areas which apply to national security. I would have thought that all members of this House would appreciate that it should not be left open for the Auditor-General to be interfered with in his decisions on matters of national security and national interest or, for that matter, for it to be left in the hands of a committee of the parliament to seek information that would go into the public arena in a way that could do great damage to Australia's standing on an international basis or otherwise. I believe that in the drafting of the bill, it was originally passed by this House, the government had this in mind, and I had many discussions on the need to ensure, firstly, that there was an unfettered power there for the Auditor-General as an officer of the parliament entrenched by these bills and, secondly, that the Auditor-General was not embroiled in political controversy brought about by some decision of a committee whereby the majority on that committee were not members of the executive government of the day. Clause 37 replicates a framework which has been in operation in the Audit Act 1901 for almost 20 years. The scope for intervention by the Attorney-General to prevent disclosure of particular kinds of information on public interest grounds is not extensive. In view of discussions I had on that very point, it was considered appropriate that the Attorney General, again in the national interest, should give a certificate to the Auditor-General as to why information should be withheld by the Auditor-General. Again, that is to ensure that the maximum amount of accountability was there and at the same time we did not interfere with the national interest and particularly, as I say, the national security. There are provisions to prevent information being forthcoming that might prejudice matters before a court. Of course, this just entrenches the sub judice rule. One can appreciate the fact that that can do untold damage to many people in the community if a committee of the parliament could take advantage of information that had been brought to its attention to circumvent what should surely be in the interests of justice in this country of ours. The reasons listed in clause 37(2) for the Attorney-General to issue the certificate relate only to matters of genuine importance and significance. (Extension of time granted) If one were to imagine a worse case scenario that could occur under the Senate amendment it is possible to see how damage could be caused to Australia's national or international security and how the integrity of the Commonwealth's position could be undermined in ways that caused genuine damage to as Australia, Accordingly, the House of Representatives believes that it is not worth the risk to accept the Senate amendment. The House of Representatives believes that the framework in clause 37, unamended, has been proven to operate in a realistic and sensible way, having been used only once for reasons of national security. Moreover, clause 37 as drafted provides an added measure of accountability on the executive in that it compels the Auditor-General to report any intervention by the executive and the reasons for it.. The House of Representatives believes that the framework provided for in clause 37 is sound and therefore disagrees with the Senate amendment.",130
187,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,AIRPORTS LEGISLATION,"The only point of difference between the opposition and the government on this whole package of legislation relates to clause 37. The legislative package itself dates back to 1989 and the work of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. It lapsed in previous years, principally because of an obstructive opposition at the time. As the Labor opposition, we support the legislative package. It is largely our creation. Whilst the former opposition delayed the package literally for years, in this parliament we have facilitated quick passage and intend to continue doing so. The Commonwealth needs modern financial systems in legislation and this package will deliver that. However, there is one matter of contention, and that relates to the power of the executive to gag the Auditor-General. Labor accepts that in some situations the national interest will be served by the nondisclosure of some information-for example, sensitive Defence or foreign relations information. We agree with that position and, accordingly, support the right of the Attorney General to issue a certificate under clause 37 in appropriate circumstances. I note that this power currently exists and apparently has been used only once over the last 20 years or so. I believe it was during time of the Fraser government. However, the amendment which the Senate agreed to is designed to stop potential abuse of what is by any yardstick a very wide power given to the Attorney-General. The amendment of the Senate, whilst maintaining the general power of the Attorney, qualifies it in one important respect-namely, that the Attorney cannot issue a certificate to silence the Auditor General about an issue on which the parliament, or a committee of the parliament, has requested information. Just as the reserve power for the Attorney is important, so too is a legislative guarantee against the abuse of that power. Indeed, the unfortunate recent episode where we saw the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) seeking to gag the Law Reform Commission is a striking and contemporary illustration of the need for this kind of protection. We have had the Law Reform Commission seeking to make a submission concerning the native title legislation. We have had clear evidence that the Attorney-General has interfered with that process. His defences have been that this issue is outside the charter of the Law Reform Commission, yet the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Nick Minchin, has sought himself the views of the Law Reform Commission on the native title and Wik legislation. The Law Reform Commission routinely comments on inquiries by parliamentary committees. Indeed, the Attorney-General had to own up this afternoon to having tabled an annual report which gave a number of examples of that process in action. The Attorney General had not even bothered to read it, according to his response this afternoon. The real reason for that attempt by the Attorney General at suppression was political-the embarrassment of the government at the Law Reform Commission's findings that the government's proposed native title legislation may be unconstitutional,may involve massive taxpayer compensation, may be in breach of this nation's international obligations .. It was never a problem before that the Law Reform Commission made submissions to parliamentary committees and other bodies. the So for this government, when the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) attacks Aborigines, that is free speech and ought to be celebrated but, when the Law Reform Commission wants to tell the government some home truths and tries to support Aborigines, that material ought to be suppressed and never see the light of day. In my view, this is not the kind of Attorney-General whom we would want to see having the kind of unlimited power which the government is seeking to provide for with its provision. It is clearly a political use of the Attorney-General's power to suppress what he has been engaging in. The matter was reported to the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) by the Chief of Staff to the Attorney-General, Mr Hugh Funder. He spoke with the principal private secretary to the Prime Minister, Tony Nutt, to let him know what was going on. This was all about high politics, not some appropriate and genuine concern on the part of the Attorney-General about the Law Reform Commission exceeding its powers. The Labor opposition will support the Senate amendment. We will be supporting it again in the Senate. We believe it represents an appropriate safeguard. (Time expired)",131
188,Mr FILING,AIRPORTS LEGISLATION,"In speaking to the Senate's amendment No.2, I have a couple of questions I would like to ask the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) on the matter. I am interested to know exactly in the terms of this particular amendment of the Senate whether it in fact would make the Auditor-General more answerable to the parliament, as was, in my view, the understanding of the role of the Auditor-General. I refer to House of Representatives Practice, which specifically says: The Audit Act provides that reports of the Auditor General must be forwarded to the Speaker for presentation to the House, and this is illustrative of the position of the Auditor-General as a person responsible to Parliament, rather than to Governarena. ment. I would have thought that the Democrats' amendment in the Senate is in fact enhancing the relationship between the Auditor-General and the parliament rather than perhaps reinforcing the relationship of the Auditor General as a creature of or answerable to the executive. I would be interested in his response to that.",132
189,Mr FAHEY,AIRPORTS LEGISLATION,"Very briefly, in response to the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), I can indicate that, if the honourable member for Moore looks at section 37 and the subsections there in terms of the provisions that are applicable, the circumstances in which the Attorney-General can in fact issue a certificate is very clear. That certificate can only be issued by the Attorney General and, of course, reported on by the Attorney-General to the parliament where it is in the public interest to do so. This is about a protection of areas. I would have thought that the honourable member for Moore would understand more than anyone else that information will be forthcoming from committees of this parliament on a regular basis where the government is not in the majority, particularly in another place, is an opportunity given for base political purposes. I seek to avoid the national interest being affected by such decisions that are taken for base political purposes. I certainly would want to avoid any risk being put to national security. That is the basis for the clause as drafted. That right, that protection, is taken away by the amendment moved by the Democrats in the Senate. There are very limited opportunities for the Attorney-General to issue such a certificate. I have indicated that in the past 20 years it has occurred on one occasion. I would have thought that the honourable member for Moore could imagine many situations in any single week where information is in the national interest. Dare I say it, events in New Guinea and Bougainville earlier this year might have been fairly relevant, but it would not have been in this government's interest for that sort of information to be in the public It is narrow. It is clearly in the public interest to have that there, and the amendment would destroy that protection which I believe is vitally important for this nation's future.",133
190,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,AIRPORTS LEGISLATION,"Let me repeat: it is not the opposition's view that it is appropriate for a power of this kind to be given to the Attorney-General without any qualification which has regard to the parliament. We believe this does raise separation of powers issues involving the primacy and supremacy of parliament. We note that part of this bill is to make the Auditor-General an officer of the parliament and, against that background, we think it is appropriate that parliament should have some fetter on the powers of the Auditor-General. I emphasise that, for the Auditor-General to be truly independent, the Auditor-General is in a position to carry out his or her functions in the way that he or she sees fit. I do not think what is being proposed by the Senate gives rise to the prospect of parliamentary committees dictating to the Auditor-General in any shape or form. I would make the point that, while the opposition does not propose to divide on the bill in the House again, and we are keen that it has an appropriate passage, we do intend to if there pursue this issue in the Senate. Question resolved in the affirmative. Committee of Reasons Motion (by Mr Fahey) agreed to: That Mr Reid, Mr Andrew and the mover be appointed a committee to draw up reasons for the House of Representatives disagreeing to amendment No.2 of the Senate.",133
191,Mr FAHEY,AIRPORTS LEGISLATION,"On behalf of the committee appointed to draw up reasons for the House disagreeing to amendment No.2 of the Senate, I present the reasons which are being circulated to honourable members. The reasons read as followsSenate Amendment Number 2 The amendment proposes clause 37, page 23 after subclause (2) be supplemented to include that the Attorney-General must not issue a certificate in respect of information requested of the Auditor General by a House of the Parliament, a committee of a House of the Parliament or a joint committee of both Houses of the Parliament. The House of Representatives does not accept the amendment for two reasons.

192,Mr TAYLOR,PRIVILEGE,"Groom) (7.28 p.m.)Earlier today I received a letter from a man in Nambour, Queensland, in the electorate of Fairfax. Over the last couple of days, both in this place and in the Main Committee, we have been debating quite extensively the firearm reforms. I want to take the opportunity to congratulate everybody concerned with I do not want to take up too much of the time of the House doing that, but I cannot let the opportunity go by without congratulating the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the premiers, the chief ministers and indeedÂ· the Australian people. That effort involved a lot of rea'sonable people. . This letter that I have received reflects the view of a minority group of unreasonable people. I am very pleased that the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) is in the chamber. She should, I suggest, listen to this because these are some of the so-called supporters of what her One Nation party stands for. I would like to read to the House what this letter said. I will only read part of it, but it is the salient part. It is headed 'Treason Trials', and it says: I have been instructed to advise you sir, that your name is in the eighth batch of one hundred (100) alleged political, judicial, administrative, media and financial criminals to be charged, tried, and where found guilty, HUNG for treason, crimes against the constitution, crimes against the Bill Of Rights 1688 ... and crimes against humanity et. al. It goes on: As you would be, or should be well aware by now, this will be your last term in office. After that to, see section 18B the Treason Trials. I have provided a copy of this letter in accordance with standing orders to the clerk. It is signed by Mr Norm Segal of Nambour, Queensland. This gentleman, if that is the right terminology, and one or two others of the same ilk-the MCNivens, the Dawnings, the Tony Pitts-who are involved in the member for Oxley's organisation and the publication of such outlandish magazines as Lock, Stock and Barrel are the sorts of people who are writing to us. Like a lot of politicians, I have to have a thick skin. I do not want to make anybody a martyr in this matter, but I think it is about time we exposed some of these people for what they are. They are a very vociferous minority group in our community, and I think it is about time we exposed them for what they are. Adjournment proposed and negatived.",141
193,Mr TAYLOR,PRIVILEGE,"MrSpeaker, I was raising a matter of privilege and was referring to some of these people and the writer of this particular letter that I received. Others may have received such a letter; I do not know. I can only act as an individual. Some of these people are absolute loony tunes and fringe dwellers, and we should expose them just as that. We listen to what they have to say, but I think it is about time we drew the line and did something about it. A lot of these people are involved with the member for Oxley's organisation and with the organisation of the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). Both members want to hide behind some of these people. If I were the member for Oxley, I would be looking over my shoulder at these people. I do not know that you understand the way you are being manipulated by these minority groups, and that was reflected in your speech earlier in the day in this place on native title. You talk about one nation conspiracy theories and new world orders. That is quite ridiculous. You are being driven by some of these vociferous minority groups. It is about time you grew up and knew exactly what was happening. Mr Speaker, I would like to raise this letter as a matter of privilege. Before you came in, I provided a copy of this letter to the clerk and I seek your guidance. As I said before, nobody wants to make anybody a martyr. But I think it is about time that this particular gentleman really understood what parliamentary privilege is all about. I seek your guidance and your ruling understanding orders 95 to 97 A.",142
194,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,I thank the honourable member for Groom. You raise some very interesting questions. I will take the matter on notice and report back further. NA Motion (by Mr Miles) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Unemployment,142
195,Mr SAWFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"A couple of weeks ago Channel 9 and News Limited, in conjunction with the CES, ran a Jobs for Australia campaign. They should be commended for that, as should the employers of Australia that offered the 20,000 jobs. However, the stark reality is that these 20,000 jobs, even if they all eventuated, would do nothing of a fundamental nature to change the chronic and endemic unemployment that stagnates the economies of Australia and the developed world. Corporations and business will not deliver full employment. Why would they? They do not have the long-term responsibility for stability and families that governments can have. Governments need to lead. Governments need to set the policy environment in order to seek the cooperation of corporations, business and labour unions. Yet governments around the world, including the Howard government, are moving away from the commitments and social contracts they have had with ordinary workers post-World War II. In an article in Foreign Affairs volume 75 No.3, Ethan Kapstein, Director of Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in the United States, made a number of points about globalisation and its impact on employment: The global economy is leaving millions of disaffected workers in its train . . . Just when working people most need the nationstate as a buffer from the world economy it is abandoning them . . . For generations students were taught that increasing trade and investment, coupled with technological change, would drive national productivity and create wealth. Yet over the past decade despite a continuing booming international trade and finance, productivity has faltered and inequality in the United States and unemployment in Europe has worsened ... In globalisation's previous incarnation governments had done little to protect working people from its malign effects, and their mistakes exacted a in revolutions and war. Kapstein argues that governments are trying to break their postwar deal with workers expansionary while maintaining their commitment to an open economy. Governments cannot have it both ways and, instead, the policy focus should be on negotiating a package that helps workers adjust to ongoing changes. Kapstein says: If the concern is incoming inequality, policies should be adopted to close the income gap. If concern is unemployment more jobs created. In developing positive solutions however, it is important to recognise that declining rates of economic growth caused largely by a drop off productivity are hurting all workers. Governments from the mid-1980s until now have adopted policies deemed sustainable credible by financial markets. These policies have privileged stability over employment, according to Kapstein. Restrictive economic policies, reduced deficits, reduced spending, reduced taxes and-the most exalted deitylow inflation have favoured financial interests at the expense of workers. Politicians and public officials who adopt these restrictive measures are labelled 'responsible' by editoriing alists, and the markets reward their behaviour sustaining the ideology. Kapstein says that governments essentially have four choices to assist their unskilled and semi-skilled work force. The first choiCe protectionism, which is a remedy worse than the disease. The second is education and training, and that is perhaps the only policy intervention that meets with universal approval. Democratic societies should be financed. It makes for good politics and good economwas ics. But, in the near term, it cannot provide the solution to the structural problems of employment and inequality. The third approach is to increase the number of jobs through public works programs and employment subsidies to the private sector. Public job creation is relatively cient and socially productive-since it prosmall vides younger workers with needed job experience-and it can be done fairly quickly. The fourth policy choice is tax reform, perhaps eliminating income taxes altogether for a large number of the working poor while price making them sharply more progressive up the income ladder. One of the main arguments against an strategy is that it is inflationary. Certainly, inflation is unwelcome, but so is unemployment, which in this country is more like 13 to 15 per cent and much higher than the admitted rate of almost nine per cent. Kapstein acknowledges that restrictive policies may have been necessary when first conceived in the 1980s to bring stability to the financial markets, but they have failed too should be many people for too long. The challenge to all governments is clear: in restore growth and opportunity. Unfortunately, in this country of Australia that we all represent, realisation of the message that Ethan or Kapstein brings-who was also one of the proponents of globalisation in a former lifetotally escapes the Howard government. Telstra: Phonecard Vending Machines",142
196,Mr BILSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Dunkley) (7.37 p.m.}-Two Dunkley small businessmen have lost substantial sums of moneyÂ· investing in a phonecard vending machine business that had the backof Telstra. Mr Gerhard Schulz and Mr Ted Hancock each lost $16,000 by investing in a business opportunity in 1993 promoted by General Vending (Australia) Pty Ltd, an associated company to Del-Marina Pty Ltd, is which shared a common director, Mr Rod Montague Laski of Prahran East, Victoria. Mr Laski's companies claimed in advertisements published in the Age in early 1993 a 'staggering 40 per cent minimum guaranteed return on your investment'. This same claim reiterated in subsequent correspondence between Mr Laski and my constituents. The written guarantee promised that only sites that took revenue of at least $340 per week per machine would be selected. Naively but not unnaturally, as the associated company, DelMarina Pty Ltd, had a distribution agreement effiwith Telstra, they were among at least 19 investors who believed these claims and purchased phonecard vending machines subsequently deployed at various retail outlets and around Melbourne and Sydney. Companies like Telstra and those associated with it have an obligation to behave ethically. On 14 October 1994 after the Casualties of Telecom saga with one compensation payment of $2.3 million, Telstra CEO, Mr Blount, said in large advertisements that Telstra embraced 'an approach based on honesty and integrity ... values fundamental to the way we do business'. My constituents assumed Telstra would have conducted a full study on Del-Marina Pty Ltd in view of their distribution agreement and relationship. Telstra suggested to potential investors Del-Marina would be the sole source of new phonecard distribution outlets. The Telstra phonecard brand name was used in advertiseeight ments. My constituents assert that Telstra never enforced its agreement with Del-Marina which insisted investors read the distribution agreement, only provided to Mr Schulz four months after he had made his investment. In July 1993 Telstra stated that General Vending Pty Ltd was the trading arm of Del-Marina Melbourne. and that General Vending (Australia) Pty Ltd was now registered as a company. By September 1993 my constituents knew that the claimed return on investment was mythical. Mr Schulz complained to the Trade Practices Commission which advised that, with their limited resources, the matter did involve widespread consumer detriment therefore would not be pursued. Despite Marina receiving complaints in mid-1992, Telstra failed to terminate General Vending's contract until 28 October 1993. Telstra knew of Mr Laski from previous dealings and had ously terminated a contract with him. This surprising reaffirmation of faith in Mr Laski by Telstra allowed General Vending to win around $1 million in revenue. Telstra benefitSecurities ed from more phonecard sales and a reduction in vandalism at public phone boxes. While Telstra offered to allow affected investors to supply phonecards sites, this was impractical because a tiny number of people were supplying large areas by this time in view of the low returns from each machine. By October 1994 Telstra was indicating to Mr Schulz's solicitors that might consider funding an action against Laski, but nothing came of efforts to get Telstra to fund a class action against Mr Laski or the companies, justified by' Telstra on basis that General Vending was pending company deregistration. This was despite Telstra engaging solicitors to prepare a class action. Eventually, in April 1995, Telstra offered Mr Schulz $1,600 to use as he saw fit. Mr Rodney Laski did not cease as a director of General Vending (Australia) Pty Ltd until 24 April 1996 but had ceased his directorship with Del-Marina Pty Ltd on 2 February 1993. These vending machines were sold by General that Vending for up to $1,800 each. Australian Securities Commission records show Mr Laski to be currently the director of other companies including Miami Coin International Pty Ltd. Mr Laski's companies have previously been located in the CadburySchweppes building at Level 10, 636 St Kilda Road, Melbourne. About six months ago, he did a 'midnight flit' from this building. He now trades at Level 1, 391 St Kilda Road, Mrs Robyn Peet of Dingley, Victoria, obtained judgment against General Vending Pty Ltd, Del-Marina Pty Ltd and Conmorre Pty Ltd for $71,800 in February 1996. Mrs Peet had been pregnant at the time she originally invested $63,000. Mr Donald Smith not obtained a judgment in the county court for and $70,000 in November 1995 against Deland Mr Laski. In July this year Telstra wrote to Mr Schulz saying that they were unwilling to reopen their previous goodwill offer or renegotiate. Mr Laski is now offering previso-called 'club cards' for phone sex. I call upon Telstra to put aside its indifference and to again consider doing what it can to assist these investors. The Australian Commission should formally consider whether Mr Laski is a fit and proper person to hold Australian company directorship under section 230 of the Corporations to existing Law. (Time expired) Western Australian Liberal Party",143
197,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening to I would like return to they one of my favourite and recurring themesMr namely, the hopelessness of the Western Australian parliamentary Liberal team. We know that my view of their hopelessness is the shared by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) because there is not one Western Australian Liberal in the cabinet. We know that, in all of the speculation this week, about who is going to come and who is going to go, the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) and the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) are much more likely to go out than they are to go up. We have seen headlines in recent times such as 'PM takes Moylan to task', 'Time may soon be up for minister' and 'Moylan too ill to fend off her critics'. So we know that the Minister for Family Services is on a short fuse. We also know, as the member for Moore (Mr Filing) alluded to today in question time Senator Campbell from Western Australia is gunning for her as well. He is after her spot. We also know that the Premier of Western Australia, Mr Court, has no confidence in either the Attorney-General or the Minister for Family Services. Yesterday he refused to be drawn on either of them, either their current performance or their future. What do we know about the Attorney General? We know that the Prime Minister has no confidence in him because as an Attorney-General he is not in cabinet. Now we discover that the Premier of Western Australia has no confidence in him either. An article in the West Australian of 1 October headed 'WA cabinet call' says: Premier Richard Court put in a bid yesterday for a WA Cabinet minister in the Howard Government's ministerial reshuffle . . . Mr Court said it was ludicrous that WA was not represented in Cabinet . . . He refused to comment on speculation that WA's Judi Moylan would be dumped ... Mr Court singled out senators Chris Ellison and Ian Campbell as talented MPs who would make good Cabinet ministers. That is picked up in the Australian, whose headline reads 'Premier at odds with PM over make-up of cabinet'. He again calls on Senators Ellison and Campbell to be made cabinet ministers. We know the Prime Minister has no confidence in the Attorney-General. Now we know the Premier has no confidence in him. Daryl would have gone by the end of the week, but now that he has been caught out over the Australian Law Reform Commission, the Prime Minister is handcuffed to him and he cannot take him out. Who is one West Australian Liberal who the Prime Minister would like to promote? His good friend, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). An article in the West Australian of 29 August headed 'Rocher to bide time' says: Prime Minister John Howard is missing one of his most loyal lieutenants. He wants his long-time friend and political ally Allan Rocher to return to the Liberal Party. It is understood he wants to meet privately with Mr Rocher-possibly as early as next week-to discuss future options, including a way of facilitating his comeback. The scheduled meeting for Wednesday of this week was cancelled because of other matters. But an article in the Sunday Times on 28 September headed 'PM backs return by WA's Rocher' states: Prime Minister John Howard has privately backed moves to bring a former Liberal and now independent MP, Allan Rocher, back into the Government. But the move is believed to have run into opposition in WA, with one Liberal warning it would be ""World War ill"" if it went ahead. Liberal Party president Tony Staley is understood to have approached the WA Liberal Party in July offering a deal to bring Mr Rocher into the party. The deal was that a WA minister would go into the Cabinet if the party agreed to re-endorse Mr Rocher for the seat of Curtin. ""Staley would not have done that off his own bat,"" one Liberal source said. ""Tony was the emissary for Allan's good friend-the Prime Minister."" So we can have a WA cabinet minister from the Liberal Party if Allan is back in the show! Why would Premier Court want to promote Senator Campbell? Because. we know that there is real trouble for Liberal senators in preselections coming up in October and November. The West Australian on 19 September states there is 'serious jockeying for position by incumbents Sue Knowles and Ian Campbell' for the Senate spot. Why do we know that Senator Campbell is in trouble? Because he - as l-t down the WA resources and prospectmg mdustry over section 23(pa), as the parliamentary secretary at the table well knows. So, why would Premier Court want to support someone who is letting down Western Australia so badly? Because they are both No-l. Crichton-Browne kids-they grew up in polItIcs at the feet of Noel Crichton-Browne. There is another Noel Crichton-Browne kidSenator Lightfoot-who is prepared to stand up for Western Australia. Today I received in my office a letter dated 26 September from Senator Lightfoot, senator for Western Australia. It is addressed to Senator Ian Campbell, senator for Western Australia, Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, and it says: ....it is still my unchangeable position, that the sectIOn 23 (pa) should stay intacto within the present act. There are no possible suggested amendments that could replace that section that will be either revenue positive, or recreat- the incentive for prospectors to add to the Nation's mineral reserves wealth. May I also add, that with the combination of Native Title, Diesel Fuel Rebate capping, the removal of 23(pa), the Western Australia Government's soon to be implemented Gold Royalty, a worrying number of miners are on their fiscal knees: A- the Nation's biggest dollar earner, I am becommg mcreasingly uncomfortable with my Government's indifferent, even irresponsible attitude to the mining industry. So let us hope, for the mineral and resources industries in WA, that Senator Campbell's disloyalty to the industry is not rewarded by a promotion into the cabinet over the Attorney-General and over the Minister for Family Services. Senator Campbell does not deserve to be promoted on the basis that he has monstrously and massively let down the Western Australia mineral resources and prospecting industries. Kingscliff High School",144
198,Mr ANTHONY,ADJOURNMENT,"Richmond) (7.48 p.m.}-I rise tonight to speak about a school in the Richmond electorate-Kingscliff High School. This is a very progressive school which has oyer 1,150 students. The principal, Milton SImmons, has seen the school grow from 400 students from when he became the first principal of the school in 1986. One of the reasons for the success of the school is its initiative in reaching out to feeder schools. It has become a standard feature.of the high school that students spend some tIme at feeder primary schools telling the pupils what the high school children are doing, especially in the environmental field. As - iltonputs it, it is 'kids teaching kids', and It has been very effective. They have been very proactive in environmental work and I fully support and encourage the principal, Milton Simmons, and a number of very professional and dedicated teachers. At the school they have the Kingscliff Enviro Club and membership is about one-third of the whole school from all age brack-ts. Their involvement with landcare projects mcludes dune regeneration work, reafforestation work at Kingscliff and river care. They won the NSW Landcare award in 1996, they were finalists for the Telstra Landcare Education Award in 1996, they won the Banksia Environmental Award in 1996, they were entrants in the NSW Landcare award this year and they are also now putting together a proposal for the United Nations Environment Programme Environmental Youth Forum for South Pacific and Asian nations. There are three students in particular who attended the Australian Youth Forum at the Old Parliament House in Canberra whom I would like to mention: Lara Maciuk, Tammy MCDonald and Kim Meighan. Several very positive decisions came out of the conference and particularly the proposal for a youth congress which would talk directly to government. These three and others from the Kingscliff High School are actively working to bring people in the Tweed Valley into environmental programs. They participate in the activities of the local Tweed Valley Family and Youth Support Service-run by David Neely who is doing a very good job as a youth officer-and set up a Tweed Coast Youth Council which meets every month at the Kingscliff High School. They are discussing not just environment issues but public transport, other activities and facilities for young people. Lara Maciuk, a 16-year-old year 11 student was also nominated for the 1998 Young Australian of the Year Award for her environmental and youth work. This is the second year running she has been nominated for the award. She is a key member of the Kingscliff Enviro Club which, as I mentioned, were finalists in the NSW Landcare awards to be announced in November. She has represented Australia at the United Nations Youth Forum. There are some other individuals, too, in electorate that I should mention. Christopher Teitzel of Mount St Patrick's School in form Murwillumbah has also been nominated for award for a CD, Saving the Environment, which he produced and which was sponsored by the Total Catchment Management of the name but a few. Tweed Valley. Melinda Schubert has been doing a CPA and has been nominated for a career achievement award. The school's rugby union team won a country schools' competition-the Yeates Shield-in the electorate of Calare on 21 September. The good old Kingscliff school from the north coast stole the match away from Kinross Wolaroi, scoring twice in the last three minutes-almost as good as the rugby league game last week-3l note that the son of the member for Calare (Mr Andren) was also playing in the local team but, unfortunately, the boys from the north coast beat them. The school is also a leader in the performing arts. They have participated over the last six to seven years in the Coca Cola Schools Spectacular held at the Sydney Entertainment Centre which I am sure many of my Melin bourne colleagues would know quite well. ty Also, many of the students are involved in the drama and entertainment fields. In other areas of sporting achievements, this year Kingscliff High School won the secondary schools swimming titles. They won the girls' sectionMr Hockey-Good!",146
199,Mr ANTHONY,ADJOURNMENT,I note the member for North Sydney was impressed by that. They ing also won a number of other competitions. So my congratulations go to the Kingscliff School for doing an excellent job and I delighted that this House sees fit to note Music Industry: Free Trade,147
200,Ms HANSON,ADJOURNMENT,"While it is indeed lamentable that the Australian music industry is foreign owned and controlled, there are many Australian artists who record with these companies and the industry supports thousands of Australian jobs. As free trade and the so-called level playing field are the destroying 'our manufacturing and farming sectors, free trade in our music industry in the of parallel importing will very likely do an serious damage to the whole music industry and everyone it supports: production people, workers, and nearly 2000 music retailers-to The best case scenario for price reductions under the government's plan on new releases is only about $2 to $3 per CD. This minor saving would hardly seem worth the potential cost to the industry and Australian jobs. While reducing the cost of consumer goods is a worthy cause, many would say the human price is too high. A recent poll found that 85 per cent of Australians would pay a little more to save jobs and therefore have a better to 29. I and more secure society. There is also no guarantee that the price of CDs will fall. Considering that the deregulation of the banking sector has resulted in the highest bank charges-and the poorest service ever-just as with banking, the supposed savings may not even be passed on to the consumer. We must also ask if this is just the first step a broader breakdown of intellectual properrights in Australia-a situation that puts at risk all industries that depend on copyright, patent or trademark protection. We should be wary of this government's intentions for the music industry. If it is the first step to a broader approach including patents and the like, we will all yet again feel the darkness of the shadow of our old enemy, the United Nations and its Lima declaration. If the coalition is fair dinkum about reducthe price of CDs, as it promised at the last election, then it should do so by changing the High inefficient sales tax regime which slugs am business and consumers. Copyrights, like that. tariffs, protect Australian jobs and local industries, and jobs must be our No. 1 priority. More jobs will lead to a more secure society with less crime, less substance abuse, less family breakdown and less suicide. Jobs in Australia will be created only by applying the principles of economic nationalism, while those of free trade will keep our country in a downward spiral. Governments have a lot to learn about ordinary Australians and what they are going through. I fear that these are lessons neither Liberal or Labor will ever learn.",147
201,Mr HOCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"On 30 July this year I conducted a youth forum on drugs at North Sydney Leagues Club. Students from nearly 21 local secondary schools as well as some prominent local guest speakers came along, including Alice Wood, who, at the age of 17, lost her 15-year-old sister, Anna, after she took an ecstasy tablet at a dance party, and Billy Moore, an Australian representative in rugby league who plays football for the local North Sydney Bears. The discussion on this vital issue was forthright. I learnt from students that drugs such as marijuana and ecstasy are more common and accessible in our local schools than even I previously believed. Gone are the stereotypical drug pushers who lurk in public toilets and lane ways waiting for kids to finish school for the day. Now the dealers are students in the schools and, despite what older people may think, they no longer have to widely ply their trade. Students these days have more knowledge about where to get drugs than they do about what drugs actually contain and what they can actually do. Some students at the forum spoke of peers who tum up to school stoned; others told of the frankness and openness with which marijuana use in particular is spoken about at school. Still others discussed the fairly sophisthat ticated way in which credit for drug purchases is provided. As our discussions continued, I was amazed at how undisturbed these students appeared to be about the presence of illegal drugs in their lives, both at school and at parties. The stereotypical North Shore student shows no real intrigue and is not unfamiliar with the different types of drugs available, nor the various methods of use. But from almost all the approximately 40 students in the room I received an overwhelming message: fear campaigns such as the anti-smoking campaign are very effective. The as show kids how uncool it is to smoke. Currently, some influential figures in the lives of the average teenager send deadly Drugs messages. It could be a band like Oasis-who I happen to like-or singer Evan Dando, who put their song writing ability down to a permanent drug haze, or actor River Phoenix, whose death from a drug cocktail is attributed to merely 'bad karma', that are inspiration for a student to give it a go. We need to fight back with a campaign illustrating how you can be successful, drug free and cool at the same time. We need some positive role models. The second demand of students was for a real life education campaign that was not couched in the usual rhetoric of a 'teacher knows best' classroom. On the real life effects of drugs, we all have much to learn. For example, I was surprised by Billy Moore's comment that as a professional footballer he cannot stay in a room where people may be smoking marijuana, because the smoke from a joint will penetrate the pores of his skin. Of course, with the random drug tests in professional sport this could mean the end of a sporting career. In fact, it was a guest crown prosecutor who surprised students with a detailed treatise on exactly what goes into uppers like ecstasy, acid, and other laboratory manufactured drugs. He spoke of the contaminated backyard stills where drugs are mixed and cut with various substances in an environment that is a far cry from the sterile surroundings where legal pharmaceuticals are made. He concluded if drug users could see and smell these garage factories they would not be so keen to ingest the finished products. We must be honest with ourselves and our young Australians. There must be a certain degree of acceptance in this battle. Drugs are part of our community, like it or not. So let us teach our young people not merely that drugs. are bad but that drugs can interfere with achieving long-term goals and can bring about future health problems. We should respond to the calls from students in my electorate with a two-pronged attack. Firstly, we must prove to young Australians that drugs are uncoo!. Secondly, we must educate our youth and allow them to make informed decisions as mature, young adults. If we do not respond, then Anna Wood will be just one of many young people in our society who, after making a flippant and ill informed decision, ended their lives in a manner which allowed them no opportunity to say, 'This was a dumb idea after all.' Question resolved in the affirmative.

The other aspect was to a responsible approach to firearm ownership. responsible approach should be able to continue of the firearms in a responsible and legitimate way. When we saw the drama of Port Arthur, it was a terrible tragedy. But what it did do with responsible people, was to cast a question own firearms. Yet when you look at the safety particular at the safety record of gun clubs, carried on their sport in a very responsible recognise that legitimate shooting is a sport internationally. Australia was very well served Games. There were two gold medals-one to a bronze to Desiree Huddleston. All of them in a way that made Australia proud.

It is important that what we see the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and strongly states-and, I must also acknowledge, by the terms, has been something very beneficial for of my colleague and good friend the member the nonsense of some of the things that were particularly any suggestion that this move disarm the civilian population of Australia. has had a keen interest in firearms ownership for 30 years.

At the same time, we should continue to that is pursued not only within Australia but by three medallists at the recent Olympic Russell Mark and one to Michael Diamond-and achieved the pinnacle of their sport and did it reason for farmers to continue to have firearms, pigs, rabbits, but also, at times, to deal with say.

Then we go to Western Australia, 4.3 per Wales, 3.6 per cent, and the ACT, 2.4 per cent. What I wanted to highlight from that is highest rate of handing in and the lowest rate like New South Wales. The concern I raise ownership of guns varies so significantly between as to whether states, such as Victoria and South rates of hand in, where there has been firearm rate of handing in than has occurred in those until now. I believe that this is a matter that up again with the police ministers, The other point that has come through very much a regional issue.

It raises very serious questions Australia, and the others that have had high registration for some years, have had a higher states that have not had firearms registration up the Attorney-General would probably like to take and I will come back to that in a minute. loudly and clearly is that gun ownership is very living in country areas have a much higher the city, and probably for very understandable lobby, most of whom seem to sit smugly in city their unctuous branding of all firearm owners sometimes and suggest that they must have some background of many of these critics, their NA 9002 unprofessional and distorted outbursts seem seeking a balanced public debate or trying to and complicated issue.

Department of Social Security Teleservice Centre Staff: Western Australia (Question No. 2066) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) Further to the Minister's answer to question No 1625 (Hansard, 27 May 1997, page 4197), how that many finalised calls were logged at each of the Bunbury and Perth Teleservice centres for the months of (a) April, (b) May and (c) June 1997. (2) What was the average period taken to answer calls referred to in part (1). (3) Does the Government have data or estimates on the number of clients who were unable to get through to the service on the occasions when the teleservice centres in Perth and Bunbury were overloaded. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question. Bodies (1) The number of finalised calls logged at Bunbury was: April 1997-25,377; May 199725,928; June 1997-24,114. The number of finalised calls logged at Perth was: April 1997-71,378; May 1997-90,020; June 1997-84,670.

(2) Will the planning and environmental impact process for the fourth runway be concluded by the time the sale is completed. (3) What precisely will be offered for sale. (4) Will any prospective owner be contractually bound to address noise problems associated with the airport. Mr Fahey-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. Neither the Government nor the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) is planning the construction of a fourth runway at Jandakot Airport at this time. (2) A draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was prepared in 1992 in connection with the FAC's Proposed Additional Developments at  future aviation and non-aviation development initiatives for the Airport, including construction of a fourth runway from about the year 2010 should future demand warrant such investment. Following release of the draft EIS, the then Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency (now Environment Australia) requested that further studies be carried out in relation to aircraft noise around Jandakot  to the draft EIS following completion of the Jandakot Airport Noise Study which is currently underway.

(4) The Government does not anticipate binding the new owner through a specific contractual clause to address noise problems. The new owner will be required to observe all laws that apply to the Airport (be they Commonwealth, State or municipal laws). In this context, the Commonwealth will require the new owner to obtain and maintain the necessary licences and approvals to operate the aerodrome and ensure that all air traffic and navigation service obligations are met in accordance with applicable legislation and regulations (including Air Services Regulations). Job Seeker Allowance (Question No. 2112) Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) What social security entitlements does an unemployed person have who sets up as a sole trader and is then seeking work on his or her own account. (2) If such a sole trader is able to provide work for another person, is he or she entitled to a job seeker's allowance. (3) Is it an anomaly that job seeker allowance is not available to help the creation of a trading entity or small business that provides work for other unemployed persons. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) To be eligible for Newstart Allowance a customer must firstly be unemployed. A person who is substantially involved in running a business would not normally be regarded as unemployed. An exception to this is where the business is on a small scale and designed to be a supplement rather than an alternative to wages and is compatible with taking a full-time job. Where it is determined that a person is unemployed for the purpose of meeting the eligibility requirements for Newstart Allowance, they must also satisfy a set of requirements known as the activity test. A major requirement of the activity test is that a person must be actively searching for and willing to undertake any suitable paid work. A self-employed person generally must meet this job search requirement, including not refusing an offer of employment because it interferes with their business. Sub-contractors or other self-employed people, who hire themselves and/or their plant or equipment out for particular jobs, may be regarded as unemployed when out of work but they too must meet the above tests. In certain circumstances, the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) may approve the development of self employment opportunities as an activity which satisfies activity test requirements and Newstart Allowance can be paid. (2) The provision of work for another person would not in itself disqualify a person from receiving Newstart Allowance. However, it is unlikely that a sole trader in these circumstances would be considered to be unemployed or be able to satisfy the activity test requirements. If, for example, a sub-contractor obtains some casual work, he or she would not be disqualified from payment on the basis that they employed another person. Where the work was of a casual nature, they would be treated in a similar manner to other casual workers and would generally remain qualified for payment, subject to the income test. Self-employed people earning income may receive reduced payments or no payments at all. (3) Newstart Allowance provides income support to unemployed people who are looking for work or who are engaged in other labour market related activities. There is no anomaly in denying an unemployment payment to someone who is not unemployed. People who have been on Newstart Allowance for at least 6 months can undertake self employment development (SED) as part of their activity agreement. SED can be approved as part of a person's activity agreement where the CES is satisfied that the business will be commercially viable within 12 months of commencement and it is likely to provide the person with full-time employment at a level of income at least equivalent to the rate of Newstart Allowance. The approval is intended to be for the developmental stage only and it is expected that once the business commences, income support will cease and healthy, fair competition will prevail. In addition, the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NElS), administered by the CES, provides income support for up to 12 months to people setting up and running businesses, as well as training in business management. Commonwealth Serum Laboratories: Experiments (Question No. 2147) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 26 August 1997: (1) Has his attention been drawn to articles on pages AI, A4 and A15 in The Age of 11 June 1997 concerning experiments conducted by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories upon children in orphanages. (2) Were experiments conducted upon children who were child migrants under the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act; if so, (a) in which institutions were experiments conducted, (b) was the permission of the guardian of the child migrant sought; if so, (i) when was permission granted, (ii) for which children and (iii) for what institutions and (c) was there danger to the health and safety of child migrants living in orphanages and institutions of contracting infectious or contagious diseases without inoculation or injection.",187
234,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,TABLE OF BUSIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) No information on whether the children involved in the research were child migrants is contained in the relevant research articles and I am unable to assist the honourable member with this inquiry. (a) Some research was conducted in the Saint Joseph's Foundling Hospital (formerly known as the Broadmeadows Home). In another research paper, nursing staff of the Berry Street Foundling Hospital, the Presbyterian Babies' Home and Saint Gabriel's Babies' Home are acknowledged, therefore it can be assumed research was. conducted in these institutions. In a number of articles, the childrens' or babies' home or orphanage was not specified. Not all participants in the studies were recruited from such institutions. (b) The research articles do not mention issues relating to consent. (b) (i) There is inadequate information to answer this question. (b) (ii) It is assumed that children in each study would have been treated equally with regard to consent issues, regardless of their migrant status, however, there is inadequate information to answer this question.

Private Health Insurance Coverage: Electoral Division of Chisholm (Question No. 2215) Mr Griffin asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 22 September 1997: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a report in the Waverley Gazette on 8 July 1997 in which he is reported to have referred to the rate of private health insurance in the electoral division of Chisholm. (2) If so, what was the source of the data and how was it collected. (3) What are the private health insurance coverage rates for all federal Victorian electoral divisions. (4) How does the rate of health insurance purportedly quoted by him compare with the rate children involved in the years since 1994.",189
235,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,TABLE OF BUSIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question as follows: (1) No. (2) See question 1. (3) As far as I know, this data is not kept. Any data I have for my own electorate is obtained privately. (4) This question assumes that the research data to which he refers is a time series. I can see nothing to justify this assumption.",190
