AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 2000 Second Reading to speak on the A New Tax System (Family This bill forms part of the government's overall going to interact with the GST, family payments going to get. That leads me, quite clearly, to The family is the backbone, the centre, of is that unit in our society which really holds us us going, and it is the part that the government be able to deliver something positive. This is is no way in the world that there is anything into assist the family or to somehow compensate or impost that the GST will have on families. society. What was previously seen as the nuare finding that more people are choosing to variety of reasons why that is the case. But it is many people deciding to have three or more chilonly one child or to have no children at all. is becoming a childless society. I think part of struggling and finding it more difficult to make is actually a huge burden. There is not just NA 15350 the financial burden; there are all sorts of friendly-they are very much antifamily. If we is a whole raft of antifamily policies. Every family policies of this government. If we have a look at the GST to start with, sumption. Who consumes more? Is it the upwardly unit in the North Shore of Sydney, or is it disposable income? Who actually consumes family. The family with two or three children less opportunity for work because they have time. They are the ones who have bigger costs actually carry the burden for the high income But it goes much further and much deeper than and the problems associated with the GST does GST impact on education? We are all told not think it is GST free at all. I think education have a look at that in a minute. If we look at health cost? Is it the single person living in family. They are the ones that have to take the being forced, through legislation, to have to that this government's policies are all antifamily, single area you turn to, every place you look family. In particular, the A New Tax System 2000 that is before the House I think we need to take a new approach. It looked very carefully at what government policy approach, an approach that says, ‘We support ric, but we will do it through our policies. will give you family assistance that means something. to work, then you actually have an incentive That is what this policy is about-disincentives I talk to people all the time who come to out and do a little bit more, but if I go out and little bit extra, the government slugs me. Not through family assistance.' So it is always country, we are about to see the triple whammy slugged on tax, not only are they going to be be slugged with the GST as well. On 1 July will also carry the new burden in this country families. It will be low and middle income families be a burden on the people earning $50,000, They are going to be better off. So if they to be carrying the burden for this country in a new century? That is quite easy to answer-it bill and this government's policies are antifamily, where I look I see only antifamily policies. The government also talks a lot about what of literacy and a whole heap of things, but back to families through early intervention do not see too much money going to early MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 5 April 2000 other burdens.

When I talk say that my wife and I are mad and that we are in that everyone else is having only one child. when you cannot afford it as one of you would with one working parent is finding it more and this bill? Nowhere. It is nowhere at all, because a family to either stay a family or become discourages people having children.
