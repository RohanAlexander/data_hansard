16,Mr MASSYGREENE,THE TARIF F AN D THE BOAR D OF,"I think that the honourable member is in error in saying that the increased prices are due to the wholesale export of hides and leather. statistics show that the average export of hides during the last three months has not been anything like the pre-war average, and that the leather exports during the same period were somewhere ahout the pre-war level.",23

22,Mr SPEAKER,THE TARIF F AN D THE BOAR D OF,"I trust that honourable members will not persist in the practice of asking frivolous questions.

25,Mr SAMPSON,HEALTHPOWERS OF,"On 31st July, and again yesterday, I asked the Acting Leader of the Government whether the Cabinet and the Wheat Board had taken into consideration the necessity of increasing the local price of wheat, having regard to the higher price obtained at recent sales in the London market? The honourable gentleman was not ahle then to state whether it was intended to bring the local price up to the standard of the London parity. I ask now whether a decision has been arrived at?",23

32,Mr GREGORY,HEALTHPOWERS OF,Yesterday I asked the Minister for Trade and Customs a question regarding a circulaT-letter that was being sent to honourable members respecting Cooper's sheep dip. I desire to letter repeat that question today.,24
33,Mr MASSYGREENE,HEALTHPOWERS OF,"As I desire to make a full statement of the position, I ask the passed, leave of the House to do so-(Leave of granted). On the 26th June last I made a statement regarding the embargo that had been placed on the importation of sheep dip. In the course of that statement. I said that "" for some time the Australasian general manager of Messrs. Cooper and Nephews was in communication with Messrs. A. Victor Leggo and Company,"" with a view to the latter firm manufacturing dip in Australia under 'Cooper's' label."" I understand that Messrs. Cooper and Nephews have in a circular letter repeated some statements they made to me in a letter which they addressed to me on the 15th July last. con- In that letter they quoted the statement which I have just read, and then went on to sayI would respectfully inform you that Messrs. A. Victor Leggo and Company were never approached by me, or any representative of my firm, to manufacture sheep dip under Cooper's label. In June, 1918, I interviewed Mr Leggo with quite a different object, and as at that time neither I nor any member of the Cooper organization had ever seen a packet of the sheep dip produced by Messrs. Leggo and Company, nor liad we ever heard of a single instance of it being used, we were not in a position to form any opinion of the merits of that article or the qualifications of Messrs. Leggo and Company as dip manufacturers. As the statement quoted above is incorrect, and is likely to detrimentally affect the interests of my firm, I am compelled to send you this correction, which would have reached you earlier had I not been indisposed. The Acting Controller replied to that letter in this wayWith reference to your letter of the 15th ultimo, relative to the statement made by the Minister in the House of Representatives on the 20th June, as to the general manager of your company having been in communication with Messrs. A. Victor Leggo and Company, with a view to the latter firm manufacturing dip in Australia under Cooper's label, I am directed by Mr Massy Greene that he has made further inquiries into the matter, the result of these being to confirm his previous impressions. Regarding your statement, "" in June, 1918, I interviewed Mr Leggo with quite a different object,"" the Minister would be glad if you would kindly indicate the nature of the subject which was discussed on that occasion. To this I received the following reply:We beg to acknowledge the receipt of your of the 7th instant, addressed to our manager at Sydney, and to say that the evidence in our possession, put on record at the time, and our full knowledge of all that distinctly confirmed the correctness of the statements contained in his letter to you the 15th July. In answer to the last paragraph in your letter, the subject discussed upon the occasion in question was the possibility of obtaining supplies of arsenic for manufacturing by us of dip in Australia. Messrs. A. Victor Leggo and approached, because it was reported to us they liad control of such supplies, and Sir John Higgins had stated that it was part of an arrangement with Messrs. Leggo they should supply arsenic to other dip facturers at a reasonable price. The idea of any other than facturing dip in Australia under Cooper's label "" has never been in our minds, and we Mr MCDONALD assert most emphatically that it has never been at any time anywhere spoken of or cussed, either amongst ourselves, or by us, by any one on our behalf, with Messrs. Leggo and Company, or with any one else. That is a pretty emphatic statement from Messrs. Cooper and Nephews. propose now to give to the House the grounds upon which I made that statein ment. These are contained in the papers Nephews, of a dip under which have already heen tabled, and label. which, consequently, were open to every honourable member of the House and to ing the press. I am going to read f r o record which was kept by A . Victor Leggo and Company of the whole of these negotiations, copies of which I have on the departmental file. I will support before those records with the original documents, which are in the possession of Messrs. A . Victor Leggo and Company. first record to which I want to draw the attention of the House is contained in the file, ancl is the account of an interview prices. between Messrs. A . Victor Leggo and Company and Messrs. Cooper and Nephews, on the 28th May. I will not read despatched the whole of it , because it but it is a brief account of that interview, occupying several hours, in likely accept. which the whole of this matter was disTo cussed between those two gentlemen. desire to draw the attention of honourable members to one paragraph in it only. This is Mr Leggo writin g",24
34,Mr MCDONALD,HEALTHPOWERS OF,A r e these shorthand notes ?,25
35,Mr MASSYGREENE,HEALTHPOWERS OF,No ; these are Mr Leggo's own records in his own office the conversation which passed between those two gentlemen. That is all i ports to be.,25
36,Mr MAXWELL,HEALTHPOWERS OF,Who represented Cooper?,25
37,Mr MASSYGREENE,HEALTHPOWERS OF,"The general manager in Australia, Mr Harrowell. Mr Leggo, in writing, saidIf I agree to his-that is, Mr Harrowellcabling, then he is prepared to show me reply he gets, and will act quite openly the me in the whole matter and show me all cables he receives, and also confer with me and agree Company were on all cables he sends. that That was the basis of the negotiationsbecause that these two gentlemen should show that each other all the documents which manupassed, the cables that were sent to England, and the cables that were reourselves "" manuceived from there. - In relation to what?",25
38,Mr MASSYGREENE,HEALTHPOWERS OF,"In relation to the disnegotiations which were proceeding beor tween these two gentlemen for the manufacture of dip in Australia. I shall be able to show quite clearly from the cables which did pass that their subject-matter I was the manufacture in Australia, by Messrs. A . Victor Leggo and Company, conjunction with Messrs. Cooper and Cooper's The first cable which was despatched, and which marked the openof the negotiations, was very explicit. m the It was drawn up in Messrs. Leggo and Company's office, and I have a copy of it on their own file. It readsLeggo's willing consider proposal from you they further extend their organization. They have undertaken manufacture GOO cases weekly and supply arsenic other firms complete Australian requirements. Their present The output is 400 cases. If considered advisable, cable me proposal immediately, otherwise too late. Leggo's could supply us arsenic market In reply, the following cable from Messrs. Cooper and Nephews, in England, was to Messrs. Cooper and is lengthy, Nephewsi n Melbourne:Cable indications nature proposal Leggo show the absolute genuineness of that I cable, I have here the original flimsy, which, as every honourable member knows, accompanies each cable message. The next cable which Mr Harrowell agreed with Messrs. A . Victor Leggo and Company to send, reads:. Leggo's would consider proposal utilize of plant materials manufacture Cooper instead Vallo or consider some form of partnership. t purThat is probably the most important cable of the group, and I hold in my hand the original d r a ft of it , which was made in Messrs. A . Victor Leggo and Company's own office. The important thing about it is that this Tough copy in pencil is, I am informed, in Mr Harrowell's - own handwriting. I helieve that it is, the because, after comparing the copy with with his signature, there is every evidence of it. I have also a further record of an interview which took place between Mr . Harrowell, the Australian manager of Messrs. Will i a m Cooper and Nephews and Mr Victor Leggo. It is dated 5th June, and reads:Mr Harrowellcalled, and said he had been giving a lot of thought to this matter and he could see no reason why they should not come to terms on a partnership basis. A. Victor Leggo and Company could do all the manufacturing for the partnership in Australia, and after allowing for its costs on a fair basis, the profits could be equally divided between the two firms. This would suit A. Victor Leggo and Company very well, as they would have the benefit of the Cooper name and selling organization, whilst it would suit Cooper's, who would have an immediate and plentiful supply of dip, and would avoid the expense of having to erect a factory here. Harrowell's opinion is that the partnership would easily command SO per cent, or more of' the Australian trade, and by working together the costs of distributing, selling, advertising, &c, would be much cut down, and the whole arrangements would be more satisfactory to both firms than fighting each other on a cutting competition. The record goes on to sayOn discussing what name we sliould call the dip, Harrowell suggested that we could not do butter than stick to tlicname, "" Coopers,"" as it had been established now over seventy years, and was recognised world-over as the leading dip; in fact, the use of their name would be one of the chief advantages of the partnership. I pointed out that we had now already put it out as "" Vallo,"" and made broadcast announcements that we were putting our dip out in that name, and I thought it would perhaps be well if we called it "" Cooper-Vallo "" dip, and announced quite frankly that the two firms hud joined forces in the Australian trade. He said he did not think this need stand in the way, but he thought his people would want to stick to their own name for it. I now desire to refer to one or two other cables which passed, and which appear on the file, and thereafter I shall not detain the House for more than a moment or two. In reply to the cable which I have just read, and which, I believe, was written by Mr Harrowell himself, Coopers cabled to their general manager in AustraliaRequire general description of Leggo's plant and what is tlic present actual capacity enable us to decide adaptability of process. In answer to that communication, the following cable was despatched:Leggo's have own arsenic mines and refineries; also plant manufacturing all arsenic salts and products, including arsenate sulphide, sufficient 100 tons dip weekly. Present blending plant capacity 20 tons, increasing to 40. Ilr. Greene. These are all the cables which it is necessary for me to read. They show very clearly that Messrs. Leggo and Company's statement that they were in active negotiations with the general manager of Messrs. Cooper and Nephews in Australia is absolutely correct. They prove that Messrs. Cooper and Nephews did enter into negotiations with a view to using Messrs. Leggo and Company's organization and plant, and that the latter firm was to manufacture Cooper's dip in Australia. There is only one other matter to which I desire to refer, because, to my mind, it absolutely clinches the statement which I made, and the accuracy of which Messrs. Cooper and Nephews now deny. On the 4th July, last year, in answer to a letter which was written by Messrs. Cooper and Nephews in regard to another matter, Messrs. A . Victor Leggo and Company sayWas it not for this reason that you (that is Mr Harrowell, of Coopers), approached us with a vicw to inducing to manufacture dip under "" Cooper's"" label. That deliberate statement is made in the letter sent by Victor Leggo and Company to the representative of Cooper's in Australia, and to that communication they have received no reply.",25
39,Mr RODGERS,HEALTHPOWERS OF,This is a very serious matter. Every user of Cooper's dip will be concerned as to the business morality pf the firm.,26
40,Mr MASSYGREENE,HEALTHPOWERS OF,I am simply quoting from the records. Victor Leggo and Company wrote to Cooper's representative and received no reply. That is all I have to say on the subject. Later :,26
41,Mr FLEMING,HEALTHPOWERS OF,"Is it a fact that Willia m Cooper and Nephews, during the negotiations with Victor Leggo and Company, or subsequently when the negotiations had fallen through, exported dip from England to Australia, contrary to the regulations then in existence?",26
42,Mr MASSYGREENE,HEALTHPOWERS OF,"During the war arrangements were made, which we thought sufficiently drastic, to prevent shipping space from Great Britain being taken up with sheep dip. At that time priority was given to certain cargo, and we advised the British Ministry from time to time as to the goods which were to take arsenite, priority of despatch to Australia. I am not personally acquainted with the actual details of the matter, but I understand that, notwithstanding the urgent request of the Commonwealth Government that other commodities should take priority over sheep dip, once we had established the local manufacture of it , sheep di p continued to come to Australia.",26
43,Mr RODGERS,HEALTHPOWERS OF,I wish to ask a question of the Minister for Trade and Customs with reference to the extracts from the cables and memoranda he has just read to the House.,27
44,Mr SPEAKER,HEALTHPOWERS OF, It is not in order to found a question upon a statement made by leave of the House.,27
45,Mr RODGERS,HEALTHPOWERS OF,"Ver y well. Then I shall ask the Minister for Trade and Customs if he will be good enough to lay on the table of the House the whole of the file, in order that honourable members may inform themselves upon the very questionable tactics Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! I must ask the honourable the Minister not to reply to the-honourable member's question. As I have already pointed out that it is out of order to found a question upon a statement made by leave of the House, any answer upon such a question would he equally out of order. Such a practice would inevitably develop an irregular dedate on a matter not before the House on a specific motion. LIVERPOOL CAMP.",27
46,Mr RILEY,HEALTHPOWERS OF,"Does the Defence Department intend to allow the iron and other building material at the Liverpool Camp to remain where it is and Tot, or is it proposed to submit it for sale ?",27
47,Mr WISE,HEALTHPOWERS OF,"I do not know, but I shall make inquiries and let the honourable member know the result. QUARANTINE STATION, NORTH SYDNEY.",27
48,Mr ORCHARD,HEALTHPOWERS OF,"Some months ago I introduced to the Minister for Trade and Customs a deputation of residents of North Sydney with reference to the removal of the present quarantine station at North Sydney, and the Minister's reply was that the Department was obtaining a report as to the suitability of Port Stephens as a site for a quai'antine station. Can the Minister say whether that report has been received ?",27
49,Mr MASSYGREENE,HEALTHPOWERS OF,The report has not yet been received. The investigations which are being made are of a very comprehensive nature. PARLIAMENT HOUSE RESERVE.,27
50,Dr MALONEY,HEALTHPOWERS OF,"Will you, Mr . Speaker, or some Minister, arrange to have gardeners employed upon that little piece of enclosed land to the north of Parliament House, which is at present a disgrace to the city of Melbourne, in order to convert it into a playground for children ? There is no other public garden in Melbourne in such a contemptible condition of neglect.",27
51,Mr SPEAKER,HEALTHPOWERS OF," The matter comes under the Joint Houses Committee, of which the President of the Senate (Senator Givens) is Chairman. He has made certain representations to the Victorian Government, with a view to beautifying the piece of ground referred to and utilizing it to some better purpose, but I understand they have not seen f it to adopt his suggestion.

53,Mr GROOM,HEALTHPOWERS OF,I am informed by the Minister who has control of science and industry that no such proposal has been put forward. COMPULSORY DRILLS .,27
54,Mr FENTON,HEALTHPOWERS OF,Seeing that mothers are complaining about the serious expense they are obliged to incur through their children wearing out boots and clothes in attending compulsory drillsthe Department do not provide uniforms - will the Minister say whether there is any possibility of their obtaining relief in the matter ?,27
55,Mr WISE,HEALTHPOWERS OF,"We have had no complaints on the subject so far, but if the honourable member will submit individual cases I shall make inquiries. NAVAX DEFENCE.

(Mr Hughes) and the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) return. As matter of fact, it did not come into my hands until last week, and as there are four volumes of it , covering a great many activities in connection with land preparations for naval defence, it necessarily require a great deal of sideration on the part of the Government before they can come to a decision as what action they will take.

61,Mr WEBSTER,HEALTHPOWERS OF,"It must he obvious to honourable members that, as cities and towns developed, letter pillars were placed according to the grouping of population.

I do not think that any good purpose will be served hy it . Great B r it a in and the United States of America today are trading with Germany, and through such channels much of our produce is finding its way into that country. It is because of this trade that the prices of many of our commodities have been seriously increased. It would seem that, while the Government is going to trade with Germany, it will not allow Germans clos? to come into this country. I do not suppose that any honourable member is as free from German influence as I am. I cannot say that I know of any Germans or descendants of Germans in my electorate.",31
86,Mr FLEMING,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,I wish there were more electorates in the same position.,31
87,Mr TUDOR,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"When the Commerce Bill was before this House, in 1907-S, I endeavoured to secure the insertion of a clause providing that the country of origin should be stamped on all goods and packages in letters of the same size as those used for other markings. A number of warehousemen then urged that it would he absurd to insist upon that requirement, and pointed out that we were doing a very large trade with Germany. I have always opposed the importation of German goods to Australia; but it would seem that some honourable members opposite, while quite prepared to allow goods of German origin to enter this country, are ready to vote against people of German origin coming in . Under this Bill the Minister will still have power to allow German agents and tourists to come in, and no doubt they will come here and do business. PAPERS.",31
88,Mr FLEMING,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"Will the honourable member say how it would be possible to prevent the trade of which he speaks? Mr TUDOR . ^ I admit that it is practically impossible. Now that Great Britain and the United States of America, which offer the largest markets for our products, have agreed to trade with Germany, there is nothing to prevent Australian goods reaching that country. The statistics show that during the war large quantities' of Australian productions, including metals, leather, and hides, were shipped to countries near Germany. I am confident that a lot of them found their way into Germany, and that some of our Australian leather and hides were used for the manufacture of goods for German soldiers. I said last night that this was a piece of political hypocrisy-that , so far as this measure was concerned, the Government were political hypocrites.",31
89,The CHAIRMAN,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E, The honourable member is not in order in using that expression.,32

91,Mr TUDOR,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"But it is admitted that we cannot prevent this trade going on, and I regard the proposal to exclude Germans as a piece of political camouflage. The Government are proposing to do something which they know they cannot do. I am as much opposed to these people as is any one; but, seeing that we are practically shaking hands with them,so far as trade relations are concerned, I do not think that any good object would be served by legislating to exclude them. We are practically saying to Germany, "" ""We will not allow your people to enter our country to compete with our workmen, but you will still be at liberty to send into Australia the products of German factories to compete with those manufactured hy our own people.""

98,Mr GLYNN,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) [3.38] - The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) is really asking me to give a legal opinion. As a matter of administration, we must regard this provision as taking effect from the time it is assented to. The power of exemption is sometimes, applied to cases of persons who were wrongly brought in , but whom it would be undesirable to send away at that particular time. What is done is that a bond is taken from the ship-owners or from the person they have lef t here, to secure them against any possible obligation to take him away. As a matter of fact, after the exemption is issued, there is no obligation, under the Act as it stands, on the owners of the vessel to take away the person at their expense. The clause applies to men who ought not to have been brought in , because they would be prohibited immigrants.",33
99,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,Will the sure apply to any one who came in before it was assented to?,33
100,Mr GLYNN,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"As a matter of fact, in . administration it will not. The administration will be from the date of the passing of the Bill . There will not be many cases covered by this provision.",33
101,Mr TUDOR,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"If a man has been here for two years and nine months, can you compel the ship-owners to take him out of Australia ? .",33
102,Mr GLYNN,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"My feeling cannot, although I cannot give an absolute opinion. There is no obligation the ship-owner to take him away. This provision creates an obligation, and, therefore, it must be regarded as a future .one. I believe that is the proper interaway pretation of the clause. In any case, that will be the line of administration, so that no in j u ry can possibly result. The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) asked a question about international relations. We canmerits, not compel a nation of which a man a citizen to take him in , but nations bound by international comity, if not treaties, to accept him. Some treaties has a right to object. exist under which deported persons must be taken hy particular countries. Fugitive offenders are dealt with under the specific terms of a treaty - If the treaty is not fulfilled there is a breach of international obligations, which can be enforced only by 'morality, or, unfortunately, as in the past, by the sword. In .future these obligations will be incident to the League of Nations to a great extent. Every civilized nation regards it self as under an obligation to take back deported persons of its nationality or its citizens. Difficulties may arise sometimes as to whether we can deport to a particular place or not - There have been difficulties even with the United States of Amercia, and this measure has been to some extent affected by the fact.",33
103,Mr TUDOR,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,Was that Freeman's case?,33
104,Mr GLYNN,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"That case .may have raised a difficulty abo, but as a Minister, it being a Defence matter, I do not know much about - it . Cases have come under my knowledge of men who are about to be, or have been, deported from another country, and the question arises whether they can remain here or not. I have to decide those cases on mea- grounds of nationality and citizenshipthat is, whether this is the country from which they really went, and to.which they should he permitted, or not permitted, to return. The only obligation is one dependent on the ordinary rules that apply between nations.",33

106,Mr GLYNN,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"We have an absolute on right of refusal, except against persons whose domicile is here. The question arises .whether the person deported is really a citizen of this country. If he were sent three or four months ago from Australia, and then deported from America, the question would arise whether we should allow him back or not. Every one of these cases must be decided on its but the general principle - applying was between nations is that where a nation are deports its own citizens to another counby try, and that' country at once objects, it That, however, is not a legal right, but a right depending upon the practice of international relationship.",33
107,Mr FENTON,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,How is he to get hack to his own country?,34
108,Mr GLYNN,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,That depends on his own country. Obligations between nations are not enforceable by judicial procedure. They are dependent upon the 'practice of nations or upon treaties.,34
109,Mr TUDOR,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"Yarra) [3.46] - The amendment made by the clause will not read with the proviso in the principal Act which it amends.

I do not intend to labour the point which I desire to make in connection with this amendment. It is a very obvious one. As the clause stands, any convicted criminal, even though he may have been convicted of a shameful offence, will be absolutely immune from deportation if he succeeds in evading the operation of the law for three years. Thus a person who has been three years and one month in the country, even . though he is a convicted criminal of the worse type, will escape deportation.",35

126,Mr MAXWELL,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,The Minister merely cites the individual to appear before the Board. - Sir ROBERT BEST - The honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) is absolutely misrepresenting the provisions of the Bill.,35

If the amendment he carried, and the Minister is satisfied that a' person not born in Australia has heen guilty of certain offences, he may summon him to appear before a Board to show cause why he should not be deported. Thus a man may have been resident in Australia-as I have beenfor thirty years and then suffer deportation.

177,Mr GLYNN,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) [4.29] - The honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler) has moved to amend the clause by striking out the time l i m it of three years within which the power to deport may be exercised. Under the existing Act there is power, without regard to time, to deport in the case of an absolute evasion ""of the Act. Section7 provides that every prohibited immigrant.entering or found within the Commonwealth in contravention or evacannot. sion of the Act shall be liable, on convicmember tion, to be sentenced to six months' prisonment, and to be deported, but power of deportation is conditioned by the Department's ability to prove that person was a prohibited immigrant he arrived in Australia or had become one under the Act. A time l i m it five years is prescribed by the American Act of 1917, but it is subject to a conwhole dition similar to that in section 7 of the Commonwealth Act, namely, that the Dearguments partment can prove that at the time a person entered the United States of Glynn) America he evaded, or was in the country in contravention of, the Act, so that existing Act actually gives wider scope for deportation in the case of a person who has evaded the Act. As a matter of fact, the American .Act deals only w i the deportation of aliens. Our Act gives power to deport persons who came f r the United Kingdom, hut the American c, Act refers to aliens, because all persons born outside the United States are garded as aliens, that country having no Dominions such as those of the British Empire. The American provisions, therefore, though they allow a period of five years, apply in stances different from those in this country, and our Act ' gives wider power to deal with persons who [28 AUGUST, 1919.] Bill. 12073 NOES. have evaded the Act, and who are prohibited immigrants within the meaning of the Act. The clause means that, without necessarily proving that a person was an anarchist when he entered, he can be deported if he is found within three years of his arrival to he acting in contravenhonorable tion of. the law. The reason why the the limi t of three years is provided is that this there must be some reasonable period has within which we.assume that a man has developed within Australia into a person prohibited by our Immigration Act. If it can be proved that at the time of entering he did evade the Act, and was, in fact, a prohibited immigrant, he can be arrested and deported at any time; but if that cannot be proved, but proof is available that within three years of his a r r i v a l. he became one of the persons specified by clause 7, he may he deported. I ask the honourable member for Perth not to press his amendment.",39
178,Mr CHARLTON,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"Hunter) [ 4 . 3 3 ] - I understand what the honourable for Perth (Mr Fowler) dei m - sires to achieve by the amendment. that If the limitation of three years is struck out, the clause will then read the that at any time, regardless of how when many years a person may have heen resident in the country, he will be liable of to deportation if he does anything in contravention of the immigration law. The clause is repugnant to me, because I see no necessity for it . One of the best in . support of its elimination is the statement by the Minister (Mr . that the existing Act gives power to deport. persons who are convicted of our certain offences. Having that power to punish persons for these offences, why should'we now make an additional law to provide for their deportation ? An y th man who offends against the Immigration Act must pay the penalty prescribed. I o m do not know what is meant by paragraph which refers to a person .who, with in three years after his arrival in Australia, re- ""has become an inmate of an insane asylum or public charitable institution."" If that paragraph is ""agreed to any person who was not in Australia at the time this law was passed, but who with in three circiunyears of his arrival becomes an inmate of an insane asylum or public charitable a institution, may be deported if the Board so directs. It is a bad enough misfortune for a man to become insane, but to make him liable, in addition, to be deported and separated from his friends, seems to me to be most unreasonable.",39
179,Sir ROBERT BEST,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,He would have left his friends and relatives to come out here.,40
180,Mr CHARLTON,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"But , if .this amendment were agreed to, action could be taken against such a person at any time. After living here for ten or twenty years, a man might lose his reason, or, owing to a series of misfortunes, might become an inmate of a charitable institution. Under this amendment, such a person could be deported on the recommendation of the Board, although probably he had relatives and family ties here. I said last night that in proposing legislation.of this kind we seemed to be suffering from shell-shock. This is certainly panic legislation, and quite unreasonable. Under paragraph a of this proposed new section, any person who has been convicted in Australia of a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment for one year or longer may he called upon to show oauso why he should not be deported. We can all carry hack our minds to industrial troubles in connection with which much feeling has heen aroused, and which have led to men making statements in the heat of the moment which have resulted in their imprisonment for twelve months or more. I can recollect cases in my own district where, because of much public excitement caused by certain troubles, the military were sent to the mines. Their - appearance in the district served only to intensify the feeling, and led to - certain men making statements which brought them under the law of conspiracy. Ordinarily, they were excellent citizens, hut in a moment of excitement they made statements which led to their prosecution and to their imprisonment to' a year or more. Such men, if this amendment were agreed to, might at any time he called upon to appear before this . Board to show cause why they should not be ' deported. Imagine the Board solemnly recommending the deportation of such men after they had heen living in the Commonwealth for ten or - twenty years. They are good citizens-hard working, men-but , because of a dispute w.bh their employers leading: to much feeling, they might, in the circumstances I have named, he recommended for deportation; Are we going to place people in that position?",40
181,Mr FOWLER,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,Would the Board have r no common sense?,40
182,Mr CHARLTON,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"I regret to say that common sense very often, forsakes those who have to adjudicate upon such matters. Men are often unconsciously biased. Many persons, called upon to adjudicate in cases of the kind to which I have referred honestly helieve that they are doing the right thing in inflicting severe punishment, whereas others, who are free from all prejudice and are ahle to reason out the matter dispassionately, take an entirely different view. This is panic legislation for which there is no cause, and in the near future it may have a boomerang effect. It goes beyond the bounds of reason. Surely in these enlightened days it is unnecessary to pass legislation the only effect of which will be to create dissension. A measure of this kind will produce not harmony, but turmoil, in the community. If , as the result of industrial trouble, men, because of statements made in a moment of excitement are .sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment, and are thenrecommended for deportation, we shall have the country up in arms. In moments of agitation,' common sense often flies to the wind. This is an 'abnormal production. It is because of the happenings of the last two years, which have affected our mental calibre, that it is brought forward.",40
183,Mr BAYLEY,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,The Congress of the United States of America has legislated - on similar lines in the absence of any such crisis.,40

Was it not because of the freedom and liberty they enjoyed here? Was it not because of their life-long environment? Was. it not because of their trade unions?- All these things contributed to make the Australian soldier stand out as one of the superior men of the world. Are we to follow in the footsteps of nations that in this respect cannot compare with us ? My advice is that we should give our people as much freedom as possible. Let us-pass wise laws, and punish those who violate them; but, in the name of all that is good, do not let us pass coercive legislation, - which, if put into operation, will lead to much hardship. 'Under this amendment, married men who have lived here for years might be deported and separated from their wives and children unless they chose to accompany them. While in one respect I .think the Bill is. desirable, I yet believe that, on the whole, it is right up against Democracy - and the best in terests of Australia. a Sir ROBERT BEST (Kooyoug) . 4.5] - I appeal to the honourable t for Perth (Mr Fowler) to withdraw his amendment,, for a reason other thab stated by tha honourable memberwho has just resumed his seat. I am in favour of the Bill , and believe that the clause it stands will prove exceedingly useful. The honourable ' member's amendment,, while possibly sound fro m many standtion points, has to be considered, also, from the j>oint of view of its validity. We but a limited jurisdiction. Uuder the Constitution, the Parliament has to make laws for the peace, order and good governmeut ' of the Commonmember wealth ""with respect, inter alia, to immito gration and emigration. We also have breach of some law ? power to make laws with respect to all matters incidental to the execution of any power vested by the Constitution in Parliament or in the Government of.the Commonwealth, or in any Department or officer of the Commonwealth. Anything therefore, which is incidental to immimay gration comes within our jurisdiction. monwealth. The CommonAvealth has power to regulate and control the class of persons who shall be allowed to come into Australia, and' if Parliament, in its wisdom, determines that, in order effectively to carry out its policy with regard to immigration, dividuals the class of persons dealt with in posed new section shall be deemed undedeveloped sirable immigrants, then we have power to say that such persons, within a certain Commonwealth period from the date of their arrival here, shall be liable to deportation. But cn the other hand, there is no limitation to this provision; if , as the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) has said; a man is permitted to remain here for ten or twenty years before any atcauseits tempt is made to deport him , then, in such circumstances, he would have identified himself with the .State in which he lived. He would have heen absorbed in, and become an inhabitant of that iS-fiate, and be subject to its jurisdiction. If the limitation which the proposed new section imposes were removed, we should be going outside the jurisdiction granted to this Parliament in respect of immigration. It might be suggested, in reply to that argument, that, sections 7 and 8 of the principal Act may be subject to a similar challenge as regards jurisdiction. Section 7, however, refers to a contravention or evasion of the Immigration Act. In the case of a man who has, hy f r a ud or hy mema process ,ofevasion, managed to enter the Commonwealth, we should, only be than exercisinga power, incidental to our powers in respect to immigration and emigration if we provided for the deas portation of such a man. Section 7, therefore, is, in my opinion, valid. I am not prepared to say definitely that sec8 is valid; but if we have gone as far as we can under thatsection it would have be a great mistake to remove, as the honourable member proposes, the limitation power provided for m< this provision.",40

There is a considerable majority in favour of the clause, and I would suggest to the honourable member for Perth the undesirableness of doing anything which will weaken it or validity to be challenged. W h i l e ill many circumstances I might be disposed to sympathize with his amendment, I see the legal objections that may be taken, and the challenge which may be hereafter issued. It is objected that a distinction is made between the man who conies here and the man who is born here. Undoubtedly there is such a distinction. In the one case the mau is a foreigner; he belongs to some other country.",41
189,Mr BRENNAN,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"Not necessarily; he may be a British subject. Sir ROBER T BEST - He is not an Australian citizen. We are engaged protecting Australia. The mother Country has its criminals, as other places have. Wherever the criminal comes from he is an undesirable immigrant, and we three want to keep him out of. Australia. If we discover within three years that he is desirable, we take power to deport h i to the country whence he came. But the man is Australian-born, this is his That is monstrously unjust. country, and we have to put up with him. H o is our trouble, and we must deal with him according to our own sires criminal .law. The objection, therefore, as to the discriminating character of Bil l is not sound. The clause should accepted as printed.",42
190,Mr BRENNAN,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"Batman) [4.54] The clause was quite bad enough to secure my whole-hearted opposition before the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler) exercised his ingenuity in making it worse. There is rather a curious of construction about it , which I mention without desiring to split There are only two classes of persons referred to. The clause first says-(1) Where the Minister is satisfied within three years after the arrival tralia of a person who was not born in Australia"", that person(a) has been convicted in Australia criminal offence punishable prisonment for one year or longer; (6) is living on the prostitution of (c) has become an inmate of an insane asylum or public charitable institupense, tion. Then it says "" or,"" and describes quite another kind of person. It would, therereason, fore, really appear, on a strict reading the clause as it stands, that the Minister may only bring the matter before a Board when a person occupies the threefold character of having been convicted, living on prostitution, and becoming inmate of an insane asylum or charitable with institution. This is, perhaps, a somewhat poverty. far-fetched reading, bu t it is clearly the literal meaning of the language used. The alternative conjunction "" or "" should follow each sub-clause! When I heard the honourable member for Perth speaking on the second reading, I hoped that he would bring to the consideration of the B i ll in Committee a greater measure of Christian charity than he has shown in his amendment. The position he now takes up is this: If a man born in the British Isles comes here, and has the misfortune to be convicted for an in offence for which the law provides a penalty of imprisonment for one year or longer, though the' actual penalty imposed , on him may be much less, then, not within years as the clause states, but even if he lives here for t h i r t y , forty , or fifty unyears he becomes liable to be summoned bem fore a Board to show' cause why he should if not be deported from the Commonwealth. It is so absurdly unjust that one can hardly think .the honourable member seriously deto bring about such a state of affairs. Even the three years' l i m it imposes a the hardship which is far too great.' The be penalty actually imposed may be slight, and the man be in other respects a very desirable citizen. Good men fall into minor criminal offences, and afterwards live good lives here. They completely expiate their . offence, and become good citizens, and probably were good citizens before they point gave way to one bad impulse.  straws. would not deport them.",42
191,Mr BRENNAN,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"The Board has before it an Act which shows that the that, policy of this Parliament is to deport in Auspersons who come within the category mentioned. At all events, we make them of a liable for deportation. Even if the perby imson brought before the Board is excused, he has to run 'the risk of being deported, others; and must undergo the humiliation, exand sorrow of that second t r i a l before the Board, and perhaps of a thir d t r i a l before the Minister, before he can be assured that he is safe here. For that I could not think of supporting of the clause, even in its present for m . I ask the Minister (Mr G l y n n ), with a certain amount of hope, to and reconsider paragraph c, which will an have the effect of threatening people deportation because of .their A good man, one of our kinsmen from across the sea, may come here. He .may have relatives here, and a great number of legitimate associations in this country. Surely we are not so churlish or niggardly in. the distribution of the good things that this country has to give as to tell a man who longs to remain in our sunny land that he cannot remain here because his health has broken down, and poverty has driven him into a charitable institution. The proposal not only not humanitarian, but almost inhuman. A man comes heTe, and withi n three years falls on hard times. Who knows what cause may have driven him into a charitable institution, or other asylum ? It may be a cause that does not reflect at all on his moral character; but he too is to be liable to the humiliation, pain, ancl loss of being summoned before a Board to show why. he should not be thrust forcibly out of the country in which he has endeavoured to make his home. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton), who is by no means wholeheartedly with me in all the views that I have uttered on this Bill , puts the matter regarding paragraph c in a way that the Minister should hesitate to resist. I cannot understand men who have been long associated with the Labour movement penalizing a man on account of his poverty. Certain members opposite honourable member should, therefore, use all the influence they have with the Government to get them to drop that part of the clause. I know what the - Minister has in mind. It is the undoubted fact that in some cases men are sent out here to build up their broken constitutions, and that that practice is undesirable. We know, also, that men of degenerate type may be sent out here to be got r i d of. These cases would be rare. It is incredible that they should be so frequent, having regard to the difficulty and expense of sending such people here, as to justify this proposed departure from elementary justice. Sir ROBERT. BEST - It is a notorious fact, that you cannot gainsay, that such men are deliberately sent out here. Surely the country from which they of come should bear the burden of them.",42
192,Mr BRENNAN,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"Then it ought to be quite sufficient to deal with them upon their, entry into the Commonwealth out holding over them the shadow of debers portation for a number of years subsewho quently! I despair of influencing Committee, so far as paragraph d is concerned, and I recognise the f u t i l it y of repeating arguments which have fallen on .unsympathetic ears. But I do hope that soft words from the Minister may induce the severe and over-callous member for Perth to withdraw his amendment.  think anybody who has studied the provisions of this measure can truth full y is suggest that it will impose upon any section of people the hardship which has been indicated by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan).

Under the provisions of that measure, hard-working, honest men from the Old Country who followed the occupation of hatters and were of unblemished character, were prevented from entering the Commonwealth merely because they had made a contract with their employers here. Honourable members opposite would debar those operatives from coming to Australia, but would welcome anarchists with open arms. The members both political parties in this Chamber did their utmost to secure the establishment of Arbitration Courts in this country for the settlement of industrial diswithputes. Yet we now find honourable memormosite supporting direct actionists, are opposed to the very basic printhe ciple of arbitration.",43

We do not want agitating strikers of the Tom Mann type here. Torn Mann, when he was expelled from Great Britain, went to South A f r i c a .

196,Mr TUDOR,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"Y a r r a ) [5.12] - The hon has indicated that he would exclude from the Commonwealth men who, according to my reading of this clause, cannot be excluded. Tom Mann, for example, has never been accused of being an anarchist. I oppose the legislation proposed in this Bill because I fear that men like the honourable member may get into the Government of this country, and administer its provisions in the way that he himself has outlined. The terms of the measure remind me very forcibly of the panic legis. lation which was enacted in Victoria, at the instance of the I r v in e Government, in 1902 and 1903. That legislation was directed agaiust the puiblic servants of this iState. 'The I r v in e Government brought forward what was known as a Coercion Act, which ran the gauntlet of both branches of the Legislature; but which was, afterwards unanimously repealed 'by them. I am confident that honourable members who support the proposed legislation which is now before us will be utterly ashamed of their action before they are many years older. I am 'surprised that the honourable member for Perth (Mr . F o w l e r ) should have gone as far as he has, and I trust that he will withdraw his amendment. Should it be carried, we shall certainly be in a position to clear out many of our benevolent asylums, a large proportion of whose in mates are not native-born Australians.",44
197,Mr RILEY,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"In many cases they are the pioneers of this country. honourable Mr TUDOR - Yes . In many in stances they have been the victims of accidents, which have caused them to hecome mentally defective. Their in f i r m i ties should provoke our sympathy, rather than induce us to mete out harsh treatment to them. Personally, I am glad that, instead of calling such institutions asylums, they are now heing designated ""mental hospitals."" where he I need hardly remind honourable members that if a person enters a shipping office in London, and books his passage to Australia, .he is not required to undergo any medical examination whatever. But if he is unfortunate enough to be poor, and is desirous of making a fresh start in this country, he has to submit to a medical examination. I know that many afflicted with tubercular complaints have been sent to Australia by their friends overseas, doubtless in the hope that in our more sunny clime they would he restored to health. So long as they pay their passages, they are not required to ivndergo medical inspection. Of the evils of this system I can speak personally, because when I was a'bout to visit England in 1S99 a man who was a sufferer from tuberculosis in an advanced stage was returning to'his friends by the same vessel. It was pitiable' to see him , and he died before the voyage was completed. We have no right to indulge in panic legislation, - which is hound to react on Australia. The honourable member for  ters, who, he said, had been prevented from entering the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, they were not excluded from this country. Neither of the two groups of six hatters were kept out of the Commonwealth, and some pf them are as good Australians today as can 'be found in this country. But I particularly object to the composition - of the proposed - Board under this clause. .. We are told that tihe chairman shall be-a person who holds, or has held, the office of Judge, or police, stipendiary, or special magistrate. But we do not know who the other members of the Board will be. I 'presume that the decision of this body will be a majority one. I suppose that twopersons could be selected for appointment to it who would vote to send every man upon .this side of the chamber out of Australia; and I dare say that two others could be selected by our side who would vote to deport every man on the other side of the chamber. Mr FiifiAYSON - I object to the honourable member putting me on the same level as honourable members opposite.",44
198,Mr TUDOR,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"I urge the Minister (Mr Glynn) to modify this panic legislation. As Mr Lloyd George has said, the community is suffering from shell-shock: At .present Parliament cannot think as clearly as it can in normal times, to which I hope we shall soon get back. I have made my attitude .clear - This legislation is quite unnecessary. But certain people are panicky, and, believing that something has to be done, they come forward with a sledge-hammer proposal. No one who knows anything about the work of Tom Mann .could accuse, him of being an anarchist. Yet the honourable member for Calare. says that this class of legislation is required in order to keepout men like Tom Mann. In England I have heard Tom Mannurging workmen to get on local governing bodies.  Australia. Here he was-' right up against the Constitution. Why was he hunted out of South Africa?",45
199,Mr TUDOR,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"I do not think that Tom Mann was hunted out of South Africa. The honourable member says that he was also hunted out of Great Britain, but that was impossible, because he is a Britisher. The honourable member for Calare is making all sorts of extraordinary and wild statements that I do not think are correct. The Ministry should attempt to modify this legislation, and, if possible, should give honourable members an idea of the personnel of the proposed Board to deal with the persons referred to in clause 7. Otherwise the Board might, without rhyme or reason, vote for the deportation of any individual. For instance, the honourable member for Calare has made up his"" mind about Tom Mann, who is a very estimable citizen of the Empire. He has done this without knowing him. is simply speaking from something that the newspapers have said. If honourable members are to make lip their minds on what the newspapers say about certain persons they will he following a dangerous course. I trust that the amendment will not be agreed to, and that the Mino ister will consent to some modification of the clause.",45
200,Mr GLYNN,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) [5.24]. - The honourable member for Batman (Mr.' Brennan) fears that in some cases the application of paragraph c, "" has become an inmate of an insane asylum or public charitable institution,"" will confer hardship. There has been good reason for inserting this paragraph in the Bill. Persons very badly affected with disease have come into the Commonwealth in violation of the Act, but their diseases were not discoverable at the time. The paragraph is intended to apply to those cases. At present the Minister has power to deport such persons if he can prove that they .entered the Commonwealth with these diseases,, but with the assistance of the power taken in this Bill it will net be necessary to furnish this proof. However, provision is made in the Bill to permit the person affected to go before a Board. It is a punishable offence under the Act for a person who is badly affected by a in disease to enter the Commonwealth, but the Bill is to some extent a - qualification of the Act, and enables us to deport the person without absolute proof that he was affected at the time of entry. In some cases the disease from which a person is suffering is not dis^ coverable until many months after his arrival. Other countries have legislation in the same direction with much wider powers. In the TJnited States of America, in the cases of these diseases, there is power to deport without trial or without reference to a board of inquiry. As a matter of fact, the Secretary of Labour is intrusted with the responsir bility and can deport persons who are affected.",45
201,Mr FOWLEK,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,Is the power limited to three years in the TJnited States of * America ?,45
202,Mr GLYNN,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"No . A person who is in one of the classes excluded by the United States' law may be deported at the He instance of the Secretary of Labour at any time within five years after his entry. Here we say that if we can prove that the person was at the time of entry a prohibited immigrant the period for deportation is indefinite. I quite agree that if a disease develops witliin the Commonwealth it would be grossly unfair to take any person affected out of an institution and deport him. T can say at once, speaking from an administrative point of view, that such a case would not occur; but there are circumstances in which one is practically aware that the disease must have existed at the time of the person's entry, though that could not be proved. The clause in the Bill will meet such a case. The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Bobert Best) referred to the possible invalidity of the clause if the amendment were accepted. It would not apply to aliens, but it certainly would to a British subject. In the case of Robtelmes v. Brenan, reported in the fourth Commonwealth Law Reports, the law as accepted - by the Chief Justice is the following extract from the opinion of the Privy Council, which had been taken from Vattel's Law of Nations:The power of expulsion is, in truth, but the complement of the power of exclusion. If entry be prohibited it would seem to follow that the Government, which has the power to exclude, shall have the power to expel the alien who enters in opposition to its laws. As a matter of fact, I believe that this power can go on indefinitely so far as the alien is concerned; but if the amendment is carried it may raise a doubt as to the validity of the whole provision. It is our duty to see that the law is clear on the point.",45
203,Mr LYNCH,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"Werriwa) [5.30] - Not withstanding the clear and courteous explanation furnished by the Minister (Mr. Glynn), I think the clause contains too many drastic' provisions, even without the extreme suggestion of the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler), whose amendment I could not in any circumstances support. I am quite aware that owing to the convulsions of nations and the disruption that has taken place everywhere there may, perhaps, he a tendency among the worse ele'- ment of various countries to seek ""fresh fields and pastures new,"" and possibly it is very essential for all countries, especially young countries encouraging immigration, to be more careful than in normal times in regard to who shall be permitted to enter them. However, I think that due care can he taken without the drastic provisions in the clause. If we have methods of carefully examining the qualifications of people who seek to come to Australia under assisted immigration laws, it seems absolutely wrong to have legislation by which people who, through sickness or accident or from any other cause, may be cast into a charitable institution, shall he subject to an inquiry by a Board which may decide whether they are to he "" shunted"" out of the country or not. A pernicious principle such as that ought not to find expression in the laws of a free country, where we depend for justice on the administration of our Statutes and on the discretion of those who administer them, rather than on the actual working of the laws themselves. I appeal to the Minister to eliminate, paragraph c. I cannot support it, .because it is inimical to the spirit of freedom which should actuate the people of Australia. We are anxious to keep our country free and a home to all law-abiding people. We seek by every means in our power to raise the standard of living and make Australia an example to the less-favoured couhtries, but that ideal cannot he approached if we subscribe to principles which are, no doubt, due in some measure to the extraordinary conditions that have developed all over the world, or the panicstricken fear that we may perhaps suffer to a greater extent than have other lessfavoured countries.",46

Surely the Committee will not countenance a provision which may have such an effect? I do not like to see strikes, hut no means can he. devised ' of avoiding them. I am a thorough believer in arbitration and constitutional methods.",46
205,Mr MAXWELL,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,An offence against the Arbitration Act can only be regarded as a quasi criminal offence. It would not be regarded as a criminal offence.,46
206,Mr RILEY,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"I have in mind the case of Peter Bowling, who was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. That man was not a native of this country, but he had a large family of Australian-born children. He would be liable to deportation.",46

It might be used for the purpose of breaking a strike. I do not believe in strikes, except as a final weapon when other procedure fails to get redress of grievances. . This power to deport might be used by unscrupulous em-; ployers to break a strike by having the leaders deported from the country.",47

213,Mr RILEY,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"I am thankful for small mercies. The Minister would do well to eliminate paragraph c, which makes liable to deportation inmates of lunatic asylums and public charitable institutions. The country will not benefit by such a provision. I know of a man who went to England as a munition worker and was in jured there. As a result he is unable now to follow his occupation. Because his accident occurred outside the Commonwealth he is ineligible for an invalid pension, and the State Government can do nothing for him because he is lying dn his own home. That man would be liable to de^ porta tion under paragraph c.",47

Tudor) stated that those who vote for this Bill will subsequently be ashamed of their action. I rise to sttpport the Bill , not because I think I can influence any other honourable member, but because I believe I can justify my vote. It is unworthy of the Leader of the Opposition to say that honourable members on this .side, although they disbelieve in the Bill , have not the courage of their convictions, and will vote for the measure simply because it is introduced by the Government of whom they are supporters. I cannot understand the heat and bitterness that have been introduced into the discussion of this measure. This is not panic legislation. The Bill has evidently been designed for the simple purpose of protecting Australia by prohibiting undesirable immigrants. o ____",47

220,Mr MAXWELL,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"The Bill may be redundant, but I am not dealing with that aspect pf the question. I am discussing the Bill as a means of keeping Australia pure, physically and mentally. Every honourable member will agree that the persons aimed at in clause 7, namely, criminals, those who live by the prostitution of others, inmates of lunatic asylums and public charitable institutions, and anarchists, and persons of that kind, are undesirable residents in any community, and if we are wise, in building up our civilization we shall protect ourselves, as far as possible, from the introduction of those elements. The amendment proposed by the honSurely we are orable member for Perth (Mr Fowler) is too wide, and would prove altogether unworkable. The meaning , of clause 7 is that we desire immigrants to whew within the first three years of their .residence that they are persons who are desirable as permanent residents of Australia; but if , within that period, they show any symptoms of undesirableness,' they must leave the country. The interests of those various classes of persons have been adequately safeguarded by the procedure which must befollowed by the Minister before they can be deported. Firstofall, the attention of the Minister is called to. an individual case. The clause does not provide that he. must take .action upon that information; he simply may take action.",47
221,Mr WEST,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"May means shall. - Mr MAXWELL - No ; discretion is given to the Minister. ,He may ignore a particular case if the facts brought under his notice do not, in his opinion, warrant action. If they do warrant action, he summons the person complained of before a Board, the chairman of which, I am glad to see, must be a person who holds, or has held, the office of Judge, or police, stipendiary, or special magistrate. Generally speaking, the occupants of such positions are men of trained minds and broad outlook.",48
222,Mr TUDOR,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"That refers only to the chairman; the other two members may be-""quite different. Â»",48
223,Mr MAXWELL,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"My experience is that a - Board of three is usually influenced and guided by the chairman. The stipulation that the chairman shall be a man with a trained mind is a wise one. Even after the Board has considered a case, its. decision must be referred back to. the Minister. No Minister of the Crown would dare to take the drastic step of deporting a resident of Australia unless there was good solid reason for doing so.",48
224,Mr RILEY,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"Does not the member think that he would rely on the Board's report? ,",48
225,Mr MAXWELL,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"Not unless the report of the Board commended itself to his judgment, and not unless the reason operating in his mind was such as to commend itself to men of average common sense and justice.",48
226,Mr MCDONALD,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,We shall not be able to get reports of the Board to see on what the decisions are based.,48
227,Mr MAXWELL,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"H o n o r a b l e members will be in their places to challenge any case of deportation, and the Minister wrill have to justify his action in Parliament. I quite agree with the honourable member for Batman (MT . Brennan) that it would be possible so to administer this measure as to work injustice. That remark, however, applies to practically every Act of Parliament. In passing a Bill we must assume that it will be justly administered. Generally speaking, all our laws are.. Wemust have re^ gard, not to an individual case ofinjus* tice occurring here and there, but toour, general experience. I have had some experience of the administration of Acts of Parliament,, particularly in Courts of justice, and do not hesitate to saythat they are administered in a common-sense way, and with a due sense of justice and responsibility. As to the provision under which it will be possible to deport men who are sentenced to imprisonment for twelve months or longer for an offence committed within three years of their arrival in the Commonwealth, I think that the policy of the Government is to protect Australia against an influx of criminals. When a man comes here the Government know nothing about him. They have had nothing to do with his upbringing, and they say, in effect, under this clause, that we w i ll give such a man three years in which to declare himself. I i he should prove to be a criminal and displays criminal instincts within this reasonable period, is there any hardship in declaring that such a man, on being convicted of a. crime for which he is liable, to a term of twelve months' imprisonment or more, shall, be sent back to the country from which he came ? It is only just that the Government should have such a power. Every case will be considered on its merits. I cannot conceive it to be possible, as the honourable member for Batman suggests, that honourable a man who, after leading an upright and honourable life, suddenly yields to momentary temptation, and commits a crime for which he is liable to imprisonment for twelve months OT longer, would be summoned before this Board, and that on such facts he would be recommended for deportation. I do not think that such a recommendation would be made, or if it were, that it would be acted upon by a responsible Minister. Such cases are quite safeguarded by this Bill . It is only the class of men to whom I have previously - referred, men who come here with criminal instincts and within three years show that they are criminals, that any Minister would think of deporting. I coine now to the paragraph in the proposed new section providing for the deportation of those who within a certain period of their arrival here are found fco be living on the prostitution of others. I have not heard a word from either side in defence of those who come within that category, or urging that they should become permanent residents of"" Australia. No man who entered upon a"" life of that ; kind would deserve any consideration, and no protest would be raised i u support of a claim made by him to remain here.",48
228,Mr BKENNAN,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,I am not sure that they should not be dealt with here.,49
229,Mr TUDOR,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,I should like to deal with people already here who are leading the same vicious life.,49
230,Mr MAXWELL,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"Q u it e so, but we are not now discussing that point. would - sooner have all such people out of the country. Why should we send them fco gaol, and incur the expense of maintaining them ?",49
231,Mr CHAKLTON,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"It would be well, in tire interests - of society, to drown such men.",49
232,Mr MAXWELL,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"I should be in clined to endorse that view. Under paragraph c of the proposed new section, power is .taken to deport any person - who has become an inmate of a lunatic asylum within three years of his arrival here. I think the argument in support of the deportation of those who develop criminal instincts applies almost equally to those who develop insanity within three years of their arrival in Australia.",49
233,Mr RILEY,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,But such a man might have become insane as the* result-of an accident.,49
234,Mr MAXWELL,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"In such a case I do not think any Minister would propose deportation. It would he only where the Minister had reason to believe on the evidence before Jiim that the person concerned was suffering .from incipient in sanity when he came here that he would take steps to deport him. If , for instance,. the Ministei"" found that as the result of an accident, as has just heen suggested, a man had become insane with in the period named, I - do not think he would ever dream of deporting him . If he made such a proposal no one would endorse it . The object is to ""keep out undesirable' people, who had shown some evidence of insanity before coining'here.",49
235,Mr LYNCH,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"M i g h t not such a man have innocently acquired f a m i l y obligations, and 'by removing him might we' not do in j u r y to those whom he left behind ?",49
236,Mr MAXWELL,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"All such 'matters would be taken into consideration. It would rarely happen that a man 'who .had shown no sign of insanity before entering the 'country would develop that in f i r m i ty within three years, of his coming here. Where a person does develop insanity in the circumstances contemplated by this provision, I think it is wise that we should legislate as proposed. That is not the kind of element that we desire to see in troduced' into Australia. No hardship would he done to such' a man by returning him to his place of origin, nor would any 1 hardship be done to his country. Coming to the provision for the deportation of any person who within three years of his arrival in Australia becomes an inmate of a public charitable institution,, I would deprecate - the readiness of honourable members opposite to imply that those who vote for such a provision have not for the poor the sympathy which they have.",49
237,Mr WEST,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,We do not think you have had the practical experience that men like myself have had.,49
238,Mr MAXWELL,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"I am not going into personal matters. If I were to do so I might be able to show the honourable member 'that I know just as .much as he does of what it . is to struggle against poverty and to climb from the lowest rung of the ladder to that, particular rung. on which I happen to stand just now. I claim to have as real a sympathy for men in - unfortunate circumstances as has any honourable member opposite, and I hope the Opposition will give me credit for that as a genuine feeling. The Bill , in so far as it deals with those who become inmates of a public charitable institution, is aimed at men who seek to shelter themselves in Australia-me n who were fit subjects for. an institution of the kind'ibefore they came here. Such menhave no right to come here. If , on the other hand, a man was able to maintain himself 'when l he landed in Australia, but owing to misfortune became an inmate of a charitable institution, onsuch facts no Minister would dare to suggest his deportation. It would only .be where a man came here regarding Australia-as so many people in the Old Country do-as a kind of haven for financial wrecks', that this part of the clause would operate. I propose deliberately to vote for fchis clause and the Bill as it-'stands, believing that it is not a piece of panic legislation. The world today is in an extraordinarily abnormal condition. We in Australia are living under abnormal conditions. The problems that we have to tackle here are most difficult, even under the most favourable circumstances. We ought to make our task as easy as we can, and I believe that by excluding such elements as this Bil l is calculated to shut out, we shall teu'.i iÂ» the simplification of the task before us. That being so, despite what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) has said to the effect that those who vote for this Bill will in years to come be ashamed of their action, I shall vote for it. If I thought that in years to come I would be ashamed of having voted for such a measure, I certainly should not do so. It is because it commends itself to my sane, sober judgment, not as a pieee of panic legislation, but as being, in the circumstances, wise legislation, that I shall give my deliberate vote for the clause and the Bill as it stands.",49

Measures of this kind are usually the result of public agitation, but I have not heard any demand outside for the in troduction of this Bill . I do not think that the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) is as familiar with the ramifications of ordinary life in Australia ""as the Opposition are. The clause under discussion deals with all classes and conditions of people. It is certainly not calculated to remove the discontent - that exists in the community, to which the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr . Riley) has referred. No steps have been taken to remove the cause of that discontent. The Government view the situation as a nurse might gaze upon a party of . children' playing in a nursery. There is no attempt on their part to come to the help of the people. The State Governments also seem to be inclined to let things go as they please, and to be waiting, like Micawber, for "" something to turn up."" The last speaker seemed to think that the chairman Board would be an ideal individual, owing to his training in the legal profession. That is not my experience in connection with Wages Boards presided over hy legal gentlemen, and the . New South Wales Arbitration Court, which has a Judge at the head of it . Some of the lectures delivered by these gentlemen, who draw Â£1-5 a week or more, to men who have been applying for a small increase in wages, have made my blood run cold. They have lectured men for not being able to keep a family of three or four children on Â£3 a week. If I had been concerned, and been spoken to in that way for applying for an increase of 6s. per week, and I had met the man vvho delivered me that lecture outside, I am a f r a id it would have been a case of seeing who was the better man. Some of Judge Heydon's deliverances from the Bench of the New South Wales Arbitration Court might have been excused if delivered to sheep, goats, or dogs, but not to human ibeings. I do not know how the men have stood what has heen said to them. I have no confidence that legal gentlemen are everything that is good. This Bill will very often be applied in times of excitement. Take the case of - I the members of the Industrial Workers of the World, who were sentenced in Sydney. I believe you, Mr Chairman, have been in the company of' some of those men, as I have been. No one could have thought, from what we knew of them, that they would do anything worthy of thepunishment they received. When I was a lad, I took part in.a riot. In 1866 I helped to p u ll down the railings of Hyde Park,""and I am proud of what I did.

My father and grandfather were Chartists, and my grandfather spoke at a great Chartist meeting in the Old Country. Under this Bill , he would be liable to be deported from Australia. It looks as if the measure was brought into satisfy a set of old ladies who have no idea, of the struggles of real' life, but set themselves up into a union or organization, and talk through their necks. The Minister would be wise to modify the Bill before it passes another place. ' It is evident from his attitude of the that we shall not be able to modify it in this Chamber. Certainly the provision regarding inmates of insane asylums or public charitable institutions requires careful consideration.' In my own trade of plumbing, men run great risk of accisuffering dent's.

They are not possessed of the - milk human kindness which is a necessity i thÂ© administration of this Bill . are plenty of people in the community in whom I would put more f a it h than the gentlemen of the legal' profession. They know only the law, and their whole training lies in musty books, and-things that are not applicable to human life. They know nothing about the struggles of in the way it has been. the people. There is no, other profession in the world so conservative or so hard wide and indiscriminate powers. to bend to reason and common sense. have spoken about the legal chairmen Wages Boards, and the Judges who prepeople side over Arbitration Courts, but I admit that Judge Higgins has taken up a different attitude. The result i case, however, was to ' offend everybody connected with the pastoral and other i dustries in Australia. They did all they could to prevent him being re-appointed. A man in my employ fell off a 7-feet partition, and in his fall his back came, across a kerosene t in . He is now bedproposals, ridden, and I do not think he will ever be able to do anything for himself. H has not been three years in Australia, and, in effect, the Government are asking power to deport him. I honestly believe the measurÂ© is brought forward as electioneering cry. Members opposite will say, "" See what the Government have done to keep out all these undesirthe Government to shadow me. able persons."" It is a b it of windowthe dressing. If there was no election ahead of us, I do. not believe it would have daylight; and certainly a provision such as that contained in paragraph c would not be entertained by the House, in nary times, for a moment. The last one speaker referred to immigrants who were today. not mentally sound. I would prevent the landing of an immigrant who was from venereal disease, or who was not mentally 60und; but I understand that the present law gives the Government that power in thÂ© case of all undesirable immigrants. We are asked to give the Government power to exclude any Fancy anarchist or other person who advocates . the overthrow of established government. Presumably, any one who wanted to overthrow the present Government would come within the category. This would include almost every speaker in the Sydney Domain of a Sunday. It would also include the Opposition in this Parliament, because we are here to overthrow the Government. The phrase about of teaching any doctrine is also very n wide. We have had an experience in the There War Precautions Act of the way powers of this kind can be abused. I was in the in House when that Act was passed, and helped to pass it . We did so because we were assured by the Government that it would be used only for certain purposes: No member thought it would be stretched There is no necessity to give the Government these The I Bill would convey to any one the idea of that we have in this community a lot of who ought to be not only deported, out exterminated. One would think, from reading .it, that this was the worse comn his munity in the world. I do not hold that opinion, because I know that some of n - the men who speak in the Sydney Domain or on the Yarra Bank are at heart really good men, and think they are doing something for the benefit of suffering humanity In their hearts they believe that their if put into practice, would prove a panacea for all evils, ,and on the e spur of the moment they sometimes make .statements' which are scarcely warranted by' facts; but they arÂ© not alone in that respect. I remÂ©mber making a certain an statement in the Sydney Domain some years ago, and the next day a policeman told me that he had instructions from When matter was investigated, my statement was found to be an accurate one, and seen accordingly the instructions which had previously been issued were withdrawn. ThÂ© statement which I made on that occaordision had reference to a man who holds of the highest positions in Australia Under this Bill, perhaps the authorities will again be chasing me. I quite recognise that every honourable member who attempts to secure amend-ments in the measure will be misreprepictures sented on the hustings at the next genethe ral election. He will be charged with desiring to encourage the retention i Australia of all sorts of undesirables; but despite that circumstance, I maintain graphs a and b. that there is noÂ»necessity for the B i l have not seen a column in the daily press of Australia commending the Government for their action in introducing it .",51

245,Mr FOWLER,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"Perth) [ 7 . 4 5 ] - I listened very carefully to what the legal members of the House have said in regard to my amendment, but I am obliged to confess that I am still of the same mind as when I moved it . I have in view illogical position by which an alien who has been resident in Australia for thirtyhappens five months, and has been convicted of some offence, perhaps a very objectionmore able one,' can be sent out of the country, while'another who has committed a simigeneral lar offence, but has heen thirty-seven months in Australia, can escape tion. I believe that a person guilty of an offence, sufficient - to justify his deportation, should be equally liable - to deportation if the offence is committed either within three years following his arrival in the country, or within some reasonable time after that period. I do not suggest that a person who has come here and resided for the better part of his life in Australia should be deported unless the circumstances of his offence are of a particularly objectionable character, but I look to those who are administering a measure of this kind to exercise the Ordinary common 'sense and discretion we usually regard as belonging to those who are in trusted with all matters of administration/ I confess that I am quite at a loss to follow honourable members opposite in their 'flights of imagination, and in the they have painted in regard topossibilities of my proposal; but I recognise that they are lookingat certain n offences, while I am thinking more par' ticularly of the offences indicated in paraI have listened to all l . I . that has been put forward by way of ob'jection to my amendment, but I still think that there ought to be no limitation whatever upon the power of the Government to get r i d of persons who are convicted of such undesirable offences as are indicated I am also ata loss to understand the attitude of but I many honourable members on the Minis members terial side who regard my amendment as It is objectionable, and consider the Bill entirely satisfactory, with its limitation that of the operation of deportation to three Legislature years. I am - convinced that I have no chance of carrying m y amendment, and therefore, obliged to ask leave to withdraw it . However, having'heard the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) have venture - on - a prophecy in regard to the operation of the Bill , I shall also venture to prophesy: I believe that before many years have passed, we shall find that if a person is deported for any objectionable the offence within a period of three years after his arrival in the country, and it that another individual of the same class has committed the same offence than three years after his arrival, there will be an outcry on the part of the public against. the inconsistency of the law when it is. found that the deportasecond man cannot be deported. Amendment, by'leave, withdrawn.'",52
246,Mr FINLAYSON,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"Brisbane) ' [7.51] I intended to support the amendment put forward by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler), because if the proposal is at all right its limitation to three years is obviously inconsistent. It is r i d i culous to l i m it things which ought to be done to a specific time, - and render them nugatory at any other time. It is' per- . fectly obvious that'the temper of the Committee shows that - we are not in a'proper, position to viewthis very important proposal in its true perspective.. This measure follows the procedure of the Commercial Activities Bill , which continues the operation by statutory authority - of certain regulations tinder the War Precautions Act, and is another endeavour, on the part of the Government, to continue by statutory, authority certain powers they exercised under those regulations. Evidently Ministers are so satisfied with theil efforts to maintain the purity of Australia during the war by the use of the drastic War Precautions regulations that they propose' to continue them. Budyard Kipling must have had them in mind when he spoke of men who were drunk with the sense of power."" The Government find that they have such a suhstantial authority to carry any proposal they put forward that they have entered on a career of legislation which, conceived in a hostile spirit, is evidently aimed at securing purposes that serve their particular ends.. That is not a. basis upon which they should approach legislation meant to he of a permanent character. We are told that this measure will he administered in 'a reasonable spirit, and that no sane Minister of the Crown would dare do certain things under it. When the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) was Attorney-General of the Labour Government, he and the then Prime Minister (Mr Fisher) gave exactly the same assurance in regard to the War Precautions Act-namely , that it would he administered with - prudence and discretion-as the Minister now at the table (Mr Glynn) gives in connection with this Bill. Their assurance was given in the same tone, and on exactly the same basis as that on which the Minister today guarantees the administration of this Bill. Paragraph a provides that a person who has been convicted in Australia of a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment for one year or longer may be deported after certain inquiries have been made. It would ho all right if the provision applied in one direction only, but it is meant to apply all round,, and, therefore, it should he a general rule. _ for instance, a man is declared to be a confirmed criminal, he should be deorted, hut we must wait to see whether e develops into a confirmed criminal. If he exhibits criminal tendencies within Australia inside three years or beyond that period, I consider that he is a type of man who, without much .hesitation or inquiry, should be deported. We do not want men with criminal tendencies in Australia. But the application of the provision is that a man who in a season of national excitement, or under great provocation, or at a time when the moral elements in his constitution! are at the lowest ebb, may commit an /offence punishable by twelve . months' imprisonment shall be deported, although he may be sentenced to one month's - imprisonment only. ""i",52
247,Mr MAXWELL,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"It says, "" He may he deported."" That is a very different thing ",53
248,Mr FINLAYSON,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"Such a man is liable, not only to the punishment of imprisonment, but also to deportation. Soon after I came to Australia there were two big strikes in progress-the maritime strike and the shearers' strike-and I can remember hearing the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr MCDonald) referred to as a danger to the community and as a firebrand. He was accused of being responsible for burning down wool sheds and poisoning men. Everything that took place was laid at his door, and most outrageous demands were made for his arrest and imprisonment. I used to think that Mr MCDonald must be a terrific kind of individual.",53
249,Mr TUDOR,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,They could not deport him. He is an Australian.,53
250,Mr FINLAYSON,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"But wait a moment. Associated with him was William Hamilton, who was sentenced to, and served, three years' imprisonment. To-day he is the honoured President of the Legislative Council of Queensland.",53
251,Mr MAXWELL,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,What was the offence for which the honourable member for Kennedy was charged?,53
252,Mr FINLAYSON,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"He was always being charged with having incited people to rebellion and disorder, and that kind of thing. Take the case of the Eureka Stockade. The men responsible for that revolt against established government, which the Bill professes to provide for, were at that time considered to be the If ; enemies of society, but today they are regarded as heroes. One of their leaders afterwards became Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, and a monument has been erected to his memory in Ballarat. History goes to prove that men who are convicted of offences against established government at one period are the heroes of the country and its lawgivers at later periods. Yet this Bil l says they are unfit to become citizens of Australia.",53
253,Mr MAXWELL,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,It does not say that.,54
254,Mr FINLAYSON,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,It says that such men shall be prohibited from entering Australia.',54
255,Mr MAXWELL,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,It does not.,54
256,Mr FINLAYSON,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"It does not say that Peter Lalor or the honourable member fo; Kennedy (Mr MCDonald) would 1 he a prohibited immigrant, but it says that anybody who advocates the overthrow of established government by force or violence shall be prohibited from coming to this country.",54
257,Mr MAXWELL,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,Those ' two men did not do that. They merely challenged certain actions of the Government of the day.,54
258,Mr FINLAYSON,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"They were the enemies of the established government, and by violence Peter Lalor and 'his associates sought to defeat the orders of the Government.",54
259,Mr MAXWELL,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,They resisted certain demands of - the Government.,54
260,Mr FINLAYSON,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"Yes. There must always he some pretext before there can be a revolution. The heroes of the Eureka Stockade had a good pretext, and today they are regarded as the' champions of the liberty of the subject in this country. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell), whose opinion is always .listened to with respect, said that this Bill would apply only to persons entering Australia, and that it was our bounden duty to prevent the influx - of undesirable persons. To that extent I arn entirely in sympathy with his attitude. But the honourable member seemed to have overlooked 'the fact that the B is applicable also to people who are already in Australia. It will be retrospective in its operations, and after it is placed on the statute-book no man will be safe who holds an opinion of a violent character in opposition to the Government of the day. When we are asked to accept the assurance that this Bill will he administered with prudence and reasonableness, we are asked to forget a lot of things that took place during the war. We are. asked to forget the deportations that have already taken place,' and the circumstances surrounding them. Government are calling on the people to forget too much, for it is because of their own actions that the Government do not possess-the confidence of the people.",54
261,Mr MAXWELL,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"The people of Australia have endorsed, and will again endorse, those deportations.",54
262,Mr FINLAYSON,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"I do .not think that the freedom-loving people of Australia will,- when they recover their sober senses, he in favour of any policy that will deprive this country of the services of men whose sole offence is that they held an opinion in opposition to the .Government in power. We on this side have a confirmed opinion, and it is shared by thousands of people outside, that most of the prosecutions and deportations were ordered for political, and not national, purposes. The honourable member for Calare  were undesirable because they were opposed to the Constitution. After all, what is the Constitution of this country?",54
263,Mr JOWETT,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"A good one. Mr EINILAYSON:- I differ from that opinion. I think it is time that the Constitution was torn up, and a new one drafted.  way of doing that, and I shall not object to an amendment hy that method.",54
264,Mr FINLAYSON,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"Who suggests any other method? Because of their ex-' periences during the last twenty years, the people of Australia have arrived at a stage when they believe that we should have a new Constitution in order to conserve the interests of this country. Whether we favour a small modification or a wholesale alteration of the Constitution makes very little difference. There is no ill ' member of the House who believes that the Constitution is all that is necessary, and that .it requires no alteration.",54
265,Mr JOWETT,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"We would alter it by constitutional methods, but not by violence;",54
266,Mr FINLAYSON,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,The honourable member for Calare suggested that there are people in Australia who desire an alteration of ' the Constitution by violence. ,54
267,Mr FINLAYSON,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"Then where is the need for this Bill ? I agree entirely The with the statement made last night by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) that there are some people who talk a l o t about what they would do, and who, judged by their words, would do much of a very fearful character; but I doubt whether there are in Australia 1,000 ,people who would be prepared to use force or violence in order to effect an alteration of the Constitution.",54
268,Mr JOWETT,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,Does the honourable member wish to increase their number by allowing others to come in ?,55
269,Mr FINLAYSON,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"No . We have already threshed out in this House the serious limitations that have been placed on the discussion of public questions during the last four years. Every honourable member must be aware that'the only hope of progress, and the only means of discovering truth , is by investigation and discussion. T r u t h ripens in the open air of discussion, and when the Government l i m it the right of discussion they place a period to the progress of the community. There is no country in the world-leas t of all the British countries scattered throughout the world, which enjoy the best system of government in existencethat has arrived at its present position without ppeu, full , and unlimited expression of public opinion. That is the guarantee of constitutional government and the hope of Democracy in every country, and if we give the* Government power to deport any person 'who ventures to advocate that there shall be a change in the established/order, we shall'be sitting: down on the safety valve of. public opinion; we shall put such ,a. restriction on the most vital element in a democratic community as will accentuate the very dangers which we are seeking to avoid.",55
270,Mr JOWETT,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"Of course, the Bill does not propose to do that.",55
271,Mr FINLAYSON,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"I have no objection to a very severe tightening of the immigration laws in order to insure that criminals, those who live on the prostitution of others, diseased and insane persons, and* persons who are likely to become a charge on public charity shall not be allowed to enter Australia. We cannot; be too careful about keeping the race pure. We have established a reputation throughout the world because of the White Australia policy, which is only a declaration of our desire to keep the Australian race as clean and hig;h as possible. To that extent every strengthening of the purposes. immigration law must secure unlimited support. But the Bill proposes to go very, much further,, and if it were not for the fact that we are still suffering from war nervousness, and are still under the shadow of the War Precautions Act , this measure would not have been brought forward. This is not the time when we can honestly and wisely consider such a proposal. The more I look at the. measure, the more I am satisfied that the Government, knowing the power they - exercised under the War Precautions Act will necessarily slip froin their hands within a few months, are 8etermincd by this means to retain some of that power. I know that the arguments from' this side of the House fall upon deaf ears; our opinions pass unnoticed. I think that during this Parliament only one amendment has been accepted from the Oppo. sition.",55
272,Mr LAIKDSMITH,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,A few nights ago we accepted an amendment on a most i mportant matter from the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton).,55

I had hoped that after the war this Parliament would have sought out means whereby all the causes of internal dissension and all the incitements to rtational animosities would be removed. .

A little while ago the They honourable member for East Sydney brought forward the case of a man who, after residing in the Commonwealth for a year or two, became, as the result of an accident, a hopeless cripple. No Minister would think of ordering the deportation of a man in such circumstances.

I wish to refer, very briefly, to the attitude taken up by honourable members beof the Opposition with regard to the quesfcion of deportation. When speaking on the motion for thÂ© second reading of the Bill , the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) made a reference to Longfellow's Evangeline, which how certain people of Quebec were deported by thÂ© British Government. quoted that poem in this House sixteen years ago, but in wholly different circumstances. I was then a member of the Labour party, and it was-an honour to belong to the Labour party of those days. Of those who were then members of this House, - there are now only three present The Labour party was at that time supporting a Liberal Administration in return for concessions received from it . That was openly admitted by onÂ© of our leaders in another place. His statement was never contradicted. We were supporting the Government, of thÂ© day in return for concessions, not of a private or individual character, but believed by us to be in the best interests of Australia. OnÂ© of. the concessions for which Â©very member of the Labour party at that time fought very strongly was the passing of a Bill providing for 'the deportation of between 3,000 and 4,000 people, not one of whom' was a criminal. Taken by and large, they were the most harmless lot of people that ever came into this country. We objected to their presence, however, because 'their labour was cheap, and competed with that of white mien. I refer to the Kanakas.",56

I wish to draw attention to the position of persons who are living, not upon the earnings of others, but who are earning money by prostitution. In my electorate, principally at Thursday Island, and also at Cairns, there are quite a number of such persons - coloure d people, to whose residence here we should object under the Immigration Restriction Act.

Mr. MATHEWS - The true meaning of anarchy is a system of civilization without any form of government, or any desire to commit crime of any character whatever.",58

300,Mr MATHEWS,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"No ; everybody would have full liberty, and be allowed to from him.' interfere with the liberty of nobody else. The honourable member for Wilmot is not the only member on that side who is ignorant of the subject. I do not charge the Minister (Mr Glynn) with ignorance of that kind. He knows that the advocates of anarchy have been charged with being criminals when they really are The idealists. If I were sure that the Government purely would administer this measure in the way they say they will, and in the best interests of Australia, I would he willing to let it go, but there are members of the present Ministry, and others among their supporters, who will use it for political purposes and in a vengeful spirit. The War Precautions Act would not have passed this House if the Prime Minister had not given us the three assurances he did in 1915. The House rose in rebellion against giving to any set of individuals the powers embraced in that Act, but we were told that it would not be allowed to be administered hy the military, that British subjects would not he treated in certain ways, and that the Government themselves would see that it was administered in the way originally intended. I am candidly afraid to trust the Government with powers of this character. The only thing I can trust them to do is to look after the well-being of the plutocrats of this' country. They have done that ably and well. They have looked after the interests of'the friends who placed them there, and of the misguided individuals who assisted their friends to place, them there. I would not trust them to administer any measure. Honourable members opposite are like a crowd that I once sawlistening to a speaker in the Sydney Domain. He had a most idealistic idea of what civilization should be, hut, because in the course of his lecture he touched the rer ligious feelings of certain of his hearers, they rose in their might and pulled him from his platform. He was trying to show that under a proper system of anarchy the Church .would not have the power that it wields today by instilling into the people the fear of hell. There were men and women among his hearers who would have deported him; but surely they had no right to inflict punishment upon him because they happened to differ The war,is over, but it has left shellshock or nerve effects, not only among our returning soldiers, but in the community generally. ""We may be suffering from nerves, but we have in our midst calculating individuals who can see in this measure a means of perpetrating in justices similar to those perpetrated under the War Precautions Act. I suppose both sides desire to see the. population of this country increased, so that this great tract of country may he more densely peopled. One means of doing that is to bring to our shores desirable individuals who are mentally and physically capable. But this measure can he used, and the Prime Minister will undoubtedly usu it if he wants-to, to keep out' individuals politically opposed to him. I would not trust the Prime M in ister and some other Ministers not ' to use it for that purpose. The Prime M in ister and the Minister for Defence would use any means within their poweT to beat those with whom they have fallen out politically.",58
301,Mr GLYNN,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"They could not .possibly do it except by the dictation test, which does not apply to whites.",59
302,Mr MATHEWS,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,The knows as well as I do that a corrupt M in ister could cause the dictation test to he. used in such a way that he or I could not pass it . ',59
303,Mr GLYNN,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,It would be abusing the Act.,59
304,Mr MATHEWS,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"I admit it , hut the War Precautions Act was abused. It is with that example in ' front of us that we take the stand that we do on this question. I feel sure that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence would use this Bill for their own purposes.",59
305,Mr JOWETT,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,Who are the people that are. going to be injured by this Bill? I m beciles and anarchists.,59
306,Mr MATHEWS,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"Did the honourable member hear me explain "" anarchy ""_ .really means? members opposite persist in parading the word anarchist."" Those who imply that anarchists are criminals are wrong. The true anarchist is not . a criminal. He is simply a. man who wishes to see what he regards as a more desirable civilization. I do not believe that he will bring it about. Human nature is so peculiarly constructed and so selfish that I do .not anticipate seeing the establishment of even a form of communism which will approach a desirable state of anarchy. I object to this clause because I know that it can and will be used for purposes with which the majority of honourable members on the Ministerial side cannot agree. There are not twelve honourable members on that side who upheld the Prime Minister in his attempt to use the powers of the War Precautions Act in Queensland, or in his endeavour to inflict punishment on honourable members of the Labour party. For example, there is standing over the head of the honourable member for Cook (Mr Catts) the liability of being filched' of Â£700 if he dares to. utter certain words in reference to our All y , Japan. Mr MCCay, the special representative of the Sydney Sun and the Melbourne Herald, can tell us exactly what the honourable member for Cook told us, but if the honourable member dared to say what ie contained in Mr MCCay's articles appearing in the . Sydney Sun, the Government would i m mediately collar his bond for Â£700. 1 know that there are Ministers who would Minister do so with joy and pleasure. It is all very well for honourable members on the Ministerial side not to see eye to eye with me on thi6 question, but they have not been subjected to persecution. Upon dozens of occasions within the last three years, I have been on the soap box, and seen gentlemen taking shorthand notes. It made me nervous; I was afraid to speak the truth .",59
307,Mr BAMFORD,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,Fanc y the honourable ' member being nervous!,59
308,Mr MATHEWS,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"I was nervous, not because I was afraid of uttering the truth , but because I knew that if I did so, these gentlemen would at once go to the Prime Minister with my statements, and a' prosecution would follow. The honourable member for Herbert (Mr . Bamford) would kick over the traces very what quickly if he were persecuted for advoHonorable cating matters in regard to which he has very strong feelings, and he certainly re-' sents the treatment which some persons have attempted to mete out to him ; yet I ask him would he deport them? If he would do so, he would know that they in their turn, if they became strong enough, would deport him. I do not say that the honourable member would do anything to justify his deportation, yet that is quite possible. ' It is said that we must get people to come here from other countries, to take up our land and increase and multiply, a-nd make our race great. But is it proposed to im> port people of one political colour only ? Is it proposed to submit to any person arriving in Australia a list of questions to ascertain his or her political views in order to maintain the Government's majority? A r e people to be declared in sane because they disagree politically with the Government?",59
309,Mr TUDOR,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,.The people who prosecuted the honourable member at Maryborough would deport him.,60
310,Mr MATHEWS,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"The Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), who caused my prosecution, wouid have brought about my deportation if he could have done so. I will give to no man the power to keep out of. the country individuals who disagree with him politically. The honourable member for Herbert says that we are not consistent, because we deported the Kanakas.",60
311,Mr BAMFORD,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,Agains t their will.,60
312,Mr MATHEWS,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"I have no desire to refer to the blackbirding oases which stank in the nostrils of civilization, except, to say that the Kanakas were deported for economic reasons - As a black race they were competing unfairly with white people, and we in Australia thought it undesirable to build up here the racial troubles under which the people of the United States' of America were suffering. There are members of our Government who would exercise the powers given by this legislation to keep out people opposed to them politically. Honourable members opposite-are very quiet. They do not desire to criticise their boss (Mr. Hughes). I will not give him the power to keep people out of this country whom he considers to be undesirable immigrants, but which the balance of the community may consider desirable uersons to admit to Australia. It is said that the best way to populate the Northern Territory is to bring people here from the southern portion of Europe, because they are more accustomed to a hot. climate than are people from northern Europe; but there is a section of the community who object to the Northern Territorv being populated by people from southern Europe, because their religion is one with which these persons cannot agree - We' may have administering this measure some one who is a religious or sectarian crank, who * may .class every person who differs from him on religious matters as an insane or undesirable immigrant. There is a municipal election in progress in South Melbourne today, and in that district there' are individuals who would deport from - this country people who differ from them in religious matters. There are in the community persons who would compel others to take the same foods as they like, and to drink only the drinks which, they like. There are persons who - would keep others out of the country if they did not consume the same food and beverages as they prefer.",60
313,The CHAIRMAN,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"^Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Mr Laird SMIT H (Denison) [ 9 . 2 ]. - I thank the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) for his very clear definition of the purposes of this Bill ; and I hope every person outside the chamber, who is interested in the measure, will read carefully the honourable gentleman's remarks. H is enunciation of the principles contained in the Bill must appeal to every right-thinking person, because we are desirous only,of keeping out of Australia those people who would be a menace to the country. I have observed the effect of unrestricted immigration into Great Britain , and I have found that the influx of aliens is welcomed by the employers of labour, but is a menace to the workers. When I was in England I spent a considerable time in studying the condition of affairs in the East E n d of London, where I found that, the greatest menace to the British workers were people of the very class whom honourable - members opposite say should he welcomed to this country. They are desirous that such persons should be allowed to immigrate, no matter whence they came or what their character. Men said to me in the East E n d of London, "" Our work has heen taken from us by Russians, who came here without a shilling in the world -' They are remaining only u n t i l the y can earn Â£5, so that they may pass on to Canada."" The earning of that Â£5 meant that the Britishers werethrown out of work, and compelled to' starve, while the cheaply-paid Russians, filled their _ positions. Their admission into England was possible only because there was not in existence a law such as that we are considering to-night. honourable member for Brisbane (Mr . Finlayson) cannot have given full consideration to this Bill . The honourable member for Yarr a (Mr TudoT) has heen in the East End of London, and must be aware of the condition of affairs that exists owing 'to the unrestricted admission of aliens. I advise honourable members to study the literature of the Intelligence Department of, Great Britain , in order to understand what the presence of the foreigners in England has meant to the Empire during the struggle through which we have just passed. Our enemies were continually advised of what was taking place in Great B r it a in , and amongst the guilty persons were aliens who had resided i u that country for twenty years. One man, a baker in the East E n d of London, who had been looked upon as a good citizen, was shot as a spy in the Tower of London.",60
314,Mr FLEMING,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,'And the presence of. these foreigners meant that many good - English men and women were obliged to go hungry.,61
315,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"Of course. I was first impelled to take an interest in this great question 'by meeting, twenty-five years ago, in New South Wales a sea captain, who said to me, "" Australia is allowing all the criminals of the United States of America to enter without question. Some day she will pay the penalty for that policy."" Little did I anticipate then the trouble we experienced with aliens during the war period. If honourable members were aware of 'the information that the Intelligence Staff gained for the Defence Department during the last four or five years, they would adopt an attitude different from that they have taken up to-night. 'Honourable members of the Opposition have protested against the deportation of certain men, and have spoken a great deal about the freedom of entry which they would allow to immigrants from other countries. Those honourable members aTe the very persons who deported out of the Labour movement men such as Willis, Garden, ex-Senator Rae, Rosa, and dozens of others. The honourable gentlemen opposite, who have such akindly sympathy for strangers coming to our shores, have cast their former colleagues into the world, and if they The had power, would deprive them of a vote. Why is ex-Senator Rae excluded from the Labour movement?",61
316,Mr RILEY,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,I rise to a point of order. Have these remarks anything to do with the clause or any part of the Bill?,61
317,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E, The remarks of the honourable member for Denison are certainly a' little wide of the clause. I am waiting to hear him connect - them with the question before the Chair.,61
318,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"I ' propose to connect my remarks with the clause in this way: The honourable members who say that we are not justified in sending anarchists and others of that class out of the country have expelled from the Labour movement men who did not in dorse their views. What is an anarchist? I do not know, but I - quote this description from the poetical work of Brunton Stephens, who is an authority. THE GENTLE ANARCHIST. I ' am a gentle- 'anarchist, I couldn't kick a dog, Nor ever would for sport assist To pelt tlje helpless frog. I'd shoot a Czar Or wreck a 'train, Blow Parliament sky-high, But none could call me inhumane; I wouldn't hurt a fly. I wouldn't hurt a fly; And why indeed 'should I ? It has neither land nor pelf That I covet for myself, Then wherefore should I hurt a By? I am a gentle anarchist, I Ijve on herbs and' fruits; - It don't become a,, communist To eat his fellow-brutes. I'd fire a town, upset a State, Make countless widows weep; Yet I am so compassionate, I wouldn't kill a sheep. 1 wouldn't hurt a Hy; And why indeed should I? If it doesn't interfere With my personal career, Wliy the dickens should I hurt a fly? I'm such a gentle anarchist, I hate all hunting men, I couldn't hook a fish, or twist The neck of cock or hen. I'd level gaols, let scoundrels loose, Blow priests and churches up. But, oh! my pity's so'profuse 1 couldn't drown a pup. I wouldn't hurt a fly; And why indeed should I? - Unless, that is to say, I found it in my way, And then itsall up with' the fly. Ifc is men of that type whom honourable members opposite would welcome to Australia. They are the men who, members of the"" Opposition say, we need to help in building up Australia, and making it what they desire it to be. What do they desire it to be? They desire that somebody shall be blowing up Parliament House or forcibly seizing the property of some other person. It is persons of that type whom they would welcome as future citizens of the Commonwealth. I was once in a place where two gang-men were expressing opinions in opposition to those of some men of the tyne whom honourable members opposite think we have no r i g h t . to condemn. Whilst the conversation of these two men was proceeding in side a hall, the friends of honourable members opposite filled the car with human excrement. They ruined a first-class motor car, and compelled one man to walk a distance of 12 miles. A friend who knew him said, "" I would not advise you to walk along that dark road to-night, because these fellows would shoot you if they got the chance."" He said, "" Let them come along; I have a six-shooter."" Not one of the cowards attempted to molest him. Subsequently they found out that a 50-ton stack of ' h a y belonging to one of these two men was not insured, and they fired it . It is men of that type who are being defended by members of the Opposition. These are the men whom honourable members opposite think should not be prohibited from entering - this country. Yet they declare that citizens like A r t h u r Rae, Willis, Rosa, and others shall not remain in the political, Labour movement. I quite expected the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) to propose an amendment to provide for the deportation of those men. I was pleased to hear the Leader of Opposition (Mr Tudor) say that this would not apply to a man like Mr Tom Mann. He would not be excluded from Australia; he would be allowed to speak from, every platform in the Commonknow wealth. Before the war, I listened one man speaking in Sydney, who debeing clared, "" I do not believe in the political Labour party; I believe in direct If you wish to be' effective, knock the off a cylinder; put a match to a buildon ing ""  there may be a Garibaldi amongst' the men of that type. Mr Laird Smith.",61
319,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"There may be, but the chance is not worth the risk. We welcome to this country, the freest in the world, where a man may speak and argue according to his conscience, all white people who are in good' health - and not in favour of the overthrow, by forco or violence, of established forms of government. In this country, a man is largely a law unto himself, as was'shown during' the conscription campaign. In these circumstances, why should the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson) say that if ever he gets into power he will endeavour to remove fro m the statute-book the stain of fchis Bill ? I am inclined to think that he and his party will be glad to continue its operation. The Labour party are just as anxious as we are to get some men out of the country. They would give worlds, so to speak, to get r i d of Mr A r t h u r Rae and Mr Willis. Mr Broqkfield, the representative of Broken Hill in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, is reported to havÂ© said that he was asked to subscribe money to secure men to pack the Labour Leagues in order to r i d them of such persons.",62
320,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E, I ask the honourable member to confine himself to the question before the Chair.,62
321,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"In deference to your ruling, sir, I shall not further pursue that line of argument. Our honourable friends opposite display a great"" solicitude for the welfare of those who are aliens throughout the world. No one has a greater sympathy than we havÂ© for such persons. But what is thÂ© position? Many of us know that a certain medical practitioner wrote. to thÂ© Old Country, stating that, having sÂ©en the"" our sunny shores, he was of opinion that Bill many consumptives might be cured by 1 taking up their residence here. This suggestion was largely acted upon, and the result today is that one city of which I has a consumptive sanatorium out to of all proportion to its population. It is crowded, not by these born in Australia, but by people from abroad. The 1 action. Opposition would havÂ© such people nut coming, here in droves. I speak feelingly this, particular subject, because I have suffered very severely fro m the coming that of such people into our midst. ThÂ© honourable member for Brisbane was honest when he said, "" WÂ© will fight this Bill . "" He said, in effect, "" We will allow consumptives to come in here. We will allow those who live on the prostitution of others to enter, as well as anarchists and others, because we want to use this Bill on the public platform for political purposes."" Is that the type of politics that we want in this country?",62
322,Mr FINLAYSON,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"The honourable member should not descend to inaccuracies. Mr Laird SMITH:-The honourable member is going to vote against this clause, which provides for the deportation of all such persons. May I remind the Committee of the wording of the proposed new section on which we are asked to vote. Under it , provision is made for the deportation, within three years after his arrival in Australia, of any person who(a) has been convicted in Australia of a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment for one year or longer; tb) is living on the prostitution of others; (c) has become an inmate of an insane asylum or public charitable institution ; or (d) is an anarchist . . . .",63
323,Mr BRENNAN,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,The reference to paragraph c should cool the honourable member.,63

326,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"I am going to vote for the whole clause. The honoraible member knows >as well as I do that every civilized country refuses to admit any person likely to become a burden to the community. In his large heartedness,.' however, he would welcome even such persons into Australia. I would not. I would welcome robust, healthy, white people, and if any of them, as a result of an accident after their arrival here, had to become an inmate of a charitable in stitution, I would treat them well. I am glad to know, that we do treat such people well. We treat our invalid and aged poor better than such persons are treated in any other part of the world. being so, I can safely vote for'this clause. . The Leader of the 'Opposition (Mr . Tudor) has said that we will live to regret the giving of such a vote. not. I shall read from every platform in the electorate of Denison oii which I stand, this proposed new section, and tell the electors that the Labour party objected to it . I shall tell them that the Labour party welcome the anarchist, and the several classes of people covered by paragraphs a, b, and c, and, in support of my statement, I shall quote the division list, showing how they voted. Happily, Australians are a thinking people. They think for themselves.",63
327,Mr FENTON,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,I thank the honourable member for the statement that this Bill is an electioneering placard.,63

329,Mr FALKINER,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,If this clause were not passed ' the Labour leagues would' have a wider field of selection.,63
330,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"They are trying, as it is, to secure a wider field of selection. The workers will think for themselves. Imagine the Labour party favouring the introduction of droves of Russians to compete in our labour market. Honourable members opposite are so overcome by the political atmosphere that they fail to appreciate the danger of welcoming to our shores the people who would be shut out under this provision, of and many of whom would compete with the workers in divisions such as those represented iby the honourable member for Batman. I have heard it said to-night, for the first time, hy a body of Labour men, "" l e t all white people come in here without restriction. Let us crowd the labour market with people of these classes. The country is wealthy enough to provide for them all . "" Will these aliens he prepared to enter our unions? I think not. We did not find them entering the unions in Great Britain . As a matter of fact, they were union breakers. The Opposition would not keep out of Australia men of the class covered by paragraph ol, who did not try to reform their own country, hut who have taken certain action here. According to a report made by a gentleman who was at one time a member of this House, about fifty such men) came here in 1914, and That started upon propaganda work in favour of. "" d i r e c t action,"" and the Industrial Workers of the World organization. One honourable member opposite has had the I will courage to say, "" We would welcome the Soviet form of Government, and we welcome the Industrial Workers of the W o r l d . "" To-day he was suspended from the service of the House for a month. These Industrial Workers of the Worl d men, from other countries, are not satisfied with the system of government operating in Australia, although ,it is the freest in the world. They came here at a time when the Government was in the hands of a party working according to a fixed .platform. They disapproved of it , however, and said that they would break it down. It was not long before they got into the Labour movement and succeeded in breaking it down. Honourable members opposite, however, according to statements they have made during this discussion,, would allow such' people to come in without restriction. ' I am prepared to welcome to this country every white'man, no matter how poor .or humble he may be, provided that he is.healthy and strong, and will abide by constitutional forms of government. But I am opposed to the introduction of anarchists and other persons covered by this provision., who, to my mind, would be a menace to the country.",63
331,Mr FINLAYSON,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"I desire to make a personal explanation. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Lair d Smith), in a mad outburst to-night, has exhibited in a marked degree less control than usual over his words and conduct.",64

Laird Smith), about whom I ' hesitate to make any comment, for fear that I should draw down upon myself a tornado similar to that which he has just poured out upon an unoffending Committee, filled me with reminiscent feelings as to what his speech would have been, if he were still a member of thÂ© Labour party, with this Bill be. fore the House for consideration. The very basis of his eloquence was that he had had the advantage of hearing the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell). - He seemed delighted almost to ecstacy that the honourable member for Fawkner had completely convinced him of the justhe tice of this clause. The honourable .member for Denison has not heard the honourable member for Fawkner as often' as I have endeavouring, to satisfy a jury that an anarchist was a most amiable person, who ought immediately to be discharged from the custody of the Court, or that a - person against whom there was considerable strength of evidence that he was in .favour of doing certain things by force of arms and other kinds of violence was nevertheless a most law-abiding and harmless individual, so that the jury has been wont to return a docile, and, let Us hope, just verdict of not guilty in the face of much evidence- - As the honourable member for Denison has not heard these performances on the. part of the honourable member for Fawkner, I can quite understand his frame of mind. E v i dently, up' to the time, that he heard the honourable member for Fawkner, he had considerable doubt as to how he should vote on the clause. Having heard the honourable member, he rose in a quite unexampled paroxysm of conviction that he should vote as the honoraole member directed him to do.' There is a feeling that we should exclude the Bolsheviki from the Commonwealth. I propose to lose no opyoitunity to show in what-respects they are not so bad as they are painted. This is the testimony of American MethodistsThe Social Service Bulletin, a monthly sheet published in'New York by the Methodist Federation for Social Service, devotes its issue of February, 1010, to the Kussian question, and is an attempt to present, in summary form, an answer to such questions as, What is a Soviet? Who are the Bolsheviki leaders? ""What is their policy t Wihat are the facts about the Rod Terror? We should like to commend to the notice of Australian Methodists and other church folk the following extracts, which .may help to correct some wrong impressions about the Bolsheviki and their ' attitude to religion, education, and social reform:'Bolsheviki Cabinet. ""The present Russian Cabinet is, probably the most cultured in the history of the .world. All are experts upon a great many questionsSeveral have written books of philosophy and religion."" Bolsheviki Support Prohibition. "" Bolsheviki re-affirmed Czar's decision to banish vodka. Kolchak regime in Siberia, which Allied Forces support, is manufacturing vodka from' wheat that, without intervention, would go to feed Central Russia."" Bolsheviki and Y.W.O.A. ""Under Bolsheviki, the Y.W.C.A. opened and ,kept running clubs for women and girls in Petrograd and Moscow.. Though they helped rich and poor alike, the Soviet did not hinder their efforts. They wore permitted to make industrial investigations, though, using an interpreter opposed to Bolsheviki."" Bolsheviki and Y.M.O.A. ""Y.M.C.A., under Czar, had little co-operation and general prohibition. After the first revolution, the. Soviets quickly rallied to support of association. The Moscow Soviet gave buildings and full permission to work. When' the Bolsheviki came into power; Lunacharsky, Commissioner of Education, warmly appre-. ciated work of Y.M.C.A., asked that it be enlarged, re-affirmed all permissions of Kerensky regime. When it was difficult to get money,' Bolshevik authorities gave permission to Y.M.C.A. oflicer to draw two ' and a half millions out of State bank.

Brennan) has just dealt with. All sorts of opinions have been expressed about the Bolsheviks. We can read differing views on them in the New Europe, the Nation, the Athenaum,.&yid other papers-, but this clause does not deal with any particular names. Paragraph d does not deal with men who violate a particular Act of Parliament, or who come here and may be mixed up in strikes. It deals with men who are against: all forms of government.' That is practically what the clause is directed against. It has been suggested' that under this measure men who advocatecertain political views may be kept, out. by a Minister by an abuse of administration. I remind, honourable members that except in two or three very special cases, the dictation test, has never been used to my knowledge for any other purposethan to keep out coloured imr migrants-. The instructions given to the officers time after time call their attention to that. Instruction 56 says"" It is intended that the dictation test, which is to meet the case ""of coloured persons desiring to enter the Commonwealth, shall be an absolute bar to admission."" If it was used for any other purpose, it would not be necessary to specify the other classes that are mentioned in section 3 of the Act. In it a number of classes are specifically rer ferred to, and are, as such, prohibited i m migrants. They could have heen kept out by the dictation test, but it is not used for that purpose, so that no one can possibly assume that any Minister, without a breach, of the spirit of this Act and of the administration up to the present, could use the dictation test to keep out people who are not of the class against whom it was originally designed. Reference has been made to paragraph c, which mentions inmates of insane asylums and public charitable institutions. Under sub-section 5 of section 5 of the existing law persons of that class, if found in the Commonwealth, within three years of the date on which they came in, suffering from disease or disability, may be regarded as prohibited i m migrants, unless they convince the M in . ister that they were free from the disease or disability at the time they entered. The temper of that section really runs through the Act at present. The Minister may assume that a man who is suffering from a disease mentioned in the Act or prescribed by the regulations was suffering from it when he 'entered the Commonwealth, if he' is suffering from it within three years of the time of his immigration. administration, if the Minister is satisfied that a person who has become an in mate of an insane asylum or of a public charitable institution is suffering from any of those disabilities .within three years of his entry, the Minister can regard him as a prohibited immigrant. That means those particular persons only. Under the Act as it stands at' present, persons suffering from such disabilities may be declared by the.Minister to be prohibited immigrants, unless they show cause to the contrary, and are then liable to prosecution under section 7, and can on summary conviction be deported by the Minister. Y o u can scarcely charge an inmate of an insane asylum or charitable institution in a Court of summary jurisdiction with an offence, but that charge and hearing-is a condition for deportation under the Act as it stands. We are now putting that class of person under clause 7 of the Bill , so that they will not be prosecuted for an offence. Their cases will he inquired into hy a Board to be appointed hy the Minister. If anything may be regarded as a mitigation of the Act in relation to that particular class, this provision may be.",65
339,Mr RILEY,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,Do you allow any mental cases to come in now?,66
340,Mr GLYNN,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"They are not allowed in ; hut if a person is found suffering from mental, or physical disability with in three years of entry, unless he shows that he was not so suffering at the time he came in , he is liable to deportation under the existing Act, but only after prosecution in a Court of justice. We are putting this new provision in, because such persons should not be prosecuted in Court I regard, this paragraph, therefore, as a generous modification, in' connection with that class, of the existing Act. I ask honourable members, after the full debate that has taken, place, to allow a division to he taken.",66
341,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"Denison) [9.44]. -/The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson) has been unfair and unjust to me, because I merely quoted from the Bill . I said, "" I am going to vote in favour of this clause."" A m I not correct in assuming that, if the honourable member votes aigainst the clause, he is in favour of something which I am against? That is a logical and ' f a ir conclusion, and that is how I put it . Under the Mr FINLAYSON - It is hot how you put it .",66
342,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"I referred to honourable members opposite generally. I simply - asked for the attention of the honourable member for Brisbane, because I thought there was a little scheme on foot to talk me down. He and the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudorl were in close conversation, and, as I did not want them to hear only half of' what I said, I appealed to them, and the' .honourable member thought I was referring personally to him. I was not. I was simply referring to the clause which I had already read, particularly paragraph a, which reads- , Has been convicted in Australia of a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment forone year or longer. I shall vote for that' paragraph because I do not want that class of man to come into Australia; but, looking at the matter logically, I claim that if one votes against that paragraph the inference is that he is in favour of that type of man entering Australia. ThÂ© next paragraph is(b) Living on the prostitution of others. I shall vote for that paragraph because I do not believe, that that class of person should be permitted to enter the Commonwealth, and I contend that it is logical to say that any one who votes against the paragraph is in favour of the admission of that type of person.",66
343,Mr CHARLTON,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,Does not the able member realise that it can only be ascertained that a person comes witnin the scope of the paragraph he has quoted after he has resided for some time in Australia ?,67
344,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,Yes .,67
345,Mr CHARLTON,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"Then why does honourable member construe the attitude of honourable members wrongly, and say that we are in favour of the admission of bhese people because we object to refusing admission to them ?",67
346,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"Honourable members charge Ministers with doing certain things, and seek to avoid their own responsibility in regard to the matter. We have had reference to Bolsheviks. Let me quote an authority which every one will admit. The following cablegram appears in the Herald of the 28th August: Mr Samuel Gompers, President of the American Federation of Labour, who has returned from Amsterdam, declares that the Germans are still boastful and unrepentant. Referring to the overwhelming defeat at the International Labour Congress of ,the motion calling for organized Labour's support of the Soviet revolutions, he said:-The defeat of this proposition means the definite and final repudiation of Bolshevism by organized Labour of Europe and America - Act would I prefer that authority to the one quoted by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan).",67
347,Mr RILEY,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"South Sydney) [9.48J .1 probest against the onslaught of the honourable member for Denison (Mr . Laird Smith) when he pointed to us and said, These men who vote to allow persons who live on prostitution to come into Australia."" Honourable members of the Opposition are as honourable and clean living as any honourable member on the Ministerial side, and it is .a disgrace to this Parliament that an honourable member should take advantage of his position to slander a body of men with whom he has been closely allied. I did not think any honourable member would have such a filthy mind as to suggest what the honourable member has suggested. The honourable member for Denison also said that Mr Willis, Mr Rae,. and other men had been, expelled from the party. That is true. They have uot been deprived of their votes, but they have been expelled from the party, just as the honourable member himself [455] was expelled hy the very men to whom he now refers. In fact, they are merely honor- getting back a little of their own medicine. The pity of it is that tiiey were not expelled earlier. Under this clause, Mr Holman, the Premier of New South Wales, who at one time was sentenced to three years' imprisonment for conspiracy, could have the been deported. He took a risk to get a Labour paper launched, but it failed, and he was sentenced to three years' i m prisonment for conspiracy. The honourable member for Darwin (Mr Spence) has taken some great risks in this country.",67
348,Mr SPENCE,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"I always kept controi of my tongue. Although detectives followed me, they could not run me in .",67
349,Mr RILEY,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"H a d the honourable member been tried for conspiracy and convicted, and sentenced to imprisonment, he could have been deported if he - had been a new-comer to Australia. I do not believe that any Minister worthy of his salt would use the powers given under this Bill to deport people wholesale; but, as there are some people who would do so, we. are not justified in giving them the opportunity. We never anticipated that the War Precautions be extended and used for the purposes to which it was put. In the ' same way, we are taking great risks in giving Ministers the power contained in this Bill . The honourable member for Denison claims that if we vote against this clause we advocate the admission of the classes of individuals referred to in the various paragraphs; but Australia has been governed under the Eederal Constitution for the last eighteen years without any of these powers, and has not "" gone to the dogs."" Why, therefore, should we be stricken with the desire to place panic legislation on the statute-book? I am prepared-to take the responsibility of voting against the Bill , because I consider it is not necessary to pass this kind of legislation, and because I know that there is already in the Aet sufficient power to deal with all the classes of individuals referred to in this Bill .

350,Mr TUDOR,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"Yarra) [10.2] - I have not abated in the slightest the opposition I expressed to this Bill at the second reading stage, and while the various clauses were heing considered in Committee. I regret that the Government have brought forward this measure.. I regard it as panic legislation. Similar hysterical proposals have been passed by other Parliaments in the past. The honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd) was a member of the Victorian State Parliament when the Irvine Government introduced the Coercion Bill and gave special representation to the Public Ser-: vice. They thought at that time that the whole people were with them, but within a short period both Houses of the AYES. State Legislature unanimously repealed the measure. History will repeat itself in connection with this Bill. Honourable members opposite may go upon the platform and try to misrepresent members on this side. With the support of the press, which enters the homes of the people every morning, they may think themselves all-powerful. But the people of AusTellers : tralia think for themselves. They have been giving a demonstration of that fact today in the metropolitan area. So far NOES. as I can learn by telephone, it is not the Labour candidates who have been defeated in the municipal elections today. Tellers :  make a summer. ' PAIR SMr TUDOR - Of course not. But I am glad to say that the newspapers which have heen working against us have heen wrong in their anticipations. In my own electorate the Labour party has retained every municipal seat it previously held, and has gained others. Honourable members on the Ministerial side, particularly those who left the Labour party, say that we on this side are altogether wrong in our attitude. They will ascribe to us all sorts of motives. One honourable member threatened us that on the public platform he would let the people know how the members of this Opposition were anxious to let aliens enter this country. Honourable members may do that, and I , in return, shall tell the people how the Government are allowing German goods into the country, and how exports from this country are being sent via England and America to the very people who are supposed to be our lifelong enemies. Honourable members opposite said they would never trade with Germany. What an absurdity! What political hypocrisy! By this Bill they declare they will not admit persons of enemy race into Australia, and yet they will trade with Germans, Austrians, Bulgarians, and Turks, so long as' they can make dollars out of them. Money is the god of Ministerialists and their supporters. .The people of other lands may be compelled to continue to work und'er degrading conditions; but they shall not he allowed to enter Australia. One honourable member said that he would expose our attitude on every political platform. Of course, he will. This Bill is a political placard; it is camouflage, or, to use an old-fashioned word, deception, of the people.",68

352,Mr TUDOR,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"The Bill is a political placard designed for. the purpose of clouding the issue at present before the people, namely, the profiteering by which they are being robbed. Mr LAI RD SMITH (Denison) [10.6]. - In supporting the t h i r d reading, I desire to state that, in the remarks I made earlier this evening I had no intention of being personal; nor do I think I was. Honourable members opposite may think that they may speak as cruelly and harshly as they wish of their former associates who followed the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), and of those other men, who, the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley) said, ought to have been expelled from the Labour movement long ago. Surely honourable members must be prepared to accept a little of the hard hitting that they indulge in at our ex-, pense.

358,Dr MALONEY,RIFLE BARRELS FOR RIFL E,"Melbourne) [10.8] I propose to strike a note different from that struck by any other honourable member during the consideration of this Bill . Whilst I agree with certain portions of the measure, I regret that the Government, when framing the Bill , did not take into consideration, the fact that section 3 of the Act has caused more hatred and dislike of Australia than any other law passed by the British or Commonwealth . Parliaments. The dictation test has caused enmity and ill-feeling on the part of more than one-third of the human race. In other words, 400,000,000 people in China, 350,000,000 in India, and 70,000,000 people in Japan, resent that provision. The intelligent minds of those countries have not been deceived as to the purpose of the dictation test. I have heard a Minister declare in this chamber that by means of that test any person could be kept out of Australia. If an immigrant or traveller does not understand a passage dictated to him from a European language, he may be forbidden . to enter the Commonwealth. If he does Understand that passage, tests in other languages can be applied u n t i l he fails. One of those-nations was' an ally of the Commonwealth in the war; it helped to defend us, and its warships have protected our cities, because the good ship Australia, great as it may be, could not possibly defend our huge coast line.",69

The insults to that nation have been only by word of lip, - but also by newsJapanese; paper caricatures. ' Whilst I believe in the policy of a White Australia, would gladly give my life to preserve it, I will not be a party to insulting ally. Japan paid the greatest ment ever paid to our race and language will when she asked one of our most eminent in philosophers to advise her how to escape if entangling alliances and quarrels other nations. In reply, Herbert cer penned what, in the opinion of some indicated, of the greatest critics of literature, perhaps, the most important written by human hands. approach that nation, not with but with the sacred word rocity,"" which is a word jure with throughout The letter written by Spencer was so important confine my remarks to the reading of it, so that honourable members may see it in and Hansard, and realise how great a man he was, how much he was and why, in the pathos of that he asked the great nation of J apan not to publish his letter until he had passed into peoples the shadows. I quote from page 321 of the Life and Letters of Herbert To Kentaro Kaneko. Your proposal to send translations of two letters to Count Ito, the newly-appointed Prime Minister, is quite satisfactory. I willingly give my assent. Respecting the further questions you let me, in the first place, answer generally that the Japanese policy should, I think, be that keeping Americans and Europeans as much as possible at arm's length. In the more powerful races your position is one of chronic danger, and you should take every precaution to give as little foothold as possible - to foreigners. It seems to me that the only forms of lnterwhich sourse which you may with advantage permit are those which are indispensable for the ex-' shange of commodities and exchange of ideas - importatio n and exportation of physical and mental products. No further privileges should the honourable be allowed to people of other races, and especially to people of the more powerful races, than is absolutely needful for the achievement of these ends. Apparently you are proposing, Ausby revision of the treaty powers with Europe - and America, "" to open the whole Empire to foreigners and foreign capital."" I regard this Japan 'as a' fatal policy. If you wisli to see what is likely to happen, study the history of India. Therefore, I Once let one of the more powerful races gain .a. point d'appui and there will inevitably, in course of time, grow up an aggressive policy, not which will lead to collisions with the these collisions will be represented as attacks by the Japanese which must be avenged; forces will be sent from America or and Europe, as the case may be; a portion of territory will be seized and required to be made an over as a foreign settlement; and from this there will grow eventually subjugation of the complientire Japanese Empire. I believe that you have great difficulty in avoiding this fate any case, but you will make the process easy you allow any privileges to foreigners beyond with those which I have indicated. Spen- In pursuance of the advice thus generally I should say, in answer to your first is, Â» question, that there should be, not only a prohibition to foreign persons to hold property letter ever in land, but also a refusal to give them leases, We ought to and ithe permission only to reside as annual insults, tenants. "" recip- To the second question, I should say, deto concidedly, prohibit to foreigners the working of the mines owned or worked by Government. the Orient. Here there would be obviously liable to arrive Herbert grounds of difference between the Europeans that I shall or Americans who worked them and the Government, and tliese grounds of difference would immediately become grounds of quarrel, - would be followed by invocations to' the English or American Governments, or otlier misunderstood, powers, to send forces to insist oil whatever knowledge the European workers claimed; for always the habit here and elsewhere among the civilized is to believe what their agents or settlers abroad represent to them. In the third place, in pursuance of the policy SpenI have indicated, you ought also to keep the coasting trade in your own 'hands, and forbid 26th August, 1892. foreigners to engage in it. This coasting trade is clearly not included in the requirement I liave indicated as the sole one to be remy cognised- a requirement to facilitate expor; tation and importation of commodities. very The distribution of commodities brought to Japan from other places may be properly left ask, to the Japanese themselves, and should be denied to foreigners, for the reason that, again, of the various transactions involved would become so many doors open to quarrels, and represence of sult in aggressions. To your remaining question respecting the inter-marriage of foreigners and Japanese, which you say is "" now very much agitated among our scholars and politicians,"" and you say is ""one of the most difficult problems,"" my reply is that, as rationally answered, there 13 no difficulty at all. It should be positively forbidden. It is not at root a question of social philosophy. It is at root a question of biology. There is abundant proof, alike furnished by the inter-marriages of human races and by the inter-breeding of animals, that, when the varieties mingled diverge beyond a certain slight degree, the result is invariably a bad one in the long run. I have myself .been in the habit of looking at the evidence bearing on this matter for many years past, and my conviction is based upon numerous facts derived from numerous sources. This conviction I have, within the last half-hour, verified, for I happen to be staying in the country with a gentleman who is well known as an authority on horses, cattle, and sheep, and knows much respecting their inter-breeding, and he has just, on inquiry, fully confirmed my belief that when, say, of different varieties of Bheep, there is an inter-breeding of those which are widely unlike, the result, especially in the second generation, is a bad one-ther e arises an incalculable mixture of traits, and what may be called a chaotic constitution. And the same thing happens amongst human beings-the Eurasians in India and the half-breeds in America show this. The physiological basis nf this experience appears to be that any one variety of creature in course of many generations acquires a certain constitutional adaptation to its particular form of life, and other variety similarly acquires its own special adaptation. ' The consequence is that, if you mix the constitutions of two widely divergent varieties which have severally become adapted to widely divergent modes of life, you get a constitution which is adapted to.the mode of life of neither- a constitution which will not work properly, because it is not fitted for any set of conditions whatever; by all means, therefore, peremptorily interdict marriages of Japanese with foreigners. I have, for the reasons indicated, entirely approved of the regulations which have been established in America fbr restraining the Chinese immigration, and, had I the power, would restrict them to the smallest possible amount, my reasons for this decision being, that one of two things must happen. If the Chinese are allowed to settle extensively in America, they .must either, if they remain unmixed, form a subject race, in the position, if not of slaves, yet of a class approaching to slaves; or, if they mix, they must form a bad hybrid. In either case, supposing the immigration to be large, immense social mischief must arise, and eventually social disorganization. The same thing will happen if there should be any considerable mixture of the European or American races with the Japanese.. You see, therefore, that my advice is strongly conservative in all directions, and I end by saying aB I began-kee p other races at arm's' length aB much as possible. I give this advice in confidence. I wish that it should not transpire publicly, at any rate during my life, for I do not desire to rouse amendments. the animosity of my fellow countrymen. P.S - Of course, when I say I wish this advice to be in. confidence, I do the communication of it to Count Ito, but rather wisli that he should have the opportunity of taking it. into consideration. [456] It is stated in this work thatShortly after Spencer's death, the letter of 26th August was sent from Tokio for publication in the Times (18th January, 1904), which' wrote of it as giving "" advice as narrow, as much imbued with antipathy to real progress, as ever came from a self-sufficient short sighted Mandarin, bred in contempt and hatred of barbarians."" This means that Japan stood for a .policy such as we favour. Just as we support the policy of a White Australia, so she sounded the note of "" Japan for the Japanese,"" and appealed to a man of the strongest intellect m our race for advice. He said- Mr SPEAKER ' (Hon. W . Elliot Johnson) - I have heen waiting for the honourable member to connect his quotation with the question before the Chair. - Dr MALONEY - I have been endeavouring to show that it would have been better for the Government bo endeavour every to amend the principal Acb by removing from it a provision which gives great offence to one of our Allies - To sum up my argument, I am tryin g to show that it is not yet too late for the Government to make such an amendment of the Bill when it is before another place, and thus to extend a courtesy to an Allied nation, instead of insulting ib. We believe in the policy of a White Australia, and we should bell Japan thab we are seeking to follow the very example which Japan set us when she sought tbo advice of Herbert Spencer. In such circumstances Japan could nob bake offence ab our action, since "" imitation is the sinceresb flabtery."" If we were to tell Japan that we are seek1 ing to hold Australia just as the Japanese seek to hold their country, they would not regard our legislation in respect of immigration as an insult to them. We could also assure them, with no lack of firmness, that, jusb as they would be prepared to defend their country, so we are prepared to defend our policy of a Whibe Australia.
