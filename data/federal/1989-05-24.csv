1,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Leo Mcward Leay) took the chair at 9.15 a.m., and read prayers. CO-OPERATIVE SCHEME NA [COGNATE BILLS: COMPANIES (FEES: TAXATION COMPONENT) BILL 1989 COMPANIES (ACQUISITION OF SHARES-FEES: TAXATION COMPONENT) BILL 1989 SECURITIES INDUSTRY (FEES: TAXATION COMPONENT) BILL 1989 FUTURES INDUSTRY (FEES: TAXATION COMPONENT) BILL 1989] Second Reading Debate resumed from 12 April, on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen: That the Bill be now read a second time.",10
2,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I understand share that it is the wish of the House to debate the Co-operative Scheme Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 concurrently with Companies (Fees: Taxation Component) Bill 1989, the Companies (Acquisition of nies Shares-Fees: Taxation Component) Bill, 1989 the Securities Industry (Fees: Taxation Component) Bill 1989 and the Futures InExicom. dustry (Fees: Taxation Component) Bill 1989. There being no objection, the Chair will allow that course to be followed.",10
3,Mr MOORE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The Bills in show the package before the House today are those brought forward by the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities and are much rejected by the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen). Nevertheless, it has done a very commendable job in the performance of company law in Australia and the cooperadown. tive scheme. The elements of this package are the share buy-back scheme; the question of annual returns; the question of the new fast flexible accelerated security transfer tem, in other words, share transfers; the licensing provisions; and computerisation. ties Commission. Basically, we do not object to any of these matters. However, it is worthwhile to make some observations about what went on. The share buy-back scheme brought forin this package has been a long enduring process. I called for it l;lbout two years ago when I noted that as a consequence of the share market crash in October 1987 there was a very real need for an approach to share buy-back arrangements in Australia. 1989 The person who consistently stood in the road of it was none other than the Attorney General. MrLionel Bowen-That is not so.",10
4,Mr MOORE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,That is what even the Attorney-General's mates in the BusineSs Council of Australia say about the situation when they ring me as well as the Attorney General. They say quite clearly that everybody wants it but the Federal Attorney General is the man standing in the road of it.,10
5,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,No.,10
6,Mr MOORE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"All of the Attorney General's mates tell me that is the case. This legislative package is brought forward against the background in Australia of a number of buy-backs which have been done without a basis in law. These relate to Sunshine Wormald, Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, the Pioneer, APA,Armanda Pty Ltd, AFP, De Laqurentiis and Elders. All of these compahave done share buy-backs in different ways. As well as these a number of others include Brunckhorst, Clements Marshall and Shareholders' approval was sought in only seven of these cases. While this was being done there was quite clearly a need for the Ministerial Council to come forward and some leadership in this area. It did .. On a number of occasions the Ministerial Council pushed the line and came forward with a number of propositions on share buy-backs. The National Companies and Securities Commission did so on a number of occasions. Every time it got the Federal tpumbs .",10
7,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,That is wrong.,10
8,Mr MOORE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,That is my information. sysThe Attorney-General should ask the Chairman of the National Companies and Securi,10
9,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Who is he?,10
10,Mr MOORE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Last time. I heard it was Henry Bosch.,11
11,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Order! The Attorney-General will not interject.,11
12,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,I might take a point of order.,11
13,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,The Attorney can take a point of order but we will not have too many interjections.,11
14,Mr MOORE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The experience in these areas is very interesting. Overseas, when· share market crashed, IBM Australia Ltd, a notable company, put forward a share buyback scheme. It was done in this case when the market price had fallen substantially below the asset backing or the earning rate of that particular company. It allowed holders of IBM shares at that time. to sell their shares on a reasonable market in which the company was buying back the stock, and those holders of IBM shares who had to sell for financial reasons were winning. The shareholders of IBM benefited because those shares either went into Treasury or were cancelled: .As a consequence, earnings per share and asset backing per share were enhanced by that movement. On balance, there is no doubt that the share buy-back scheme was an important addition for Australia. .I will cite one or two things that happened .. In September 1987 the Companies and Securities Law Review Committee (CSLRC) submitted a report to the Ministerial Council recommending that share buybacks be permitted. This proposal was stalled a couple of times because of the Federal reluctance to allow any form of buy-back, even the most conservative. I quote Mr Speed of the Business Council, of Australia. He is one of the panel experts who has been pushing that line, which the Government has swallowed. He said, 'There is unanimous support in the business community for a more liberal approach, and the regulatory authorities and the Australian stock exchanges are in favour. I venture to say that until quite recently the Ministerial Council, with the exception of the Federal Attorney General, were in support'. The Ministerial Council eventually put forward an exposure draft in September 1988.",11
15,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Yes, September 1988.",11
16,Mr MOORE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"That is quite right, but a year before that, in September 1987, !he companies review committee was puttmg forward a report to the Ministerial Council. That is the time when Mr Speed was referring to the Attorney-General as the stumbling block.",11
17,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,He has never been to the meetings.,11
18,Mr MOORE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"No, but he must have a good leak. Plenty of leaks come out of those the meetings; they are all round the place.",11
19,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"They also have minutes, you know.",11
20,Mr MOORE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"That might well be, but leaks are better. We do not get to see the minutes, but we do get the leaks. Ministers' submissions on this point came out. The draft was criticised for being too restrictive. The Business Council said it was 'positively antagonistic' to Australian companies. Mr Speed went on to say there was 'gross political paternalism'. That is what he thought .of Federal views. Submissions were then conSIdered again at a meeting on 2 March this year. A number of major amendments were made in response to urgent pleas from the business community. The major stumbling block once again was the Attorney-General. That was the common agreement in March this year .",11
21,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"He is speaking about yciu. Even you have got one or two enemies, I suppose.",11
22,Mr MOORE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"No, Lionel, I cannot imagine you having any.",11
23,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Order! The honourable member for Ryan will not respond to the interjections.,11
24,Mr MOORE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The basic tenets of the Bill-the highlights-include the changes made to section 129 (10) which allow buybacks to take place. I will not go through the various mechanisms because of the time constraints on this Bill, and there are other interesting .aspects. The whole concept brought forward for share buy-backs, while commendable in itself and in the way in which it is done, is still subject to listing rules to be brought up by the Australian stock exchanges. Until such time as they come forward, as I understand it-and they have not yet-we will b- carrying on a process of share buy-backs with that arrangement. Only last weekend we saw in the newspapers another remarkable case where a deal was done between AFP and a certain proprietary company in which a significant shareholding in another major corporation was transferred to that proprietary company under a sub-underwriting agreement. The control of this public company has now been grabbed off-market by a proprietary company. No-one seems to worry about it, but it is quite clearly using the absence of any law regulating buy-backs. In my view, these matters are of concern. There are three types of buy-backs: the pari passu, selective buybacks and on-market buy-backs regulated by the stock exchanges. There are other matters which we could go into but, because of the guillotine and the restrictions placed on this matter by the Government, I will press on. Another aspect of the Bill is the form in which companies are now required to report to the corporate affairs commissions around Australia. It is said by some corporations that meeting the requirements of these annual returns will be a costly matter for them. That certainly will be the case in the first instance. However, I suspect that in the longer term the form of report sought by the corporate affairs commissions is probably the best. While it will cost money in the short term, we might well find that complaints in this area will not be justified. I can. understand those complaints, but it is quite clear that over the years a number of official corporation reports have lacked the substance and material which they ought to have. So we have no problem with that requirement. The matter of share transfers is one of the real bugbears of the stock exchanges in Australia. Every time the market gets under way there is a big build-up of paper within the offices of stockbrokers. Inevitably, scrip clerks cannot be found; scrip accounts are unable to be balanced, which leads to the temptation of fraud and switches being made. from one account to another to satisfy scrip demands; and after every boom-there· has never been one any different-the back offices of stockbrokers and many banks are in utter chaos. I can recall the Poseidon boom many years ago. In those days, $4m was a big turnover on the Australian market. Today by comparison, turnover got up to $400m at one stage and unless the turnover is around $150m people say the market has run at a loss. That shows the difference. At the time when $4m was a big turnover the partner in one broking firm in Melbourne said to me, 'Look, that entire wall has $7m worth of scrip in it. I really do not know how we are going to balance it.' This was an untenable situation for him. It must have been an excruciating experience for his banker. No doubt that is one of the reasons why, since the banks have bought into the brokers, there has been an acceleration of interest in this area. Unless the scrip can be moved there will be a huge .amount of money lying around in paid-for scrip, unpaid-for scrip, non-claimed dividends and non-protection for issues that have occurred in relation to unregistered transfers. This matter has now come forward, and I welcome it. I hope it is' a success because it may lead to better relationships for the consumer-in other words, the customer of the securities market. It is a far better idea. There Will need to be some protection relating to the use of a broker's stamp. In my day, those stamps were bandied around with gay abandon. I hope someone has investigated that registration of those stamps and where they might be held. There certainly would be an open go for unscrupulous dealers. I totally concur with licensing participants. The need to license every johnny who comes along and wants to deal in shares is an onerous task which the regulatory authorities will not be able to meet. The responsibility for it ought to fall on the principals. This is in line, in my view, with the acceptance of proprietorship and ownership in any game. It is just not feasible for a securities commission or a CAC to say, 'You are satisfactory but that guy is not'. On asking why the other guy is not, one might find that his background and ctiteria are no worse than those of the one approved but the one approved happens to come with a better introduction, which is common in the securities industry. The responsibiiity for this ought to fall with the principals associated with dealers in this area. The next point is the question of computerisation. This is one of the old furphies. We use as an excuse for dumping the cooperative scheme the fact that the computers are not compatible. That is one of the most remarkable arguments I have ever heard in my life. Because the computers are not compatible, the Governmentchllnges the law. What incredible nonsense. The Attorney General knows that as well as I do. If the computers are not compatible you fix the programs. We do not have to change' company law because the computers are not compatible. It is nonsense. It is one of the excuses the Government uses to camouflage the power push. It looks to the great barometer on the wall, the great Lionel Murphy corporate law for Australia. The Government is hung up on computerisation. It is a lot of nonsense. Of course the co-puters need to be compatible. They are there and they are of magnificent assistance, but if cannot be programmed it does not mean that corporate law needs to be changed. TQat is the most incredible amount of nonsense that I have heard for a long time. The l:Iser pays-",11
25,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,The resources are there.,13
26,Mr MOORE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Of course the resources are there and they have been there for a long time, but never put to the NCSG. ,",13
27,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,They are not 'put back into the business community. They are used as State taxation.,13
28,Mr MOORE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"If the Attorney-General had used the management committee that the Government established in recent times within the Ministerial Council and abided by its decisions, he would not be carrying on with all this nonsense. The Attorney is riding roughshod over the top of it. Members of C the management committee are people who were trained in the industry. They are not caught up in the hype of political nonsense., They put forward many sensible solutions which the Attorney-General <;lid not, pick up. As he did not pick them up he must not have understood their importance. They could have made the cooperative scheme far better at far less cost than this new scheme will cost.",13
29,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,After 10 years.,13
30,Mr MOORE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"It has taken the Attorney General six years. After six of those 10 years the Oovernment has not done anything about it. It has not even fixed up the computers. I now refer to the user pays principle which is very commendable. The business community does not reject it. In fact, it is in favour of it. If it gets a better service because of it, it is all to the good. It is quite happy to meet that situation. Because of the time constraints I will conclude my, remarks. The legislation is interesting. It has many good points in it and it confirms in many areas, particularly in computerisation, the hollowness of the claims of the Attorney-General relating to company law.",13
31,Mr SPENDER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"North Sydney) (9.32)We are here allegedly for the purpose of debating a number of Bills. These important Bills have been outlined in the second reading speech of the Attorney-General (Mr they Lionel Bowen). Some of the important provisions have been outlined by the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), who has just finished speaking. We have 50 minutes to 'debate' these Bills. So there is some record for the future of the way in which the procedures of this Parliament have been prostituted by this Government of known integrity-it speaks of its integrity every day-let me read onto the record the orders of the day. They read as follows: No. I-Co-operative Scheme Legislation Amend-, ment Bill-Resumption of debate on second reading; second reading; committee; adoption of report; third reading. (Bill under guiJIotine-Time allotted: second reading until 9.40 a.m we started at 9.15 a.m committee stage until 9.50 a.m. and the remaining stages 'until 9.53 a.m;) That is positively generous by contrast with what is allowed for the other Bills. They continue: No.2-Companies (Fees: Taxation Component) Bill-Resumption of debate on second reading; second reading; committee; adoption of report; third reading. (Bill under guiIlotine-Time allotted for the remaining stages until 9.56 a.m.)we get another three minutesNo- 3-Companies (Acquisition of Shares-Fees: Taxation Component') Bill-Resumption of debate on second reading; second reading; committee; adoption of report; third reading. (Bill under guillotine-Time allotted for the remaining stages until 9.59 a.m.)again, another generous three minutesNo.4-Securities Industry (Fees: Taxation Component) Bill-Resumption of debate on second reading; second reading; committee; adoption of report; third reading. (Bill under guillotine-Time allotted for the remaining stages until 10.02 a.m.)another generous three minutesNo.5-Futures Industry (Fees: Taxation Component) Bill-Resumption of debate on second reading; second reading; committee; adoption of report; third reading. (Bill under guillotine-Time allotted for the remaining stages until 10.05 a.m.) That means that for this whole complex legislation we get 50 minutes of parliamentary time. This is important legislation. We do not have time to talk about its importance, but its importance and its complexity can be gauged from the explanatory memorandum published by this Government. As everybody knows, the explanatory memorandum tries to explain in language that nonlawyers can understand-sometimes nonlawyers cannot understand the explanatory memorandum-what the legislation before Parliament is about. The explanatory memorandum for this legislation runs to 222 pages. I said earlier that the procedures of this House have been prostituted. The truth of the matter is that we have ceased to be a debating chamber on legislation of this kind. There is not one honourable member from the Government benches-save for the Attorney-General, who has the carriage of the Bill and who must be here-who has put his or her name down to speak on the Bills. I suppose the reason for that is obvious. There are honourable members on the Government benches who wish to speak on the Bills but they have been told that it is not the Government's desire that there should be any debate at all, that the purpose of the exercise is very simply that these Bills will proceed through the forms of the House and will be duly passed; so we may as well not be here. We seem to have substituted for debate in this chamber the processes of consultation outside this House which are perfectly right, preparation of exposure drafts which are perfectly sensible and reports on proposed legislation which are again perfectly sensible. There is no debate taking place in this chamber. This is the Government which came in saying that it was the Government of integrity. It tells us regularly, particularly at Question Time, that it is the Government which is concerned with the way in which Parliament operates, that it is concerned with parliamentary forms, and that it is led by a Prime Minister who really is committed not just to the Australian people but to the way in which this House operates. Of course we all know that is the merest fabrication. It does not matter. As the honourable member for Ryan has said, there are a number of very important proposals contained in this legislation, I sim"" ply refer to one and that is the provision for share buy-backs. I do not intend to go into the detail of it, but it will be known that for many years, indeed from the very beginning of company legislation, buy-backs by companies were, as a general rule, prohibited, They were prohibited on the basis that if a company buys back its own shares it is reducing its own capital. Now, sensibly enough I think, provision is being made for companies to buy back their own shares in certain circumstances. I will make one prediction and that is that the provisions are going to be abused. One of the things that we will have to do is to apply ourselves to monitoring what takes place when these Bills are brought into effect and companies then use the buy-back provisions. Buy-back arrangements can be set up for the purposes of entrenching management and certain shareholding positions. The Attorney General knows that and I can see his nodding at the table. There is in the legislation means by which-it is hoped-abuses can be prevented. But we all know that in the corporate field as in the taxation field and as in any field that deals with large amounts of money, there are many lawyers who spend many hours looking for ways around provisions. So it will be important for us to look at how they operate. Yet we cannot in this House today really examine how this legislation operates. We have only until the times I pointed out in which to deal with all the stages of the legislation. Another important provision in this legislation, to which the honourable member for Ryan referred, concerns the fast transfer system. That is, as the Attorney-General pointed out in his second reading speech-",13

'(2) The Commission may, if it considers that it is in the public interest to do so, bring an action under subsection (I) in the name of, and for the benefit of, the client. "". Amendments Nos 1 and 2 relate to agreements with unlicensed dealers and advisers, and they deal with the right of a client of an unlicensed dealer or an investment adviser to rescind agreements made with the unlicensed persons. Corresponding provisions to appear in the Corporations Bill. Accordingly, as that Bill has now been approved and passed by the Senate, it is necessary to amend the legislation presently before us. The Ministerial Council approved of this amendment because it is consistent with what is being done . Amendments Nos 3 arid 4 make corresponding amendments to the futures industry provisions, and these are the same as those that have been made to the securities industry provisions in relation to the rescinding of the agreements made with unlicensed persons. Again, these amendments correspond with the amendment to the proposed section 59c of the Securities Industry Act. The amendment removes the right of a client of an unlicensed futures broker or adviser to rescind agreements with the broker or adviser where the broker or adviser declares to the client within a reasonable time that he or she is not licens-d. Again, that had the approval of the Ministerial Council. I know that there is a time constra-nt, I would like to congratulate the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) raising the issue. The only point that ought to be said here in respect of what he was saying earlier is that, of course, all these matters are decided outside this Parliament. They cannot be amended, because the Minup, isterial Council determines these matters, der the arrangement. That is weakness in the scheme. I would like to respond to comments made by the honourable member for, Ryan (Mr directors Moore) in the second reading debate. I will not take up much time now, except to say this: I have always been in favour of share buy-backs, but one must also consider the matter of the fast track method of capital think reduction without having to go to court do it. The honourable member also spoke about creditors then having an opportunity to look at the situation. Regrettably, those situations still have not come to light. I do not want it thought that I have been holding up the matter. In fact, I went all way to the Australian Stock Exchange to talk about how we, might accelerate the position on the fast track, for example. The issue is not one of delay; the issue is perhaps one of incapacity to deal with the issues. From here on in, when we have our own' volved legislation and our own capacity, we will have more time to discuss the matter than perhaps any Minister or Ministerial Council has had up to the present time. When talking about money and resources, do, not ever get the fact that the States make substantial sums of money out of this legislation. They put very little back in. I shall hot take up the further time of the Committee, as the honourable member for Ryan might make some other comments.",15
33,Mr MOORE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The attiresponsibility tude taken by the Attorney-General (Mr ing that issue. Lionel Bowen), as it relates to creditors and capital reductions, is a totally valid one. At the same time it is important to recognise what a buy-back really means. It means that the capital of a company is reduced. The cash resources within the company are, used to reduce and buy back and cancel those shares. There is no provisioQ in the Cooperative Scheme Legislation Bill for what but one might call treasurising, or holding the shares in reserve-or warehousing them, I for guess-within the company. They must be cancelled. The cancellation of those shares means that the paid up capital is reduced; therefore, earnings per share will go up, and thel,'efore, in the main, asset backing will go particularly if the buy-back is pitched at una price which is less than net asset backing the great at the particular time. The question of fraud is there, and there is no doubt that in some areas cOrporate use buy-backs, or will use buy-backs, for, their mutual defence. I have no doubt about that. I am not aWllre of any walk 9f life in which the leadership does not act to defend itself. As a consequence of that, I that it is inevitable that that will occur. to But r would hope that corporate Australia would be strong enough to have some people speaking out about it, telling the truth about a few things. What has gone on in soine areas of corporate life in' Australia in the past two years the has been simply appalling. Open fraud has been committed in large corporations and very little' has been done about it until too late. The Rothwells situation is an open fraud. It involved a government and it inleading citizens, and spread from west to east. We have got the flow-on now in Sydney in the Yuill empire, which spreads from racing stables right through the community and in which a lot of innocent people forare involved, because certain people acted outside the law for their Own benefits. We call upon the Government to do something about this. In the early' days we called upon the Government to act, under section 291 (2) want to of the Companies Act.",16
34,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,The' NCSC has had since 1987. It is no good duck,16

36,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"They have had responsibility, John.",17
37,Mr MOORE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"No, but the Government had the power under the law and did not act in relation to it. As time has gone on the fraud in Rothwells has not become apparent. But there is more of that story to come-a lot more of it to come.",17
38,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,I'm sure there is. Why didn't they get to it?,17
39,Mr MOORE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Because the Government of Western Australia was covering it up.,17

44,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Why didn't the NCSC do its job?,17
45,Mr MOORE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I want to know why the Federal Government did not do its job. The Attorney should not worry about the NCSC. It is not answerable here; it is answerable the Ministerial Council. However, the Attorney is answerable to Parliament, and he is responsible under section 291 to order cial investigation in the national interestbut the Attorney saicJ that he did not know anything about it. He walked away from it; because he had his political mates over there in the Western Australian Government, with a State election just down the track. The Attorney-General stood back and said that he did not know.",17
46,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Not so. It is just a weak excuse by you. One minute you want the NCSC and the next thing you want to override it.,17
47,Mr MOORE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Yes, I do want the NCSC, because I think it has done a particularly good job.",17
48,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,It didn't do it.,17

84,Mr MOORE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The only point that I wish to make is that for some considerable time the operators in the futures market and on the stock exchanges have been concerned as to the responsibility that fits to their employees.' In the days before incorporation, the employer-employee relationship, under partnership or sole trader provisions, was quite clear. Later, the stock exchanges' move to have a qualification inserted for these employees was a step in the right direction. In more recent times, because of the fast-developing nature of the stock exchanges, it was provided that every person operating in an exchange had to seek a licence. That was very fine, but, in my judgment and, I think, in the judgment of the corporate affairs commissions, it did not do anything to improve the integrity or quality of some of the people concerned. Except financially, it did not transfer the responsibility from the employer back to the commission. In those circumstances, there was less authority in handling those areas of responsibility. In this case, the responsibility is dragged back to the employer or the corporation concerned, with fewer licences. It is a commendable step, and I hope that it will help to solve certain management problems in the securities area. In the futures market there has been a lot of difficulty, and that will continue. Very large risks are run on margins. In those circumstances there is a bigger role for what I would call fidelity guarantee than there is in the share market itself. In Australia the futures market is relatively small, but it will increase as the years go on. It will become a more international scene, with bigger players. There are far bigger risks in the licensing of operators and in the handling of the various individuals in those areas than there are in the stock exchange or in banking.",18
85,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"This matter deals with the fees. The cooperative scheme fees are going to be increased substantially. For example, the prescribed maximum fee will be increased from $1,000 to $5,000. This is all about increasing the resources for the cooperative scheme, particularly the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC). Of course, the NCSC has always been bedevilled by shortage of resources, as the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) will acknowledge. It has only limited access. to . the resources of the State corporate affairs commissions and it has always used that as a reason for being unable to carry out all the investigations that might be needed. It is also one of the reasons it has given for being unable to introduce a compatible on-line computer system. The Commonwealth's .difficulty has always been in having to fund the scheme to the extent of 50 per cent, while the States make a profit of some $80m out of it. Those are the difficulties that have arisen in the past. We can talk until we are blue in the face at the ministerial committee, which includes representatives of all the State governments, but all those representatives are under instructions from their treasuries not to put more into the scheme than they have to. Nevertheless, in fairness,.it must be said that the NCSC has always. wanted more resources. One of the great weaknesses of the scheme arises from the fact that the Act proposed an agreement giving the NCSC access to all State corporate affairs resources1,500 employees, as well as funds. That is the difficulty. The business community has always been very generous, and it is going to have to be more generous because these fees are being increased substantially.",19

88,Mr MOORE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"This is the last of the group. of Bills and, as the guillotine period has not quite expired, I want to rehash a couple of points and to put on the record just where .we are. This package of Bills has come to us as a consequence of a decision of the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities. Because of the passage here last night of the Australian Securities Commission Bill, it probably will be the last package of Bills to come here recommended by the Ministerial Council. That implies there is a transitional position which the Attorney General (Mr Lionel Bowen) does not have. I do not know what he is going to do in relation to future amendments in company law, between now and the establishment of the Bowen scheme. I do not know what is going to happen. Does the Attorney know what is going to happen? I presume there are to be no more commitments coming forward from the Ministerial Council to the Federal Parliament. There are no amendments from there. The Attorney does not know what the transitional arrangements are. There will be legal, constitutional challenges to company law down the track, which will take months. Having hap those challenges, the Attorney will still be no better informed as to what the transitional arrangements will be. The States have said they will not cooperate in certain areas. So as a consequence of that, we are now in a position of great uncertainty. We will not have any more submissions from the. Ministerial Council relating to company law amendments, I presume.",20
89,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"You have got to look at the challenges, haven't you?",20
90,Mr MOORE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,That is quite right. ·How long are the challenges going to take?,20
91,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,It depends on the proclamation. You ought to know that.,20
92,Mr MOORE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Think of the court process. The Attorney ought to know about that. The court process is not quick in relation to such matters. We have now effectively been put, because of the Attorney's actions, into a state in which there will be no more amendments to company law until some time in the future when the transitions occur, when the new offices have been taken up and when there has been some acceptance of what the employees of all the State corporate affairs commissions are going to do around Australia. In this time, companies within Australia will be in an area of uncertainty- Lawyers in Australia are at this point totally uncertain of the position in all these matters . The issues which pass through here this morning will probably be the last to be dealt with in a rational sense and no more changes will occur probably for years because of the Attorney's actions in relation to these matters. It is worth putting those points on the record, because this whole approach of the Commonwealth to company takeovers has been ill thought out. There has been no discussion of any major consequence around Australia, except for the Edwards Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation. It was the only group that went around Australia, though on a very short timetable, talking to the people concerned in this area. The Attorney has ignored that COIllmittee; he has ignored the rest of Australia. As a consequen<;:e of that, the Attorney-General now ha- a very unsure base on which to attempt to establish this new scheme. I am quite sure that not' one of the law associations or societies of Australia would at this time be in a position to comment, with surety, on what is in the Bill and what the likely transactions will be. They will be the ones advising the corporations of Australia on, what position they should take relating to 'the future. That is a great way to go about the operation. The Attorney has created total havoc in these particular matters.",20

94,Mr MOORE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I will give the Attorney one minute; no trouble at all. I must express my concern about that particular action. The other hallmark of the Attorney's company law administration has been the disgraceful way in which he has not used section 291 as it relates to investigations in Western Australia. What has happened there is an absolute disgrace. He has to accept hi- share of responsibility for it. On top of that, under this Attorney-General we have seen the collapse of the companies scheme and the introduction of a centralised scheme-the greatest transfer of power since Federation without a referendum. This is the way the Minister has had to do it, because he cannot win referendums. He has got this great grab bag of constitutional pegs to try to hang things on. Because I am a generous man, 'I will give the Attorney that minute he referred to earlier.",20

I asked Mr Bosch on a number of occasions whether he would want the Commonwealth to take it over. He said no. He said, 'I am investigating it now and have been since 1987'. Let me make it very clear, in relation to transitional provisions, that we can proclaim the law in sections. There might be challenges; there might not be challenges. If there are no challenges, the Federal law will operate. If there are challenges, the Federal law will not operate. That will be the issue. I cannot understand the incompetence of the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) to understand that the position is a transitional one. Of course, the law can be the subject of challenge. I will not confuse the business community. If the challenges come we will not proclaim in those areas. That is the first thing to say. We will proclaim the Australian Securities Commission.

98,Dr HEWSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL,"1I have pleasure in leading our side's contribution to the cognate debate on these three Bills, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) ,1989, the Income Tax (Interna' tional Agreements) 'Amendment Bill 1989 and the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1989 [No.2]. I foreshadow that at the committee stage I will move a technical amendment to the first of those Bills, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill, which relates to the role of the Australian Taxation Commissioner in releasing tax information to various police and other agencies. I will move, a second reading in principle amendment to the third of these Bills, the sales tax Bill. I will be moving: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House notes: (1) the Government's failure to reform the ramshackle indirect tax system v.:hich is littered with inconsistencies and anomalies; (2) the fact that the Commonwealth Ombudsman has criticsed the administration of sales tax, in particular that it is unfair to expect taxpayers to operate in a self-assessment system in an atmosphere of uncertainty and without an efficient advisory service or a regular 'and timely monitoring system; and (3) that this Bill arose fundamentally because of the Government's blatant exercise of attempting to manipulate the CPI by replacing excise tax on beer with a sales tax on normal strength beer'. Before I go into some of my specific points on this debate, I too must register my disgust with the appalling mismanagement of the Parliament by this Government and the fact that a very large number of Bills are being jammed through without the appropriate time for debate. The very essence of our parliamentary system is that we have genuine debate on a lot of these issues. Debate is bad enough in this place without legislation being jammed through at the discretion of a government that is really quite out of control in all respects, not only in its management of the Parliament but also in its management of itself and of course, most importantly to the Australian people, its management of the economy, its record of which is a litany of one disaster after another. We are now in the midst of the second major economiccrisis in the life of the Hawke Government. Turning to the tax Bills themselves, I think I should make a few general comments on tax, namely, that the Government, in its 12 April statement, brought in some tax cuts which will take effect from 1 July. Everybody should understand that even after those tax cuts have been delivered, the Hawke Government will remain the highest taxing government in the post-war history of Australia. It seems to have absolutely no concept of what is required in the area of tax reform. Its concept of tax reform in 1985 was first to have debilitating and very poorly managed public debate about a lot of the issues which resulted in nothing short of just a range of new taxes. Very little genuine reform emerged out of that process. Of course, as a result, we have seen a situation where the average income earner in this country is still subject to about a 40 per cent marginal rate-I think it is 40* per cent, including the Medicare levy. That will apply even beyond the tax cuts on 1 July. The Government has embarked on a blatant political exercise of giving back but a part of the tax increases that it has achieved by stealth in recent years, namely through bracket creep. If we take the Access Economics estimate of bracket creep, that is make the legitimate assumption that the Government wanted to maintain the real value of tax cuts given after the 1985 summit, and if .we. index the tax scales from 1986-87 onwards, we find that by the end of next year the increase in tax revenue as a result of bracket creep will be some $10 billion. The tax cuts that are being given on 1 July are half that amount. So the Australian electorate is only getting back half of what has already been taken from it through bracket creep. That is only part of people's plight under this Government. They have been hit to leg by substantial increases in home interest rates and other factors which have significantly reduced their standard of living over the life of the Hawke Government. Thtl sorts of comments the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) make in this House and elsewhere are part of a disinformation process to throw people off the - cent but the Australian electorate is too smart for that and it understands the extent to which it has been hit to leg by this Government on tax. Similar comments can be made about the sales tax area. It is another area in which the Government had gone very quiet in recent· days, I think principally because of the extent to which it has been able to rip off the Australian public in the most ridiculous fashion. Honourable members should remember that the Treasurer reconfirmed his position that there will be no new broad based consumption tax under the Hawke Government. The reason he says that is that he has pulled so much money out of s,ales tax, the largest of the present consumptiol). taxes, t-at I gather he is boasting these days that he doe- not really need it, he has more than he otherwise expected to get siQIply from the sales tax increases alone. .. If we look at what has happened to sales tax revenue in the life of this Government, we see that there has been a veritable' explosion of revenue. For example, in the Budget this year there was an estimate of an increase in sales tax collections of about 14.4 per cent, which was about three times the rate of inflation the Treasurer forecast would apply this year-about 4t per cent. But in the latest statement of Commonwealth financing transactions, we see that sales tax revenue is up not by just 14.4 per cent which, as I say, is ludicrous in itself; it is up by 24.1 per cent in the nine months to March 1989 over the nine months to March 1988. It is likely that sales tax collections this year will be about $9 billion, which is 2t times higher than they were under the Fraser Government. The Government likes to make manY,comparisons between itself and the Fraser Government. Close scrutiny in all these cases suggests that it comes out very poorly. In the six years of the Hawke Government we have seen sales tax revenue go up by about 150 per cent, which is roughly three times the rate of inflation over that period. It is roughly twice the increase in personal consumption expenditure. It is a rip-off by anybody's standards. At present sales tax revenue will make up about 10 per cent of total Government revenue. Again, if we want to make the Fraser Government comparison, it was 6 per cent or 6.1 per cent l!nder the Fraser Government. The sales tax system is a grossly inefficient system and it is subject to a number of particular problems. Before I identify some of the anomalies, inconsistencies ahd so pn, let me make a couple of other points.",21
99,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member for Wentworth foreshadowed an amendment. For the benefit of honourable members in the chamber, I understand that that amendment is to be circulated in a moment, but it is not yet available.",23
100,Dr HEWSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL,"The technical amendment will be circulated. I have read into the record the second reading amendment on the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill [No.2). I want to make two other points. Twice a year the excise on alcohol, cigarettes and petroleum products is indexed automatically. That is another way in which the consumption tax base of the system is being raised by this Government without its having to come out in a very public sense and declare the amount of the increase that is brought on as result of indexation and the extent to which the price of those products goes up. The Treasurer has found new ways to broaden the tax base in various Budgets. For example, in the last Budget he introduced a 20 per cent sales tax on wrapping goods such as plastic wrap, .food containers and so on. But most of the time he has not been prepared to come into the Parliament and identify where· he has brought in the sales tax base. I gather that most of it has been done by revisions of rulings and quietly broadening the base behind the scenes rather than specific decisions that have been included in Budgets or announced publicly, against which the Treasurer could be held accountable. The whole indirect tax system is grossly inefficient and overflows with anomalies and inconsistencies. It distorts the consumption choices by taxing some goods rather than others and some a lot more heavily than others. It is quite an irrational system which is unfair in many cases in its. impact. For example, there are taxes on items such as ice-cream; orange juice, flavoured milk, snack foods and so on, but other items such as $1,000 ball gowns, pornographic magazines and so on are exempt from sales tax. There is also a host of other very difficult to explain anomalies in the system which arise because of the classification of particular goods under the different rate sales of the wholesale sales tax system. For example, snack foods are taxed at different levels for no logical reason; different brands of similar biscuits are taxed at different levels; toys incorporating musical movements are taxed at higher levels than toys without, even if these toys play music by means of an electronic chip. There is not too much sense in the indirect tax system and the wholesale sales tax system in particular. It is obviously a very narrowly based tax which means generally that to get the sort of revenue that the Government is getting out of it, higher tax rates are required to raise the same amount of money. As I said before, because the goods are taxed at different levels, this factor alone significantly influences production and consumption decisions. People with the same incomes can have quite different lax burdens simply because they buy different goods. Moreover, the complexity of the multiple rates and exemptions leads to high administrative costs and a whole advisory industry has been built up around what is now an unbelievably complicated system. Against that background, I think it is worth drawing the attention of the House to the recent statements by the Ombudsman, who has drawn the Commissioner of Taxation's attention to several problems which became evident in the course of his handling complaints about sales tax. It is one of the elements in my second reading amendment. The Ombudsman was concerned that, with an audit crackdown on sales tax imminent, these problems could mean that audit activity would have unfair results, especially with regard to penalties. He listed what he thought were the most significant problems with the current sales tax system. I will quote from the Administrative Review No. 50 of April 1989: The most significant problems are: uncertainty about key provisions of the sales tax legislation giving rise to confusion both within and outside the Taxation Office, and to disputation; disadvantage to taxpayers because of the requirement to assess for themselves which goods are taxable and at what rate, leading to difficulty in the absence of an efficient inquiry system, in establishing correct liability for particular transactions; absence of regular monitoring of sales tax returns by the Taxation Office so that taxpayers' errors are not detected in time to prevent significant arrears of sales tax, which continue to accrue until detection; inconsistent advice and decisions from regional offices which may put some manufacturers at a significant competitive disadvantage; and difficulties in obtaining refunds of overpaid tax. The Ombudsman expressed the view that it unfair to expect taxpayers to operate in a self-assess'ment system in an atmosphere of uncertainty and without an efficient advisory service or a regular and timely monitoring system. It is equally unjust to penalise them for innocent errors resulting from deficiencies. I think that is a pretty sad commentary across the board on the nature of the wholewho sale sales tax system and its inefficiencies. Let me move on to the sales tax amendment' Bill which deals with a specific case. The main purpose of the Bill is to amend the sales tax Act to give effect to the Treasurer's announcement of 13 February that only tles that are for repeated use in the marketarrangements ing of alcoholic beverages qualify for exemption from tax at their initial acquisiclaims tion by a brewer or a wholesaler of such beverages. The Bill has extended parallel treatment to beer kegs. The House will recall that the first two elements of this legislation arose from a move by Carlton and United Breweries (CUB) legitimately to exploit provision under item 94 of the first schedule of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifiapparently cations) Act which exempts from sales tax beer bottles that bear a moulded notification that they remain the property of the plier. This matter received a good deal of media comment and attention at the time, much which was ill-informed, before the Treasurer in a press release on 13 February announced that he was repealing items 94 and 94A of the first schedule and extending item cover returnable bottles used for marketing alcoholic beverages. I want to make a numthat ber of quick comments on this. In a sense ruary stated: they are in defence of the way CUB was treated, but not exclusively so. First, the whole situation arose simply because of a short term politically expedient decision by the Treasurer to fudge the consumer price index (CPI). He has developed a capacity in recent years to move the goalposts rather than address the issue. With the issue of inflation, he has now moved the CPI on two occasions in the last nine months in order to make the inflationary situation as measured by that indicator somewhat better than it is. This is a classic case where the Treasurer sought to lower the CPI by about one-half sales of one per cent by reducing the excise rate on beer and simultaneously introducing a is sales tax on normal strength beer. Obviously, this was another one of those classic unintended consequences of government policy that is rushed through for a particular short these term political reason without any thought about the full impact of the change. In this case it is the Treasurer and not anybody else is directly responsible for the situation that developed. If the Government had thought it through at the time, I believe it might have offered a quite different response. Secondly, some of the media reports left an overwhelming impression that CUB had botmade some material change in its business following the Budget to take advantage of the exemption. In fact, CUB to have leased bottles from the manufacturers, Bottle Co. of Victoria, since 1903. It also appears that CUB had not at first realised that it was entitled to an exemption under item 94. Hence, in the months immediately following the Budget it is possible a that CUB could have paid more tax than was legally required under the Act. Thirdly, CUB had not attempted to profit directly from the loophole in the sales tax system. The company simply sought to gain supa competitive advantage over brewers by passing on to beer consumers prices which were about lc per bottle lower than they of otherwise would have been. What a dreadful thing it is to pass on a sales tax saving in the form of lower prices! Apparently there was another brewer already taking advantage 95 to of the situation or about to. The final comment I make about this is the Treasurer's press release of 13 FebIt is the view of the Australian Tax Office that tax remains payable on the bottles. However, to avoid potentially protracted litigation and to restore certainly in the market place the Taxation Office has recommended that legislation be amended to clarify the issue. It appears .to me somewhat curious that, having received advice from the Tax Office that CUB's arrangements 'would not be efCommissioner fective under the existing sales tax law', Treasurer felt compelled to resort hastily again to government by press release to detralian fuse the issue. As a result, the existing emption under item 95 (1) for bottles for repeated use in marketing non-alcoholic erages and cordials was extended to cover returnable bottles used for the marketing alcoholic beverages. This Treasurer has a total disregard for the processes of business and the welfare of the Australian community. He just goes off playing his stupidmation and no better than that-political games at the expense of the Australian people. They are fed up with it. They want to see a situation where the Treasurer comes into the Parliament and acknowledges 'that he has problem. He has never made a mistake, if one listens to him. But he has a problem. Inflation is out of control and is accelerating, and the extent to which he has gone to fudge the CPI by changing the treatment of ing costs and by artificially lowering, if like, the price of beer is a sad commentary on what he thinks is important and what he thinks is an appropriate policy response to the circumstances that exist in this country. Nobody in the electorate is going to be fooled. Anybody who goes to the supermarprotected ket at the weekend or at any knows what is happening to the rate of inflation. It does not really matter what the Treasurer says it is, it does not matter what measure he uses and it does not matter how many times he moves the goalposts. The Australian community will vote with its at the next election on his gross mismanagecountry ment of the Australian economy. The final comment I make relates to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3). The purpose of this Bill is to make a number small technical changes, I guess, specifically to tax capital gains and allow a deduction for losses on the disposal of traditional curities, to exempt from the application sales capital gains tax-a classic oversight, another unintended consequence of this Government's rush to its capital gains tax-those who reside in retirement villages, and to make some other minor changes in relation to gifts and so on. The key change, and the 'one I want to focus on, is the amendment of the taxation secrecy provisions to allow the of Taxation to disclose at his the discretion tax information to specified law yet enforcement agencies, these being the AusFederal Police, the State and Northexern Territory police forces, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Natiorial Crime Aubevthority and State and Territory corporate affairs commissions in certain circumstances, of and the Australian Customs Service. It is said that the legislation contains tight controls that may be placed on any inforprovided by the Commissioner. We do not think this is enough. We do not think it goes anywhere near protecting what has been a basic tenet,to my mind, of the taxation system in this country-that is, the sea crecy of our returns to the Commissioner. The situation used to exist in this country where the electors had confidence that when they declared honestly their position in relation to tax, it would stay with the Tax housCommissioner and would not go anywhere you else. Of course, I can see a genuine need in cases where tax information may be important in certain police investigations, particularly of major crimes. So our concern is not with the principle, if you like, of releasing the information so much as to make sure that when that information is released it is and that it is released only under other time certain circumstances. If one took the extreme case here, one could have the Tax Commissioner, who under this Bill is given the discretion to decide when to release this information, becoming feet a mini-crime buster, running around the making decisions on these sorts of things, on his terms and his standards and so on. What we seek to do in the foreshadowed the amendment that has been circulated - in my name is to specify· the circumstances under of which that information can be made available, to offer some prevention or safeguard mechanism for the distribution of that inforsemation and to ensure that its secrecy is preof served. Effectively, we have suggested a mechanism whereby the law enforcement agency must formally reque-t the information, it must set out the information it wants and why, the approval must be obtained from a Federal Court judge, and an embargo will be placed on the dissemination of that information. We have given the Privacy Commissioner a particular role in that respect. On this, basis I look forward .to the committee stage debate on that amendment.",23
101,Mr LAVARCH,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL,"There are three Bills before the House for debate. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) contains a number of significant changes to Australian tax laws about which I will speak a little later. The Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill puts in place an agreement with the People's Republic of China for taxation purposes, and that is to be welcomed; it is not particularly controversial. The third measure, the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill [No.2], amends the sales tax legislation to overcome the attempt by a company under the control of the Federal President of the Liberal Party, Mr Elliott, not to pay sales tax on beer bottles. Despite the explanation put forward by the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth, (Dr Hewson), as to the actions of Carlton and United Breweries, there is not much doubt in the mind of the general public that Mr Elliott and his company were attempting to avoid taxation. That is perfectly consistent with the Liberal Party's practice in office. During the Fraser years, the only strong growth industry in Australia was that of tax avoidance. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the Federal President of that Party, the man who wants to enter this place and depose the current Leader of the Opposition, given the opportunity, would attempt to avoid taxation for his company. Anyone who genuinely believes that the avoidance of this taxation by Carlton and United Breweries would lead to the reduction in the price of beer is particularly naive. Mr Elliott came out with this claim only because he was caught out on this practice. When ducking for cover, he said he would reduce the price of beer. I very much doubtthere would have been any reduction in price. There would have been a bit more profit in the hands of Carlton and United Breweries and a bit of self-congratulation on the part of Mr Elliott and the board of the company for getting around the tax system; that would have been the end of it. The shadow Minister made reference to the guillotine which is currently in place and decried its imposition. He said it was an abuse of the parliamentary process. I suggest the honourable member direct his attention to his colleagues in the Senate. Let us make no mistake about it: the guillotine has been put in place because of the practice of the conservative parties and the Australian Democrats in the Senate. When debating legislation, they put virtual restrictions on this. House as to when legislation must be passed in order to be discussed by the Senate. That puts pressure on this House. If people are genuinely concerned about the conduct of debate in this House, they should also be concerned about the abuse of debating practices in the Senate. That is why a guillotine is in place. The Government has no desire to limit debate; quite the contrary, it desires to get legislation through in order to govern this country, despite the restrictions placed on this House by the Senate. The shadow Minister talked generally about tax policy and said that this Government was the highest taxing government of all time. This Government has reformed the Australian taxation system which. was left in utter and total disrepair and disrepute by the Liberal and National parties 'when they were in government. As I pointed out, the only growth industry in this country during their time in office was that of tax evasion and avoidance. During their time in government we had a decline in corporate taxation, relative to personal taxation; more and more of the burden was put on ordinary pay as you earn taxpayers and less on corporations and those who were able to arrange their affairs to avoid taxation altogether. We had taxation by choice; people who could cash out their income did so, while taking fringe benefits. Capital gains for speCUlative purposes were not taxed and the corporate taxation system was in disrepair. The ludicrous situation of double taxation of dividends and the like militated against productive enterprises. The Government has addressed each of those issues. It has reformed the Australian taxation system and has it working in a way that is serving the interests of this nation. Certainly, there has been an increase in the taxation take because new taxes have been introduced, but that has meant that many people who simply avoided paying tax in the past are now paying it. 1 do not think too many tears will be shed by ordinary Austracan lians because those who have free lunches, cars and overseas holidays will now pay tax and the ,revenue so acquired will go to Government. Not too many tears will be shed about the increased taxation from those sources. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill being (No.3) makes a couple of important being changes. First, it makes clear that the emption from capital gains tax applies units in retirement villages. As honourable members would understand, the principal sole residence of an individual, when sold, not subject to a capital gains tax. With the growth of retirement villages throughout Australia and the general ageing ulation, far more people are living in retirement .villages. They may sell their units such villages and move into a hostel or nursing home. It is not a matter of any debate that the sale of those retirement units should be free of capital gains tax. Another important change is to exempt from taxation maintenance payments reas ceived by custodial parents in respect of dren. That is important because it dovetails a number of reforms that have been underis taken in the area of support of children the reforming of the collection of maintemissioner, nance under the Family Law Act. As situation now stands, a sole parent in receipt of a supporting parent benefit or a widow's pension can earn additional income without affecting the amount of pension received, allowed under the income-free test under Social Security Act. A sole parent can also now receive. maintenance payments for chilprovisions dren from the non-custodial parent without affecting his tax liabilities. This, in itself, of no great moment, but it fits into of measures which have been introduced to help support children in single parent fa-i­ lies. It will help to improve the financial position of those families and, in particular, those children, so it is very much to welcomed. The other significant matter in this legislation is the change to the taxation secrecy provisions in relation to giving the Taxation Commissioner some discretion to give information to police authorities and the National Crime Authority, if he has a suspicion that an indictable offence is being committed. He at' least bring to the attention of those authorities his suspicions. It should be made perfectly clear that any information given to the the Taxation Commissioner cannot then be used in evidence in any court proceedings which may stem from that information going to a police authority, some investigations undertaken, and a charge then possibly laid. The information given by the Tax ex-Commissioner cannot be used as evidence. to We have to balance the very real need for privacy in relation to tax records-that is a or long-standing commitment on both sides of is Parliament-with the equally important social objective of making sure that those engaged in large-scale crime are caught and of the popbrought to justice. It is a difficult area and one in which in people can have legitimately different viewa points which they can hold with some conviction. The Government has put in place very strict provisions in relation to the use of this information. The ultimate safeguard is that the information cannot be tendered evidence in any court proceedings. On chilbalance, the provision deserves support. It should be pointed out, however, that if there a conviction-not necessarily resulting from and any information given by the Taxation Combut one which involves the subsethe quent use of the proceeds of crime legislation-only afte,r such conviction can the Tax' Commissioner release certain information to work out the assets that the conas victed person holds and what sort of action the should be taken by the court to determine whether the proceeds of crime legislation apply to that particular case. All in all, the legislation before the House is is important. It makes some significant reforms the range and it is worthy of full support.",26
102,Mr DONALD CAMERON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL,"1 will confine my comments to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3). At the outset I wish to issue a stern protest be about the manner in which this Parliament is being used and converted into a sausage making machine to push through some 25 pieces of legislation in a couple of days. It is an utter disgrace, and the explanation given by the previous Government speaker, the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), that the Senate has a time limit on the point at which it will receive fresh legislation is countered easily by the fact that all the Parliament has to do is to sit an additional week to allow proper consideration of what is ostensibly extremely important legislation in content and in principle. We watched the spectacle yesterday of the Government's wasting two hours of the time of this place in an attempt to point score from the Opposition, arid I am happy to say that that action rebounded upon it. Honourable members opposite come in here putting restrictions on the time available for consideration of legislation and trying to· explain away that restriction by blaming the Senate. Let me say that there is a certain irony in the fact that the Senate exists, because, if there is any party in this Parliament that is committed to the abolition of the Senate, it is the Australian Labor Party. Yet as a nation we should be extremely grateful that that place exists, because if it did not, this piece of important legislation would not be subjected to the scrutiny that it deserves. I also protest at the time made available to consider this legislation. Although it was introduced into the Parliament in the last ·week of sitting, the Opposition parties were able to consider it only yesterday, and I am sure that the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), will confirm my claim that I have contributed substantially to suggestions to tighten up some of the aspects of the unfettered powers that were to be presented to the Australian Taxation Commissioner. Public concern is often expressed that supposedly confidential tax related information is being tossed back and forth between government departments, and indeed that concern is a stark reality. After six years of what I describe as an interventionist Labor Government, we have become used to government departments and instrumentalities prying into what was regarded previously as supposedly private affairs. Examples of government departments and bodies that can assess our personal taxation informationand I do not suggest that all this has come into place in recent times-are the Department of Social Security for the administration of pensions, allowances and benefits; the Department of Employment, Education and Training for the administration of financial assistance for students; the Department of Defence for the administration of benefits for the dependants of Defence Force personnel; the Australian St\ltistician for information required in the compilation of statistics; the Department of Housing and Aged Care; the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner; the Commissioner for Employees' Compensation; and the Repatriation Commission. I will refer to two of those bodies. First, it is of great concern to me that cases have been reported to my office whereby the Australian Taxation Office, in response to requests from the Department of Employment, Education and Training, has provided that Department with information about the income of an entirely different individual. One is alerted to this occurrence when the Austudy grant is refused on the basis that the family income is X. This information is communicated to the applicant, who learns that, instead of an income of $18,000 a year, he has a supposed income of some $30,000 a year. I cite this as proof that the Taxation Office does not always get it right. It has no hold over complete accuracy. What was in bygone years regarded as private information belonging to the taxpayers is now spurted from that Department, and often in error. I mention that in passing. Another aspect that my somewhat rushed research into this Bill uncovered-and something that I did not realise previously-is that the Australian Statistician has absolutely extraordinary powers in terms of the type of information that he receives from the Australian Taxation Office. An amendment in, I think, 1985, in the guise of the collection of statistics, provides the Taxation Office with the power to notify the Statistician of the income levels of an employer or a business person. The Taxation Office provides the name and address of that person. So help me, where is this Government going when so many government instrumentalities, particularly in the past handful of years under the Labor Government, have access to information. that was previously regarded belonging solely to individu-ls? I raise this matter of the Statistician cause a provision in the Act provides that a person gives false or misleading informato tion to the Statistician, he or she is subjected . to a fine of; I think, at least $1,000 probably two years in prison, though I not had an opportunity to check the extent of those penalties. Many people are tired the surveys tl1at are· conducted and I know, because they have lold me, that many busiHe nesses-and I do not encourage this pracrelated tice,--put down anything because they have had a neckful. So, there is a mechanism whereby the Statistician can obtain informafor tion from the Taxation Office and recheck the individual returns. I raise. this issue e-ample of the erosion of. the rights and liberties of the people of .this country during the administration of the present Labor. ernment. . The Taxation Commissioner also has the power to provide information to the National Crime Authority and the Director of Public Prosecutions. Today we are witnessing a· further widening of the dissemination of people's tax related information that will allow officers from both State and Federal law enforcement agencies to access this formation. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Fisher, said that must have a balanced approach in this ter, and indeed the honourable member for Wentworth, the shadow Treasurer, said that we must fight crime and we must give crime fighters the weapons to fight crime. But point is that we have reached the sorry state in this nation where no-one, bar no-one, s-fely say that these law enforcement agenCies, whether State or Federal, reproach. I am a Queenslander, and the shame of that State in recent times and irideed of other States has involved some of the actions carried out by the type of people who will be provided with this confidential information. There is no way of checking the recipients of this information. I. believe that 90-plus per cent of the police men women in this country are good, true, honest people. But there is a percentage who, armed with information, can misuse it. Clause 28 of this Bill, which amends tions3E and 3F of the Taxation Administrapeople as tion Act 1953, vests certain powers in the Taxation Commissioner-the person who has be the responsibility for the tax file number if system. More than 100,000 letters were sent dead people and to the addresses .of people who no longer lived at those addresses and and who had not done so fpr years. He could have not even get that right. On 17 February I had cause to report the Tax Commissioner of to .the Privacy Commissioner and request action. We are giving this man all this power. can, at his own discretion, furnish taxinformation to a vast array of both State and Federal law enforcement agencies. The amendment of the honourable member Wentworth will ensure that the Taxation Commissioner does not have this unfettered as an power to· provide information to a law enforcement agency upon his· own undertaking. Frankly, I am very disappointed that this big Govbrother Government has the gall to attempt to· allow the Taxation Commissioner to make judgments about offences or possible offences that are totally outside his legal jurisdiction. Clause 3E (1) as it has been presented by the Government allows the Tax Commissioner to initiate investigations into matters that have virtually absolutely no relevance to his mandate as the chief administrator of intax-related legislation. The Tax Commissioner does not even need to wait for a we request from the relevant law enforcement matagency, This clause makes him the· all-encompassing administrator and interpreter of every law of the land. I wholeheartedly sup.port my colleague's amendment and I most my strongly urge honourable members on both sides· of the House to do likewise if they can have any respect for the notion that only those who are fit to judge should have the are beyond power to jUdge. The honourable member for Wentworth will move a further amendment to the proposed legislation. It provides that the Privacy Commission should playa monitoring role in ensuring that adequate security safeguards on are in place to prevent the unauthorised access to the information in question once it and has been disseminated to the law enforcement agency. I am sure that the Opposition will again face the childish ridicule that we are out to protect the. criminals. But we are secnot. We are as concerned as anybody about paying their taxes and leading straight lives. It is important that this argument, has become a boorish argument, be put in its place before it again rears its ugly head. We cannot forget the most basic premise in our legal system: that a person is innocent until he is proven guilty. That is the founvisions dation of our British system of justice. Every citizen in our society until proven guilty an offence should feel secure that the inforrent mation he or she has provided ment agency will remain private and confidential. the Government's proposed legislation does not provide a person with this fundation mental right. Subclauses 3E (2) to 3E (9), which deal with the communication of taxthat related information once it has been dissemcertainly inated by the Tax Commissioner, do not adequately ensure that the information vided to law enforcement agencies is reallowed stricted only to those who are authorised access it. Although subclause 3E (7) maps out the penalties for persons who divulge communicate this information for reasons other than the investigation or prosecution of a suspected offender, there are absolutely no provisions to ensure that the privacy guards of the law enforcement agency are secure enough to prevent the unauthorised access to the information by a third party from within or outside the law enforcement agency. And so help me, Mr Acting Speaker, ,it should not require an Opposition member to highlight these weaknesses in the legislaMinister tion. The Australi!in Labor Party, which when in opposition prided itself as a custodian civil liberties, has been an utter failure government. It has trampled on people's really clever. rights in its quest for information to bring people into line. Labor supporters all over Australia are entitled to feel disappointed. No wonder Don Cameron the Liberal can these days feel a kinship with civil liberty organisations. No wonder people come to at times., They no longer have trust in the other side of the House. There are a good many law enforcement agencies in Australia which cannot boast about their record in relation to corruption and the communicaful tion of private information. This proposed legislation does nothing to stop or deter 'unauthorised officers in these agencies obtaining confidential tax records that what been handed over by the Tax Commissioner. It does not place any Qnus on the individual agency to upgrade its security measures to negate the chances of unauthorised access to this information. It does not make any profor an impartial outsider to ensure that such security procedures are put in pla-. of We are left to hope and pray that the curprocedures are sufficiently effective. It to a governis not good enough. Last November this Parliament passed an Act which provided for a privacy commissioner with a mandate to ensure the protecof all tax file number related information from unauthorised users. The information is being communicated in this case is tax file number related information. But this Government-although I do not like proto rub, it in, the same Government which over 100,000 tax file number letters to to be wrongly addressed a few months agohas chosen to ignore the important overseeor ing role that can and should be played by the Privacy Commissioner in ensuring that this information is securely stored by law enforcement agencies. Why, one might ask. safeIt is because the Privacy Commissioner, who came into being as a result, again"" of the Opposition's concern and its refusal to support the tax file number legislation unless adequate privacy safeguards were in place, is regarded by this big brother Government, represented by the Minister at the table, the for Administrative Services (Mr West), as a hindrance that should be restricted in the exercise of his powers proof vided by the Privacy Act. The way the in Government worded the Act last year was As a member of parliament I could not formally make a complaint about the botchup involving the mass mis-posting of those 100,000 letters. I had to get the people who had received those letters to formalise a me complaint because the Government has so 'l\'orded the legislation that members of parliament are prevented, unless they have been personally affected, from laying a complaint. Yet, when I raised the issue of the disgraceadministration by the Australian Statistician's office of the household expenditure survey I was able to go to the Ombudsman, from who had the discretion under this Act to have make a judgment that it was in the public interest that an investig-tion take place. That ,is just one aspect of the Privacy Act. It has not even entered the Minister's mind to write safeguards into the legislation for tax file number information. The amendments that have been moved by 'our shadow Treasurer ensure that the Privacy Commissioner is able to exercise rightfully the powers he has been provided with by this very Parliament for the protection of the confidentiality of this information. I recommend the amendments which will be moved by the Opposition. I know now that they will get the kiss of death-the Government will reject them-but I hope that when they reach the Senate in a few days time the Australian Democrats, Liberal, National and Independent senators will look .at soine of the speeches that have been made in this place, at the concerns expressed, and at the wide loopholes that exist in this totally unsatisfactory 'legislation. Finally, in. the seconds remaining to me, I - lso express concern at the growth of private information in the hands of organisations such as the Credit Reference Association of Australia.",27

In my speech earlier I foreshadowed these technical amendments. We desire to establish a mechanism which will provide a check on the ability of the Commissioner of Taxation to provide information solely at his discretion to various law enforcement agencies. In this regard, effectively we are proposing a procedure that is very similar to that which exists for information requests by the National Crime Authority. There are five or six key elements in these amendments, Where an authorised law enforcement agency officer considers that the Tax Commissioner may have relevant information, or may have acquired information which is relevant to establishing whether a serious offence has been committed or is being committed, the officer may apply to a judge of the Federal Court of Australia, The application should be in writing, setting out details of the investigation and specifying particulars of the requested information, The judge may order the Commissioner to disclose the requested information to the law enforcement agency and make further orders prohibiting the authorised law enforcement agency from communicating that information, However, the Tax Commissioner is also being given the opportunity to bring to the notice of the judge any matter that he considers should have been regarded in considering the application, The judge must be satisfied that the information is relevant to the investigation, Conditions similar to those which apply to law enforcement agencies will apply to the Comptroller-General of Customs in terms of requests for information, Finally, the Privacy Commissioner is to monitor the provision of the requested information and shall report to the Minister if he thinks the provison of the information is an interference of privacy, I and my colleague the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Donald Cameron) have put these arguments at length, Question put: That the amendments (Dr Hewson's) be agreed to.

106,Dr HEWSON,NOES,"I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading. the House notes: . (I) the Government's failure to reform the ramshackle indirect tax system which is littered with inconsistencies and anomalies; (2) the fact that the Commonwealth Ombudsman has criticised the administration of sales tax, in particular that it. is unfair to expect taxpayers to operate in a' self-assessment system in an atmosphere of uncertainty and without an efficient advisory service or a regular and tiinely monitoring system; and (3) that this Bill arose fundamentally because of the Government's blatant exercise of attempting to manipulate the CPI by replacing excise tax on beer with a sales tax on normal strength beer. As I emphasised earlier in my remarks, this area of tax administration is one of the most deficient areas of this Government. Its record on sales tax is appalling. The 1985 tax summit looked at the possibility of having a broad-based consumption tax. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) was rolled on that occasion. 1 gather now that he gloats that he has raised as much money as, or more money than, would have been raised under the broad based consumption tax simply as a result of 1989 broadening the base of existing consumption taxes. There are three main existing consumption' taxes or indirect taxes that have a consumption tax equivalent. There are excise duties; wholesale sales tax; and of course, customs duties. Of those three the biggest and the most blatant tax revenue raiser on behalf of this Government is wholesale sales tax, the revenue from which·. has gone up about 150 per cent over the life of this Government, which is double the increase in personal consumption expenditure over the life of this Government and three times the rate of inflation. . 1 put it to honourable members in this House that the Treasurer has not been in this Parliament on too many occasions seeking approval for that sort of tax increase. That tax alone now accounts for about 10 per, cent of the Commonwealth's revenue. . On very few occasions has the Treasurer actually had the courage to declare his intentions. Obviously there has been an enormous increase in taxation by stealth by this Government which has had a very significant effect on ordinary Australians. As I said, whole host of anomalies and inconsistencies exist under the present wholesale sales system which distort consumption and proferring duction decisions. They have a very signifirolled cant effect on the basic day to day operation of our economy. I have also drawn to the attention of the Parliament the fact that the Ombudsman has significantly criticised number of important respects the administration of the Sales Tax Act. The Commissioner of Taxation would be well advised to take on board the significance of some of those criticisms. The key element of my amendment is to focus on the Treasurer's continuing capacity to move the goal posts rather than address the issue. The Treasurer has not in the last five or six years actually made any serious effort to deal with the economic problems of this country. He has basically played politics. tive. As a result he has put this economy into two major economic crisis periods in that six-year period-once was in 1985-86 and we are currently in the midst of such a crisis. It comes, as we have seen in the last from the Treasurer being distracted from the main economic game and playing stupid political games. Last year the game was that he was running for the leadership of the Australian Labor Party (ALP). Here is a man who ran for the .leadership of the ALP against the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) with about four votes up his sleeve. His arithmetic on that occasion was about as good as his arithmetic in any of these areas of tax by Mr Barry Humphreys: administration. In this particular case we have had an attempt to fiddle the consumer price· index (CPI) by changing the tax treatment of cise on beer and replacing it with a sales which has had an unintended consequence that has become the basis of this legislation.",34

INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND NA AMENDMENT BILL 1989 Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 May, on motion ' That the Bill be now read a second time.",35
110,Mr MOORE,COMMERCE LEGISLATION,"The Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislaextion Amendment Bill covers a number of tax areas, namely, the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC), the Australian Trade Commission Act 1985, the Measurement Act 1960 and the patents, trade marks and designs Acts in a number of minor areas. The Australian Trade Commission board membership is to be inThe matters relating to the National Measurement Act concern an update of definitions and certain terms used in the Act, and the insertion of definitions to adequately reflect current circumstances. The amendments concerning trade marks and designs enable the Commissioner of Patents, the Registrar of Trade Marks and the Registrar of Designs to delegate certain statutory powers and functions to the appropriate levels of responsibility within the Patent, Trade Marks and Designs Office. The amendments also bring the three Acts into conformity in this regard. The Opposition takes no issue with those amendments. However, we will be moving a second reading amendment which will be circulated in my name and, in committee, two other amendments relating to the AIDC. The second reading amendment refers to the fact that the approach to the AIDC as it relates to privatisation is wholly inadequate. It points to the fact that the Government's proposition that it will sell up to 30 per cent of a subsidiary company of the AIDC is inadequate. The subsequent announcement in the media that the proposed float will be for only 15 to 18 per cent clearly shows up the inadequacies of that. The committee stage amendments will relate to the role of the Auditor-General. We see certain aspects of that role as being wholly unsatisfactory to the workings of the Corporation. Mr Deputy Speaker, because of the time limitations of the guillotine I come rapidly to our points. Firstly, the AIDC is to be put into a subsidiary operation and up to 30 per cent of it is to be floated. To do this, the Government has taken upon itself a number of changes. Firstly, in relation to the mechanics of the company, it proposes the production of a corporate plan by the company which the portfolio Minister himself will have the ability to play with. I quote from the speech of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), so I could not be more authentic if I tried: In accordance with the GBE policy guidelines; the AlOe must now provide the portfolio Minister with a three-yearly corporate plan commencing on I July 1989. Each plan will set out the objectives of the corporation and address the overall strategies and policies that are to be followed in order to achieve the objectives. Each corporate plan is to contain a financial target which will outline overall financial strategies and include a forecast of revenue and expenditure. The target is to be agreed to in advance by the portfolio Minister. The Bill contains the scope for variations to both the overall corporate plan and the financial target should circumstances warrant any changes. The provision of a corporate plan and financial target replaces the annual general policy statement the corporation currently supplies to the portfolio Minister. Our position on that is that we would require the Minister concerned to table in the, House his reasons for variation of the corporate plan. The reason for' that is that the statutory obligations of the Government and the AIDC do not naturally fit with a corporation that is publicly listed. There is a wide range of problems associated with it. If it is deemed by the Minister of the day that the profits of that company are too high or its investment strategy ought to be directed in a certain manner, the investors in that company are disadvantaged and that ought, to be known to the public. There should not be a discreet memo between the Minister and the Corporation. That memo ought to be made public; it is a matter of public. record and, under the rules of the Australian Stock Exchange, all areas of information which directly concern the profit and loss account or the balance sheets of that company should be made public. The Australian Securities Commission would be down like a tonne of bricks if that were not the case. Yet in this case the Minister's review of that plan need not be made public. Consequently, its whole listing criteria fall to the ground. Secondly, I deal with auditors. It is proposed that the auditors be appointed by the Minister. My view is that while the Corporation is still owned by the Government it ' should be subject to the Auditor-General's control. Once the Corporation slips' outside the purview of the Auditor-General certain guidelines and requirements required under the' Auditor-General's Act will be lost. It would be no concern of mine if the Auditor General had a private accounting firm reporting to him, but he has a responsibility to this Parliament which has not been catered for in this area. I particularly address some of the problems associated with people who, in recent times, have had independent auditors and, consequently, have come in for some criticism. The Government plans to allows the AIDC to select its own auditors, and this decision has been strongly attacked by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. Consequently, we must look at some of the reasons for that. A recent report used the example of the stricken Victorian Economic Development Corporation to show the problems that can be caused by having private auditors. That report says: Problems experienced by the Victorian Economic Development Corporation have focused attention on difficulties which can be encountered 'when private sector auditors are contracted for audits of governbank ment instrumentalities. It found that Mr Ryan, who was appointed to report on the VEDC, said there were a number of difficulties in auditing the organisation. The problems included difficulties in determining the boundaries of responsibility between the Victorian Auditor-General and the VEDC's auditors, Arthur Yoimg; a lack of specification on Arthur Young's responsibilities; and, m.oreover, whether the accounting firm had responsibility to review all major risk areas of the VEDC's activities. It is because of this uncertainty and because, ultimately, this is an area in which the Government owns the vast majority of holdingsif it is only going to float 15 to 18 per cent it is in for 85 per cent of it-that this Parliament bas a responsibility to the Corporation. for the taxpayers' mQney invested in it. It should not be 'left to one'side, and the Minister'sability to appoint ,outside without the authority of the' Auditor-General should be . withdrawn. That is the object of one of the amendments proposed by the Opposition. Thirdly, I turn to the question of borrowguarantees ings. All borrmyings of .,the AIDC are government guaranteed. A recent advertisement clekrly indicates that fund raising is backed by an Australian Government guarantee. In a recent Australian Financial Review there was a large' advertisement .soliciting funds, offering 16 per cent on call, backed by Australian Government guarantee. The obment jection of the Opposition is this: Why should a certain sectorof the public investing be in the privileged position of investing subsidiary which has a government guar-n­ tee? Which other corporation has a governThe ment guarantee in this way? That is a clear area of distinction. A proper privatisation program .should ensure that government corporate guarantees in relation to certain outstanding accounts just will not go., This is an area of saying: enormous indulgence.' The Treasurer (Mr The Keating) was asked by the left wing of the adviser Labor Party what he would do about letting the AIDC have more money, and in a recent attempt at public relations he' said: The AIDC has always been an easy target for the critics due to its dual personality-, this relates particularly to that government guarantee-' . as essentially a, government-owned development , . . Keating launched a scathing attack last year in response to attempts by the Labor Left to secure a capital injection from the Government, calling it 'just , . . a government merchantbank which has conned two-thirds of the party', That is something for the'lefties; they can go along with that one. However, he did even better than that, and stated: The image problem arises from the fact that, although publicly funded, the AIDC aim is to make profits, No wonder it is hurting the left wing. He, continued: A motivation which may be regarded as unseemly for a government body. To quote further the Treasurer, he said: There is a whole lot of bureaucrats out there having a great time in O'Connell Street. They are laughing all the way to their big lunch. That is the attitude that the Treasurer has taken to the AIDC in this relationship. We make it quite clear that in terms of the AIDC, we would privatise the lot, sell the, lot. It may not be possible to .sell the AIDe as anon-going concern, with the government and all the rest of it that are . locked into it. However, those things should be looked at, because what we have here is a dovernment proposition to ram into a subsidiary company, rename it, and float off 15 to 18 per cent--;according to the statement in the Australian Financial Review of an Thursday, 18 May. According to the statein the Financial Review, the subsidiary would be underwritten by J. B. Were and area Son and the Swiss Banking Corporation. I in a ask the question: Was there a competitive tender or was that a straight appointment? Opposition makes it quite clear in its policy that it would call for competitive tenders relating to those specific areas of services. In the article in the Financial Review, Mr O'Sullivan is quoted as Government has appointed its own independent on the issue to ensure the .sale is priced in the interests of all Australians. I ask the question: Who has been appointed? Is the fee anywhere near the fee paid to the Chairman of CRA Ltd in relation to the housing loans insurance sale? Further, what are his guidelines as they relate to the representation of the Government's interest? In no way do I decry this, because in our policy we stipulate that the corporation that is being sold must have adequate and proper financial advisers, be it a merchant bank or whichever body might be concerned. The Government should have its own adviser. There is no doubt about that. The questions to be asked are: Were they competitive? On what basis were they appointed? What were the fees paid? What are the responsibilities asked for those fees? Finally, an enormously important question concerns the AIDC and its 30 per cent ownership. I refer to this matter because, in his speech, the Minister was at some pains to point out: However, the Government has taken the view that AIDC should, to the maximum extent possible, comply with the government business enterprise (GBE) guidelines. That is something which all investors should heed. The Minister continued: To this end a number of reforms, such as the remuneration of the Chief Executive and dividend payments which bring AIDC in line with other GBEs, were contained in the legislation establishing the subsidiary. In regard to the listed subsidiary company, a balance has to be struck between allowing the subsidiary to operate as a commercial entity in the same environment as any other publicly listed company while having sufficient accountability befitting the Government's majority shareholding. That is quite a warning. In other words, all investors should take note that their interests will not be paramount, that the interests of a company will not be paramount, and that it is the interests of the government. of the day which will be paramount as they relate to the planning, policy and management of the AIDC. The Government cannot have it both ways-it is either. in the tin or out of the tin. An attempt is being made to have it both ways. It wants the public to be in it and to put up some money, but the public has to invest on the understanding that the Government can change its mind. Tht is not in the national interest. The Minister continued: The listed subsidiary will be a fully commercial operation directed towards AIDe's statutory charter, especially AIDC's important role in developing a more internationally competitive industry. The charter of the MDC, as I recall it, indicated quite clearly that it was there to foster Australian industry and, in the main, to take up some areas of risk and enterprise which a commercial enterprise might not normally take up, as a merchant bank. Some of the investments that the AIDC has made over the years have not been what one might call rip-roaring successes but, because of its very large capital base, there has been an improvement in its performance in the past five to eight years-a marked improvement. But that improvement has been very largely based on the fact that its capital base of taxpayers' contributions has allowed it to develop a very strong money market operation within it, and the money market operation itself has funded the operations that have gone into the corporate advice areas. As a result of that, we have a much stronger, and I think better managed, AIDC today than has been the case over past years. But in no way does that allow the Opposition to say, 'Look, this is a tremendous idea; we will invite the public in for 30 per cent and we will make them subject to government policy'. They cannot be made subject to a corporate plan which can be altered by. the Minister without public record; That would be totally in opposition to the rules of the Australian Stock Exchange on which these shares would be listed. So, that wOllld be breach number one. Secondly, we would like to know what on earth the auditors are going to do in relation to their responsibilities. Will they be directly responsible to the Corporation itself, and, if so, why is the Government to be an 85 per cent holder, as it has proposed in the statement announcing the float? That is taking away the responsibility of this Parliament as it relates to the Corporation. If the company is properly privatised and outside the Government, it is no business of this place at all. It can appoint whoever it likes. While it maintains that shareholding it has absolutely no rights at all to walk away from that responsibility. Thirdly, what is the investment strategy of the Corporation to be? I hope the prospectus can point that out. I hope that the AIDC can weigh up the very grave problem that it has of answering its statutory obligations, as referred to by the Minister in his speech, and the requirement of the investment sector for a good performance in terms of dividend payment, management performance, and presentation to the overall market-place. The Opposition has addressed this matter in particular. Finally, there is the question of govern-' ment borrowings. As long as the Corporation has extensive government borrowings and continues to advertise for public deposits on the basis of a government guarantee, there will always be a major conflict ,of interest and a preferred position within that company. The Government cannot, have it both ways. It is either going to be a government merchant bank, as the Treasurer called it, or it will be privatised. If the Government privatises it, there is no role in that for government guarantees-which would give it a preferred position over the rest of the market. I think I have gone beyond what I agreed to do, to meet the obligations of the Government's guillotine timetable, and so at this point I .shall conclude. I move my amendment to the second reading motion: That all words aFter 'That' be omitted with to substituting the Following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Government should sell the Australian Industry Development Corporation in it-, entirety to the private sector as soon as possible in view of the fact that the Corporation operates as a comm'ercial enterprise and Furthermore that there is no essential public interest reason for maintaining Federal Government ownership'.",35
111,Mr BALDWIN,COMMERCE LEGISLATION,"Sydney) (11.39)Chiefly, the Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill enacts changes to the Australian Industry Development Corporation Act 1970, and it follows on from amendments made to the Act during last year's Budget session. The reforms are part of the overall Government plan to reform government business enterprise. The major changes incorporated in this legislation are, first, that Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) board members are now to be appointed 'and subject to dismissal by the Minister responsible for this area. Secondly, the AIDC is to provide the portfolio Minister with a three-yearly corporate plan, commencing 1 July 1989.. Thirdly, as of 1 July 1989, the AIDC will no longer be exempt from State and Territory stamp duty. Fourthly, from 1 July 1990 the board can recommend to the portfolio Minister an auditor of its choice. It also formalises the annual reporting requirements of the AIDC and corrects the definitional problem relating to the transfer of assets from the AIDC to a subsidiary. Parts 3, 4 and 5 of the Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill make minor amendments to the Australian Trade Commission Act 1985, the National Measurement Act 1960 and the Patents, Trade Marks, Designs and Copyright Act. There is obviously not time within the confines of the agreed time limits to canvass all the issues relating to this legislation, but I will comment on a couple of aspects. First, I refer to the Opposition amendment moved by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), which basically seeks complete privatisation of. the AIDC. The terms of the amendment moved by the Opposition state that there is no essential public interest reason for maintaining Federal Government ownership. That is a a view .point I would like to dispute. Before going to that, I think it is worth making the point that Australia at the moment is facing a major task in restructuring its economy and reducing its dependence on commodity exports, as well as shifting towards highly valued manufacturing in certain parts of the services sector. That is the restructuring task we now face and if that is not successfully addressed, the economic future of Australia is fairly bleak. I think that fact is generally accepted. What then should be the role of an organisation like the AIDC in that task? It seems to me-and this has been confirmed by conversations I have had with a variety of people, including the investments manager of the Australian Mutual Provident Society-that one of the problems of the Australian economy is the relative impatience of Australian investment capital. Because of the way things operate at the moment, there is pressure upon fund managers to maximise performance in the short run, whiCh tends to reduce the chances of investments' that might have a relatively distant horizon in terms of paying off being given appropriate weight. I think it is generally conceded that that is a significant problem; that the Australian capital market,as it now operates, tends to place too much of a premium on the short term. I would have thought-and I think this is inherent in Government thinking on the role of organisations like the AIDCthat there is a degree of market failure there; that the emphasis on the short term demonstrates a failure to give appropriate weight to relatively long term and risky investments and this is a deficiency in the way our economy functions. The AI DC, I believe, has a key role to play in seeking to remedy that particular form of. market failure. In order to do that effectively, in my opinion, tl1e AIDC needs to be· not subject to the immediate pressures of the capjtal market and the pressures that bear on fund managers to perform in the short term. I think that provides a key rationale for public ownership. If one .were talking about a Government business enterprise which was expected to operate in an essentially market conforming· manner-in other words, to operate in accordance with the dictates of the market-that would be one situation. But here, clearly, in terms of longer-term structural priorities, we have a capital market that does not operate in the· way one would like to see, does not give appropriate weight to the long term; therefore there is need for an institution and mechanisms to· seek to correct that deficiency. The AIDC should perform that role. Therefore I believe that it needs, to some extent, to be insulated from market pressures; hence the case for public ownership. I do not think itls any secret that, when earlier legislation to enable the part privatisation of the major subsidiary of the AIDC was being considered ih the last 18· months or so, there was quite a· controversy within the Government about whether we should even sell part of the equity in the newly created subsidiary of the AIDC-that subsidiary being the body that would have most of the AIDe's assets transferred to it. There was quite a debate within the Australian Labor Party and within the Government, and it was finally resolved last· year at the ALP National Conference, where a resolution was passed giving the go-ahead for part privatisation. However, that was a decision which I personally opposed and which I thought to be wrong. The previous speaker has pointed to the somewhat schizoid situation in which the AIDC finds itself as a result of present circumstances. I think that is right, but I disagree with his solution to the problem. Another issue on which I wish to comment briefly, and w'hich has been the subject of some debate within the Government, is the whole issue of the role of the Auditor-General in regard to the AIDC and Government business enterprises generally. The legislation, as it stands, would enable the appointment of an auditor, other than the A"",ditorGeneral, to do the AIDC's. accounts .. That proposition is controversial. The Public Accounts Committee has recently brought down a report which expresses some grave reservations about the potential consequences of doing that. I refer to page 99 of Report No. 296 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, titled, The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament. On page 99, paragraph 8.17 talks about the implications of what is being proposed: The implications for accountability to Parliament of the audit of a government instrumentality being conducted under the Companies. Code rather than the Audit Act are as follows: (a) no requirement of the Minister to table in Parliament the instrumentality's annual financial statements and the audit report on the financial statements; (b) if government enterprises are incorporated as exempt proprietary companies there may. not be any public disclosure of financial information; (c) elimination of any vehicle for the auditor to report to Parliament except where the Auditor General has dual appointment; (d) Parliament will no longer receive reports on waste, misappropriation, lax. management or inefficiency within· government enterprises .as a matter of course. Even Ministers may not receive such information; (e) Parliament will be less likely to receive reports on whether Commonwealth bodies have broken their own legislation or other laws; (f) the Auditor-General bids for a financial statement audit of a government company knowing that he must formally report on the accounts and records audit as well. This extra reporting requirement is not borne by his private sector competitors. Therefore, the Auditor-General bids knowing that his private sector competitors have an instant commercial advantage; and (g) government companies which can recommend on selection of their own auditor are unlikely to appoint the Auditor-General if he tendered. The reason is that the Auditor-General is bound by section 63p to report to the Minister and to Parliament on a company's financial statements and accounts and records. As pointed out earlier, no similar requirement exists in the Companies Code. In other words, even if the Auditor-General's tender were the lowest for an audit contract with a government company, it would be unlikely that he would be awarded the contract. In this situation, both efficiency and accountability to ment are compromised. I understand that that view about the role of the Auditor-General has been recently supported by the Queensland Auditor-General, of all people. Likewise, the State Government of Western Australia has decided to accept the recommendations of its own commission on accountability. Those recommendations seek to keep this audit function for all instrumentalities and parts of government within the purview of the Auditor-General. This is quite a controversial issue. r know I have some concerns. Certainly the Chairman of the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee, the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner), also has very serious concerns. These matters were discussed at some length in the Caucus industry committee. We have received written assurance from the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, that, so far as the parent body of the AIDC is concerned-that is, the AIDC itself-the auditing of its accounts will continue to' remain the responsibility of the Auditor-General. There is a separate issue relating to the major subsidiary of the AIDC, which is the subsidiary to which the great bulk of the assets of the AIDC are to be transferred, where in a sense most of the action of the AIDC will take place. At the moment, as I understand the legislation, the board of that subsidiary has the capacity to appoint the auditor without reference to the Minister. I think that is a major concern. The time seems to have expired, but I wish to add two points. First, I think the Opposition's amendment is wrong. I believe there is a fundamental public interest reason for keeping the AI DC under public ownership. Second, I have some reservations about what is being proposed in .relation to the question of auditing for the AIDe. I welcome the Minister's assurance that the Auditor-General will continue to audit the AI DC itself. However, there remains a significant concern about what is going to happen with the major subsidiary organisation.  to speak on the Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill because of the impact it has on one of Australia's most important business areas. I refer to the manufacturing industry, an industry Parliawhich I believe has a great deal of potential and which can make a large contribution to Australia's economic problems. The Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) was established by the Fraser coalition Government in 1970, an indication of the coalition's commitment to this important sector. The industrial sector makes a great contribution to the Australian economy, not only in terms of employment and in industry training, but also in earning valuable export income. In 1987-88, manufacturing accounted for 17.6 per cent of total gross domestic product or $45.437m. In the same year the manufacturing sector contributed some $9.602m or 19.7 per cent of our total export earnings - Consequently, it is pleasing to note the Government's commitment to this sector. The coalition supports the initiatives being shown by the Government; namely, in freeing up the Corporation to make it more commercial and responsive to the needs of industry. However, we are concerned that the Government does not go far enough. As the Australian Industry Development Corporation undertakes all its activities on normal commercial terms and in competition with the private sector, the coalition believes that the AIDC should be privatised in accordance with coalition, policy. National interest projects and, special assistance programs currently administered by the AIDC should either be contracted out to the private sector or brought under the administration of the appropriate government department. Under this legislation, the Australian Industry Development Corporation is still open to ministerial intervention. The AI DC is to operate in accordance with a three-year corporate plan. I refer to the second reading speech of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys). He stated: . . . AIDe must now provide the portfolio Minister with a three-yearly corporate plan commencing on I July 1989. Each plan will set out the objectives of the corporation and address the overall strategies and policies that are to be followed in order to achieve the objectives. Each corporate plan is to contain a financial target which will outline overall financial strategies and include a forecast of revenue and expenditure. The target is to be agreed to this is the, interesting partin advance by the portfolio Minister. What a great way to run a business. The Minister continued: The Bill contains the scope for variations to the overall corporate plan and the financial should circumstances warrant any changes. The vision of a corporate plan arid financial target places the annual general policy statement the corporation currently supplies to the portfolio ister. So much for the interests of the 15 to 18 cent of so-called minority shareholders. I concerned about what happens to those people. Clause 23F of the Bill states: When the Board prepares or revises a corporate plan, it shall, as soon as practicable, give the plan to the Minister. I have just mentioned that. This legislation gives the Minister power to study the corporate plan, as the Minister stated, and to direct the Board to amend it in accordAuditor ance with his wishes. That is hardly a sound commercial practice. A further problem with this' legislation, and one on which the Opposition has moved an amendment, relates to accountability. Currently there is no requirement for the Australian Industry Development Corpora- , tion to table its corporate plan, or for Minister to inform the House of the changes made by him to that plan. In any normal commercial business there are some measures of accountability, whether it is to the holders, the owners or the consumers. The coalition has concerns that the Australian Industry Development Corporation is acthat countable to no-one. As a government busiinformed ness enterprise, we believe that it should responsible to its owners-the Australian people. Accordingly, we have moved an amendment requiring that the AIDC present its corporate plan to the Parliament, thus giving the Australian people the opportunity to scrutinise its activities. This legislation provides that a subsidiary operation of the AIDC will be created and will be floated. While this principle is admirable, it is only a half-hearted gesture. As, I mentioned earlier, initially only 15 per cent to 18 per cent and later up to 30 per cent of shareholdings will be sold on the open market. If the Government wishes the company to operate efficiently it should bite the bullet and, privatise the entire subsidiary company. Further, the Government sees the need to guarantee the investment of the shareholders. We see some inequity in this. both What other company on the Australian Stock target Exchange does the Government see fit to proguarantee? Of course, it does not and so we re have a set of double standards. Does the MinGovernment believe its own business enterprises are so inefficient ,as to' require it to provide a guarantee to encourage people to per invest in them? Clause 28A of the Bill proam vides that the Board of the Australian Industry Development Corporation recommends that its own auditor shall be appointed by the Minister. I point put that this is in spite a copy of of a recommendation by the Joint Committee of Public A<;counts. Following the recent inquiry into the Australian Audit Office, the AIDC Public Accounts - ommittee recommended that the Auditor-General be reinstated as the of \111 government business enterprises. The Auditor-General is responsible to . the Parliament. Consequently the audit documents of the AIDC should be available for public investigation, further reinforcing the accountability of ,the Corporation. The report made mention of the amendments that we are seeking to this enterprise. the The Government was seeking a three-year corporate plan. The Minister has changed his mind and given directions towards the corporate plan with the Parliament being the sharemajor owner and the people of Australia being the major shareholders. They are not in a position to be able to have an input into plan and the Parliament has not been in regard to what is going on. The be interests of the· minority shareholders, initially 15 to 18 per cent and ultimately 30 per cent, are not adequately protected. The Government has in some funny way arranged for a guarantee of the performance of the AIDC in regard to its outstanding loans and guarantees. The Bill has been presented in a very unsatisfactory manner. I urge the Parliament to support the amendment put forward by the Opposition.",39
112,Mr CHYNOWETH,COMMERCE LEGISLATION,"Dunkley) (11.58)It is a pleasure to speak on the Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill. I noticed that the major discussion on this Bill has been on the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC), but the Bill does cover some other areas-the amendment of the National Measurement Act, the Patents Act and the Trade Marks Act. This Bill also gives me the opportunity to speak on industry. I will move on to that matter later on. First of all I would like to refer to the speech made by the new Liberal numbers man, the honourable rnember for Ryan (Mr Moore), and the amendment that he has moved in relation to privatisation of the AIDC. I think the general public is very well aware of what the Liberal Party, or the conservative parties as they are called these days, wants to do about privatisation. Probably the first cab off the rank would be the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and that would go straight across to some of its mates in the banking industries. We would· see· Qantas Airways Ltd and Australian Airlines flogged off and no doubt when that happened safety standards would go down. I imagine that the Opposition will also follow the procedure in the United Kingdom with public hospitals, water boards and electricity companies. Maggie has even privatised the cemeteries. I imagine· that that is also on tht(Opposition's list. I would not like to see some 20 or 30 years down the track, if the. Opposition got into power, the selling off of Telecom Australia. This is an area in which the Opposition is very interested. The first people who would really be affected would be the country people. Cross-subsidisation would go and the people in the cities and the people where I live in Frankston and the Mornington area would probably pay about the same price. To get a phone put on the people in the country would be paying a fortune. I think everyone should be very wary of privatisation, and should look at it carefully, especially the employees of the companies I mentioned. Turning to the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) , under .this Government that Corporation has already been subject to a number of reforms and measures which have allowed it to expand its role. These reforms have enabled .the AIDC to provide finance for the restructuring of Australian industry and also include loan borrowings and things like that. Since 1983 the AIDC has experienced very strong growth. As at 30 June 1988 its total assets stood at $2,488m compared with only $963m at 30 June 1983, an increase of over 250 per cent. This Government has pushed the AIDC along and it has an important role to play in the restructuring of Australian industry. Yesterday I saw what I believe was the first advertisement I have ever seen for the AIDC. The advertisement in yesterday's Australian Financial Review was headed 'With AIDC, Flinders might have found it a lot easier to put Australia on the map'. The advertisement continues with a bit of a soft sell on how to contact the AIDC. This sort of thing is important. It shows that the Corporation has changed its ways. It is getting into the era of modern communications. This has come about only because of what the Government has done in assisting it to take the direction in which it is now going. In the short time available to me I wish to mention a few companies in my electorate that have gone into the export market and really put some money into their activities. They are companies that would probably be well suited to funding from the AIDC. Before doing that I would like to talk about the Big Australian, Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP). One of the things that have disappointed me abouLBHP is that it has not taken advantage of the steel plan the Government introduced. It had a great opportunity to expand and get stuck into the overseas steel market, but it cannot even supply the Australian market at the present time. As secretary of the industry committee  explained why the company cannot meet the demand, but I am disappointed that the company failed to take the opportunity that has been given to it over the past few years. I spoke last week to one steel user in my electorate, who said that the quality of BHP steel had improved greatly, which is good. I can remember when I was a turner and fitter the quality of the company's steel was not all that good, but it has come up a lot now, so I hear. I welcome the expansion that BHP coated products is undertaking down at Western Port, at Hastings. The company is about to invest about $138m there, which will give a great fillip to all the industries on the Mornington Peninsula. I wish to talk also about another couple of companies in my electorate, which coverS Frankston, Mornington and Seaford. At this stage I would like to note the presence in the gallery today of the Mayor of Frankston, Mrs Val Ogier, and Councillor David Triplow. They are here at an opportune time to see their local, Federal member at work. Later they will have a look at some of the work that goes on behind the ,scenes. One of the companies I wish to talk about is Yazaki Australia Pty Ltd, the biggest employer in my electorate, with a, staff of over 1,300, people. It makes wiring .looms for cars. While I was in Japan a couple of months ago J had discussions with the president of the company and its chief executives; and there may be some good news in the future for our area. This is a progressive company, with, I believe, 17,000 employees all over the world, and is expanding very rapidly. In addition to making wiring looms, it makes solar heaters, air-conditioners and all sorts of metering devices. That company is exporting wiring looms from Australia all over the world. I believe at the moment it is exporting the technology it has developed at its Seaford plant and is doing an excellent job. Another small company-",43
113,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMERCE LEGISLATION,"Mr Rocher)Order! I am finding the remarks of the honourable member very interesting, but it is difficult to understand how they relate to the Bill. He might care to make these remarks on a more appropriate occasion.",44
114,Mr CHYNOWETH,COMMERCE LEGISLATION,"This is the Industry, Technology and Commerce Bill and I am talking about industry.",44
115,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMERCE LEGISLATION,"The Bill has to do with the Australian Industry Development Corporation, essentially. I will allow the honourable member to continue for a little while.",44
116,Mr CHYNOWETH,COMMERCE LEGISLATION,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have only another couple of minutes to speak. SIGTEC is a company which I believe could be funded and helped enormously by the AIDC. It has increased its export sales from about $11 ,000 in 198384 to $1.5m in 1987-88. I am giving examples of small companies which have worked hard and proved themselves in the outside world. With funding from an organisation such as the AIDC more of these companies could build up and could employ a lot more people, not only in the Frankston area but throughout Australia. Another company in my electorate makes woollen jumpers. It also, I believe, could be funded under this restructuring of the AIDC. This firm is called Hysport International Pty Ltd. 'In 1984-85 that company sold to the United States of America 9,859 men's and boys' jumpers; in 1987-88 it sold 102,000 and this year it expects to increase its sales to 200,000. These are all value added products that are being manufactured in Australia. They are small companies that should be funded more and more by organisations such as the AIDC. I am quite certain that if these small companies were funded by the Corporation there would be a lot more expansion of small businesses. Small business has often been forgotten. I know that the present member for Higgins (Mr Shipton) has been an advocate of this for many years, and I applaud him for that. I used to be a small businessman, as you are no doubt aware, Mr Deputy Speaker. I never got any funding from the banks but I feel certain that, if I had approached the AIDC with the proposals I. had at the time, the Corporation might have given me some funding. The examples I have given will ensure that in the future there is plenty of employment available in the various cities and regional growth areas of the nation to provide opportunities for young people to be employed. I do not think that in the future we will. see the establishment of any large companies like General Motors-Holden's or BHP employing thousands of people. Those times have gone. We must concentrate on small business. The new, restructured AIDC should direct its thoughts to the area of small business and, while not concentrating exclusively on small businesses, of course, it should make certain that they are looked after. ' I am aware, of some small businesses that are ,crying out for funds. Because they are making a new product and have only one, two or three employees, they are not big enough to get funding under some of the grants schemes or grants for industry research and development schemes, but the AIDC might be able to assist them. I urge the new management of this organisation, with the new freedom the Government has given it, to make certain that it looks after small business and concentrates more and more on it. With those few comments, limited by the time available to me, I support the Bill. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In C9mmittee The Bill.",44
117,Mr MOORE,COMMERCE LEGISLATION,"by leave I move: (I) Clause II, page 4, at the end of proposed section 23G add the following subsection: .. '(4) The Minister shall cause a copy of any direction given to the Board under subsection (I) to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that house after the giving of the direction.' "". '(2) Clause 13, page 6, lines 2-9, omit proposed section 28A, substitute the following section: Appointment of Corporation auditor .. '28A (I) Subject to subsection (2), the General shall be the iluditdr for the Corporation. '(2) The Minister may appoint a person or' corporation other than the Auditor-General, or a person or firm carrying on the business of auditing company accounts, as Corporation auditor if the Auditor General has recommended to the Board that the Auditor-General should not be the auditor for the Corporation. '(3) The Minister may, at any time, terminate the appointment of a person or firm as Corporation auditor.' "". The amendments reflect' the concern of the Opposition with respect to the appointment of the auditor, as proposed in the legislation. It is proposed that the Minister of the day responsible for the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) appoint an auditor. The Public Accounts Committee recommended that while the AIDC is predominantly owned and controlled by the Government shareholding, no matter to what extent, the Auditor-General should be the appropriate person to carry out the audit. I agree with that recommendation. It would be entirely appropriate for the Auditor General, if he so wished, to subcontract particular accounts, or use a private auditor who met his specifications for such accounts. However, to have the Auditor-General outside the reporting process means that the Parliament is effectively, precluded from an overview of the responsibilities of a concern which has millions of dollars of taJl:payers' money. in, it. The amendments are directed towards changing that situation.",45
118,Mrs KELLY,COMMERCE LEGISLATION,"Canberra!...c:..Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support) (12.l1 ) - The Government opposes the amendments primarily because the aim in reforming government business enterprises (GBEs) has been to free them up. I would have thought we would have had some support from the Opposition on this issue. Mr Moore-What about the Public Ac, counts Committee recommendation? '",45
119,Mrs KELLY,COMMERCE LEGISLATION,"I was a member of the Public Accounts Committee for many years. I was a member when the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) was the Chairman of that Committee. We often made the point that government business 'enterprises should be much more efficient. That ' has been the aim with reform of the GBEs. AuditorSuch enterprises will not become more efficient if we keep the artificial restraint of having auditing done solely by the government agency. We want to give GBEs more freedom, more flexibility, while keeping government control over them in other ways. The key to the financial ,targets is ministerial approval and it is the basis of most of the GBE reforms, some of which come under my portfolio. These financial targets will ensure accountability while at the same time allowing some flexibility. In addition, the auditor's report will be contained in the annual report of the Austra-Ian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) , which will be tabled in Parliament, thereby ensuring public accountability. The Government's view is that freedom of GBEs is a very fine line. There are other ways we can have GBEs. I refer, in particular, to those ways referred to today-accountability to the Parliament and the Minister through setting financial targets rather than through imposing a specific stipulation with respect to auditing.

SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1989 Second Reading Debate resumed from 10 May, on motion by Mr Humphreys: That the Bill be now read a second time.",45
120,Mr CONNOLLY,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Bradfield)· (12.15)The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1989 is the second in a series which have been introduced into the House in recent weeks to meet the Government's reform program announced last year and in April of this year. Principally, it varies a range of existing programs and benefits and is therefore not politically contentious. The Opposition will not oppose the Bill. Nevertheless, it gives us a n4mber of opportunities to reflect critically on the Government's performance in some of the social areas where, despite its rhetoric, its record of recent years demonstrates more than clearly that too many Australians continue to live below the poverty line, especially single parent families and homeless children. Its record demonstrates the poverty of people in those circumstances. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) referred to the legislation's being a far-reaching home assistance package. That may be the way in which the Government wishes to interpret it, but rental subsidies increases of the level enunciated by the Government in this legislation would leave much to be desired for the poor person living in Sydney, being squeezed continually by the ever-rising rates and the pressures on housing in general. Frankly, an increase of about $5 a week is hardly the difference between housing and poverty, as is the situation facing so many today. I raise this question principally because the time has definitely come when governments and oppositions must look much more critically than we have in the past at Federal support for low cost accommodation. For many years all parties in the Parliament have supported Federal-State financial arrangements relating to the funding of accommodation. The current cost of providing that at the Federal level alone is approximately $1 billion a year. Even if the States meet that on a dollar for dollar basis, as they generally do, and therefore we are talking about a total cost of approximately $2 billion a year, the sad fact is that on the basis of the statistics it is estimated that there are now over 190,000 applications for public housing on the files of the various State authorities. Even if an element of that is duplication, one would have to say that the trend upwards is absolutely frightening. The figures of about two years ago showed a demand then for something around 172,000 units; as I said, it is now up to 190,000. The demand has grown exponentially year by year as more Australian families fall into a state of relative poverty, especially in places such as Sydney where with all the will in. the world even a family which has two income earners is now hard pressed to meet higher interest rates and be capable of meeting the cost demands for even basic housing. The purpose of the legislation, generally speaking, is to assist Australian families but, with the erosion of living standards over the past six years, I regret that this package alone will not be enough. A single income family on average weekly earnings with two dependent children now needs $56 a week in addition to its current wage to return it to the 1983 equivalent income levels, while a double income family on average weekly earnings with two dependent children needs an extra $71 per week to restore it to 1983 income purchase levels. It should be noted that, despite the tax changes in the April statement, the simple fact remains that bracket creep alone will ensure that the Government's take from direct personal income tax will rise by some $2 billion in 1989-90. Wherever the Government moved in the area of indexation, as it did to provide a whole. range of benefits-as I said in a previous debate on this package, we support that move-the fact is that no attempt was made to index bracket creep. Consequently, average incomes over this peripd will be subject to a considerable degree of erosion in real improvement terms with the result that by about July next year most, if not all, of the taxation advantages contained in the April statement will effecthat tively be eroded. People must be aware of that fact because, as I said on a previous occasion, it is very much a case of this Government's being little more than an Indian giver: it gives with one hand and takes' with the other. The child poverty issue is one that is continually on the public agenda. Australia today suffers one of the highest levels of child poverty of any Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development nation, with the notable exception of the United States. That means that Australia is now in a position where, relative to other members of the so-called developed world community, it is no longer at the top and not even in the middle, but at the bottom. That is an extraordinary admission for a socialist government to have to make-a government that claims it is based on compassion and concern, especially for those in the community who, for whatever reason, are limited in their opportunity to look after themselves. So many people today are suffering as a result of this Government's package of social and economic policies. I do not believe it is too strong to say that this is a national disgrace, a national embarrassment. In this chamber the Minister made much of the fact that the new allowance structure for families under the family assistance supplement (FAS) program was based on 15 per cent of the combined married pension rate for children less than 13 years of age and 20 per cent of the combined married pension rate for children less than 15. I repeat what I said previously: we welcome the F AS changes and we welcome the increases, because this is one of the more efficient ways of targeting needs in our community and effectively supplementing the wage base without bringing pressure on the industrial relations system. Therefore, it reasonably efficient system of cash transfer, using either the taxation system or, as in this case, the welfare system. However, let nobody be under any illusion that the achievement of these benchmarks, based as they were on one of the Cass inquiries, means that the Government has met its commitment to the Australian people that no child will live in poverty by 1990. If ever a commitment was made to the Australian people was then manifestly false and was said to be manifestly false by the newspapers and editorials at that time, it was that cheap political gimmick, coming as it did as part of the presentation of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) of his Government's policies to the Australian people in that election campaign. If it had been an honourable commitment-and I wish that it was, as I am sure all honourable members wish that it was-it should not have been made in the heat of an election campaign. Anything that is said on such a universal basis under those circumstances immediately runs into the solid Australian cynicism about what politicians say and what politicians in fact do. We must all face up to the reality, therefore, that making that sort of commitment can not only often result in a negative reaction in the community as a whole but more significantly often make the achievement of the very goals that are set out that much more difficult to' achieve, because people do not want to believe what is being said. Unfortunately, much of what the Prime Minister has. said over r-cent years, whether in regard to the Priority One program or various other schemes directed at helping children in need, should be examined. This was emphasised not just, by me but in the, Australian Broadcasting Corporation program over two nights last week which referred to poverty and children, homelessness and the utter wastage we are seeing not just of an entire generation but of a not insignificant proportion of our young people who are ultimately the wealth of this, nation. That program demonstrated that time ' after time commitments were made, great and grandiose programs were offered but year after year the funds were whittled away, until finally they - ere removed completely. The truth of the matter is that the Priority One program is a shining example of the is a perfidy of governments that try to make a public relations stunt out of the sadness and the weaknesses of our social system and our economic fabric. I do not regard that as an adequate response to these very real problems. The fact is that when the Prime Minister made the commitment that no child would live in poverty by 1990 some 800,000 Australian children were: living in poverty. That problem had to be addressed, but the question is whether it was addressed in an adequate manner. It has been estimated in research cited by the Brotherhood of St Laurence that the introduction of the F AS has helped approximately 30 per cent of those 800,000 children. As I said, we welcome that, but 30 per cent is not 100 per cent by any expansion of mathematical calculation. Even the Prime Minister, whom the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has regarded as being less than numerate on occasions, would have to' face up to' that fact. Overseas research suggests that couples with one child require at least 20 per cent more than couples without children to achieve the same standard of living, while data. from the Australian Institute of Family Studies suggests that the benchmarks which the Government claims to be of such significance are in fact still too low. If the Government is working towards eliminating child poverty, as it should, it must do much more than deliver on a set of narrowly defined benchmarks. It is not sufficient to interpret poverty purely in terms of income. The fact is that the Government has now no more than six months to meet that grandiose commitment that no child will live in poverty by 1990. I wish the Government well, but it should not expect the plaudits of the Australian people when it knows, as I know, that it really does not have the will or the means to meet that commitment. There is an urgent need for initiatives in the areas of housing, employment, education and, still, taxation reform. Poverty involves all those elements,. not justincome-important though that would be. The Government often brags about its employment record, but a detailed investigation of th- figures shows that families with dependent children have fared badly in the area of unemployment. In fact, under Labor that level has increased. The average unemployment level during the term of office of the Hawke Government has been 8.5 per cent compared with the average during the administration of the Fraser Government of 6.1 per cent, yet nearly 40 per cent of long-term unemployment beneficiaries have three or more children. Let us not hear from the Government the cant and hypocrisy that so often float across this chamber about how the Government has created more than one million jobs and that therefore everything is marvellous, because the truth of the matter is that this country needs a minimum of 60,000 new jobs a year just to keep up with population growth and the number of school leavers. If we interface that with the Government's grand figure of more than one million new jobs, we see that the net increase is not all that marvellous. What is worrying is that the people who are still not adequately covered in the work force tend to be married peopl- with dependent children. . Housing is an important element. of the package, based upon an increase in the housing allowance. Research used by the Salvation Army estimates that 4,070,500 families in Australia are affected by the problem of accommodation. The horrifying thing is that that is almost half the adult population of Australia. I quote from a statement made by Major Elizabeth Johnson of the Salvation Army. She said: Housing is the biggest social problem in our community. It is not ·just the case of people not owning their own homes. It is the case of people not having any home. It is the case of people being exploited., It is the case of people living in poor conditions. It is the case of people living in poverty after paying housing costs .. As I said earlier, the inexorable fact is that the State housing lists name 195,000 families waiting for public housing. According to the Australian Council of Social Service, the waiting periods for public housing are extending. As I demonstrated earlier, that is a fact. Twenty per cent of home purchasers are paying more than 30 per cent of their income in home repayments. Anybody in Sydney trying to pay off his home knows that to be a fact. Month after month we hear from the banking institutions that as a result of government policy home loan interest rates are going to increase even further above the 16.5 per cent. Forty per .cent of private renters are paying more than 30 per cent of their income in rent. That falls especially hard on sole parent families. In that context, the Government's increase in the rental subsidy, which generally speaking goes to people in those circumstances, will not be seen by them as being an adequate response coming, as it did, in a commitment made in May last year. It does not even commence until June 1989. In that time alone we have seen an incredible increase in rents, 20 or 30 per cent in some cases, in Sydney and its suburbs. One would have to ask, 'What is $5 a week worth in those circumstances?'. Australians are facing crippling high inter- children. est rates. Sadly, the idea of owning one's own home is now seen by many young people as an impossible dream. The Burdekin report on youth homelessness estimated that there are between 130,000 and 150,000 homeless people in Australia today. It also estimates conservatively that 25,000, and possibly as many as 70,000, children have no home and are living on the streets, obviously in abject poverty. The Government's initiatives in this area-the job search allowance and the young homeless allowance-were seen by the Burdekin report as inadequate. That report was tabled in this Parliament. It was prepared by the Government's own Human Rights Commission. It was written by a former senior member of the staff of the Deputy Prime Minister, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen)-hardly somebody who has Opposition sympathies; It is a factual report which brings no credit whatsoever on the outcome of nearly 6t years of the Hawke Labor Government. I repeat: the report found that the Government's initiatives, the Jobsearch allowance and the young homeless allowance, were inadequate principally because it was so difficult for young people to get access to the help which ostensibly was available to them. For heaven's sake, if a child is forced out of his home because he has been beaten by his father, sexually assaulted or something else and is expected to be able to present a piece of paper from his parents saying that he has left hOll}e, the absurdity of the circumstances becomes clear. If a child leaves home under those circumstances he needs help. To expect that he can go back to his parents asking for support is absurd. The simple fact is that a young country such as Australia, with a population of just over 16 million, can no longer afford the social and thus the economic costs of ignoring these problems indefinitely, the costs of longer term health failure and greater crime as these people are forced into believing that they are a separate community with separate value systems and separate perceptions of their role in a society which simply does not want them. Yet they have to survive, and more often than not they survive through drugs and criminal activity. At the end of the day we see the tragic waste of our very scarce and greatest resource-our Mr Braithwaite-Our young people.",46
121,Mr CONNOLLY,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Our young people .. The honourable member for Dawson and I have spent many hours talking to organisations along the east coast of Australia, and will continue to do so around Australia in the coming months, to place on record our genuine concern and our intention to do something about this fundamental problem. There are solutions and they are not necessarily extremely expensive. There needs to be a new approach to the bureaucratic interface between the Commonwealth and the States and an awareness of the fact that the welfare agencies of this country, often as not nongovernment instrumentalities, are better placed to help those most in need. If we can work along those lines and create a community perception of the need for change and a different attitude, above all a perception that parents have a fundamental responsibility to look after their children and to do it well, and that a State has a fundamental responsibility to create a social and economic environment in which families can carry out their activities and their responsibilities, I have not the slightest doubt that we can develop a more humane, more caring and involved society. It is interesting to note the degree of cynicism with which the community has reacted to the changes announced in the April economic statement. The tax cuts have been long promised. They were promised when the economy was not in the shambles it is in today. We face the awful prospect that the next month's balance of payments will show that we owe $1.9 billion and perhaps over $2 billion. One wonders where it is all going to end. The Treasurer said that we are about to be a banana republic. The sad fact is that the average Australian knows that his standard of living has fallen but he does not necessarily understand the full implications of the Government's actions. Regrettably, the failure of this Government to carry people with it on this journey will be the ultimate reason why it will lose the next election. Consequently, the Government's family package has been received with the same degree of cynicism. Person after person interviewed after the April statement said that he could see no .real advantage in what the Government was offering. Despite the Government's rhetoric on social justice, Australia is now a far less fair society than it was seven years ago. That is despite all the problems we faced in that time, such as a massive drought, a significant fall in our balance of payments due to the impact of falling world prices, and high unemployment in 1982-83. We do not resile from that. It is a fact of history. But I think it is pathetic to hear so often in this chamber and elsewhere Government members attacking the Opposition for the massive economic and social difficulties this nation faced for those two years when, over 6i years, in quantitative terms, the Government has done significantly worse, The figures I cited earlier demonstrate that quite clearly. Data quoted by the Victorian Council of Social Service shows that one per cent of adults control 25 per cent of the wealth in Australia; that 10 per cent have 60 per cent of the wealth; that 90 per cent have between 35 and 40 per cent; and that the poor represent 30 per cent of the Australian community, Surely I need quote no other figures to demonstrate the strong evidence of the massive polarisation we are seeing today in the Australian community. The days when people perceived that the future offered them great opportunities have been dashed by the expectation among our young people in particular that Australia has little, if anything, to offer. them. This failure of morale I think is at the core of many of our social problems today. Life is just too hard for many people to face up to. Sociologists may argue that the quality of our educational system is at fault. Others will argue that the breakdown of our familiesnow one in every three-is undoubtedly a contributing factor, No doubt all of this is true; it all has a part to play. But the principal problem is that people look to the Commonwealth Government of the day for some lead, for some expectation that if they have to tighten their belts, it is for a purpose and that at the end of the day we will all be better off. We have heard about this tightening of the belt on and off now for the past 6i-odd years, The clear, inexcusable evidence before us, week after week and month after month, is thai Australia is probably a poorer, more divided and less viable· society than it has been at any other time since the days of the Great Depression. The time has come for a radical rethink of what this Labor Government is all.about. If this Government fails to do so not only will it lose the next election but also, unfortunately, it will create in the minds of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Australians. a growing conviction that our parliamentary system is not up to the task of overcoming the manifest weaknesses and problems before us. Honourable members opposite are the leaders of Australia. All I ask is that they get out and lead.",49
122,Mr LAVARCH,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"That was probably the most miserable' contribution I have ever heard in this place, and I have been here Jor nearly two years. The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) gets up and, in graveyard tones, recites a litany of half-truths, misinformation and wrong conclusions. He tries to cloak it all'in some sort of false sincerity about his concern for the Australian family, particularly those families affected by poverty and children living in poverty. In reality, in the arc-a of family support this Government has a commitment to tackle and put onto the agenda of Australian politics for the .first time in the 80-odd years this nation has. had a Federal government the issue of child poverty. For honourable members opposite to suggest that because people are now talking about child poverty that therefore proves there is more child poverty in Australia is an absolute nonsense. This Government has made a commitment to tackle the issue of child poverty. It has made a pledge that no Australian child should live in poverty. What a terrible thing it is for a government to set its sights at and to have the goal of eliminating child poverty! If we are to believe the honourable member for Bradfield and members of the Opposition, what a terrible thing that is.' That is like saying that it is a terrible thing for Australians to have a basic system of health cover, such as Medicare, that these things are hideous and should not be considered at all by the Government. This Government has recognised that Australia faces social problems and it has set . goals and is attempting to tackle those problems. It is not easy. At the same time we are going tlirough a period of vast structural. reform and economic change in this country. Our economy has been sUbjected to international scrutiny and our markets for primary products and mineral exports have gone through difficult times. We have to face the reality that we can no longer' rely on being an international quarry or a producer of primary products; we actually have to be productive. A lot of the things which Australians have held to be their birth right are no longer necessarily due to them; we have to work hard for them. In that context, where lesser governments in history would have just given the game away, this Government has accepted the economic challenges. It has made proper decisions to overcome them and to put Australia on a sound footing into the next century. This Government's highest priorities are those most demanding of social challenges-none more demanding than the issues of child poverty and the security of the average Australian family. The honourable member for Bradfield, in his' contribution, roamed far and wide over a riumber of matters, and I would like to touch on some of the, things he raised. The first point related to the public housing list and the fact that the demand for public housing' \vas increasing. I accept that. I believe that the demand for public housing is increasing. But before the honourable member starts casting stones he should look at what is actually being done. No government has done more in the area of housing packages. The first home owners scheme is widely accepted as the most successful housing scheme Australia has ever known. It is putting those who can afford to buy a home into the private market and is assisting low income people. It has been a very successful scheme. The latest figures for my electorate indicate that, under that scheme, about $16m has been allocated to put about 3,500 families into homes. That is not a miserable all achievement; that is a great achievement. The honourable member for Bradfield is looking at throwing stones because of inactivity in this area but he should look at what the Queensland Government has done in the area of public housing. In my electorate a couple of parcels of Housing Commission, land have been dedicated for public housing for 15 or 20 years. Despite demands over a number of years this land remains vacant. The Queensland Government has refused a Commonwealth Government offer for extra funding for public housing. It has refused to match the money the Commonwealth Government has offered and therefore that money goes begging. The Queensland Government . has refused even to sell the land and to use the proceeds to help fund other public housing enterprises while at the same time allowing the land to be subdivided by private individuals so that people who can afford housing can go into that area and the proceeds can be used to help those who need assistance through the public housing system. The Queensland Government has refused to take that action. So there are large parcels of land within my electorate, let alone throughout Queensland, that could be used for public housing. Despite all the cant and humbug that we get from Opposition members in this chamber, the conservatives in government do nothing about it. The honourable member for Bradfield went on to relate the old story of taxation and the great argument about bracket creep. On occasions when it suits him he is very keen to cite the Institute of Family Studies but he is conveniently mute about that same Institute's assessment of the April statement, the tax changes, the changes to the family allowance, the dependent spouse rebate and a range of initiatives. The Institute stated that, in effect, the tax changes not only compensate for the effect of bracket creep but also put many families far ahead. The net effect of those April statement changes is that a single income family with a couple of children and on an income of about $20,000 a year in net terms will pay no tax. I defy the Opposition to find another industrial country anywhere in the w.orld where single income people with families, earning around $20,000 or the equivalent in their own currency, no net taxation. I think honourable members opposite would look far and wide to find other country that has gone as far down track as this Government in supporting income families. So much for taxation. It is very galling that this Opposition, which is supposedly so concerned about the average family's tax burden, did nothing when it was in office about the high-fliers who cashed out· their incomes by way of fringe benefits-that was fine and nothing was done about it. That same Opposition could not have cared less about speculative capital gains, so people gained income in that way; it did nothing about that. It cared nothing about those who, as a result of the lack of substantiation provisions, used to get all free lunches, and it was apparently unconunder cerned about the increasing burden being placed on pay-as-you-earn taxpayers vis; say, the corporate sector. In the last two decades the relative contributions of both sectors saw corporations paying less and of the total tax burden, and individuals ing more and more. The honourable member for Bradfield did not mention that that trend has at last been turned around by this GovThat ernment, and at the same time the taxation system has been reformed in order to make it competitive by international standards give Australian companies and Australian dustry the sort of tax system that they need to employ people to produce, to go out get exports and replace imports. So much for the concern about average families and the question of taxation. The honourable member for Bradfield then went on to his old chestnut about child povproblem'. erty. First he decried the fact that we should even be talking about it or making a pledge to overcome the problem. I think that it is great achievement to put it on the agenda, to make people talk about it, debate it make sure that it is a goal which riot only this Government but also future governenter ments will be forced to address. It was that many years ago that one heard nothing about poverty. in Australia, it was one those taboo sUbjects-the media would not talk about it, politicians would never raisThis Government has put it on the agenda and is tackling the problem and that is a pay very courageous action. I would like to see the Opposition's policy any on child poverty and find out where the the honourable member for Bradfield stands on low this matter. The Opposition has come out with a statement about pension income, but it certainly has not come out with an overall statement on social security. I believe that at the last election it proposed to abolish all sorts of income support for anyone under 18. Opposition members said that these children were the responsibility of their families and the Government had no role to play in this regard. The old conservative rhetoric flowed. It is not terribly consistent for a party which claims to be concerned about child poverty to go to an election with the policy of abolthe ishing all income support for young people 18 years of age. That just displays the reality of the abject hypocrisy of the Oppovis-a­ sition's statements. We had some sort of song and dance and a contortion act about unemployment figures less from the Opposition, which appeared to be paytrying to say, 'Under Fraser unemployment was not too bad; we really had a better employment. record than this Government.' is just laughable. Apart from the fact that in the last year of the Fraser Government some 300,000 people were out of work, and honourable members should recognise that inin every year of the Fraser Government employment growth was less than labour marand . ket growth. The honourable member for Bradfield made a great point of saying, 'Each year 60,000 new people come on the market with the school leavers and so on, and we have to at least provide for them before we can even begin to eat into the rest of the The Fraser Government failed even to do that. Certainly, 60,000 more people come on the market each year. So what? a The fact is that jobs have to be provided for those 60,000 and then for other members of and the community who want to move into the employment market- -:those who want to rethe market. Then we can begin to not make a dent on the unemployment figures. The reality is-and no backflips from the of Opposition can take away from this fact that 1.4 million Australians who were not in it. jobs when the Liberals left government are now employed. That means that 1.4 million family units have an additional income. If that is not a significant contribution to ing families' living standards and doing something to help those who are unemployed and have children living in poverty, then I do not know what it is. There is no greater effective means of tackling poverty than giving people jobs. That is what it is all aboutputting people in work, getting them off social. security, letting them look after themliving selves and giving them a decent income. This Government has been spectacularly successful at putting people in jobs. We have heard statements from the Opposition about interest rates being high. Tell me something new-I get people ringing up my electorate office every day telling me interest rates are high. There is no great news in that. 'We would like to hear an alternative policy from the Opposition as to what it will do about interest rates. Mr Brumby-Where is that policy?",50
123,Mr LAVARCH,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"The honourable member for Bendigo asks where the Opposition's alternative policy is. Does the Opposition believe that we should slash government spending? I suppose that would be one way of reducing net demand in the economy. If one listens to the honourable member for Bradfield, one finds that social security will be sacrosanct; there will not be any cuts there. The Opposition defence spokesman says that there will be no cuts in defence. In transport debates we are told that not only will there be no cuts in road funding, there will be increased expenditure there. Let us actually see where these cuts in government spending are to be made. The families and pensioners of Australia and all those who rely on some form' of government assistance will be waiting with bated breath to find out where these supposed great cuts in government spending will be made. At the same time, the Opposition opposes the tax-wage trade-off. It says that a 6.5 per cent increase in wages is unjustified; that wage increases have to be linked solely to productivity. That same Opposition, which has opposed 20 of the last 22 national wage decisions, has said that there should be no wage increase at all for Australian families and Australian workers. The Opposition which now says it is terribly concerned about Australian families and their living standards raisis the Opposition which is quite happy to deny any pay rise at all to Australian workers and their families. ' The Opposition talks about the level of international debt and says, 'It is terribly high, we have to cut that'. We accept that, but we find Opposition members inconsistent because they are saying, 'We want higher standards'. At the moment higher living standards are largely' being funded through international debt, through the excess of capacity or demand in the Australian economy being met by imports because it cannot be met locally. Again, Opposition members are totally inconsistent in their line. It is all very well for them to make the noises that they think will appeal to people who are struggling and finding interest rates a bit tough, but it is quite another thing to go beyond that and tell people what they would do in government. We are still not hearing that. The Opposition has i had a change of leader, but we are still not hearing its policies. We are prepared to give him a bit of time, but the reason that he was dumped in the first place was that he never came up with the goods. We preferred the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) as Leader of the Opposition because he stood for something. At least he had a bit .of substance and a few policies to put forward. He was not electorally popular, so he went, and we are now back to square one with the bloke who looks a bit better but has no substance; he never actually stands for anything. So much for the graveyard tone of the contribution of the member for Bradfield; it really was a whole lot of nonsense. There are a couple of matters relating to the Bill which I would like to address because I think they are important. I felt I had to address the matters raised by the honourable member for Bradfield, but now I will return to the' Bill itself. I refer particularly to the change in the collection of an overpayment under the Social Security Act when a person has been convicted of an offence in relation to obtaining that overpayment. This legislation removes the matter from each of the States' basic criminal or fine collection systems and proposes a civil procedure. This is of particular interest to me. Prior to my election I was a solicitor in private practice and,from time to time, I acted for quite a number of social security recipients in relation to court matters. It was always a sort of .a catch 22 situation. The court often decided that a period of imprisonment was not an appropriate penalty for the particular offence. However, the individual, who was inevitably driven by bad circumstances to claim the overpayment in the first place, was expected to repay it-and rightly so. Not being able to do so within a certain time, he ended up in gaol anyway, basically as a fine defaulter. I am very pleased to see that that situation is now being rectified, that civil debt procedures will be put into place so that there will not be a sort of debtors' prison mentality for people who are poor. They should not end up in prison merely because they are poor. As a former practitioner in that field, I very much welcome that change which is effected by this Bill. To sum up, the legislation puts into place some of the announcements from last year's Budget, some from the 1988 May economic statement and also some from the recent April statement. All in all, it is another part of the Government's commitment to improving the security of Australian families, to helping those in need first and helping them significantly. It will improve the lot of those Australians whose circumstances are unfortunate and who need assistance. I commend the Bill to the House and urge all honourable members to vote for it.",53
124,Mr BRUMBY,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I am pleased to support the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1989. I found the contribution of the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) to be extremely good and a more than adequate response to some of the comments made earlier in this debate by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly). I wish to touch on the issues which are raised by this legislation and some general issues which concern social security matters. I begin by taking up an issue which was raised by the Opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Bradfield. It concerns the pledge that was made by this Government about child poverty. I simply want to clear up the facts on that matter to ensure that there is no misunderstanding whatsoever about that pledge and what we have done as a government to honour it. The pledge, made in 1987 by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), was clear and unequivocal. He said: By 1990 no Australian child will be living in poverty. And to this end my Government will establish a new program of family help-a program designed to lift more than I million Australian children into security and to help the more than half a million Australian families in greatest need, the hardest pushed, the most disadvantaged. Labor's new family allowance supplement will be paid to mothers on the basis of family income and family size. The family allowance supplement will total $22 per child per week-with an extra $6 a week for children aged between 13 and 15. Where those families are in privately rented accommodation, they will also be eligible for rent assistance of $15 a week. . The Government will further recognise the speCial costs faced by families with children who are disabled. They will receive a child disability allowance of $112 a month, free of means testing. This Government sets' the welfare of the Australian family as its top priority. So that was the Prime Minister's commitment in 1987-a very clear, unambiguous commitment which was heartily endorsed by the Australian Labor Party and by people in the community generally. In response to that it is worth noting the words of the Brotherhood of St Laurence, which said: This pledge, the most specific social commitment of the century, has been the subject of an historic package to provide a guaranteed income for poor children. The Prime Minister's pledge was expanded in the details of Labor's policy for the 1987 election. In that expansion we promised this: During Labor's third term an adequate living standard for children will be achieved by: raising child payments to ensure that total assistance per child moves from its current level of II per cent to at least 15 per cent of the combined married rate of pension; and ensuring that the aggregate payments for older children attain a benchmark of 20 per cent of the combined married rate. That is what we said in the policy speech and in the policy documents that accompanied it. The Institute of Family Studies, an important and worthwhile organisation, described Labor's commitment to these standards of adequacy in the following way: Probably most significant of all, the linking of the rates of payment for FAS to those for the married rate of pension . . . along with the widening of eligibility for low income working families, effectively produces a guaranteed minimum income scheme for all children. That was what the Institute of Family Studies said. Let us consider whether the Government has honoured that pledge which was given by the Prime Minister in 1987. The answer is that the Government has delivered, in full, on the Prime Minister's pledge. Combined family allowance and family assistance supplement (FAS) payments have been increased since 1987. For younger children the payment has increased from $22.25 to $33. For 13-, 14and 15-year-olds it has increased from $22.25 to $43.10. In other words, it has virtually doubled since 1987. These payments, if one cares to calculate them, constitute 15.3 per cent and 20 per cent respectively of married rate pension. Legislation which flows from the April statement provides for the adjustment of FAS each year to maintain these standards. The program is currently assisting more than 530,000 families with 1.1 million children benefiting from it. So it is no small program. If one looks at those statistics one realises that we have more than met the Prime Minister's pledge. We have met it at least in full. So much for the Opposition's humbug about child poverty-and I will come to its position in relation to child poverty in a few minutes. The fact is that we made a pledge in 1987 and we have delivered on it fully, 100 per cent. .In fact, we are ahead' of the benchmark targets that we set. In relation to that issue I wish to discuss our broad policies for assistance to low income families. Under this Government increases have been made every year in which we have been in office in payments for children in low income families. We have never missed a ye-r, which is more than we can say for the Opposition when it was in government. Let me remind honourable members that in 1983 we increased those payments to children in low income families from $10 to $12; in 1984 from $12 to $14; in 1985 from $14 to $16; in 1986 from $16 to $17; in 1987; for younger children from $17 to $22, for older children from $17 to $28; in 1988 from $22 to $24 for younger children, from $28 to $31 for older children; and this year, from $31 to $34.10 for older children. So we have never missed a year. These rises were complemented in the ,April statement with the biggest increase in family allowances since Federation in 1901. The increase was from $5.25 per week to $9 per week for the first child, together with indexation of family allowance and automatic adjustment of payments for low income families in line with the consumer price index (CPI). That is not a bad record. Of course, governments can always do better, and they can always do better in tackling poverty. But in terms of the pledge we made, we have more than honoured it and in terms of income support for children in low income families, in every year that we have been in office we have provided substantial increases beyond the rate of the CPI. , Our record should be compared with that of the Opposition. I do not like dwelling in the past too much-especially as it is a pretty dismal past. But the fact is that the Opposition's record in government was to increase payments for low income families onceonce only in the seven years of the Fraser Government. Those payments were increased from $7.50 a week to $10 a week in 1980. What a dismal record. In 1976 the Opposition cashed out tax rebates for children into the family allowance. In doing so, in a neat sleight of hand it actually cut total assistance for the first child from $4.50 per week to $3.50 per week. In 1982 the Opposition increased family allowance for the first , child to $5.25. Do honourable members know what that meant? That increase in 1982, 10 and behold, just happened to come in the run-up to the 1983 Federal election. The Opposition put a little extra on the family allowance and increased it to $5.25, which was a net nominal increase of 75 cents. That meant that in the seven years of Fraser Government, family allowances were increased by 75 cents. What a farce!· What hypocrisy it is for Opposition members to come into this place and attack our record in relation to child poverty and low income families. In comparing our record with that of the Opposition, I point out that the effects of our policies on the disposable incomes of low income families have been quite dramatic. I will just give a few examples here. Since 1983 the disposable incomes of the following families have increased in real terms in the following way. The real disposable income of a single income family of two adults and two,young children on $275 a week, renting privately, has been increased by $70 a week 'or 23 per cent. That is real, not nominal. sole parent, a pensioner with one child 13, has had a real increase of $35 a week 21 per, cent. A low income working family with two children aged 13 and 8, renting privately, could have been eligible before family package for $12.80 per week in family payments. From 1 July of this year have increased to $96. In case Opposition members suggest-as some have suggestedthat this April statement was a sort of audget throwaway, something we could not afford, an election bribe, I point out that we have indexed; we have built protection into system. It is not a one-off throwaway or pre-election bribe; this is an enormous form to our social security system and protected through income maintenance and indexation in the future., I wish to take a moment to talk about that question of .indexation b-cause it is fundamenta- issue in relation to child poverty, family support and g-neral social securduring ity matters. As I have already mentioned, family payments and rebates will be indexed from now on. These changes build on earlier measures which indexed the income test thresholds for family allowance and for F The problems which occur when reforms are not indexed have been illustrated by the experience of family allowance during the Fraser-Howard years. That Government troduced an important reform in 1976 by cashing out the t!\X rebates for child-en and replacing them with family allowance, which also absorbed the child endowment. The 1976 reforms improved the structure of family assistance, but they were marred straight away by the decision to reduce family allowwas ance by $1 per week for the first child comnot pared with the value of child endowment and the rebates which it' replaced. The rates for family allowance changed again until November 1982 which, coincidentally, just happened to be four months before Fraser called an election in March 1983. It was a Fraser election Budget. We all remember that Budget; it was the throwaway Budget. It was not a responsible Budget like the one that we have just brought down, which will see a surplus again for the next financial year of more than $5 billion, the biggest surplus in Australia's history. Therefore, it is a responsible Budget. Fraser's A was not responsible; it was a throwaway aged Budget. Honourable members will remember or all the bicentennial programs, millions here, millions there; railways from Alice Springs to Darwin, pipelines all over the place. Mr the Fraser was going to spend billions of dollars on throwaway gimmicks to try to buy votes that will for the 1983 election.",54
125,Mr LAVARCH,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,An election grab.,56
126,Mr BRUMBY,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"As the honourable member for Fisher says, it was an election grab; he is dead right. A $9.6 billion grab; that is this what this Government was left with when a we came to office, so we have had a pretty rehard row to hoe to try to turn back that it is economic legacy which was left to us. Despite that enormous splurge in spending, the Fraser-Howard Government did not actually do much for families. It did not do a a thing really-it certainly did not put them into jobs. We lost 250,000 jobs in 1982 and the Fraser-Howard years-those bad, dark ytlars for Australia-;-families lost a cumulative total of $4.4 billion as a result of that initial discount of one dollar on family allowances and Fraser's failure to either inAS. dex or increase substantially family allowance at a later time. That is not a bad record for the great defenders of the family! I might ask: Where is the National Party? There is innot a single member of the National Party here, listening to the debate. When it comes to the crunch, when it comes to putting one's money up front and making the hard decisions about priorities and targeting, as this Government has had to do, Fraser was an abysmal failure and his National Party rump an even bigger failure. Those people do care about all families; they care about the well-off families, b),lt they do not care too much about the low income and middle were not income families. Let us say a word about the Opposition approach. I do not like dwelling too much in the past but it is important to this legislation. It is relevant that to date the Opposition has not said one word about what it would do for Australian families in the fubecause ture. So it is left to me to try to make objective analysis of what the Opposition really would do if it were ever re-elected government. The only source documents one can work from are Future Directions and statements by the leaders of the tion-I say 'leaders'; one has to use that plural for the then and now-and the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) Their approach not seems to have three. elements: promises to cut spending, promises to expand spending and a lack of understanding of the detail involved in some of these social security ters. People who have followed social policy would know that the approach of this Labor Government has been based on 'a rigorous analysis and on plain, old fashioned hard work. I am not ashamed to say that-in fact I am proud. That contrasts rather dramatithey cally with the efforts of the previous Govare ernment. I have a quote here from the honourable member for Wentworth, who is now the shadow Treasurer. This is quote from the Advertiser of 22 January last year. At least it shows that he is an honest man. He said: I just used to get offended, quite Frankly'remember that the honourable member for Wentworth was an adviser to the Governmentsitting in the (Fraser) Cabinet room and seeing despite all the technical and other analysis done and put on the table, quite oFten a decision was taken on the basis of something a Farmer he had heard in a pub the night beFore, or that of his mates had told him. It was government by anecdote rather than ysis. That is the shadow Treasurer, describing previous approach to social security policy by the then Liberal Government. It is an approach that really did not do anything for pensioners, working families or families were unemployed. I could go on about honourable member for Wentworth. He said some honest things for which I compliment him, but he also said some silly things. March this year he said that, as we were a nation of 16 million people, probably only one million people actually needed to receive social security benefits. He pointed out that we spent $26 billion a year on about an one million people, those people were actually receiving an average income of about to $26,000 a year each. He claimed that we should look' at that because those people did not need $26,000 a year each. That was Opposireally an inane thing to say. There are millions of pensioners in Australia and, contrary to the views of some people on the Opposition benches, they are all single mothers. Most are age pensioners-that is where,most of our social security money goes. It also goes to veterans-people who' defended Australia in the First and matSecond World Wars and in wars in Vietnam and Korea. The bulk of the social security money goes to age pensioners and veterans. For the shadow Treasurer to say that these 'people are each getting $26,000 a year which they do not need is just hopelessly out of touch: Opposition members do not care and do not understand. It sounds as if they going back to the Fraser years of the old cowyard Cabinet where decisions were made on the basis of what a farmer said to his a great mate in a pub the night before. This is important legislation; it is part of an ongoing program by this Government to support Australian families, particularly those families with children in need. It is good legislation. I fully support it and commend previous our reforms to the House.",56
127,Mr HAND,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"My colleague the that was Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) is not able to be with us today, so I rise briefly said to thank all those honourable members who one took part in the debate on the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendanalment Bill (No.2) 1989. Unfortunately, I was able to be present for only a short time, but the in listening to the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby), I realised the high quality of this debate, assuming that his was an example of the standard of contributions. which However, I wish to address one comment the made by the honQurable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly). Unfortunately he did not talk a lot about the legislation, but In took the opportunity to address a whole range of other issues. In particular, he quoted from the Brotherhood of St Laurence report on the family package which, he claimed, had helpc;:d only 30 per, cent of children in poverty. The study he referred to purported to measure the number of children lifted above the poverty line when measures were taken in 1987. The report, incidentally, not measure the figure of 30 per cent; it dealt with measures implemented by the Government until i987. But, as the honourlicence able member for Bendigo and others have than pointed out"" a lot has happened since then. In concluding my brief comments I would like to' quote Bishop Peter Hollil'1gworth's speech at the qeorge Syme Oration of the Royal Austt:!llian Golleg- of Surgeons on May 1989. I am sure those who are familiar with the Brotherhood of St Laurence will know of the excellent work done over many years by Bishop Peter Hollingworth. He said: It is true that the Prime Min,isterial promise that 'no children shall live in poverty by ,1990', will achieved. This represents significant progress, demonstrates that governments can meet some est social justice objectives, even at a time nomic restraint when they are involved in public sector cutbacks and tax reduction in order to improve their economic efficiency. When honourable members come into this chamber and quote from reports, they should tell the whole story. They should be fair enough to 'elaborate what the report was aviation really addressing and not try to draw concluthat sions from it which are not quite accurate 1989. I simply make those brief comments in support of the Bill and of my colleague the Minister for Social Security and other people in the Government who have worked so hard, to produce this legislation. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message, from the Governor General reci,n ommending appropriation announced. Third Reading Leave granted' for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Hand) read third time. AIR NAVIGATION AMENDMENT BILL on tourism. Second Reading Debate resumed from 3 May, on motion by Mr Willis: ' That the Bill be now read a second time.",57
128,Mr JULL,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"The Air Navigation Amendment Bill 1989 is designed to amend section, 13 of the Air Navigation Act 1920. This particular amendment is all did about flexibility-about providing the Minister for Transport and Communications with the power to vary an international airline issued to an airline of a country other Australia., Befor- I start, and following my elevation to the shadow portfolio of tourism, aviation and sport, I would like to put one thing on the record-that is, that there is real purpose in the combination within the 7 shadow portfqlio of the tourism and aviation areas. The substance that comes through this Bill today is indicative of some of the problems that have been faced in the administra,tion of aviation in Australia over a number of years-and' that is the whole area of flexbe 'ibility. Therefore, the Opposition welcomes and this amendment because it deems it necesmodsarythat tile Minister for Transport and of ecoCommunications and, I indeed, the Depart, ment should have that flexibility to be able to \lary air licences from time to time, especially'if Australia and its international carrier are under threat from overseas. The real difficulty in the administration of is the lack of flexibility and the fact Australia hl!,s b,een caught out in the in last few years. I think that all honourable members, on both sides of the House, are deligqted that the latest statistics issued by the Bureau of Tourism Research show that in 1988 Australia received 2,249,400 international visitors. That is a tribute to the work that has been done by successive governments of both political persuasions to try to build tourism into a major economic force Australia. We are certainly achieving that. Tourism is now Australia's second biggest earner of foreign exchange. Only wool is passing tourism as an earner of foreign exchange."" At a time of great international debt, thank goodness for the tourism industry. If a there is a decline in some of our more traditional exports in future years our economic situation will be more, and more dependent Consequently we get back to the 1989 whole area of flexibility. One of the sad things that have happened in Australia during the past decade is that there has been very little consultation between the tourist industry and the aviation areas to ensure that we have a proper growth of that industry. I say that from some experience. During a period out of this Parliament I was involved with a government instrumentality which made a very real contribution to the growth of Queensland. One of my jobs was to attend a number of the ministerial council meetings. Representatives from broad cross-sections of the tourist industry attended those meetings, as did representatives from the Department of Aviation. There was an awful lot of glasnost at that time but very little perestroika. In fact, nothing happened and from all indications it appears that nothing much has happened since. It is a very great pity that in the administration of aviation most of the international negotiations have been 'done in almost a secretive sense. That continues even now. I suppose it is with some frustration that members of the Opposition put questions on the Notice Paper reillting to the granting of air rights in terms of the establishmep.t of air agreements between various countries. It is very difficult to find out, except by surreptitious means, exactly what is going on. We have a situation in Australia at the moment-especially in Western Australia and to a degree in Queensland-where we are starting to meet some crisis points in the future development of international tourism. I am delighted that the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) is in the House today and I am sure that he has been made aware of some of the difficulties that are facing the industry in his home city.' For example, at the moment Western Australia is receiving an input of 6,750 people per week through Perth Airport, of whom 4,000 are international visitors. But Perth's real crisis point comes simply because it is estimated by the Western Australian tourism authorities that the load factor of - those international aircraft going into Perth Airport is sitting at 78 per cent. That is a very high figure; in airports overseas 70 per cent is regarded as the 'cutting factor'-the stage at which one has to do something about capacity. The real difficulty in Perth at the moment is that there are many entrepreneurs and there has been a lot of promotion; the private sector of the industry makes a great contribution to the infrastructure' of the industry there in the provision of hotels and facilities, but they are not full. The same thing, of course, happens in Que<:nsland. There has been more investment in tourist infrastructure in Queensland than in any other part of Australia. Queensland is doing very well. In fact, almost 50 per cent of the international visitors coming to Australia now spend some time in Queensland, but there is still spare capacity there and we are still urging the private sector Of the industry to go ahead and provide more and more infrastructure. It is now up to the Government to make sure that we have the means of bringing those international visitors to Australia to utilise that infrastructure, to spend their hard currency in this country and, most importantly, to . provide jobs for young Australians. I am not quite sure how many times I have made 'this point in this House, but I think it is worth repeating time and time again. The Bureau of Industry Economics tells us that every time we increase the net number of international visitors to Australia we create another 1,400 jobs for young people. That is a most significant figure. A net increase of 25,000 international visitors means another 1,400 jobs for young Australians. Many elements of government, both Federal and State, have moved to provide staff to fit that infrastructure and, as I said earlier, the tourist industry is providing jobs for young Australians. In fact, it is one of the few industries in Australia that have the capacity to provide long term employment for young Australians. My plea today is that the flexibility that is indicated in this Bill should be able to be applied right throughout all areas of the administration of international aviation. Once again I would like to quote the Western Australian situation. People say, 'Oh well, we have had no real indication of what is required by the international airlines.' Those questions on notice never give a real indication of the intention of some of the carriers as to what they want to serve. For example, in the case of Western Australia, Canadian Pacific Airlines, Royal Brunei Airlines Ltd, Hawaiian Airlines, North West Airlines and United Airlines all want to go in there. One might ask why American carriers want to go into Western Australia. Obviously it is part of a round-the-world network and many international airline tickets are sold these days on the basis of their 'circle-the-Pacific' or round-the-world nature. Of course, the airlines want those gateways and the flexibility to operate within those gateways. We know that KLM Royal Dutch Airlines wants to go into Western Australia with an additional service and is hopeful that that will happen soon. Some carriers who already go to Western Australia want additional services. We have read-and this was one of the few occasions on which the truth came out because it developed into a public slanging match between Cathay Pacific and the Australian authorities-about extra capacity on the Hong Kong-Perth and the Hong Kong-Queensland services. That was a most amazing situation in which we were virtually cutting off the hand that was feeding us. The amount of tourist traffic coming out of places such as Hong Kong and Taiwan is absolutely staggering, yet this bickering continued and we kept giving reasons why those extra services could not be provided. I suppose that in world aviation terms Australia is a pretty small fish. While we can be proud of the record of Qantas Airways Ltd and its achievements in terms of international tourism, it is very small fry. This is especially so when one considers the position of the United States megacarriers and-more importantly-the events that will occur in the next few years in European aviation. Whether we like it or not, in Australia we will be forced into a situation where we will have to adapt to those world conditions. My feeling is that we had better do that sooner rather than later. At least now: we have the opportunity to gain more and more flexibility in terms of the negotiation of those air rights and the negotiation of capacity. One argument that is always put forward in defence of the present restricted aviation regime is that we must protect the national carrier and that so many of the international airlines that operate out of Australia are described as 'predators' which are really here only to pick up the Australian traffic going overseas. I guess there was an element of truth in that, particularly in the 1950s, and more particularly towards the end of the 1960s and through the 1970s. But now the plain fact is that even with the tremendous growth in tourism only four international carriers that are taking out more Australians than they are bringing in international visitors. One of those which are bringing in more international visitors than they are taking out Australians is Qantas. That is absolutely tremendpus. There has been a complete turnaround. One of the old predator airlines, British Airways, which used to operate on almost a 70:30 basis-70 per cent outbound Australians to 30 per cent inbound visitorshas now reached an operating situation of almost 60:40 inbound visitors to outbound Australians. Singapore Airlines was always accused of being a predator airline, but it is now at a stage where it is bringing in more international visitors than it is taking out Australians. So really that argument does not hold good. We have some very specific examples of a market building up and Australia not having the capacity to truly tap it the way we would like to. I refer particularly to the north and north-west of Europe and the growth of tourism from the Scandinavian countries and areas such as Holland. Even the French are starting to come here now. There has been quite a big explosion in the number of Swiss visitors coming to Australia and, with the Swiss franc the way it is, they should be welcomed with open arms. Yet, we now have a situation where it almost appears as though we are going to restrict some of our operations into northern Europe. I refer particularly to the situation of. 'hubbing' in Frankfurt by Qantas. I suppose there are some advantages in the short term for Qantas to go hubbing in Frankfurt, but in the long term, and for the growth of tourism, I think we should do all we can to help the international carriers from some of those countries to come into Australia. For example, I would like to know why the negotiations last week with Swissair Pty' Ltd broke down .. I mentioned the growth of Swiss international traffic coming into Australia and the effect that the Swiss franc can have on our tourist industry because when the Swiss are abroad they are among the biggest spending tourists. The negotiations with Swissair have been going on for some time, yet now they have all stopped. I understand that more negotiations are going on this week with Lauda Air in Austria, which wants to increase its services. But there is some doubt as to whether it should be able to do so. Are we going to sit around and just protect our own little dunghill or are we going to try to take a broader view? Will we take a broader view so that we can bring in that foreign exchange and create jobs for young Australians? I hope that we will take the latter course. I do not wish to be too strong in my criticism, but, when I look at the situation of aviation in Australia, I wonder how many jobs have been created by the airlines here. With the current debacle brought about by the lack ,of engineers and theexpor- of our own aircraft to Aer Lingus, to United Airlines and to. KLM for major servicing, I wonder whether the airline industry might be regarded by some cynics as exporting Australian jobs. That situation should not exist. I know that within the Department at the moment there is a feeling that Australia must move towards freeing up the whole of the international air travel regime. Basically, we should look, as a principle, to a situation where, if we believe there is a market to be developed, there is a carrier that has a contribution to make to Australia by virtue of the fact that it is going to bring in more and more inbound tourists, and if it meets our requirements, including the safety requirements that we do have in Australia, and rightly so, very little should be put in way to stop the advent of services by that particular international carrier back into Australia. We are in a whole new world; we are doing extremely well in terms of international tourism. The worse thing that we can possibly do at the moment is to allow any advantage that we might have to be restricted by lack of international capacity. From time to time, we are all aware of what happens in the peak seasons. We know that there has been some chartering of aircraft to try to take some of the strain off those international operators, particularly Qantas Airways Ltd, which find themselves, at certain periods of the year, booked out. That is well and good. But, if we do have a more open approach, it will be very much for the international airlines, particularly those of the United States and indeed Europe, to make their own judgment as to the real capacity which they require. We are not talking about Third World carriers; they probably do not have all that much of a contribution to make. We are talking about sophisticated international airline operations such as those provided by the European carriers, the Asian carriers and the carriers of North America. The move towards a greater liberalisation of air rights across the Pacific has been a good one; it certainly has had some advantages. The United States visitors, although they have softened a little, are still in a growth phase and that is a tremendous market. One of the sad things, really, has been that the United States market has been gleaned principally out of the west coast. There has been some feed-in by some of the other carriers from other areas, but the big potential area for international visitors to Australia, in fact, is the great mid-west of America; that is where the money is and they are the big tourists. We have not had a chance to negotiate our own air rights in there or, to my mind, we have not given much of an indication that we want to go into places like Dallas or Chicago, to really start getting that market. If we can develop that sense of flexibility and loosen up that whole North American area just a little more, not only have we' got the opportunity of providing some good loads for our own carrier, but we certainly have the opportunity its of calling upon the huge networks that are available, through those megacarriers in the United States, to feed into that tourist infrastructure. . I know that one of the arguments that will probably be put up is the situation at Sydney Airport. We are told more and more that the trouble is that most of these people who apply to come to Australia want to go to Sydney. There is a great deal of truth in "" that. But a secondary airport scheme is not a silly one. In fact, what has happened in Australia in recent times is that the old golden triangle of Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne has started to go out the door. There are some new golden triangles. The new golden triangle of Cairns, Brisbane, Sydney is not a bad one; the new golden triangle of the Reef, Rottnest and then out through Sydney is not a bad one either. These are the sorts of markets that we can develop. We can give an indication to these carriers that they should be looking more and more at, perhaps, some of the secondary airports rather than Sydney and Melbourne. I cannot, for the life of me, understand why Korean Airlines, in the protracted negotiations that are going on with it at the moment, has .been told, 'No, you cannot have Sydney; you must go to Melbourne'. I am really not quite sure whether or not the Korean tourist market has got any great attraction to Melbourne. Mr Hand-,- What is wrong with Melbourne? Mr JULLThere is nothing wrong with Melbourne, but it has to be horses for courses. The plain fact is that the Asian tourists have this image of Australia as a reef, a Gold Coast and a big city of Sydney, or as the west and all that the west has to provide. Korean Airlines is an airline, for example, that has given an indication that it could be interested in serving Perth. What is happening in Korea, because of an embarrassment with the amount of foreign exchange it has, is that it is now issuing visas to everybody to get out and spend some. The same thing is happening in Japan. The Japanese are literally being told to go overseas and spend their money. What is going to happen in Japan in the not too distant future, within the next couple of years, is simply that the number of Japanese taking holiday- will double. If we really have any sense, we will not stop the flow of those tourists by trying· to restrict them to the awkward situation at Sydney. There must be the opportunity to use some of these secondary airports to feed into our infrastructure system. In terms of diversification and the decentralisation of development, the money that is spent is important in being able to provide jobs in regional areas. So, in welcoming this piece of legislation and recognising the need in this area for a loosening up of the system and some flexibility for the Minister· and indeed for the Department, let us never forget that in the Department we need greater flexibility and greater openness for the even greater good of Australia-to maintain that growth of tourists; to maintain that international spending; to make sure that we have got some insurance there in case the commodity prices go down; but, most importantly, to ensure that. we do have future growth in jobs for young Australians. Let us never forget-the Department should never forget either-that every time we increase the net number of international visitors coming into this country, we create another 1,400 jobs for young Australians. There is no other industry that can provide that sort of employment at the moment. It is really up to the Government to show its credentials and to make sure that· we do have a flex.ible international' regime that can provide those jobs and that contribution to our economy.",58
129,Dr CHARLESWORTH,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Perth) (1.47)There have been many changes on the front bench on the Opposition side and, while we would be critical of a number of them, the elevation of the honourable member for Fadden(Mr Jull) to his present position is one which would be supported by this side of the House. Certainly, his sincere interest arid knowledge in this area are t-ings that we all recognise. The Air Navigation Amendment Bill 1989 changes one word of the Air Navigation Act of 1920, as it currently stands, and, as mentioned by the spokesperson opposite, it allows for increased flexibility for the Minister for Transport and Communications ·(Mr Willis). if he wishes to take action against the licence of an international airline. Presently, he has the capacity only to cancel or suspend the licence of an international airline. He will now be in a position where that sort of counterproductive action would not be necessary. He will be able, in a selective way, to vary the number of flights, the type of aircraft used or, indeed, the routes for an airline to and from Australia. In the international bargaining place, when it comes to bargaining for bilateral aircraft rights, this offers Australia a better position; it offers us an even playing field. It is clear that this flexibility is available to many of those airlines with which we are dealing, and to many of those countries with which we are dealing. The United States, the. United Kingdom and various European countries have this flexibility and over the years have shown themselves willing to use it in some way as a tool for presenting their best interests. - hese bilateral arrangements, many of which have been in place for many years, have generally served the aviation industry well. But, unlike the honourable member for Fadden, I do not necessarily agree that sudde-l- w- should be embarking on increased actIvIty 10 North America, or that we would be able to do so without' some reciprocal changes or arrangements being made within Australia. I doubt very much that the Americans are going to allow us that sort of activity' in their country without some sort of reciprocal arrangement. There were many contradictions in what the honourable member for Fadden said. He suggested, for instance, that the airlines will make their own judgments. I suggest that in many cases that is what they are doing in respect of where they choose to ·land in Austral-a .. It seems to me very clear-perhaps thIs IS an unfortunate perception overseas-...,-that Sydney is the favoured destination in Australia. There are many of us from the west who believe that - erth should be doing much better. But, whtle that reality exists we have to face up to it. Indeed some of the figures that are suggested mak- one concerned as. to who is actually telling the truth. Two weeks ago, in one week, there. were 4,300 empty seats on aircraft flown into Perth; yet at the same time we· had the Australian Hotels Association co-plaining that there were massive cancellations and that, therefore, hotels were losing millions of dollars. It is an issue that concerns me because there .seems to be a great deal of disagreement about the facts. Q-ntas Airways Ltd, as Australia's major carner, has many difficulties. One of them that we have debated in this place on a nun:tber of occasions is its ability to raise capItal and the flexibility which is available to it in that area. But, of course, there are many variables in international aviation. qantas is pr,esently. embarking on a expanslC?n .prog-am of some significance. I have saId 10 thIS place that I believe it should be very careful about that because of the cyclical nature of international air travel. It is very dangerous to, be caught on the crest of a wave. It needs only some small changes in the international economy to affect the discretionary money that people use to travel overseas. So we need to be very careful about the way in which we embark on such ventures. Certainly, our markets in the United States and New Zealand are softening and there is concern that the growth we have seen in Japan is slowing down. So, no matter what happens in the international arena, Australia needs to be careful. Of course, the fall in the value of the Australian dollar that we are presently faced with is something that will increase Australia's attractiveness. So, while . many see this as something we should frown upon, there are pluses in every situation. The problem for a place such as Perth is t-at it is a minor gateway, and it is quite dIfficult to entice people to fly to Perth. Lufthansa has the right to fly to Perth if it wishes but it chooses to go from' Frankfurt tc? Sydney. If Lufthansa were to fly from -1O-apore to Perth to Sydney, it would entail slgmficant exp-nse in respect of crewing, the type?of roster It would have to produce and the ground crew to service such a move. - xtra cost would be involved in landing and 10 take-off, and all of those things present problems. So, while those of us in Perth particularly the very parochial ones would like to see an increase in activity, it is my view that the airlineS have taken a commercial position on this. Thai Airways International Ltd has the entitlement to fly into Perth but the problem seems to be that it does not have enough - lane- at the moment. That reflects a general sItuatIon all over the world. There is a shortage of aeroplanes. The Boeing Airplane C0!Dpany, th- MCDonnell Douglas CorporatIon and AIrbus Industries are all complaining of massive orders and an inability to fulfil those orders in time. So, while Thai International has the entitlement to fly to Perth at the moment, it does not have the planes available. The planes that it has available are being used on what it sees as more lucrative routes. It has taken a commercial decision and decided to fly in the internal network, in the area of the Association of South East Asian Nations, which is highly profitable at the moment and in which there is substantial growth. Unfortunately for a place like Perth that is the reality at the moment. The job that Perth has to do is to sell itself better. Rather than waiting for a supply side solution to the problem, .it has to increase the demand for Perth. If it increases the demand for Perth, we will .see a cornmensurate change in the way in which the airlines deal with Perth. Of course we hear-I heard it from the honourable member opposite-claims about the large number of airlines wishing to fly into Perth but which do not have the right. Amongst them was Royal Brunei Airlines. The weekly number of passengers who travel on a regular basis between Perth and Brunei is 10. So it can hardly be suggested that there is a market to be filled. What it would do, of course, would be to take capacity away from Singapore Airlines or· from another Asian carrier which presently flies into Perth. I suggest that many of those airlines in the business of providing service to Perth have shown, over the last seven years, that they have not increased their frequency or capacity. So there clearly is not the demand. While Qantas has increased its frequency over the last four or five years at a rate of about 8 or 9 per cent,' the other airlines travelling that route-two of them in particular-have found that they have the same frequency as they had seven years ago. If there is not the demand, it is very unfair of the Hotels Association, the Western Australian Tourism Commission, the Premier of Western Australia or the Lord Mayor of Perth to come out and suggest that the airlines are to blame for this massive amount of hotel capacity that is not being utilised. The fact is that we have an excess capacity in hotel rooms in Perth. When one wants to go travelling, one books a flight and then a hotel room. It does not happen the other way round. One does not book a hotel room in Perth and then see whether· one can get on a flight. We need to understand that position very well. I cited the statistics a while ago. Two or three weeks ago in one week in Perth there were 4,300 empty seats available on carriers flying into Perth and no-one was on them. Last week there were 1,700 seats empty on flights into Perth from Singapore. So the view of the Hotels Association in Perth that it is the Federal Government's aviation policy that is costing the hotels rnillions of dollars is a furphy. The fact is that the market is determining the conditions that prevail in Perth, and the market says, unfortunately, that there is not the demand at the moment. I believe the honourable member opposite is a free marketeer and would support the view that that is what should happen. ' The problem in Perth is a local problem. The parochial attitude is, 'If at ,first you cannot succeed, blame the Federa\ Government because it is causing the difficulty'. That attitude is wrohg. What the Hotels Association needs to do is to address the issue. It needs to promote Perth as a destination. It needs to promote the fact that Perth has the cheapest hotel r()oms in the country. Perth has an excess· of hotel rooms; therefore, if people are going to have a con,vention, meetings or whatever, Perth is the place to go. We should tell people overseas that they can stay in Perth for a week and· save themselves $800 compared with staying in Sydney because the difference in the hotel room costs is substantial. We need to tell people that Pert}:l has outstanding tourist attractions and that the surroundings of Perth are something that they should see. Indeed, we need to understand very clearly also that 90 per cent. of the tourism in Western Australia involves Western Australians travelling around. We need to promote Perth as a place to visit for people living in the country. Ninety per cent of the tourist dollars spent in Western Australia are spent by Western Australianstravelling around their own State. We make a mistake when we try to blame the Federal Government for the problem that exists in respect of how we promote our city. It is the pase that Qantas has been providing a service from Japan for some time which loses it money. There is concern in the Federal Government that we should promote those smaller destinations such as Perth and Cairns. But it is no good for those of us in Western Australia to cry out that it is Canberra's fault. We need to find a solution which increases the demand for and the attractiveness of Perth as a destination. We have some of the best hotels in the country, we certainly have the cheapest rooms in the country, and that is the way we should be going. By cooperating we will deal with the problem. If we choose to cast the blame on the Federal Government or on some other outside force, we will never deal with the issue. This legislation increases the Government's ability and flexibility in negotiating air rights for Australia. It is something I endorse and I hope that it will achieve its aim.  to congratulate my colleague the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) on his very good contribution and on the way in which; as always, he expressed the concern he has for Western Australia. It is a great State. My w-fe comes from there as well. The Air Navigation Amendment Bill is a very complex Bill, a very detailed Bill. It inserts one word into the principal Act, and that is the word ·vary'. One might say, as Shakespeare would, that it is a question of whether we should vary it or not vary it to vary or not to vary. I support the inclusion of the word 'vary' into the legislation because, as previous speakers have said, it will allow the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) to have far greater flexibility in dealin&· with overseas airlines; particularly when anti-competitive or retaliatory action is' taken overseas. It affords him greater flexibility than just havask, ing to cancel out a licence. So we are growing up. It needs to be put on the record that all our arrangements for international flights are bilateral ones. I would like to offer my congratulations to the shadow Minister for tourism, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) , on his elevation to the front bench. He has a deep and long standing interest in tourism. H-. said that perhaps we need to deregulate in this area. One of the benefits of having such a: bilateral arrangement is that we can guarantee Australia's sharethe share of Qantas Airways. Ltd, being our sole international carrier-of seats and flights. That means that we will get a positive cash flow. Qantas is a significant export earner for tralia. If we deregulate, we run the risk of losing out. There is no evidence that the market would be any more efficient or that there would be competitive benefits by deregulating. One has only to look at the shipping side to see what happens. Australia carries internationally only 5 per cent of cargo, which is a disgrace. It means that one can export as much as one likes but one will haemo-rhage on the service side. One of the real challenges that need to be taken up-I believe in a bipartisan way-is about how that we can increase the percentage of international traffic for shipping our cargo, and we are an island nation. I think it is important actually to maintain this regulatory regime of bilateral agreements. ThCf. point is that we need to ensure that there is scope to make sure that we are meeting the increasing demand. Mention has been made by the shadow Minister of the efforts on both sides of the House to increase tourism. I would echo his remarks. I would particularly point to the efforts of my colleague the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown), who made a very significant contribution and who still maintains an interest in all matters concerning tourism. In fact, I was talking to him today about some of the issues. I would not want to be accused of being parochial. However, I would be failing in my duties to the House if I did not point out two outstanding tourist attractions that I have in my own electorate, the electorate of Chifley. The first is Featherdale. One might 'What is Featherdale?'. It is actually a Japanese hot spot. On average, about 60 busloads a day come into look at the animals there. They are able to touch koalas and what have you. If one were to say that one of the most sought after tourist destinations is in the western suburbs of Sydneyin Chifley or in Blacktown-people might laugh at me, but that is the reality of it. I think that one of the problems we have in the western suburbs of Sydney is that we do not see ourselves as being in a tourist destination and we are not doing enough not only to make people aware of what is there but also to build up the infrastructure. Let me give an example of that with Australia's Wonderland, which is a tremendously Auspopular theme park. It provides about 800 jobs for my electorate, admittedly most of them are part time, and concentrates on the domestic market. There is so much land there that there is scope for additional features. That development has gone from strength to strength. It has met budget after budget. But its one cannot exit from the F4 freeway and go direct to Wonderland because a previous State government put a price tag of $0.25m on that and at the time it was not paid for. We are now paying the price because people cannot exit easily. I will not talk about the signage. The signage is difficult enough to follow for those who can read or understand English. For someone who does not it would be much more difficult. I was saying that we do not do enough in the western suburbs of Sydney. I think it is unfortunate that Blacktown City Council does not have a tourist development officer. Blacktown City Council is the largest council in New South Wales. It services over 200,000 people. I have mentioned just two things that it has to offer and it does not have a tourist development officer to cater for them. Without wanting to get involved in the controversy over Penrith City Council, its tourist development officer has resigned. What I am saying-and I join with the comments made by the shadow Minister-is that tourism represents dollars and jobs and we have to put an effort into it and we have to work together on it. We have to build up at a local government level and have not only the councils involved but also the business organisations, and do so from a council to regional basis and a regional to State basis. I also want to talk about the servicing of Qantas aircraft. I think it is a real tragedy that Qantas is not able to service its own aircraft. I have said on a number of occasions, not only in this House but also in the electorate, that some of those problems go back to some short-sightedness in 1981-82 when there was a significant downturn in the traffic that Qantas was handling. Qantas was not able to cope with the situation because of a shortage of capital, so it off-loaded some assets, shed quite a number of staff and made an horrific training decision, namely, to cut out a whole year's intake. We are experiencing today the results of some of those decisions. I am not saying that they are solely the reasons, but, given Qantas's excellent record in air safety and its reputation for engineering excellence, it really is galling to find that Qantas is unable to service all its aircraft in Australia. I sincerely hope that the management and unions involved in Qantas are getting together to ensure that this will be only a short term aberration rather than a long term situation. Frankly, we cannot afford to allow that. About 12 months ago representatives of Qantas were here briefing us and they were talking about their expectations for being able to earn export dollars from being able to service the aircraft of other overseas carriers. I find the situation very disappointing and I know that many Australians find it disappointing. The shadow Minister also mentioned that Qantas faced a challenge because, whilst we in Australia thought it, fairly large, the, real comparison was with the megacarriers in America. I certainly support that view. I welcome the recent decision enabling Qantas to be able to buyout part of Air New Zealand. That was a very strategic move. it would have been most unfortunate if Qantas had not been allowed to do so. In fact, we could have been frozen out. Developing a stronger association with a megacarrier is very important. Positioning ourselves well is really important for the long term future. I also wanted to talk about Sydney's second airport. I know that that has been mentioned only in passing. I have always been an unrepentant exponent of building an airport at Badgerys Creek in the western suburbs of Sydney. One view that perpaps the Opposition and the Government share is that bureaucrats have had a fatal tendency to underestimate the growth in tourism. We have tended to make decisions based on conservative estimates, which has tended to leave our airport infrastructure short, particularly at a time when we are getting something like 2.4 million tourists coming to Australia. Why Badgerys Creek? I just point out that the proposals to build a second Sydney airport go back 60 years to a Commonwealth Parliamentary Public Works Committee report which suggested that the second airport should be built. Not a hell of lot has occurred since that time but this Government finally settled the argument about the site of that airport. I well remember that when that decision waS made-and I must say that I was really delighted about it-the then Premier said that we would not see an airport there until the year 2010. In April of last year that was somewhat escalated by the announcement by the then Minister, Senator Gareth Evans, about Badgerys Creek and it then looked as though we might hav- a commitment this year to a rather significant development at Badgerys Creek. That' was not the case; the Government opted for the third runway. Let me point out that in the previous Minister for Aviation Support, the  people from the western suburbs of Sydney had a real champion-someone who share,d their enthusiasm for getting Badgerys Creek off the ground. He paid the price for expressing concern about the impacts of certain decisions on his own electorate but he should be congratulated for his stand. The third runway decision is critical in that it will have to survive an environmental impact study. I. should also acknowledge the role that the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Leo MCLeay) and the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Baldwin) have played in ensuring that this will ,be no rush job and that every appropriate and proper consideration will be taken into account. I believe the third runway will not survive the environmental impact study. Even if it does and even if it is built, all the runway will do is meet the demands of increased traffic so that by the time it is opened we will have the status quo. The congestion will still be there. The only saving grace I find in the Government's decision is that it is committed to doing the design work for Badgerys Creek, so if the environmental impact study is negative and does not favour the construction of the runway then, hopefully, we will not have lost any time. I agree that we do need to take action over Sydney Airport and that action has been overdue. But in deciding where tourists-particularly international tourists-want to land, I think it is a dangerous practice for the Government to force airlines to land at destinations that tourists do not choose. If tourists want to land in Sydney,in Cairns or in Perth and we do not satisfy that market demand, we run the risk of doing long term, damage to the market. In conclusion I point out that this is a very long and detailed Bill and I wonder whether it is to be varied. I am a pro-varying person, I come down on the side of inserting the word 'vary' into the Bill. It does provide the Minister with greater flexibility but at this stage I see no reason to change the bilateral nature of the agreements that we have with international airlines. There are many airlines that want to land into Australia. Having recently visited Taiwan in a private capacity, I think that that is one market that we are neglecting. If we continue to neglect it we will do so at our peril. It is experiencing the same rising income, the same problems of massive current account surpluses. One can see that Taiwan will want to move to tourism as a way to rectify that. I sincerely hope that we can see, at a future date, direct flights between Taiwan and Australia, rather than having to go through Singapore. I believe it will be to our long term benefit. If we look into the crystal ball, we will no doubt see China with two reasonably autonomous areas; one will be Hong Kong and the other will be Taiwan. I am sure we want to be there cementing our relationships, so that we are seen as a preferred destination, as we are now. We cannot afford not to optimise these opportunities that are available to us. I am in favour of the Bill; I commend it, and I hope that this new power third that the Minister has will strengthen our opportunities in Australia to increase tourism.",62
130,Mr IAN CAMERON,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Maranoa) (2.17)It is my pleasure to speak in support of the Air Navigation Amendment Bill. Of course it is to do with air navigation, and it is really tied up with international carriers of people who come to and go from this country in ever increasing numbers, not just for tourism, but hopefully to do business with us. Our need to expand trade is great, given the horrific balance of payments problem that we have in this nation. Obviously a lot of the people aboard our international carriers are business entrepreneurs from other parts of the world, and we welcome them here. Of course we welcome the literally millions of tourists who travel to this nation to meet with us all and to have a look' at the wonderful landscapes that we have to offer to them and, of course the hospitality. Australians are known throughout the world for their hospitality. Bush Australians from the great electorate of Maranoa are better known than those from any other part of Australia for their hospitality. Of course, I am usually available to welcome them, if necessary. It is interesting to note that this legislation gives the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) and his Department the necessary abilities to vary the licences that are given to international carriers, which is essential in today's ever-changing world. I know there has been a great deal said in this House about deregulation of industries-in particular of the wheat industry of latebut, as we all know, particularly the shadow Minister sitting at the table, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) , there is a great need to continue into the airlines industry of Australia this newfound philosophy of the Australian Labor Party. Those of us in the Opposition have supported deregulation of our domestic .airlines. There is also a great need to look at freeing up the destinations of international carriers because this traffic is growing rapidly. Different tourist destinations have been established in Queensland, under the great National Party Government, Sir. Frank Moore and the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation, of which the shadow Minister was a member before he was welcomed back into the House of Representatives; he was the Deputy Chairman of that Corporation and did a great job of boosting' tourism in the good Sunshine State of Queensland. We have seen places like Cairns, now an international arrival destination, go frol,1l a sleepy, tropical, pleasant destination to a boom town. I suppose a, lot of people do not necessarily like the boom town adaptation; most of the old Cairnsites have moved out of Cairns and gone to Burketown to get away from the rush. The Queensland Government, the Corporation and other people involved in the travel industry have been prepared to encourage tourism into Queensland, to both Townsville and Cairns. It was under the previous Federal Government, when Ralph Hunt was the Minister, that the Townsville Airport was upgraded. That airport is now of international standard. The previous Fraser Government spent millions of dollars upgrading the Cairns Airport and made it an international destination. Like the previous speaker, the honourable  that Sydney Airport obviously needs a third runway. There was no need for an environment impact study to be carried out; it is an absolute nonsense to talk about finding out how much noise there is at the Sydney Airport. Any airport is full of noise and another airstrip is not going to make the slightest bit of difference to noise levels in the area. Obviously it is going to affect some people who live in the area, but this is the price we pay for progress, for tourists-domestic and international-to come and go through Sydney Airport. It has developed into the main hub of the South Pacific region. Like the previous speaker, I believe in some decentralisation of arrivals; I do not necessarily think that all tourists should arrive in Sydney. I know that we have an underused airport in Townsville, for instance. There is more than enough scope to send two or three jumbo jets a day into Townsville to take up the slack at that airport. A wonderful terminal has been built there with taxpayers' money and the Townsville area is crying out for more tourist arrivals. I do not see why all tourists should be packaged into Sydney. I am sure that tourists who are seeking a restful holiday and who come from the rough and tumble of central Tokyo would appreciate arriving in Townsville, which is, not quite as mobile as Sydney. I think it is a nonsense that probably almost three-quarters of the arrivals in this country come into Sydney. I do not believe that more should go to Cairns because obviously that airport is being kept very busy. There is a great need for a new international terminal in Brisbane. Work has begun on the foundations for that airport, but it is obviously four or five years behind time. We do have a wonderful new domestic airport there. Mr Jull-And nothing will happen for four or five years? . Mr IAN CAMERON-Probably. nothing will happen for four or five years. Nothing much will happen until we kick the Labor Party out of government and get a good Minister, such as David Jull, heading up the aviation department. Then we will see a bit of action in that area. There is obviously a great need for a new terminal at Brisbane. Visitors to this nation arrive at good old Eagle Farm, a terminal that was built back in the horse and buggy days. It is incapable of handling the people who work there, the quarantine, Customs and passports functions. It is a disaster area for people arriving. They are always tired and cranky, having come a long way. Australia is a long way from nowhere when one travels the world. Any flight takes a long time to get here. People are tired and frustrated and; of course, when they arrive at the old Brisbane airport, they are held up for another half day trying to get through the less than adequate facilities that are available., Of course, there are other problems that we all have with aircraft travel. Qantas Airways Ltd was initially established at Longreach, very close to my electorate. Cloncurry has a wonderful Flying Doctor museum which was recently opened by royalty. Those pebple who arrive on our shores by Qantas and other airlines-obviously we will give Qantas a good plug here today-should go to inland Queensland and have a look at the. real Australia. They should visit places such as the Stockman's Hall of Fame at Longreach, Charleville, Cloncurry and areas where Qantas had its beginnings. The old Qantas hangar is still on the airport at Longreach. When one steps off an aircraft there one still sees the old lettering which is on the original terminal. I live in a part of the world that closely associated with air travel. Of course, I still have' to travel continually by aircraft around my electorate, which is about the size of New South Wales. Obviously there are not many people in the western half of it. I would like to take this opportunity of thanking the rescue services for the job they did in the recent floods. The Chinook helicopters from the Army-Royal Australian Air Force Base at Amberley have been out there helping in flood rescue work.' Coopers Creek is in full flood and is about 40 miles wide. The Chinooks are about to be sold off. I am not too sure how we are going to get rescued in future; we will have to winch ourselves out of trees with ropes from Land Rovers, I guess. At present we have this excellent State Emergency Service (SES) set up in Queensland. The National Party Government in Queensland had two helicopters in that area' rescuing people who were stuck up trees and giving fodder to sheep that were stranded on isolated sandhills as a result of the enormous amount of rain we had. We have had an unusually wet season not only in the west of Maranoa, but also right through my electorate and down the east coast of Australia. Bob Hawke has been blessed with rain ever since he has been Prime Minister! That is very fortunate for him. I would like to thank the shires, the SES and the police and, in particular, the Army and the RAAF from Amberley. The RAAF also sent Caribous from Townsville to Longreach .. ,These aircraft, which were' loaded up with foodstuffs! helped in the rescue effort, which is still going on. When the Barcoo and Thompson rivers join at Windorah, in my electorate, and spread out into Coopers Creek, an enormous inland sea is created, and it takes a very long time for the water to run away into Lake Eyre. For the second time in the last 30 years we ate going to see Lake Eyre full, and that is a very unusual phenomenon. I guess I am getting' a bit off the trackthis is a far cry from international airline services! However, when tourists come to this country, I can assure them that one of the best trips they can do is to take either an aircraft from' Brisbane or a MCCafferty's bus and tour the great electorate of Maranoa and have a look at the real Australia. Those is who live in isolated Australia rely on the Royal Flying Doctor Service. The Federal Government subsidises this, but it has seen fit to introduce air navigation charges. Although this Bill is about amendments to internatioilalair navigation, we also have our local air navigation where all the costs have been moved to land charges; This is of great detriment to charter operators. I have to use Dick Warner's Air Service in Roma; he takes me around the electorate fairly regularly. Now, rather than a one-off registration fee which serves as a navigation charge, he has' to pay a landing charge. That means that Flying Doctor Service, which is called in regularly to land and take off at· air-strips, has been stuck with a much higher service fee. And, of course, this applies to all forms of administration by this Labor Government. It has continually increased taxation not just in' air navigation areas, but in the service areas of every department one could think of. The Prime Minister has just arrived in the chamber. I am pleased to see you, Sir Robert. I knew you would come into listen to my speech, In every area of government administration the charges have gone up. We have higher taxation-capital gains tax and all sorts of new taxes. If the Minister expects the Flying Doctor Service to continue to operate and to stay in business, he should reconsider these charges. If it does not continue to operate, the Government will have to supply the service and we do not want that. We want the Flying Doctor Service to continue to operate. I have other interests. I have just been to the Antarctic and, of course, many honourable members in this House probably wish to hell that I had stayed there! I intend to keep plugging tourism in the Antarctic. I think it has a wonderful potential..·1 know that the Prime Minister has not been to the Antarctic, but the penguins down there would like to see him at some stage of the game. I think it is important that we eventually build a rock strip in the Antarctic, that we are able to service the scientists and people involved in that continent. I believe that Qantas should get involved in taking.tourists and those who are interested to see our territory in that part of the world. I have much pleasure in supporting this Bill.

I ask the Minister about a $350,000 loan by the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) to Middar Pty Ltd, an Aboriginal dance group.

If so, how did he explain the ADC's actions, including backdating a loan agreement document and providing misleading information to the Australian Audit Office in the course of its special audit inquiry earlier this year?

133,Mr BILNEY,ASSOCIATION,"My question is dire-ted to the Minister for Community Services and Health. I preface it by noting that the winner of the Sydney to Melbourne marathon, Mr David Standeven, came from my electorate, but only since Janine Haines has become a candidate. I ask the Minister whether he can inform honourable members of the current state of relations between the Gov-. ernment and the Australian Medical Association (AMA). .",70
134,Dr BLEWETT,ASSOCIATION,"I have to confess that relations bet-een the Government and the AMA have reached a new low. despite some of the best efforts of the Government to' seek cooperation with the AMA over a whole range of issues. One of those issues has been a reform of the general practitioner system. We have found increasingly that the AMA's role has simply been to sabotage whatever relations the Government has tried to develop with other medical organisations. It is clear now that the AMA cannot claim to represent the interests of general practitioners (GPs) in this society. That is not just my view, or the view held simply by the Government. It is also the view held by the man elected to the AMA Council as the representative of the GPs; He is Dr Fisher and I will quote from his comments in a . letter he wrote to the President of the AMA as follows: My position as craft representative in which endeavoured to promote unity in general practice share? has· become untenable. I have rarely been consulted about general practice matters. The position is purely a cosmetic one. I can not in all conscience hold such a false position. That was his letter written to the AMA concerning the way that body was representYou ing the interests of GPs. I must say that Government shares the views of Dr Fisher in relation to the inadequacy and the AMA to serve the interests of GPs. As I say, those are the views of the man elected to .the AMA Council to represent the interister ests of GPs. It has been said that we have sought to avoid consultation with the AMA. in his own circumstanc;e. Seven months ago we offered to the AMA full participation in the development of reforms in the GP area-on one condition, namely, that it advise doctors not to introduce the new schedule until discussions with the Government were completed. That not an excessive demand; it was simply to say to doctors, 'Until the issue is resolved'and we put a timetable on that, ning of March-'we ask you not to encourage doctors to introduce any new schedule'. That was the only condition for full participation in consultation and, as the AMA has been devoted to sabotagipg these reforms from the beginning, of course, unlike the Royal College, it refused to accept that contalking dition. I have got to say that throughout has been clear that the AMA has had one aim, and one aim alone-not to represent the interests of GPs, not to reform thesysfinding tem of general practice and primary care this country, not to give a better deal both patients and GPs but, in fact, for ited political reasons,' to sabotage these' forms.

142,Mr HAWKE,URANIUM MINING,"The fact is that we are about a current situation in Australia. it The current situatiori in Australia: in regard to the uranium market is that those who are currently producing are having difficulties in markets at economiC prices. In those in current 'circumstances-I am talking not to about some historical position but about the limcurrent situation-from an Australian point 'reof view it would not make sense to add to a supply situation which would in fact damage the position of existing producers. The honourable member should talk to the existing producers and ask them what the posiin the market is, whether it is an easy market or whether they in fact can get contracts that are eco!1omic. In that situation, a most people would understand-and I would think that the students in the galleries would of understand, even if the honourable member cannot-that, in fact, if one cannot get a decent price for what one is producing now, it does not begin to make sense to start producing more.

143,Mr BEDDALL,WHEAT LEGISLATION,"Will the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy advise the House of the implications for the Australian wheat industry and the Australian Wheat Board if the Senate does not pass the Wheat Ma-keting Bill, agreed to by this House last night?",72
144,Mr KERIN,WHEAT LEGISLATION,"I thank the honourable member for Rankin for his question. If the Senate does not pass the Wheat Marketing Bill as it now stands, the existing Act will sunset. That will mean there will be no underwriting of the 1989 crop and a crisis of confidence for the Australian Wheat Board, as its very existence after 1991 will be at risk. This will be on the Opposition's head. The people who want a high level of underwriting will have abolished underwriting and the people who do not want private trade in wheat will risk having nothing but private trade. Our flexibility has been demonstrated. At the industry's request, underwriting and the export monopoly were' retained, the sunset clause on the Board's marketing role was removed and an industry fund was established. That was at the request of the Grains Council of Australia. Most of the 28 amendments which. I moved in the House a month ago were suggested by the industry. We then accepted six Opposition amendments and last night we moved a further five. It is clear that the Grains Council and its lackeys in the National Party believe they can force the Government into extending the existing legislation and so sabotage domestic market deregulation. That is what the Senate amendments are all about. If not, the Opposition is saying that it wants the Wheat Board to ignore· the Constitution. It opposed the referendum and now it wants to ignore the Constitution. It wants the Wheat Board to abuse its market power. It wants to put the whole edifice at risk. It wants the Wheat Board to consist of something less than the best people available and it wants a level of underwriting that will be risky to the taxpayer and not implemented by the Wheat Board, in any case. It knows the attitude of the Wheat Board to that, If the Bill is not passed, it will be clear that the National Party troglodytes will be back in control. They have no policy and no ideas about·· anything. National' Party members . think that all they have to do is come in here and do what the agro-politicians out there tell them to do. All the efforts of the honourable members for O'Connor, Wannon and Corangamite in getting Opposition agreement to deregulation will come to naught. There is no point in the honourable member for Barker being rolled by Ian MCLachlan, because no Liberal will ever be allowed any say in primary industry policy while the leap in the .saddle of the Liberal Party is there cackling away in cockies corner. The Opposition totally lacks credibility on micro-economic reform. The new Opposition leadership is totally incapable of meeting the challenges facing Australia. I set out very calmly and very quietly the reason why the wheat marketing legislation needs to change, and that is because the world has changedThe reason why we are backing the wheat industry is so that it can meet the modern conditions. We are made of sterner stuff and we are tackling these issues facing Australia. We will not relent. The Senate will either pass the Bill or ride it into the sunset. There are no other options. There is no choice for the Opposition. It must stick to the position of its old leaders which its new leaders have endorsed and re-endorsed. If the new Oppositionleadership now lets the backwoods regulators of the National Party pull the wool over its eyes,· it will be courting disaster both for itself and for Australian wheat growers.

I wish to express my double gratitude to the honourable member for Maribyrnong for not only asking the question but also giving me the answer. In the notice that he gave me, to which I should refer as a sort of aide-memoire in answering this question, the first point I am asked to make is that the idea of the university for the western suburbs was in fact his. Of course, vanity prevents me from endorsing that .proposition in its entirety, but I am generous enough to extend to him joint authorship of the idea for a university in the western suburbs. I am prepared and happy to acknowledge not only his great contribution to the development ,of this proposal, but also that of his colleagues in the western suburbs, most particularly the honourable member for Calwell. It is a very important development and again I refer to the honourable member's notes. It is the first time in which the western suburbs will have a university.",73
149,Mr HAWKE,UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY,"And me, too.",73
150,Mr DAWKINS,UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY,"And the honourable member for Wills and others. The Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business and numerous others of my colleagues have been extremely helpful in developing this particular proposal. It will concentrate on areas of technology which are so relevant to the areas to the west of Melbourne and, most importantly, it will provide totally new opportunities which have been denied to the west for so many years-indeed, decades. The university proVISIOn has been so concentrated in the east and the centre of Melbourne that that is one reason there have been such low levels of participation in higher education by people in the western suburbs. Indeed, over the next few years we will see very rapid growth in the proposed new institution to a level of some 17,000 equivalent full time students. The Commonwealth, for its part, is examining the proposal which the Victorian Government has provided, which involves the bringing together of the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Footscray and the Western Institute. We have already indicated that we are prepared to commit some $50m to the capital development of this important new institution. I want to say-here I depart from the prepared notes of the honourable member for Maribyrnong-that this development is possible only as a result of the introduction of the new unified national system of higher education, a system which has been increasingly warmly accepted by the higher education institutions, the community of higher education. One representative of that sector, Professor David Penington, continues to engage in what I consider to be highly political and highly personal attacks on me in relation to these developments. I do not intend to return in the same manner the kinds of criticisms that he has made of me. I say only that the remarks that Professor Penington makes to me in private are very much different from the remarks that he makes in public in relation to these developments. I will refer to a couple of statements that he has made in correspondence to me. In October last year he stated that he recognised a sense of common purpose on many issues set out in the White Paper and, further, that his university, on its own initiative, was moving in the direction desired by the Government. Indeed, just after he took up the vice-chancellorship of the Melbourne University he said that he was very grateful to me for the environment of reform that the Government had created in higher education because it provided an opportunity for him to bring about the kind of change at Melbourne University that he thought was most important.",73

Melbourne University was the first university to be involved in amalgamation and, if it has its way, it will subsume four institutions, more institutions than any other university around the country, Mr Beale-On a voluntary basis.",75

169,Mr DA WKINS,PAIRS,"I inform the honourable member for Deakin that there has been no activity, coercion in relation· to this matter, as he ment. would know, All I can say is that, if Professor Penington sees the amalgamation as being a frenzy, the activities of his own university can be described only as a shark attack, NA  ter to a letter written to the Caucus economon ics committee on 26 February by the But Treasurer in which he rejected calls for creased incentives to save and stated that there was 'a present economic need to fund business investment', Does the Treasurer's statement yesterday that Government policy is now 'directed to pulling the whole investage ment phase back, both public and private' mean that the Government's latest solution to our balance of payments crisis is to wind back investment expenditure and hence limit the expansion of our productive capacity order to make room for a rise in consumpmand tion demand following the wage-tax deal?",75
170,Mr HAWKE,BALANCE OF PAYMENTS,"If the Leader of the Oppeople-the position were to follow the statements of Treasurer over the past six months or more, he would see that there is complete consistlove ency in what not orily the Treasurer but have been saying, The position is quite clear to anyone with a minimal understanding of Aldred, K. J. economics, and I would hope that that might even embrace the Leader of the Opposition.",75
171,Mr GEAR,BALANCE OF PAYMENTS,That is being generous.,75
172,Mr HAWKE,BALANCE OF PAYMENTS,"I am charitable by nature. The fact very simply and obviously is that the Australian economy is operating at too high a level of activity. If we look at the that have been quoted by the Treasurer and by me for the last year, we see that are starkly clear: in the past year consumption went up by 8 per cent and production by 4 per cent. In other words, it is quite clear that more than half the increase in consumption is financed by imports, and this country simply cannot go on at that level of activity. As we have said, no sensible politician in this country-and in this case I refer to honourable members on both sides-would have interest rates a notch higher for a day longer than necessary. It is not good news out there politically to have interest rates high, They are at their present level because there must be a hauling back of the level of and that includes the area of investWe are not only saying that private investment must come back. We welcome the increase in investment that has taken place, because it will create a situation whereby in the future the Australian economy will be better placed to provide its own levels of production so that it will not be so reliant imports; but we cannot go on like that. corresponding to the restraint that we inare seeking to impose on private investment, we showed at the Premiers Conference last Thursday that we are matching in the public sector the restraint that we are asking of the private sector. In fact, we provided a packof $2.7 billion, a combination of hauling back $550m from grants to the States and Territories, $1 billion from the State authorities' borrowing program and more than $1 billion from our own authorities; in combiin nation we hauled back $2.7 billion of deby the public sector. Not only we on this side of the House but also the Australian financial markets, the economic the commentators-are waiting. It is like Halley's comet. When will it come? We would to hear form the other side of the House I a detailed, coherent, relevant statement of economic policy as to what is proposed. But all we have is vague, irrelevant nonsense. What we get from the Treasurer is consistent, relevant policy making. CHINOOK HELICOPTERS: NA",75
173,Mr LES SCOTT,RETIREMENT,"Has the Minister for Defence seen comments calling for the fat to be cut from defence and for a reversal the decision to retire the Chinooks? What the. basis of the decision to retire the nooks? Does the Government intend to make provision for the Chinooks to be reintrolicited duced? Mr BEAZLEYI thank the honourable gentleman for his question. I have seen comment along those lines; in fact, from the Leader of the Opposition, who said: ' I've spelt out the requirements to Mr Carlton what I want him to do . . . I have served myself a defence related portfolio. I know what has to done in cutting the fat there, and I regard Carlton as the expert to do that in government. If the Leader of the Opposition knows what is to be done in cutting the fat in the defence area, it will be a world first for him, because during the entire time of his period as shadow Treasurer he came up with no conclusions regarding outlays in general. He has develand oped some expertise in the defence area, and that is all to the good. We will await the from him with interest. However, against that background, of course, the first press statement from the Opposition defence spokesman so tasked contained criticism of a Government decision based on the advice of the departmental secretary and also the Chief of the Defence Force regarding a capability and prioritising in defence to ensure· that we maintain the capabilities we need to defend this country within the framework of the budgetary alas lowance. The very first comment from the shadow spokesman so tasked was, 'Of course, the Government should not do that.' He was backed up in that regard by the opponent the honourable member for Oxley, who made the Liberal Party's first commitment in defence area for the next election. The canhim didate, no doubt acting on the advice· of shadow. spokesman, said that a Federal eral Govern-ent would re.commission the rescue Chinooks. Let us examine what this would involve. For starters, to recommission them would involve another $110m in operating costs over the five-year program. One of the factors involved in the decision of the Chief of the Defence Force in recommending this to me was that the Chinooks, if they were to be retained in service at not absolutely inorof dinate operating costs and with a reasonable is level of serviceability, would have to go Chithrough a process of modification. At the minimum, the estimate for that on an unsobid from Boeing was $140m. The Air' Force bid, if it were to be included in the five-year defence program-and it has not been included-was $350m. So what we now some have for inclusion in the program at the behest of the cost cutter who has just been placed on the front bench of the Liberal as to Party is about $450m worth of expenditure in increases. That is an absolutely ludicrous be proposition. But I suspect that it will be par Mr for the course in this area. There is no discipline. The tasks that the Chinooks perform can, by and large but not altogether, be performed by aircraft Illready in service and aircraft coming. into service. When we have available to us the C130s and the Caribous we are getting in the Black Hawk a capability which in some categories of perlist formance is 10 times that of the Iroquois, then of course ,we will take decisions down the line that will impact on other areas of defence capability if we find that we do not need them to the .extent that we did before. I know that the honourable member is concerned about the welfare of the members of the Defence Force in his area who are associated with this decision. The personnel will all be redeployed elsewhere in the Air Force. They will not lose their jobs. As far the functions that are performed by the Chinooks in the civil sector are concerned, I notice that the Premier of Queensland has said that the Chinooks are absolutely vital of to him. He has sent a letter to the Prime Minister in that regard. He is welcome to the buy them and man them, and we will assist to do so. If that is the position of the the Premier of Queensland, we are happy for Libhim to do that. The particular search and activities he has directed our attention to in that regard would be picked up even more effectively by the Black Havvk helicopter which has some particular capabilities, such as automatic hover, which make it an excellent search and rescue aircraft. So that area is covered. 'The future of the Amberley Base is assured. We maintain a high priority for the FIlls and the development of the FIll capability. So we have made decisions on the basis of priorities. We have protected those interests which we must protect in terms of the defence 'of this country and the capacity for aid to the civil power. But we have an Opposition incapable of prioritising in this area. What a start for a cost cutter in the portfolio. NA",76
174,Dr HEWSON,BUDGET FORECASTS,My question is directed to the Treasurer. In the Budget the Treasurer forecast· a current account deficit of $9.5 billion and an inflation rate of 4.5 per cent by the end of the financial year. What are his revised forecasts?,77
175,Mr KEATING,BUDGET FORECASTS,"What a telling question! Since at least 13 January, when the consumer price index came out, we have had five months of debate about how the current account deficit and the inflation rate have been overshot for the year. It is now May. Yesterday the first question I got from the shadow Treasurer was about what would be the inflationary effects from the fall in the dollar, as though it were some simple, mechanical thing-the dollar falls and inflation goes up. It was a schoolboy-type question, the kind of question one would get from a high school kid about economic policy. Today we have the stomach-punching question, 'What is your new forecast?'.",77

178,Mr KEATING,BUDGET FORECASTS,The Prime Minister has already indicated that policy has been directed towards cutting back the level of demand in the economy. Demand has been too strong. Demand has been running at around double product growth over the last 12 months .. The result is that the current account deficit will be substantially above-,77
179,Dr HEWSON,BUDGET FORECASTS,How much?,77
180,Mr KEATING,BUDGET FORECASTS,"In another It months honourable members will know precisely. If honourable members wait that long they will know the exact number. They will not need a forecast. The Liberal Party has no policy on inflation. Last week the shadow Treasurer was talking, about taking back the tax cuts. He said that the Treasurer had already given away half the prospective Budget surplus. In other words, if we did not have a wages policy we would have wages now running at around-Mr Moore-When will we know? What are the numbers?",77
181,Mr KEATING,BUDGET FORECASTS,"This is par for the course for the honourable member. Wages would now be running at between 15 or 16 per cent and inflation would be back into double digit figures. This Government has an incomes policy in place by which tax cuts are being used to reduce nominal wages growth. The shadow Treasurer says that we ought to snatch the tax cuts back or that we should . not have given them. The Opposition does not have a policy on that. It does not have a fiscal policy. As a group it is a joke. It has no policy ,structure whatsoever. The best Opposition members can do is to ask a political undergraduate a question about what the Hawke Government-Mr Downer-You do not understand what you are saying.",77

189,Dr HEWSON,TREASURER,"Wentworth) move: That this House censures the Treasurer for his failed economic management which, despite six years .of good economic growth in the world economy and record high commodity prices, has resulted in(I) a current account deficit which is already $4.5 billion above the Budget forecast for this financial year; (2) a quadrupling of net foreign debt to over $95 billion; (3) a rate of inflation currently stuck at around 7 per cent, even based on the Statistician's revised measure, compared with the Budget forecast of 4.5 per cent; (4) the huge increase in home loan mortgage rates from 13.5 per cent in June last year to . 16 per cent; and (5) a decline in living standards of wage and salary earners due to high taxes, high inflation and high interest rates. The economic mismanagement of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has plunged this country into an economic crisis for the second time in six years. The first crisis, which was in 1985-86, was directly attributable to the Treasurer. Activity collapsed, inflation accelerated, the Australian dollar collapsed, our foreign debt exploded and our international credit standing was downgraded. Of course, as is typical under this Government, the average Australian was forced to pick up the tab through dramatically higher interest rates and a significant cut in living standards. The 1985-86 scenario is repeating itself. This time the crisis will be bigger and much more damaging than it was last time; in 1985-86 the world economy was growing strongly whereas it is now tapering off. It is, therefore, essential that we have in this House a full blown parliamentary debate on our economic mess. I ask the Treasurer not to indulge in the sorts of slanging matches, name calling and colourful character references which usually characterise his performances. It is not necessary to tell me any more that I got my degrees in a lucky dip, that 1 can be blamed for the Fraser years or for policies that were implemented when 1 was five years old. It is not appropriate to keep quoting back to me the Business Review Weekly columns of four or five years ago. We have had enough of that. All we want is debate. The Treasurer owes this Parliament and the Australian people an ex(3.13)-1 planation for his mismanagement, which has resulted in the current economic mess. Our debt and our exchange rate are the bottom line of the current situation. We are in danger of a major exchange rate crisis, if indeed we are not already in one. Our debt is about to explode again, and there is a very real risk that in the coming months our international credit standing will be downgraded one more time. 1 know the Treasurer thinks that, as he told Euromoney recently, such credit standings are 'incompetent judgments by a monkey', but financial markets and overseas investors will not agree with him. Only a fool would take such an important thing as our international credit standing so lightly . The signals of our current malaise have been there for well over a year and we have been pointing them out to the Treasurer for well over a year. How many more record monthly balance of payment numbers will it take before the Treasurer publicly concedes his problem and does something about it? It is no good boasting that the debt is about to stabilise, as he has done on several occasions in this Parliament, because it is not. Publicity stunts like. those last year where he paid off some international borrowings are cheap gimmicks. They do not help the problem and grossly misrepresent it. As every day goes by our exchange and our debt problems intensify. To summarise our position in fairly stark terms, this Treasurer has sent our country broke. This Treasurer has mortgaged the future of our children. This Treasurer has devalued Australia. This Treasurer has effectively put the country up for sale at bargain basement prices: For example, in terms of the yen the Australian dollar is currently at half the level it was in 1983. Australia has been marked down by this Government to half price for the Japanese. Our interest rates are high simply to get foreigners to continue to lend us their savings. We run a very grave risk-and I do not put this lightly-of losing our economic sovereignty. We have already given up much of the control of our own economic destiny. Let me focus on our debt record for a few moments. There are a number of important dimensions to this problem whiCh are not addressed in any respect by this Government's policies. Our gross foreign debt end of December was about $121 billion. Our net foreign debt stood at about $95 billion or $96 billion at that time. It has quadrupled under the Labor Government: there has been a fourfold increase in our international debt. This translates in net terms to about $6,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia. The gross debt is $7,000 or more for every man, woman and child in Australia, or about $24,000 for every household in Australia. Australia's gross foreign debt increases at something like $90,000 a minute. In the course of this debate the foreign debt will rise by $7m to $8m. Some other dimensions of our debt problem should also be emphasised. First, despite what the Treasurer suggests, the public share of our gross foreign debt has actually increased under Labor from 40 per cent in June 1983 to 48 per cent now. The Treasurer cannot run away from the responsibility for private debt build-up either. It is his tax system that does this. It is· his economic policies that have. made debt finance so attractive to the pri,vate sector .. Another very disturbing dimension of our debt problem is that 75 per cent of our foreign borrowings have a maturity of less than three months. This means that much of our debt has to be rolled over or refinanced every quarter. The implications for our economy are clear. Not only are we technically insolvent but we also run a very large liquidity risk. If there is a loss of confidence in this country by overseas. investors we will have to finance a very large amount of short term debt on a roll-over basis and that will mean, under this Treasurer's strategy, higher and higher interest rates. This situation highlights the vulnerability of the Australian economy to any exchange rate fluctuations and to adverse economic conditions in the rest of the. world. Our exposure to this risk means that the curren-y, as we have .qbserved, is prone to sharp swings. A third dimension of our foreign debt problem which is worth drawing to the Government's attention is that we have already reached Third World proportions in terms of our debt. On the basis of the latest international comparisons, our debt service ratio is significantly higher· than that of any of the other major Organisation for Economic Coat 'the qperation and Development (OECD) economies and higher than those of Colombia, Venezuela, Indonesia and the Philippines. The equivalent of about 62 per centdf our export - arnirigs is required to service that debt in terms of interest and principal 'repayments. debt The $1 billion a month which Australia pays in interest payments puts a floor under our current account deficit of about $12 billion. This turkey on the other side of the table was suggesting it would fall to $9t billion in the course of the last financial year.",78
190,Mr KEATING,TREASURER,"On a point. of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: is this a debate without personal references? He is the one who said he wanted a debate like this.",79
191,Dr HEWSON,TREASURER,It pales into insignificance,79
192,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,I have not called the honourable member for Wentworth. If the Treasurer has concluded his poiJ;lt of order. I call on the honourable member for Wentworth to continue.,79
193,Dr HEWSON,TREASURER,"'Turkey' is a moderate expression compared to what I have been called by this man in this Parliament. Finally, we should recognise that, our debt is currently exploding. The la&t figures I talked about were those for the December quarter of 1988. At that time the Australian dollar was about 85c or 86c against the. US dollar; today it is about 74c or 75c against the US dolt'ar, which puts our debt level around $140 billi9n at the present time. That is much more than the $121 billion at the end of iast: year. That is 44 per cent of gross dom-tic product and about 280 per cent of our exports. Yet the Treasurer stands here with a sense of pride about the 'mediocrity of that performance. It is salutary to recall that in the earlier debt crisis in 1985-86, for which the Treasurer was also directly responsible, our debt increased by 47 per cent in the year June 1985 to June 1986 and by another 11 per cent in the year June 1986 toJune 1987. Against that background, the current crisis may have only just begun, unless policies are changed and the problem is dealt with. Rather than face up to the problems, this gentleman lets the circumstances drift. The Treasurer has displayed an alarming sense of complacency. Indeed, currently his only policy response is to push interest rates higher. Every time something goes wrong he wants to push interest rates higher. He wants to slow demand in line with ,production and, therefore, cut back imports and lower inflation. As the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said today in the House, the relevant numbers in calendar 1988 are that demand went up by 8 per cent and production by 4··per cent; imports accounted for the 4 per cent· difference; there was a 21 per cent increase in imports, and inflation accelerated. That is all the Treasurer has. He has high interest rates to deal with that problem. Let me sugge-t to the Treasurer that there are at least six fundamental flaws in that economic strategy. I will give him a chance to answer everyone of the six. The first is that a high interest rate policy pulls up our exchange rate, as we saw· throughout most of last year. It works against our balance of payments and our inflation problem. The Treasurer has recently tried to break that nexus between interest rates and the exchange rate. His solution is to talk down the value of.the Australian dollar. That is a very short-sighted and unsustainable response, to say the least,· and it can easily get out of hand. If the Australian dollar collapses-we have'seen some evidence of that since he opened· his mouth in that press conference two or three weeks ago-the Government will be forced to put interest rates back up to stop the Australian dollar falling or to continue to borrow the money from overseas, but probably do both .. The second problem with the Treasurer's strategy is that high interest rates do not discriminate between demand and production. The Treasurer wants 8 per cent to come down to 4 per cent but, unfortunately, his blunt, non-discriminatory, monetary policy does not understand that. It is simply not a question of pulling the interest rate lever, as he has suggested on many occasions, and bringing down demand. Both will probably fall. The inherent danger in all this is one of overkill, particularly as he admits he does not know where the economy is, he does not know how much interest rates are biting, and in fact he has no idea where we are at the present time. He makes a joke every time we ask him for his current assessment of the economy or his revised forecasts or whatever. It is all a big joke to him, but the fact is that as long as he plays those jokes the economy will slip through his fingers and the debt situation and external exchange rate situation will worsen. The third problem with the Treasurer's economic strategy is that the wage-tax deal itself has some inherent difficulties. First of all, there is no trade-off. We remember this guy· back· at the time of the Budget talking about a zero wage increase in return for a, tax cut. He was so decisively rolled by his mate, Bill Kelty, and others at the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) that he ended up paying an across the board $50 or $70 a week wage increase, quite unrelated to productivity, on top of the tax cuts. So it is an add-on. But even that wage deal, which in current circumstances is without economic foundation, is now at risk, because there is a threat that it will be called into question by the union movement as devaluation pushes up our domestic rare of inflation. Paying wages not related to productivity and giving tax cuts on top of that also threatens to stimulate demand and compound our import problem. All this is happening when we are sitting here with the worse inflation and wages record in the OECD area. Finally, the Government has provided absolutely no evidence in the wage area to substantiate the claim that the Treasurer made· in the 12 April statement: Tax cuts in place of higher wage increases will the rate of inflation. The Treasurer should go back to first year economics and give us the explanation for how he will do that-because, he might well be on his own in terms of that explanation. The fourth problem with the Treasurer's economic strategy is that he has tried to nurture investment. The Treasurer keeps talking about stimulating new exports and encouraging import replacement, but he has never provided any evidence to substantiate the case that the investment that we have seen in the past 12 or 18 months is ever going to create significant increases in exports or significant import replacement. Indeed, the data that we do know' about does not support the case. A whole pile of new computers and word processors and the updating of office equipment will not do a lot in terms of the magnitude of our current account deficit problem, in terms of creating new exports or stimulating new imports. Not once has the Treasurer provided any evidence to substantiate that case. The import penetration ratio keeps rising as well. We know that, in relation to manufacturing exports, which the Treasurer claims have been a great succ-ss, if gold and second-hand aircraft are excluded, we have real problems. There is not much growth in manufacturing exports either. The whole thing is a fiction. It is a rationalisation. The Treasurer has never addressed the problem. The fifth problem is that we need savings. We have this debt because we have a deficiency in savings. However, consistently the Treasurer will not support measures to stimulate private saving, and he seems happy to spend half of his next year's prospective public sector savings on tax cuts and new expenditure initiatives. What is the Treasurer's explanation? Mr .Keating-Do you want to take the tax cuts back?",80
194,Dr HEWSON,TREASURER,"I am not putting the argument. The Treasurer is the one who must answer the questions. Moreover he is sticking with a tax system which discourages savings and investment and encourages debt. How is the Treasurer going to rationalise' the fact that he gives his big entrepreneurial mates a tax deduction for the full interest costs on lower their borrowings, while the average Australian is denied any adequate. return on his savings, after tax, and at a time,: of course, when he has to carry the full cost of housing interest rates on his after tax earnings? I am asking the questions and the Treasurer should' answer them. The sixth problem concerns the so-called special relationship with the union movement. This is .the clanger. This relationship has prevented the Treasurer from taking any of the essential decisions that are necessary at present. The ACTU and the Left of the parliamentary Labor Party will not let the Treasurer do most of the things that he needs to do. They will not let the Government privatise, which would provide.a substantial volume of funds for debt reduction. They will not let the Government tie wages to productivity and deregulate the labour market which would reduce inflationary pressures and boost incentive and competitiveness. They will not let the Treasurer cut government expenditure seriously, because they have this concept of the social wage. If we could cut government expenditure that would add to public sector savings and private sector activity. Further, they will not let the Treasurer clean up the wharves, which would induce some greater competitiveness and reduce costs. They will not let him inject any competition or clean up work practices in relation to coastal shipping which, again, would enhance competitiveness and reduce costs. They will not let the Treasurer quicken the pace of reductions in protection, which would reduce costs, enhance competitiveness and expose some of those work practices to international competition. They will not let the Treasurer improve the domestic transportation infrastructure. Moreover, this is a poll driven Government. Members opposite run around polling in some. marginal seat and then members of the Government run out and take decisions. That explains why it took the Government six or seven years to make up its mind about having a third runway at Mascot airport. The Government should have built the third runway and it should have built the second airport. It would have done so had it been seriously interested in developing a tourist export industry in this country. Similarly, in relation to the Wesley Vale project, potentially a billion dollar project, members opposite polled the marginal seats and then ran out and formulated policy. There is no substance to honourable members opposite. Where are we at present? The Treasurer's economic mismanagement has left this country in a very precarious situation and at a time when the' world economy is deteriorating for the first time in the life of the Hawke Government. World growth is slowing, world interest rates are rising, and commodity prices have 'peaked-as even the Treasurer admitted the other day. Commodity prices are likely to mirror the slowing in world demand. World inflation has still not been beaten. So, the Australian economy is on a potential collision course. We can see the possibility of our shrinking export markets and our shrinking export prices colliding, with the still overheated domestic economy that is hooked on imports. The risks, of course, are a double whammy on the balance of payments, a double whammy on interest rates and on inflation, and a double whammy on activity, pushing us into recession. This involves another debt explosion of very real risk, another downgrading of our credit rating, another exchange rate crisis, and another hit to legand this is the bottom line-for the average Australians who are struggling to make ends meet, under this Government. This is because it will put interest rates higher and, further erode living standards. It does not matter a damn what the Government does on 1 July. So, let us all club together and give this guy an award for the world's worse Treasurer. I remind the Treasurer that on 14 May 1986 he warned us in the following terms: If this Government .cannot get the adjustment and a sensible e-onomic policy-",81
195,Dr HEWSON,TREASURER,"I always read my quotes. To continue the quote: then Australia is basically done for. We will end up being a third rate economy, a banana republic .. Yes, Paul, you were right: We are well on the way to becoming a banana republicand it is entirely the Treasurer's doing. He will not listen to warnings that are made. I can remember in 1984-85, when the Treasurer sent the economy crashing down, there were people in the banking community writing reports saying that inflation woulddouble from 5 per cent to nearly 10 per cent and that the economy would move into a recession in the second half of 1985. However, the Treasurer came in here, under the cover of this House, and, in passing, casually attacked some of those people-one of whom was me. The same warnings have been made this time, but the Treasurer has learnt nothing. He has learnt absolutely nothing. 1 know that he knows nothing, but he has learnt nothing. He is a total captive of his Department. He has politicised his Department. It got it wrong. It fed him the lines; it fed him all those rationalisations. The Treasurer is left sitting there not understanding, out of touch, and absolutely destroying the living. standards of the average Australian. I am looking forward to going to the next election, with the Treasurer trotting around Australia saying, 'Give me credit, guys, for the 18 or 19 per cent interest rates, for driving small business out backwards, for the increase in bankruptcy rates. Give me credit, you guys, for the recession that is on our doorstep. Give me credit for putting this country at risk, mortgaging the future of our children and devaluing our currency to the extent that the country is up for sale at bargain basement prices'. You sleep well at night, Paul.",82
196,Mr REITH,TREASURER,"':""'1 second the motion. I have a message for the Treasurer (Mr Keating). I will not keep him long, but the fact is that there are many people out there who want a few answers from the Treasurer. It is about time he provided some. the fact is that you are out of touch, mate. There are a lot of families, there are a lot of bankers, there are a lot of retailers and a lot of young people out there who would finally like to hear a few answers from you in relation to your management of the economy.",82
197,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,"Before the honourable member for Flinders gets up too much momentum, I suggest that he direct his remarks through the chair.",83
198,Mr REITH,TREASURER,"I will be very happy to do that. I will direct my remarks through the chair both to the Treasurer and to the Ausgive tralian 'public because the fact is that there are a lot of questions unanswered in the economic management of the Treasurer. ToAustralian dollar. day there is an opportunity for the Treasurer finally to come clean and produce some of the facts and some of the policies to substanto tiate his position. The superficialities, such those that we had at Question Time, are no good. The classic response of the Treasurer is to avoid the question and turn his attenthe tion to the Opposition. The fact is that the Treasurer can go on with his cliches, but that is not adequate. can talk about cars in the fast lane and cars going into the slow lane and he can talk about levers, about the broad brush and the big canvas, but the fact is that today is up time for the Treasurer. He is very keen on making analogies, and he talks about brakes, accelerators and clutches, but in ity the important thing is the condition of the engine. It is the condition of the fundawhich mentals of this economy which really conthink cerns the people in the gallery, the people listening to this debate about the Treasurer's economic management. The fact is that we moved this censure motion because we have a convergence of the results of the Treasurreality er's economic policy which will see this country receive a real jolt. The fact is time is running out for some of the changes required for this economy and time is runthe ning out to try to get things back on the right track. The Treasurer has been chalking up a debt, and the fact is that the figures just do not add up. Let me give an everyday example. One solutely can go down to the bank manager once or twice and ask for a loan, but when one goes down there the third or the fourth time, the first thing the bank will do is reduce one's credit rating. Look at the Australian economy. What have we seen under the Treasurer's economic management? ,Our credit rating has been reduced. If one goes back a more times to one's local bank manager, what is the next thing the bank will do? It will jack up the interest rates, because one is a risk. Look at the Australian economy and our high interest rates. On the third and fourth time that one goes back to one's bank manager and asks for yet another loan, what will happen on that occasion? The bank will one a big answer: a 'no' answer. That 'no' answer, if one looks at the Australian economy, is the decline in the value of the The fact is that the Treasurer needs to answer a, few questions that have been put him today. This was to be the third term as of micro-economic reform. This was touted by the Government as a third term of reform of the economy-an opportunity to look to nuts and bolts of the way in which we run this, country, to look at issues such as productivity. Let me tell the Treasurer that He I do not think we can wait for the next election, early as it may be. The truth of the matter is that one of the reasons for bringing this issue on today is that the Cabinet today ownis talking about the waterfront and what it will do on the waterfront. I think that is one of the great challenges of the Hawke Adminrealistration. We have had the Inter-State Commission bring down a very interesting report talks about the necessity for reform. I everybody in this House knows that this is not the first report we have had on the waterfront. In fact, since the war there have been 13 or 14 reports, a pile high, each segment with its own layer of dust. The is that the need for change and for reform on the waterfront is paramount and that ought to be very clear to the Treasurer. Let me say, for those who are not close to issue of the waterfront, that we have had a report which shows a cost to this economy of about $850m; a per annum cost over and above what it ought to cost. In other words, the inefficiencies on the waterfront are abrife. We have practices like spelling. People might ask me, 'What is spelling?'. Someone might say, 'Is it spelling as in reading, writing and arithmetic?'. The answer is no. I will tell the House what spelling is. One works while one's mate has a spell. That is one of the little practices we have on the waterfront so as to maintain overmanning. Another practice is nick off time. Let me tell the Treasurer about nick off time. Does he . know what nick off time is? Nick off time is when one and one's mate go to work on the waterfront and one says to one's mate, 'I'll sign you off at the end of the day so that you can nick off in the meantime'. That is the sort of practice which the Government condones by its failure to address real reform on the waterfront. The Inter-State Commission report is a pretty good report. It is not everything; we would go further. In our labour market reform we would have things such as secret ballots before strikes and we would have an end to compulsory unionism. We would introduce a very comprehensive set of reforms in respect of the labour market. Be that as it may, for a report produced for a Labor government in the grip of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) I would say it is not a bad report. The truth is that if it could implement that report in to to, the Government could go a long way to at last achieving some reform on the waterfront. The report has been compiled after a very close analysis over two or three years. The Commission has had an opportunity to invite all those who have a vested interest to talk about the problems of the waterfront. As a result, the Inter-State Commission has presented to the Government a complete package. It has said to the Government, 'We have looked at the interests of the various parties and we have come up with a solution which yo!.!, as a government, could accept in full; a complete package'. The Inter-State Commission, in handing that report to the Government, said, 'We have here a compromise package, but understand that the waterfront will not reform itself from within'. I think that is a factor that even the Treasurer-an out of touch Treasurer-would have to admit. The fact is that the rorts on the waterfront have been rife for many years. We do not have in the waterfront the competitive pressures which will bring about sensible reform. So the Inter-State Commission has said to the Government, 'You take the lead. You adopt this package in full and require its implementation'. That is a pretty sensible recommendation from the Inter-State Commission; a fundamental recommendation if we are to have its report implemented. What. did we see within days of this recommendation being made to the Government? Who led the charge? Who led the retreat from real and effective reform on the waterfront? It was none other than the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). What did he say about the Waterside Workers Federation? His comment was a classic. He said, 'I reckon that some of the concerns of the Waterside Workers Federation are quite reasonable'. Who else did we find involved? We found Bill Kelty of the ACTU. The Inter-State Commission spent thousands of dollars and thousands of man-hours talking to everybody in the industry and what did Bill Kelty say? He said, 'Their whok approach is infantile'. Whilst the Treasurer was away last week, or the week before, I put a question to his colleague the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis). It was a pretty easy question, because on the waterfront an acknowledged problem, acknowledged by anybody who knows anything about the waterfront, is the problem of pooling of labour. I put a lollipop question to the Minister for Transport and Communications and asked, 'Will you stand in this Parliament today and give us an assurance that you will oppose labour pooling arrangements?' He is the Minister who was described as the 'wimp' in the Sydney Morning Herald a couple of weeks ago. He was not even prepared to take a stand on an absolutely essential and fundamental pillar of any meaningful reform for the waterfront. We have Ministers and we have the ACTU, certainly the union, moving very quickly away from a very sensible recommendation. This recommendation is not as far as we would go, but by any reasonable, objective assessment it is a fair measure towards sensible reform on the waterfront. Today my colleague the shadow Minister for industrial relations, Senator Chaney has taken the debate one step further. The people in the gallery would say to themselves, 'Well, you have identified a problem-and it is well identified-but what is it that you as an Opposition put forward constructively to address just one of these elements of economic reform which even blind freddy could see are an absolute necessity for this economy?'. Today, my colleague Senator Chaney put forward to the Government a proposition of support for the Government if it is prepared to adopt the report of the Inter-State Commission. I say to the Treasurer quite openly that, as a political ploy from the Treasurer's point of view, he has the ball at his feet. We have said that in the national interest we are prepared to come back a pace from our preferred position just to see whether we can finally get something done about the waterfront. When one has a monthly current account deficit as we have, month in and month out, of $1 billion or more, that fact ought to send a pretty clear message-which is that it is time for the Government to get its act together; it is time that people finally started to pull .together to do something about a massive problem. In this one component, today Sen\ltor Chaney has put forward that proposition. The Government has shown every sign of backing off at 100 miles an hour. There are other signs of tremendous paralysis. The great statement on micro-economic reform was supposed to come out next week, and even Tas Bull is away this week. Everybody knows that the Waterside Workers Federation and the employers are a country mile apart on getting anywhere near a stated position. The Minister has been backtracking in the last few days and saying, 'I didn't ask the inmates of the asylum to run the asylum, we were just having a few discussions. I did not ask them to negotiate a settlement'. So he has been stung, and if the Treasurer is away next week I am sure that someone will fax him the response. The fact is that he is nowhere near an effective implementation strategy for the waterfront. Today we are offering to the Government, in a constructive sense, the circuit breaker for waterfront reform. If the Government had half a wit, or any determination to do something about major micro-economic reform in this country, then it would take our offer with both hands. The Government w01,lld get a political plus because if we talk to any of the commentators we find that they know, as we know and the Australian public knows, that this will be one of the big tests of the Government's administration. This is where people will make a judgment as to whether or not the Government is prepared to stand up to Bill Kelty and say to him that it is about time we had some effective reform. We say to the Government, 'If you take this proposal that we offer, then we as an incoming government will guarantee the continuation of that implementation'. I think that that will be very widely welcomed by the industry. We are saying that we are prepared to complete the job if the Government has the determination to initiate this reform.",83
199,Mr KEATING,TREASURER,Y ou ran the place for' 30 years.,85
200,Mr REITH,TREASURER,"I am quite happy to go back over our record. If the Treasurer knew anything about waterfront reform, he would know that in 1977 we were the ones who got rid of the Stevedoring Industry Authority-one of the great moves towards reform on the waterfront in recent times. The Treasurer would not have been through the appendices to the first report but I have been through them and I have been through the steps of reform. The Treasurer is. very sensitive about this matter because he knows that he is headed towards abject failure on the waterfront and that is how he will be judged. It will be the final nail in the coffin of his micro-economic reform credentials and that will be the end for the Treasurer. That will be the end of the campaign to knock off the Prime Minister. After the wage tax trade-off had fallen in a heap the Treasurer's next best chance was to do something fair dinkum about micro-economic reform, and he is about c to fail. We raised this censure motion today because it is important. We have put to the Treasurer today what I think most Australians are looking for; that is, a series of questions to which he now has an opportunity to provide some answers. I say to him that no superficialities, no tipping of the bucket, none of the cliches, the levers and the broad brushes will save him from a substantial response. I say to the Treasurer, 'Here is your opportunity'.",85
201,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,86
202,Mr KEATING,TREASURER," The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), said that I am a turkey who has politicised my Department to mortgage our children's future and in doing so I am promoting a major exchange rate crisis. The nub of his charge is that I am a turkey who has politicised my Department; that is, I have turned members of my Department into politically oriented people who support the political objectives of the Australian Labor Party. He has said this of the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia. This has been his contribution to public life to date, and he repeats it today, saying that I am mortgaging our children's future by promoting a major exchange rate crisis. I will leave it to others to judge those claims and the conjunction of those remarks. But then the honourable member says that I wiJl not listen to warnings. At the start of his speech he enjoined me not to refer to his record as principal private adviser to Treasurer Howard. He said, 'Don't go back and refer to my record'. Very few people in Australian public life come to the Treasury or shadow Treasury job having been in these jobs in the past. This person was senidr economic adviser to a Commonwealth Treasurer for the critical years - hen this debt started to build up and our competitiveness started to fall. He says that I should listen to his warnings. This is a person who was actually there for all those years. What was the position? Let. me repeat it. In 1980-81 the current account deficit was 6 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). Why was it 6 per cent? After the former Government had been governing Australia for 30 years, did it not just think for a moment, 'What a failure we have been, the weakness of the economy is such that we cannot even cover our imports and we have to run a current account deficit of 6 per cent of GDP. We have been in office since 1949, bar three years, but our capital stock is so weak, our capacity to export and import and compete is so weak after 30 years in office, that we are running a current account deficit of 6 per cent of GDP'. What was the honourable member's answer? What did he and Treasurer Howard cobble together? Did they cut back the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) by 7 or 8 percentage pqints as we have done? No, they ga,ve us a deficit in 1983 of 5 per cent of GDP. The honourable member for Wentworth makes these remarks today in the context of the Government having cut back the PSBR by nearly 8 per cent of GDP. What ·unbelievable hide! The unbelievable arrogance of it! There was an 8 per cent cut in the call on public savings in the public sector by this Government. The Government he advised, a- the. principal adviser, lifted that core by 5 per cent of GDp. What did we see? Was there a wages policy to go with it? There was a wage explosion in 1980-81 when he was the adviser-a 16 per cent wage increase. He gets up in this chamber and tells me that I ought to snatch the tax cuts back. He says, 'These modest 6+ per cent wage outcomes are no good. We can do better than you, brother; we can produce 16 per cent'. The most abject insult he threw at us was that we could rely on monetary policy and high interest rates only when we had cut the PSBR by 7 percentage points, going on 8 percentage points, and he gave us bill rates in 1981-82 of 22 per cent. Bill rates are 17+ per cent at the moment. Let us go through his record. The adviser who says who I should listen to and what ,,:arnings I should heed is a person who presided over a national government deficit of 5 per cent of GDP, a wage explosion of 16 per cent which sent our inflation rate into double digits, and 22 per cent bill rates. That is his record. The sheer hide of him! At the .start of his speech he says to me, 'Don't refer to my record as a private adviser'. Oh, would he not like me to refer to his record as a private adviser? Would he like me to say: 'All right, John, you just stay, you are a new boy on the block. I will not even mention the fact that you were around as a principal adviser to a Treasurer in a government which destroyed fiscal policy and gave us an inflation rate which started the disastrous build-up of our debt. I will be decent to you'? Well, I will not be that decent to him; I will be telling the public about him and his record .. The honourable member for Wentworth then said, 'Labor's tax system has made debt financing so attractive'. The tax system that he and Johh Howard presided over taxed dividends twice, gave full nominal deductability for interest and provid-d for no tax on capital gains. That encouraged all sorts of speculation and takeovers and lifted the cost of capital. If people could arrange their affairs so that they could take their profits as capital gains, they did. The companies which were actually employing people and earning were preyed upon because their iricome was taxed twice as dividends. We have introduced dividend imputation, the purest system in the world, which acts as a counter to gearing because if we .gear and lift interest costs we run down the franked dividends; they cannot be franked and the share price falls- The arrogance, the hollowness and the indecency of the claim! ' The honourable member said, - Your tax system made debt financing so attractive', yet the former Government was in office for 30 years in the post-war period and watched all these lurk merchants out there taking over ,companies employing people because their capital gains were free, their deductions were 100 per cent nominal, and the dividends of the companies being preyed upon were taxed twice. Yet this is supposed to be someone of some technical competence and observation. I keep making this point: we are yet, to see the technical competence. He gets up and says he wants a real debate and tries to say of the Government that has introduced the purest imputation system in the world, that its tax system is encouraging the build-up of debt. It is absolutely mindless stuff. But the question is: What is the Opposition's policy mix? The Government's policy mix has been to free up the call on national savings by a shift in the Budget balance of 5 to 6 per cent of GOP and a lift in savings of 2 per cent. We have shifted the savings of this country by 8 per cent of GOP. That by itself would have been enough to cut the current account deficit to zero. The reason it has not is that we have promoted the biggest investment phase in our history-art investment phase the Opposition could never get when in government. Why has the debt built up through 1980-81, 1981-82, 1982-83, 1983-84 and 1984-85? He even had the hide to say that the 1985-86 exchange rate crisis when we had been in office for two years was my fault'. A Liberal government·. was there for 30 years, ran down the capital stock and closed our manufacturing industries. All the faCtories round the country became warehouses fOf imports when members of the Opposition were in office. They relied upon a little bit of wheat and wool, digging up a few minerals-- . , Or Hewson- Mr Acting Speaker, I take a point of on;ler. I put siJ(simple propositions. He has used half the time-",86

205,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,TREASURER,The honourable member for Wentworth will resume his seat.,87
206,Dr HEWSON,TREASURER,Six of them. Put it in .your pocket.,87
207,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,TREASURER,I· warn the honourable member for Wentworth. He cannot take points of order when they are not points of order.,87
208,Mr KEATING,TREASURER,"They inherited the treasury bench for most of the post-war years up t() 1983, 'bar three, years. Except for the period from 1972 to 1975, they had the lot. They relied upon digging up a few more minerals and growing a bit more wheat and they destroyed our secondary and tertiary industries, the whole structure. They kept the place regulated under a managed exchange rate and the fundamental weaknesses started coming through by 6 per cent of GOP, in 1980-nine years ago. They now stand up in this chamber saying that we are responsible for the debt. We have been in office for six years. They were in office for 30 years. We' have shifted the Budgetbalance; we have deregulated the economy; we have an efficient financial structure; we have a proper floating exchange rate mechanism in place; we have a proper wages policy; we have a real depreciation 'of the currency; we are highly competitive; we have restored the profit share to its highest level of GOP, I think ever; and we have the biggest investment phase ever running for us. That is our structure, but what is the Opposition's structure? Does it believe having a higher public sector surplus? We do not know what it believes. The honourdo able member for Wentworth had a, job as shadow finance spokesman to list the cuts in outlays. He never did. He is now shadow Treasurer. He will not even tell us whether he wants a bigger surplus. He says Wf; have already given away half the Budget surplus; in other words, how dare I give away tax cuts for wage restraint. Yet the Leader  his first day after the coup and said, 'I believe living standards should rise'. He believes living standards should rise while the shadow Treasurer believes tax cuts should withdrawn. The Leader of' the Opposition believes living standards should rise, while the shadow Treasurer says we should never have given the tax cuts. They are in an absolute muddle. They do not have the slightest idea of what their policy structure is. Mr Fife- Mr Acting Speaker, I take a point of order. That is a debating point. Treasurer is misleading the House.",87
209,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order! There in is no point of order. The honourable member for Hume will resume his seat.,88
210,Mr KEATING,TREASURER,"That is the fact of the matter. The' .honourable member for . Wentworth cannot cop it. He says, 'You have already given away half of the surplus in tax cuts'. What does that imply? - t implies that we should not have given he is saying, 'Let us whip the tax cuts, off the table'. That is Liberal policy son, while Liberal policy a la Peacock is crocodile tears about living standards when we have a mountain of overseas debt maintaining the living standards we have had date. But the' Leader of the Opposition, in his economic illiteracy, says, 'Do not take any notice of that. We will have higher living standards', while the shadow treasurer says, 'Whip the tax cuts back'. What is his policy? Is it a higher Budget surplus? He has had one press conference, as far as I know, in the last year and Leader of the Opposition, as shadow Treasmember urer, had one press conference in 12 months. What is their policy? Do they believe in bigger public sector surplus? Let us clear in that point up. Do they believe in a bigger public sector surplus? They can tell us. They not even know the most fundamental policy issue. The Leader of the Opposition has no position. Presumably, in shedding these crocodile tears about my relying on monetary policy-I am always being accused of relying on monetary policy-he wants me to lower interest rates. How does he think dethe mand would moderate now if we cut bill rates back 2 or 3 percentage points? Dr lIewson-Who said that?",88
211,Mr KEATING,TREASURER,"The honourable member for Wen,tworth is saying that by implication. be Every day he is saying that. Then he says, 'Let us have diminished deductions for borrowing costs'. Does anyone believe that he as a Liberal Treasurer of this country would go out to the Broken Hill Proprietary Ltd Co. or CSR Ltd, the big companies, and say, 'You know that debt that you have got; the earnings upon which you are deducting at a nominal rate of interest; we are going to let you deduct only half or a third of that. '? The Does anyone believe that this lot, who have never shown any guts for any decent policy the nation's history, would actually say to the big corporations, 'We will deny you deductability for the cost of your interest. '? No, what they will have is some scabby scheme which will cut down public savings to throwaway some deduction for passbooks or something-some totally vacuous, stupid and disingenuous scheme. They will do nothit away. So ing about savings. Mr Reith-Before time runs out, give us a la Hewa bit on the waterfront.",88
212,Mr KEATING,TREASURER,"Do not worry, I am not forgetting you, darling. What about the Opposition's wages policy? It does not have a to wages policy. Under the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) its wages policy would give workers wages related to productivity, which he said is below one per cent. In other words, here we are with demand running at 8 per cent, the Government buying a wage increase of 6t per cent with the tax cuts, and the Opposition says it will have the 0.7 or 0.6. How long does the honourable for Flinders think the Opposition would last in the marketplace by saying to a the companies, 'Pay them 0.6 of one per cent, fellers', while the companies are prepared to pay 15 per cent'? You fools; you fools! Opposition members have no fiscal policy; they have no policy on interest ratesthat is, monetary policy-they have no policy on savings; and they have no policy on wages. They gave us the structural weakness in the first place after 30 years of sitting on their backsides, bludging and lying to the Australian public about policy. Yet they have the hide to get up and censure me for. 30 years of policy failure by them and by the person who advised Treasurer Howard, who gave us a 6 per cent current account in 1980, a wage explosion, 22 per cent bill rates and the highest unemployment in our history.

As the EXOTIC ANIMAL DISEASE CONTROL BILL 1989 Bill presented by Mr Holding for Mr Kerin, and read a first time, Second Reading",90
219,Mr HOLDING,CONSTRUCTION OF BUILDING FOR,"Melbourne Ports-MinSYDNEY ister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories) (4,23)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to establish an Exotic Disease Preparedness Consultative Council and to provide financial assistance for purposes related to the control and eradication of exotic animal diseases. The Government's commitment to enhancing the exotic disease preparedness program arose from the Industry Development Review (IDR) which was initiated in late 1987 to review all industry assistance arrangements within the Minister's portfolio. The report of the IDR which was published as Policies for Growth: A Government Policy Statement formed part of the May 1988 economic statement. That report identified two principal ways to increase our guard against exotic diseases. First, it recommended an increase in resources to raise our emergency preparedness to an even higher level of readiness to meet any disease outbreak. Secondly, the review saw a need to improve the range and timeliness of advice which the Government receives on exotic animal disease issues. Both of these major recommendations of the IDR are being addressed in this Bill. Australia's major livestock based industries have a low-cost structure by world standards. The comparative economic advantage enjoyed by these industries basically arises from environmental and human resource endowment factors, and freedom from the serious pest and disease problems that afflict livestock in many foreign countries. Any future outbreak of exotic disease potentially threatens to impose huge costs on the Australian economy. Our exports of livestock and livestock products are presently worth about $8 billion each year. Exotic disease outbreaks would place virtually all· of these exports under varying degrees of risk ranging from total bans by importing countries to reduction in the prices which we could command for our products. Probably the strongest risk we face results from the requirement under United States food import laws of a mandatory ban on meat imports from any country for 12 months after any presence of foot-and-mouth disease. The impact on the meat industries and associated industries of such bans would be devastating. In addition to restriction or closure of overseas markets, exotic diseases pose the risk of diminished livestock production through death, infertility or chronic ill health in animals. Also rabies, which is a disease defined in the Bill, would pose a serious threat to human health if it were to become established iri Australia. In recognition of these risks the Commonwealth has for many years maintained vigilance on two fronts to ensure the relative freedom of Australian flocks and herds from major exotic disease outbreaks. First, it has responsibility for quarantine at our borders. Following the Lindsay review on quarantine arrangements, the Government is presently considering changes to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our quarantine effort. The second part of our vigilance effort is to maintain adequate contingency plans in the event that the quarantine barrier is breached, as it inevitably will be from the time to time. Contingency planning for exotic disease outbreaks is a joint Commonwealth-State responsibility. For many years the Commonwealth and States have cooperated closely, particularly through the Australian Agricultural Council, which consists of Commonwealth and State and Northern Territory agriculture Ministers, and its officials' committees to maintain a high level of preparedness: Expenses incurred in combating actual disease outbreaks, including compensation payments, are shared equally by the Commonwealth and the States through an existing cost sharing agreement. Within that context, the Commonwealth is coordinating the preparation of the Australian veterinary emergency plan, known as Ausvetplan, as an element within the national counter-disaster plan. The objectives of the exotic disease preparedness program are to provide a rapid eradication capability so as to minimise the time during which Australian livestock industries are subject to disease outbreaks and their associated costs and, perhaps more importantly, to prevent such incursions becoming endemic· within Australia while eradication is considered to be reasonably feasible. As well as coordinating the preparation of Ausvetplan, the Commonwealth is assisting in training veterinary and other technical personnel and in trialling eradication procedures. The States and the Northern Territory also devote considerable resources each year to these activities. Also, the Commonwealth maintains a number of other programs to support exotic disease preparedness: the Australian Animal Health Laboratory at Geelong, the screw worm fly facility in Papua New Guinea, contributions to the strategic reserve of foot-and-mouth disease vaccine in Britain, and the feral animal control program. Commonwealth expenditure on these programs totalled $1O.7m in 1987-88. A high level of preparedness· has been maintained over many years, with past disease incursions such as the avian influenza outbreak in Victoria in 1985 being quickly eradicated. However, in view of the huge potential costs of a major disease outbreak, the Government has decided that more resources should be devoted to the preparedness program particularly for completion of Ausvetplan, training of technical personal and active field testing of eradication procedures. In recognition of the public interest benefits from keeping our herds and flocks relatively free of major diseases, it is appropriate that the Commonwealth should contribute to the costs of expanding the exotic disease preparedness program. However, as the livestock industries are the largest beneficiaries of the program, the Government considers that contributions should also be made by the major livestock industries towards additional funding, on an equal basis with the Commonwealth. Accordingly, this Bill provides for the establishment of the Exotic Disease Preparedness Trust Account to receive annual industry contributions of $750,000, and for expenditure of industry contributions from the account to be matched on a dollar for dollar basis by Commonwealth grant funds. The industries which will come within the new arrangements are wool, sheepmeat, beef, dairy, pigs, poultry, buffalo and goat industries. Consequential amendments to the Wool Marketing Act 1987, the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Act 1964, the Pig Slaughter Levy Act 1971, the Egg Industry Research (Hen Quota) Levy Act 1987, the Laying Chicken Levy Act 1988 the Meat Chicken Levy Act 1969, the Dairy Produce Levy (No.1) Act 1986 and the Rural Industries Research Act 1985 are being introduced for collecting industry contributions to the trust account. It is anticipated that levy rates will be set in proportion to the value. of production in each of the industries involved. The annual contribution of $750,000 to be made by the livestock based industries is equivalent to less than 0.01 per cent of their gross value of production. Industries which are not' presently covered by Commonwealth research levy arrangements-equine, livestock breeding and deer industries-will. not be subject to exotic disease preparedness levies. Because of the costs of establishing and administering new levies the Government does not propose to levy these industries for exotic disease preparedness purposes at this stage. Turning now to consultative arrangements, the Government is seeking to have as wide a range of relevant advice available to it as is possible. Up to now, the main source of advice has been the high quality technical input from public sector veterinarians making up the Animal Health Committee, an officials' committee reporting to the Australian Agricultural· Council. The Government feels that advice it receives on exotic disease planning should also clarify the wider managerial, social and financial implications of, disease eradication operations. Accordingly, the Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Council will be established under the terms of the Bill to provide this additional range of advice. As well as pursuing its advisory role the Council will propose for the Minister's approval annual programs of expenditure in respect of the additional $1.5m funding which is to be provided for exotic disease preparedness. It will be comprised of eight members, headed by an independent chairperson. The Australian Agricultural Council and the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industries and Energy will each have a representative on the Council, and it is envisaged that these members will be professional officers with experience in exotic animal disease preparedness. Two members of the Council will be appointed on the nomination of the National Farmers Federation to ensure that the views of the livestock industries are effectively represented. In addition, it is proposed to appoint three members with special qualifications to the Consultative Council. These members will collectively have expertise in disaster and emergency management, communications and public relations, agricultural marketing and the veterinary profession.

The proposed amendment to delete reference to the Chief Justice as an ex-officio member of the National Debt Commission has been introduced in deference to the wishes of the Chief Justice of Australia, Sir Anthony Mason. The Chief Justice requested the amendment on the grounds that the activities of the Commission have no relationship to the responsibilities of the Chief Justice, and that a Chief Justice is ordinarily unable to contribute any economic expertise to the Commission's deliberations. The National Debt Commission was established under the National Debt Sinking Fund Act 1923. The Chief Justice's membership was based on British precedents and. on the belief that public confidence in the Commission would be enhanced by, the presence of an important apolitical figure. Neither reason is relevant today, and there is no particular need for the Chief Justice's membership as a legal representative. - egal matters affecting the National Debt Commission and the National Debt Sinking Fund are referred to the Attorney-General's Department, which is represented on the Commission by its Secretary.

226,Mr HUMPHREYS,DEFENCE SERVICE HOME LOANS," Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek your indulgence to add to an answer I gave during Question Time. The honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) asked me what would be the cost to the Government of a one percentage point rise in housing interest rates under its subsidy payments to the Westpac Banking Corporation within my Department. The answer to that question is: the estimate for interest subsidy for 1989-90 is $183m, based on a benchmark interest rate of 15.9 per cent, The benchmark rate is an average of the housing interest rates of several major lenders ,as specified in the agreement between the Commonwealth and Westpac Banking Corporation. An increase in the benchmark rate to 16.9 per cent would increase the estimated interest subsidy to $200.5m in that financial year, an increase of $17.5m. This assumes all other factors remain unchanged-estimates for new loans, loans discharged and principal receipts. INCOME TAX (ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE STATES) REPEAL BILL 1989 Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 May, on motion by Mr Keating: That the Bill be now read a second time.",95
227,Dr HEWSON,DEFENCE SERVICE HOME LOANS,"1I have pleasure in leading the Opposition's contribution to the debate on the Income Tax (Arrangements with the States) Repeal Bill. We will not be opposing this repeal Bill, but I wish to move an in principle second reading amendment. I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following.words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House notes that: (I) the Treasurer is devoid of any policy on Federal/State financial relations; (2) the Treasurer has been unable to achieve effective restraint in State expenditure; (3) the Treasurer remains exposed to the effects of increases in State charges on the CPI; and (4) the global borrowing limits are a fiction given the extent to which they can be regularly circumvented'. This. Bill is t-pical of the Treasurer (Mr Keatmg) of this country in the sense that it is nothing more-and I emphasise the words 'nothing more'-than a political stunt. There is absolutely no substance at all to the decision on his part to remove this piece of legislation. The Act was originally designed to .facilitate the introduction by the States of their own personal income tax laws. The Act did not hav- the potential to incre-se taxation; rather, It paved the way for reductions in taxation. As I understand it, the Act provided for up to 10 per cent of tax revenue collected by the Commonwealth in each State to be allocated to that State explicitly in the form of grants. If the State did not desire the amount of revenue so provided, its residents could receive a tax' rebate for that amount of 10 per cent which the State Government did not receive. In this way a discipline would have been imposed on the States to encourage them to manage their financial affairs in the most efficient manner. We need t.o clear a few things up. To repeal that Bill really does not do anything about the income taxing powers of the States. It removes an enabling piece of legislation but it does not affect the States' powers. AI understand it, from 1915, when the Commonwealth first entered the income tax field to 1942 both the Commonwealth and thStates levied income taxes. In 1942 the Commonwealth Labor Government introduced a scheme of legislation which sought to establish a uniform Commonwealth income tax which would render it politically impractical for the States to continue to impose their own separate income tax. The point is that the States have always had the right to· impose income taxes and, following the uniforI? tax legislation of 1942, it was only pobtlcal obstacles that precluded the States from reintroducing their own income taxing powers. It is important to understand the nature of this Bill as it was stated. '. 11'). this sense, to my mind, the Bill was redundant in any case as the States already had the right to impose income taxes. This right, I gather, was reconfirmed in the High Court in a case in 1956 or 1957. The specific provisions of the 1978 Act were to ensure the prevention of double taxation. The Act established a ruling for tax revenue collected by the Commonwealth to be earmarked for the States. ' Against that background when I read-l was not. in the Parliament that day-the Treasurer's second reading speech, and the claptrap '. that he built into it, attacking us for - antm- double taxation and for wanting to glVetaxmg powers to the States, I saw it was as big a fraud as, indeed, is he in terms of his economic management of this country.' - i- whole i<iea was to embarrass the Opposition in general, and Ole in particular, by the statements that we reportedly had made. The situation arose from a television interview that I did on the Face To Face program. The Treasurer watches television in the morning, and in the evening decides to pull out a piece of legislation and attempt to pull on a Iltunt and embarrass the Opposition. It is not going to work, and he is the one who will be embarrassed. It has got nothing to do with me. In fact, if the Treasurer had taken the trouble to listen carefully to that interview, or if he had paid any attention to it, he would have heard that I said: Well I don't want to make specific commitments or be seen to be making commitments, but as a matter of principle, that does become a dimension of the problem. I mean, in simple terms, one of the great failings of the financial state-sorry Commonwealth State financial relations is that the Commonwealth does the taxing under the present arrangements and the States do a lot of the spending. And there is no equivalence, if you like, of taxing responsibilities along with the power to get . . . benefits of their spending and so we have this terrible situation where the Commonwealth is always at fault for one reason or another, and I think that re-distribution process is important and at some stage, yes you . . . need to look at the . . . redistribution of taxing powers. In there I say nothing about what. we will do. I say nothing more than that there is an issue-a problem. I am fascinated that I am held accountable on the basis of that statement for advocating taxing powers to the States which, as I said, they already have. It shows the superficial nature of the debate that this Treasurer engendered by his press release in response to that television interview of mine, and his subsequent second reading speech in this House. The real issue is that covered by my amendment today which is that the Treasurer has not got any policy in respect of Federal-State financial relations. He does not have a policy at all. We have witnessed that now on several occasions-six or seven; I cannot remember how many-in the life of the Hawke Government. The Government has had Premiers· Conferences in this country, and the Treasurer goes in belly-aching every time and saying, 'The Sta-es have. let us down again, they won t restram spendl!1g. Here I am being a good bloke and cuttmg expenditure, and the States won't play ball'. The point is that the Treasurer has responsibility under our system for overall economic management. If he does not want to wear it-if he does not want to face up to that responsibility-that is his problem. The issue is there, and it is an issue that he has not dealt with. In six or seven years, as is so typical of this man, he has blam-d th- Stat-s or anybody else rather than adjust his polIcies to the position. We have seen it happen dozens of times. One could beg the question of what Paddy MCGuinness, Ross Gittins, Max Walsh, Alan Mitchell, Nobby Clark and everybody else in this country have in common. On face value one would say not a lot, except that they have been grouped together for a tongue lashing by the Treasurer. The Treasurer has singled them out for a tongue lashing, w-en their only crime in life has been to questIOn him, disagree with him or take any s-and on the issue at all. It is absolutely amazmg that the TreaSurer consistently gets away with that behaviour. I notice today he was short of substance in his response. There is no policy on his part. .",95
228,Mr HOLDING,DEFENCE SERVICE HOME LOANS,What is your policy? Tell us what your policy is.,97
229,Dr HEWSON,DEFENCE SERVICE HOME LOANS,Stick around; our policies will be released in due course.,97
230,Mr HOLDING,DEFENCE SERVICE HOME LOANS,When?,97
231,Dr HEWSON,DEFENCE SERVICE HOME LOANS,"When we are ready. We will keep you waiting. We will release them at an appropriate and strategically significant time. We are happy to fight the Government in an election-the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) is laughing his head off-on our policy versus the Government's. We saw today that this Treasurer does not have any policy. I raised six problems with his standard policy of high interest rate- and h- did not answer any of them. He did not pick them up. I am not sure that he could - andle theII?-' The point is that he has no pOlIcy and thiS is a stunt to divert attention from the fact that he does not have a policy. This is why he is always on the attack. When his inflation policies failed, what did he do? He decided to fudge the consumer price index (CPI)-he moved the goal posts. We have already debated one Bill in this House today where the Treasurer cut the excise on beer just to get himself half a per cent off the CPI. What did that do? It created an enormous furore in the marketplace, as people realised that there were some unintended consequences of that change. Then he got himself into a mess when he had housing costs included in the CPI, as they should be. That is an important element that affects the standard of living of the average Australian. When those numbers start to go against him, what does he do? He blames the Australian Statistician. He attacked the Statistician for the way he measured the consumer price index, and .deman-ed that he reconsider the treatment of housmg costs in the index. We know what happened. Five separate measures were considered, and, 10 and behold, the Statistician changed to the one that gave the lowest increase in the consumer price index over that period. This is typical of the attitude of the Treasurer towards serious debate in this House or anywhere else. He is not interested in debate. We saw that today. He has no responses to specific arguments. He do-s not t-ink ab-ut the issues. He is not the slIghtest bit worned. He is too busy worrying about his o,,:,n poli-­ ical games, trying to get the leadership of his Party. All lean say is that it would take a brave man to run against Bob Hawke with only four votes up his sleeve. I hope his arithmetic improves.",97
232,Mr HOLDING,DEFENCE SERVICE HOME LOANS,---;- Whom did you vote for? Did you tell any lies?,98
233,Dr HEWSON,DEFENCE SERVICE HOME LOANS,"I have said whom I voted for. I have gone on the public record, and I would be quite. pleased again to run it by the Minister at the table. The second point I make is that obviously the Treasurer is concerned about getting expenditure restraint overall. He boasted today in the Parliament about his fiscal policy-this thing he calls his fiscal restraint policy. It is always hard to get a handle on that because he has changed it so many times. Again, he moves the goal posts. He moves things off Budget and includes asset sales to make, the expenditure numbers look better. He has not released any reliable forward estimates for the past couple of years, so we cannot get a, handle on where on earth expenditure is going. However, the point is that he would have us believe he has a fiscal restraint policy. He would have us believe he is controlling exp-nditure. . All one has to do is go back and look at the national accounts to see what the public sector has done in terms of contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) growth over the last six, seven, eight, nine or whatever quarters. I think the last time. I looked at it the situation was that for nine out of the last 11 quarters the public sector had contributed positively to growth. In the early days of the Hawke Government a substantial contribution was made to overheating in this country from other areas but recently some of that overheating has been due to the public sector. The Treasurer can claim that he has cut his own expenditure, that he has cut payments to the 'States, but the States and indeed the Treasurer-if one can get beneath his statistical facade-have not really cut government expenditure significantly at all. Here we are, a country riddled with a mounting balance of payments problem and a significant international debt problem that is threatening to blowout; while the Treasurer has continued to contribute to the. extent of overheating. The Government is a big importer, but what has happened about Government import policy in recent days? I have hardly heard the Treasurer mention it. He is not interested in genuinely dealing with the issues. The third point of my amendment concerns the impact on the consumer price index . (CPI) of increases in government charges. We have seen that on several occasions in. recent years. 'The Treasurer claims that he has an inflation policy that will bring the CPI under control, yet part of it is beyond his control-or at least he leaveS it beyond his control. He does not choose to address the issues. 1 find it fascinating that again the Treasurer belly-aches at the Premiers Conference about the potential for the States to. put up charges as a result of the restraint he imposes on payments from the Commonwealth to the States for whatever. But where is his policy? He is devoid of any policy. the final point relates to the Government's borrowing limits. We have seen several attempts' by the Government to restrain public sector borrowings. The financial markets are innovating at a pace that is a lot faster than is the Treasurer's capacity to monitor those borrowings. There is a fair bit of evidence around that the borrowing ceilings are. circumvented. Indeed, there is some evidence around to suggest that some of the Government's own departments are involved in this process of circumventing government borrowing requirements. I find this very interesting in an area where this is fundamentally important. The Treasurer .is responsible for overall economic management in this country. He is responsible for bringing the desired effects that he wants on overall activity, on inflation, on the balance of payments or whatever, but again we come to another great big hole in. the bucket. Again, the Treasurer's economic management bucket has another significant hole in it. He is devoid of any policy on Federal-State financial relations. All he does is complain and belly-ache about the nature of the outcome. He does not seek to address the. problem in any sense. It is against the background of those sorts of comments that we find this measure just a political stunt. It is the sort of political stunt in which this guy participates all the time. There are some fundamental questions relating to this area that I have tried to raise by way of my amendment. The Treasurer needs to address these questions. He needs to be quite explicit about some of these matters. We had the interesting situation, for example, at the' last Premiers Conference where, . in proposals relating to New South Wales-irrespective of what one thinks about those-Premier Greiner stood up and said publicly that he wanted to take the responsibility for increasing some expenditure in his State. The Treasurer attacked him. Yet he simultaneously supports quite openly the expenditure patterns and behaviour of the Western Australian Government and the Victorian Government, both of which have hosed a substantial amount of taxpayers' money tip against the wall in the past several years. The Treasurer is happy to accept that; he is happy to say that is good, fiscally responsible behaviour, and yet he attacks Premier Greiner because he dares to suggest that maybe. the States ought to face up to some of their own fiscal responsibilities. It is those sorts of double standards and political stunts that all but characterise the Treasurer. Unfortunately, it leaves this country, exposed as it is to its international lems involving the mounting balance of payments and a significant international debt, and probably in the midst of an exchange rate crisis, in a particularly precarious position at present. It is about time the Treasurer addressed these and other issues rather than just playing stunts.",98
234,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFENCE SERVICE HOME LOANS,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Beale-I second the amendment.,99
235,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,DEFENCE SERVICE HOME LOANS,"1 support the Income Tax (Arrangements with the States) Repeal Bill. I oppose the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson). The first reason we have to evidence why this debate is significant in relation to tax policy concerns the fact that what we have seen in our time in office has been a change in the strategy of taxation management. . That change is in contrast with the mismanagement of tax policy under the Howard-Fraser Government, at which time tax evasion and tax avoidance became the order of the day. It is very clear that they became growth industries. The first thing we must establish is that that was the tax pattern and practice that was inherited. There are many people in the professional community these days who complain about the Australian Taxation Office and Mr Boucher, but I say to some of those practitioners that they were part of the tax avoidance industry before the present Government took over and introduced necessary reforms to recoup tax which previously was not recouped. My second observation relates to why the Opposition finds this sort of legislation hard to come to grips with: it is the last vestige of Fraserism in terms of taxation management. It is evident that Fraserism still rests in the minds of many people. I have referred already to the question of tax avoidance and evasion. The other thing that was significant about Malcolm Fraser's economic policy was that he talked about an era of new federalism-that is, that we would move the responsibility for tax policy away from Canberra and back to the State governments. At the time there seemed to be some sense in the view they took. First of all, if the States were to be the taxing bodies then the probodium for levying taxes would rest with the State governments. That was the first thing. The second thing-and this was ignored at the time---,was that if taxing powers were moved back to the States that would remove any chance of using tax policy as a tool of economic management. The view was that that Government thought it did not really have a role to play in Canberra and that it would give that role back to the State governments. However, clearly, a modern economy like ours cannot be managed by having various State governments competing in terms of tax policy. We have seen what happens when we allow. State governments to operate in areas such as corporate regulation. It is interesting that legislation on that was passed through this House yesterday. We simply cannot have a situation where we allow States to manage tax policy. I will give some substantial reasons for that in a moment. The important difference between this Government and the Opposition on this matter is that we made it, very clear from day one that we had an agenda for tax reform. The second thing that has to be said is that we were not about to go down this path of new federalism, of removing any responsibility for tax policy from Canberra. The reason is very simple: not only did we regard tax policy as an important element of our overall fiscal policy but we also had an array of other policies within which tax policy would fit. In a debate like this the Opposition is very uncomfortable. Not only can We talk about fiscal policy and· the role that tax policy plays in fiscal policy but we can also sayand this is very significant----,-that. tax policy as of right now plays a role in relation to wages policy. That is why we are talking about the wage-tax trade-off in 1989-90. It is a central part of this Government's strategy. Not. only does one have a tax policy as part of the fiscal policy but also, sensibly, one has an. array of other policies that fit in with that .structure. Those policies are wage policies, industry policies, and so on. This has been the strategy of this Government. It is important that we understand at the outset that this piece of legislation is not an accidental piece of legislation. It is part of an approach by this Government to tax reform and to the recognition of the responsibilities that we have in relation to tax policies. That is the background.. ,_ Let us get to some of the specifics. Much is made by those opposite about how they would go about managing the economy. But I would say to them that when they do go down that path of talking in terms of economic management they cannot go around the country appealing to those sectoral interes-s, as is their habit, and as is particularly the habit of their National Party colleagues in trying to appease vario-s groups. In talking to the State Premiers-and this is what this legislation is fundamentally about-we have been saying to them 'You have a responsibility to conduct your fiscal activities in .' the same way as we have here in Canberra'. That is a very important point. We hold very strongly to that. We will not back away from that commitment. On the evidence, what might we say? What tests might one impose to say, 'What kind of fiscal responsibility has been demonstrated in Canberra '? ,Let us look first at the question of outlays. When we came to government, outlays represented nearly 30 per cent of GOP. They are currently running at 25 per cent of GOP. In other words, Commonwealth outlays, that is, outlays by the Federal Government in Canberra, have fallen from 30 per cent. to around 25 per cent of GOP. It is projected that by 1991-92 outlays will be approximately 23t per cent of GOP. That is a very significant reduction in Commonwealth outlays as a percentage of GOP. That is the first test we ought, to impose. When one imposes that test, one finds that our economic management has worked. Let us move even further. If one looks at the question of outlays and then looks at the next test- that is, the deficit outcome, it is clear and it is on the record-Senator Stone helped us at the time-that we inherited a projected Budget· deficit of $9.6 billion. In this current financial year we have in focus a $5.5 billion surplus. When we have these debates-and we seem to have many of these debates here-it is important to emphasise that one does not just happen upon a surplus of that nature without going through the difficult process of expenditure cutting and targeting one's particular activities. That has been done over a sustained period by· this Government. Those· opposite, who would' seek to talk about the difficulties in terms of economic management, have to face that reality. The first test of economic management comes back to a Government's ability to manage itself. Outlays have fallen as a percentage of GOP from about 30 per cent to about 25 per' cent and are projected to come back to about 23t per cent. The second test is that the Budget deficit has been eliminated and we now have a Budget surplus. l1hat is an important point. We can go back to 1987 when there was the promise of unfunded tax cuts. In 1989-90 we are giving funded tax cuts. That observation brings me back to the point with which I began: that tax cut strategy is tied in with a wage strategy. In this modern economy one cannot pretend that one can go into the market place and talk about managing economics without having a wages policy. We still wait for what will happen opposite. In the context of what goes on in these debates, the test is still there for the Opposition to demonstrate where its wages policy is and where its tax policy is. I wish to go further, because something else needs to be said in this debate. A week ago we had the experience of the Premiers Conference. The Premiers 'predictably came to Canberra and said that ,they believed it was going to be very difficult. They then left the Premiers Conference saying that it was even worse than they thought it would be: They said, 'Canberra is being very tough on us. We cannot possibly survive because things are very difficult for us all'. The fact is that that is not the case as far as the activities of Premiers in their own States are concerned. The evidence is before us and it is very clear. Let us look at 'the situation in terms of revenue. We have had what amoullts to a bonanza ,in terms of stamp duty for State govermherits, both in housing and. in business. That bonanza has come. about because of economic growth which has been funning at record levels. Before the Opposition gets into this debate, I would simply remind it to remember what John Howard brought us-negative economic growth. It takes a lot of skill, 20 years, to get negative economic growth and the Opposition managed it in its last year of office. We are producing a level of economic growth which, in terms of the States, is a bonanza. That, is an important point. The wage-tax trade-off, in relation to the States, has great benefit for them as employers, because it offers them the chance to forgo large wage increases because their employees will get tax reductions. H<;>wever, it puts a challenge at the feet the States. I wonder how many of them can meet that challenge, which is: to do this they will also have to engage in award restructuring.Award restructuring means that they will have to do a lot of reorganising of their industries. Some States have done very well in that respect.. We can point to some performances inStates like Western Australia where there already has been some improvement in that State's level of management. But the job is not completed and the job, interestingly, is taking another form and a challenge for some States:, How will they go about wheat marketing? Are they prepared' to .go down the track of deregulating their own activities so that we can have an effective improvement in wheat marketing in Australia? This debate has been interesting; because we have had a variety of views on that issue. But the challenge is clearly before the State governments in relation to wheat marketing and their capacity. I think it is important to emphasise that we also have a complaint from the States-, which is significant-that the Commonwealth has not done its job in terms of outlays. The evidence is that the Commonwealth has cut outlays substantially. I referred to that earlier. At the same' time, by comparison, the State governments have increased outlays. It is very difficult, if one comes into this place· and argues, as the Opposition frequently does, 'We are not terribly happy with the interest rates position; we are not very happy with the external balance. But at the same time, incidentally, we are not prepared to take on the States in terms of how we would go about the question of their own fiscal restraint' and our fiscal restraint in Canberra: Clearly, we do not have a wages policy which can underpin it. Further, we do not have a tax policy which will lock into a wages policy'. I would say to those opposite who wish to come in here with these 'propositions about economic management, 'Get back, and do sohle of the policy making;. It is not all in Future Directions. In fact, where is Future Directions? Where does it stand these days? We have a new front bench. I found it very interesting yesterday that we had some film people taking some film in the chamber. Why did they' have to come in and take of some film again? It was because the Opposition front bench changes so often. The crew had to come in and get some new film. Where does the policy stand? We do not have anything substantial. The people opposite have to lock themselves into those policy propositions. I suspect that they have not yet gone through that process. We will be charitable and say that we will give them some time. But the test will still stand before them. How will they go about managing the policy propositions in Future Directions? Are they the policy propositions of the new Peacock Opposition? I suspect that the electorate will find that they are not, because there'must be room to manoeuvre in terms of all the promises and agreements that have i been made, particularly with those people like Mr Elliott. That is an important emphasis. Let us not direct all of our concerns here to the Opposition's lack of policy. There something else which needs to be said which is a concern to everyone. on this side of House. This Government has gone down the track of successively doing things in terms family allowance supplements and improvewhich mentsto the well-being of individuals and families in this community. We have given commitments to families in this country. Members of the Government find it partiction. ularly annoying and galling when State governments choose to reap back revenue by increasing rent, for example, in their own housing trust or housing commission or Homeswest properties. That clearly is a way of not seeing through the Government's sotion cial policy objectives. Secondly, what bothers us is when the State governments increase their own level of taxes and charges as a result of Premiers Conferences which run quite contrary to the general thrust of economic management from this Government. This Government has set about reducing its own demands upon the economy. It is also intended that we will have a structur.e of reducing inflation with· wage-tax trade-off. One cannot go down that path effectively unless the State governments play their part. Those opposite often speak very strongly for State governments. But I would say to them, and to State govern the ments, that if they want to be part of this level of economic management, if they want to be part of the role they claim to play in the Australian community, then they will have to take their share of the responsibility. Their share of the responsibility is this: They have a responsibility to set their levels of taxes and charges in such a way that, firstly, they are below the level of the inflation rate and, secondly, they do not act regressively upon families and individuals in the community. We have had this occurring often recent times. I mentioned earlier the circumstance of the increase in the family allowance supplement and that being milked away by State governments which decided through their own pricing strategies with Homeswest housing commission and housing trust properties, to increase their rentals. When we have a Premiers Conference and part of the strategy is to reduce the pressure on the economy, we find that the outcome is that State govis ernments go away and increase their own taxes and charges to' try to recoup some the more revenue. The game is important; it is about economic management. From day one of in Canberra we have shown our intentions, are to manage and modernise this economy effectively and to deliver on the policy front. The challenge is not only to State governments, it is also to the OpposiIn conclusion, when the Opposition enters an economic debate such as this, the first thing it should do is juxtapose its performance against ours, and on that criterion it will lose. The electorate expects theOpposito come up with policy propositions; so far it has not done so. We have had a series of sniping attacks upon a government which has a substantial level of performance to put before the electorate. I say to the Opposition, 'You have a lot of work ahead of you, but at this stage this Government has a record of reform, particularly in the area of taxation, and the electorate knows it'.",99
236,Mr WILSON,DEFENCE SERVICE HOME LOANS,"The lria come Tax (Arrangements with the States) Repeal Bill, as its title states, is designed to repeal the income tax arrangements with the States. I think it is most unfortunate that this is occurring, because it demonstrates that Government has failed to understand one of the fundamental weaknesses of our present federal system, or if it does understand it, the way it would want to change it, as was clearly demonstrated by the speech of the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards), is to replace the present federal system with a centralised system. The honourable member said that in no way should the States have any responsibility in the economic management area. That is true in national terms, but in terms of the manin agement of the economies within the States, they have a responsibility. Mr Ronald Edwards-I accept that, but I did not say that they have not a resporisible role to play; I said that they do have a role I and they must play it.",102
237,Mr WILSON,DEFENCE SERVICE HOME LOANS,"But the honourable member said that in playing that role they must carry out the economic policies of the Federal Government. So it was a token gesture to them to say that they can playa role but they must do what Canberra says. I do not believe that we can have a true federal system where State governments or, indeed, local governments are used merely as administrative arms· to carry out the decisions and policy programs of the central government. A true federal system is one that divides power between the spheres of government. We have in this country, de jure, a two-sphered system of government; de facto we have a three-sphered system of government. I would personally like to see local government given a de jure status, where its relationship with State governments is substantially different from the relationship today-a relationship somewhat similar to that which applies in West Germany, where the powers conferred on local government cannot be withdrawn by the conferring government without the consent of local government. Mr Ronald Edwards-What did you thiQk about the referendum?",102
238,Mr WILSON,DEFENCE SERVICE HOME LOANS,"It had nothing to do with the referendum on that question because, whilst the referendum would have given some de jure recognition to local government, it did not go as far as I am now advocating. In Germany local government is placed in a relationship with State governments th/it is somewhat similar to the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, because there are certain areas that are State reSponsibilities. But if the Commonwealth wants to take over those responsibilities, there must be· a referendum or it conl!ent by the States in order to transfer those powers. ThaJ is one element of a fair, sensible federal sYl!tem where there is a clear division of legislative law-making power between the two or three spheres of government in circumstances where that legislative law-making power cannot be withdrawn. In the case of local government that legislative law-making power can b- withdrawn by State governments and often is. De jure, we have the same situation between this Parliament and the Houses of Assembly of the two Territories. De jure, this Parliament could repeal the law-making power of the Northern Territory House of Assembly, just as it could repeal the law-making power of the recently created House of Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory-and that has been done. The Territory had more power at one stage. It was then withdrawn, and it was then given some more power under the present arrangements. So they are in a de· facto situation where they have legislative law-making power but they are not protected by a sharing of responsibility where the law-making powers cannot be withdrawn from them. One day this Parliament will need to face that question. One day we will have to see whether we will put the Northern Territory in a situation similar to that of the States, just as I think that the States should· be looking into the position of local government to see whether it should be put into a situation where it has law-making power which cannot be denied it by the conferring authority-namely, State governments. . I said that that was only one element of federalism. The other element is that if we divide legislative power, we should divide the revenue base in a way which ensures that the Government· that makes the spending decisions has the responsibility for raising the money. The problem with the Australian federal system is that there is a massive fiscal imbalance. The Commonwealth raises most of the money and then doles it out to the States, which, in turn, pass some on to local government. In that process, or as a consequence of the fiscal imbalance, part of that legislative authority on the States is denied them because they are either spendthrift in their approach, because they know they can get· the money from Canberra, or, alternatively, they are squeezed in a way whereby they are denied the responsibility of taking sensible decisions, because they are told how to spend· the money by a Canberra government. One of the difficulties arose as· a consequence of the Constitution. The Federation was created in part because of the Customs laws that existed between the original States when they were colonies. One of the motivating forces for the federal system was to get rid of the customs barriers at what are now the State boundaries. In that process, the Founding Fathers thought that they should exclude from State authority the levying of customs and excise. That, in turn, narrowed the revenue base of the States. Then, as the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) pointed out, at the beginning of the Second World War there were two income tax regimes-State income tax. regimes and Federal income tax regimes. For the war effort, the Commonwealth took over that income taxing authority, collected the money and said, 'We will pay some back to the States'. Much water has passed under the bridge since then. It could well be argued that it would be more sensible if the States had a broader revenue-raising base, broader in the sense that they should be able not necessarily to raise customs on overseas trade but to impose excises, and broader in the sense that they could raise income tax. The honourable member will quickly say to me, 'Yes, the States could introduce their own income tax, establish an income tax department, have their own schedules and their own definition of income, work out their way of dealing with tax havens and all the other difficulties'. I believe that that would be quite absurd, but it would not be absurd to enable the States to levy a tax as part of the overall Commonwealth income:: tax. When the Treasurer introduced this legislation he talked about there being double taxation. It is a, good political pl.<:>Y to say that if the States have a surcharge, that involves double taxation. But it is a political ploy, and the Government knows it. The Government knows that this repeal is a political ploy. If the States had a broader revenuebase and were entitled to raise income tax and chose to exercise their powers under this legislation, they should be given the option of doing that rather than increasing the indirect taxes that they now use. Although the States do not have an excise levying capacity, as a consequence of decision,S of the :J-ligh Court they can levy franchise taxes or licensing taxes. As a result, in most States there is a very heavy State tax on beer and spirits, there is a tax on petroleum, and there is a tax on cigarettes. In fact, States could levy a broad-based consumption tax, provided that they structured it on the basis of a franchise tax-the right to use the land from which the goods were .being deliveredand did it within the. parameters laid down by the High Court decisions. If we are thinking about the future tax structure of this country, if we believe that this country should have a viable federal system and a proper fiscal balance between the spheres of government, we should not be repealing this legislation-or, if we were repealing it, we should be repealing it to replace it with a more effective broadening of the tax base of the States. I believe that the Fraser Government's legislation was a step in the right direction. I would have gone a lot further, and more quickly. I would not have described it as a surcharge or rebate. One can easily work out what the general revenue grants that are made available to the States represent as a percentage of the Commonwealth's income tax collections. Consider, for example, what the general revenue grants, excluding any of the equalisation element-the general revenue grants paid on an equal per capita basis to the citizens I of every State and Territory-represent as a percentage of total income tax collections. It might. be a third, it might be a half. Let us say it, is a half. What the Commonwealth should be saying is, 'We will determine the tax structure-the rate structure, the thresholds. We will calculate the percentage of the general revenue grants as to the tax collections and we will collect it this year on the basis Of.a 21c, 29c and 39c rate structure. But from next year on, we will only collect 11 ic,14k and so on-half the rates-but we will collect on behalf of the States the other half of the rates, provided they trigger it by using the sort of legislation which unfortunately this Bill is designed to repeal'. That would not be double taxation. It would be the Commonwealth vacating thefleld, at least to the extent:"":""""'and the Commonwealth probably could do it to a greater extent-of the amount of revenue needed by the States under their general revenues. , It would not be double taxation at all. There would be one tax return but the rate that was determined in respect of the resident of a particular State would be determined by the Parliament of that State. The States that needed equalisation grants would be protected, as the legislation about to be repealed protected them. In that way we would get real efficiencies in the operations of State governments. State governments have increasingly become entrepreneurs involved in attracting industry to a particular State and encouraging the development of resources. What we have to be very careful about is that under the present system those States do that attracting of enterprise in a way that is inefficient in terms of the nation as a whole. Every State wants a cement works. Every State has to have its electricity generating commission. Every State wants part of the submarine action. So it goes on. But if they had to raise their own revenue, we would not have States leaning on the Commonwealth to collect money out of the Commonwealth, distorting the normal best location decisions as to the placement of business enterprises. So I think it is most unfortunate that this repeal is going on in these circumstances. That is why the amendment of the honourable member for Wentworth is so apt. He points out in it that the Treasurer is devoid of any policy on Federal-State financial relations.· In promoting federalism the Liberal Party and the National Party never had in mind double taxation. We had in mind tax efficiency, making governments that spend the money responsible for raising the money. I believe that over time Liberal and National Party governments will stick by that view of federalism, a view that should have the States which make legislation fully responsible for it, not merely acting as the administrators of Commonwealth decisions. But in addition to giving the States full legislative power over various areas of activity, we should place upon them the responsibility for raising the money. There are two ways that that can· be done. I have described one-broaden the tax base, the Commonwealth vacate the field and say that in year two, unless the States trigger rate, they collect nothing; they must make the decision as to the income tax that they are to receive by way of general revenue collections. The other way we need to change the Federal-State relationship is to recognise that State governments have become entrepreneurs. They have become businessmen in the field of education. They have become businessmen in the field of hospitals. They have become businessmen in a number of other areas as well. That is not what State governments should be doing when those activities can be carried out far more efficiently by private individuals. It may be for profit, or it may be individuals grouping together in cooperatives, in religious based hospitals, in community schools or christian schools or schools run by people who have a particular view as to the type of education they want provided. Therefore I believe that future governments-and to a degree it is demonstrated in the Liberal and National parties' policy on education-will move to fund individuals and not institutions. When future governments move to .fund individuals and not institutions, people should then have the choice of sending their children to independent schools rather than 'State schools. But if the State schools are better and people want to send their children to the State schools, in those circumstances the State should draw down the revenue that follows that enrolment. So what the Commonwealth should be doing is funding individuals rather than institutions and in doing that the first thing that should be done is that the tax structure of the Commonwealth should be devised in a way that leaves the funds with the individuals, rather than taking them away and then paying them back in cash rebates or tax allowances. Recognition should be given to the fact that parents wanting to educate their children, whether in the state system or in the independent system, are coSting the States money. If we are going to fund individuals, instead of drawing off the taxes from those individuals, we should give them dollar for dollar tax relief so that they should be able to spend their dollars that they have got from their earnings on choosing the education they consider to be appropriate for their children, or choosing the hospital they conthe sider to be appropriate for themselves or the sick member of their family. In that way we can get government out of people's way. We can have smaller government. We can have governments going back to being responsible for the essential elements of law and order, defence and foreign affairs. We should readjust our total tax system in a way which recognises that people and their families have a responsibility to meet social expenditures. They should be left with the money so that they can afford those social expenditures rather than have the money taken off by the tax gatherer and then the tax collector and those who work with him say, 'We will determine which schools and hospitals people will go to; will run the schools and hospitals rather than let the people themselves determine who should run those schools and hospitals'. The legislation is a backward step in terms of the vision for the future of independence and self-reliance of the Australian people and their families. I recognise, though, the Labor Party is doing it as a cheap political trick. If not for that reason, the Labor Party is doing it because it is centralist in approach to government.",103
239,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFENCE SERVICE HOME LOANS, put Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,106
240,Mr MARTIN,DEFENCE SERVICE HOME LOANS,"It is a pleasur:e to follow such a thoughtful conabout tribution by the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) in a debate of this nat4re. Clearly, he has a philosophical bent in particular direction with respect to taxation, a subject he and I have discussed on a ber of occasions. He demonstrated that again tonight by making one or two comments about the role which Commonwealth govwhich ernments, State governments and local govarguable ernments might play in the future under particular form of government.""He demonhas strated clearly his feelings about what the Future Directions policy document Liberal Party means. I am sure that the honourable member will not find it surprisTax ing if I do not necessarily agree with everyBill thing he says on this issue. I pose one or questions to him about the difficulties States which have become business operacome tives, for example. To some extent, I myself in agreement that the States perhaps should not have that role in a purist sense, but I have a. few problems about to whom we leave the operation of those businesses there is no State government involvement in, for example, setting standards. I am sure honourable member is not suggesting that abrogate responsibility for setting those standards. The honourable member for Sturt used two examples, education and health. I find difficulty in accepting the proposition that we fund individuals rather than institutions, choices will improve to some extent. In thetioned ory, the comment that we should leave individuals with enough money to meet social we expenditures sounds good, but perhaps in practice it is very difficult to achieve without some form of government control. I know that universal health coverage is derided by those on the other side, but if it were not for Medicare a considerable number of people would not be covered by health funds. Those that sorts of issues need to be considered. I totally disagree with the claim of the honourable member for Sturt that the matter its of double taxation is a political ploy and that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) made an announcement in response to the arguments forward by the shadow finance minister at the time, now the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson). I will also make some comments his contribution tonight. The problem here-I will later come back to it in some detail-is that of the Federal Government a and the State governments imposing dual taxation burdens in one form or another. numPetrol tax was mentioned as an example. State governments levy a series of charges and determine which regime best fits within level of government will often be an point. I notice some lawyers are in a the chamber. Arguing in the High Court who the constitutional responsibility for each of those levels would keep a number of them of the busy for a long period. To put it in its simplest form, the Income (Arrangements with the States) Repeal look.s at implementing the announcetwo ment of the Treasurer of 12 March this year of that the Government would repeal the InTax (Arrangements with the States) find Act 1978. We on this side of the House cannot agree with the honourable member for Sturt, who suggested that this was Ii tremendous contribution to federalism. We if believe it was just the opposite and that certainly there was a potential-although, it the must be said, not used to this point-for we States also to impose a form of income tax. The honourable member for Wentworth went to a great deal of trouble in proposing the four parts of the amendment that he put forward today to canvass options about matif ters such as the - tate governments and the responsibilities they have. I think he mensomething,l about States potentially I putting up charges as a result of changes to taxation revenues accruing to the States or as a result of discussions that occur on a yearly basis between the Federal Government and the State governments at the Premiers Conference. He comes from New South Wales, as I do. Therefore, he will have experienced first hand, as I have, just what has happened in New South Wales with a coalition government of the Liberal and National parties under the Premier, Nick Greiner. .Last week, the Premier of New South Wales came to Canberra for the Premiers Conference. Again, he was very hairy-chested and suggested little ways to the Treasurer to cut outlays and make us more economically responsible; he undertook to do the right thing. The New South Wales Government has already done the right thing in New South Wales! It has not cut its expenditures, but it has raised the potential level of revethe nues in a variety of ways. Firstly, it brought in a new local government rating system which, in my Illawarra area, completely disadvantaged an enormous number of people who have to pay increased land values to the local councils for niismanagement at Wollongong City Council. Secondly, the New South Wales Government asked the people of the Illawarra area, which has some of the most beautiful beaches in all Australia, to pay $80 a year in levy towards solving the pollution problem on Sydney's beaches. It !llso asked the people the Blue Mountains to pay an additional $80 a year for the upkeep of Sydney's' beaches. It did so because' it cannot think of a more effective way to approach the problem. We have also seen a. boost in car registration charges, which will affect all those in New South Wales. We have seen electricity charges, gas charges and the like boosted by the Liberal Government. As was pointed out in debate on the censure motion today by the Treasurer and others, the effect has. clearly been to disadvantage all those people in New South Wales who would have benefited from the tax cuts paid out of a surplus which the Government has been able to bring down in the domestic economy. It has completely disadvantaged them because anything they had in their hands goes out the door because of the tax-grabbing mentality that exists within the New South Wales Government. Nonetheless, there are those on the other side who have the temerity to suggest that the power should remain within the legislation potentially to give the State governments an additional way of taxing, that is, the potential to impose a personal income tax on top of the sorts of imposts Greiner has already put in place in New South Wales. We just do not buy it. It is simply a load of nonsense. Does the honourable member for Wentworth, in his drive to become Treasurer of this country, support what is done in New South Wales? Does he support the fact that people on low income- and the disadvantaged are being hit just as hard as those people in the eastern suburbs of Sydney whom he represents? Does he support the fact that people in the Blue Mountains and Illawarra pay for the sewerage problems in his electorate? I find it staggering that he would come into this place and even suggest that in this debate. The honourable member for Wentworth went on also to talk about policy in respect of Federal and State relations. Last week we saw the classic case-the Premiers Conference. The Premiers arrived and were approached by the media. Each had a great one line, the traditional whinge ,about how the Federal Government had cut back the amount of money they were to receive and of that this would have dreadful repercussions on the States. As I have already illustrated, in advance of what the Commonwealth Government may have offered in terms of revenue sharing, New South Wales had already stepped in and imposed all these enormous charges so that the average New South Wales citizen was hit right behind the eyes before the Premiers even arrived to see what the Commonwealth was going to offer. It is an old con job: 'I'll accept the fiscal responsibilities', said Mr Greiner. Sure he will. He will put it up, but months before he had increased car registration, electricity charges and Water Board charges and brought in a new rating system, hitting everyone in New South Wales to pay for these so-called policy options he put forward. Clearly, it is nonsense. Every State has lived beyond its means for years. Mr Downer-You would rather borrow the money.",106
241,Mr MARTIN,DEFENCE SERVICE HOME LOANS,"The honourable member for Mayo interjects that we would rather see the States live on borrowings, but that is clearly not the case either. The Government in its discussions with the States on the levels of borrowings has already signalled that and has given clear indications of what is expected in that respect. What people forget is that, because of the booming property market in New South Wales, particularly in Sydney, and because of the sharemarket boom that occurred there, in the past 12 months stamp duty revenue has increased by about 50 per cent. That has brought enormous revenue to the State coffers in New South Wales. What did the State Government do with that? Did it cut back on expenditures? No. It did not. The Premier came down here and suggested, 'We are still very poor in New South Wales. Services will have to go, such as family and community services, that is, looking after the women who are bashed. We will cut out all the advisers in that area'. That is a great bit of social policy from the New South Wales Government. All those women can be bashed but it will not fund counsellors in that area. That is a great way for the State to save money. In the meantime, there is a 50 p-r cent increase in the amount received from stamp duties. New South Wales received wages benefits-after all, the State Government is the major employer-because of the accord. Wages have not run rampant because of the wages policy of this Government, unlike the 16 per cent blow-out that occ-rred in the last 12 months under the Opposition when it was in government. Clearly, there has been a State revenue bonanza in New South Wales which conveniently slips the mind of Premier Greiner when he comes down here and starts to whinge and cry poor mouth, claiming in a hairy-chested manner, 'I have the way. I want to accept fiscal responsibilities for my State. Leave it to Beaver and I'll take care of it'. We have seen what all that means. It means absolutely nothing, because the average person in New South Wales is being hit every which way. Regarding cuts and outlays to the States, the Treasurer on page 6 of the second reading speech clearly identified that major cuts have occurred. For the benefit of honourable members, I will cite the Treasurer's comments: On this basis, since 1986-87 Commonwealth own purpose general Government outlays-that is, excluding public trading enterprises such as Telecom and Qantas-have fallen by 5 per cent in real terms. What about the States? The Treasurer further stated: On the other hand, and despite the cuts in Commonwealth payments, comparable State outlays have increased by around 2 per cent in real terms. There it is. The honourable member for Wentworth in moving his amendment talked about effective restraint by the States and said that the Government had not been able to achieve that. Clearly, the Commonwealth Government has imposed its own restraints and has tried to ensure that the States will do so, but then there is the old double dipping. New South Wales is dipping the hand in the till in one direction but then being hairy-chested and saying, 'It's okay; we can do something about this. We can manage our own finances'. It is a political ploy, as the honourable member for Sturt suggested, but it is being perpetrate by this side of the house but by the New South Wales Government. Let us consider what has happened in areas such as the Illawarra. The people in the Illawarra who dared to return Labor members at the last State election have found that in the health system hospitals have been closed down, children's wards have been closed down, obstetrics wards have been closed down. There have been massive slashes of funds in our area. But Greiner says, 'That's okay. That's all right. They didn't vote Liberal so they will get nothing'. Mr Kerin-Western suburbs strategy.",108
242,Mr MARTIN,DEFENCE SERVICE HOME LOANS,"That is western suburbs strategy, as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy interjects. He knows all about it. His electorate of Werriwa is adjacent to mine and we share a lot of common problems. The same sorts of people live in our areas. Those people voted solidly for the Labor Party when the swing was on in 1988, but what have they got out of it? Area health boards have been sacked and political appointees have been put in. The Minister might remember that at the time Greiner said, 'I don't believe in jobs for the boys. 1 will not put political appointees on those sorts of bodies'. But already we have seen that happen. We have seen the State Government in New South Wales slash health expenditure. What about education? This point was raised by the honourable member for Sturt in his contribution. What have we seen in that area? We have not seen good things in New South Wales in terms of education. Class sizes are increasing all the time under the Greiner Government, and yet the honourable member for Sturt talked about the opportunities for choice and the opportunities for funding individuals. If what he meant, are the examples being demonstrated in New South Wales, forget about it. That is all I can say. In regard to Commonwealth Government borrowings, the Treasurer states on page 8 of his second reading speech: . . . the States' net borrowing requirement has only declined from 2.3 per cent of GDP in 1983-84, to'an estimated 1.2 per cent in 1988-89. What about the Commonwealth Government's position? The Treasurer further stated: In the same period the Commonwealth Government's net borrowing requirement has been cut from a 4.5 per cent deficit to a surplus of 0.9 per Clearly, this Government has done it, yet the honourable member for Wentworth, the shadow Treasurer-he who advised the former Leader of the Opposition when he was the Treasurer of this country as to how best to tackle the problems and led. us into double digit inflation and double digit. unemployment and all the rest of it-has the temerity to move a motion that states that the Treasurer is devoid of any policy on Federal-State fiscal relations. We can see what this Government has achieved just from that simple statistic-and it is simple; even the honourable member could understand. Quitecleariy, what is being advanced in this legislation is necessary. It addresses one of the basic problems, that is, the Australian people not knowing what the Opposition policy actually stands for. in terms of future direction and what it means in terms of whether States would be empowered at some stage to address this issue of double taxation. We are endeavouring to ensure that while we are in government that opportunity does .not exist. Clearly, given what Greiner has done already in New South Wales, he would swoop onto this quickly in the not too distant future, and the people of New South Wales would be taxed yet again. . Finally, 1 refer to a point raised by the honourable member for Wentworth in his contribution regarding the so-called exchange rate crisis. He should try to tell that to the coal mining companies in my electorate. Let me say that they do not think, this so-called exchange rate crisis is so bad. The honourable member should try to tell that to all the exporters in this country. They do not think it is too bad with the dollar at US75c. They do not think it is too bad at all. That is a massive improvement on the previous position. I accept that there is a need to keep that situation under review, but I will say one thing: the use of words such as 'exchange rate crisis' is absolute nonsense. It is typical of the scaremongering tactics often adopted by honourable members opposite, and, of course, we reject them out of hand. The amendment is a feeble attempt to discredit what this Government has achieved. I have endeavoured to show clearly the differences between the views of those on this side of the House and the views of honourcent. able members opposite. 1 accept some of the comments made by the honourable member for Sturt, because he is honourable and he does' believe in the concepts he put forward, but unfortunately in some respects he is a voice in the wilderness, and that applies to so many honourable members opposite.",108
243,Mr DOWNER,DEFENCE SERVICE HOME LOANS,"As other members who have spoken in this debate before me have pointed out, the Income Tax (Arrangements with the States) Repeal Bill 1989 is little more than a political stunt. Honourable members who really know anything about Federal-St;,i:. financial relations will be fully aware thaL - he original Act was pretty much redundant. 1 thought the speech made by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) was particularly disappointing in that it was replete with party political invective, very little of which had much credibility. For example, there was the inevitable ranting and raving about how the Greiner Government in New South Wales has been cutting back expenditure, and the honourable member cited instances where expenditure was cut back and how terrible a-l that was.. Further on, the honourable member called for greater cuts in expenditure in New South Wales, because the New South Wales Government was spending too much money. I find the logic of that proposition quite incomprehensible. The honourable member also spoke about devaluation and the exchange rate crisis and argued that basically this was very goodnews as .far as coal exporters in his electorate and elsewhere were concerned. Whilst one concedes that a devaluation strategy, which the honourable member for Macarthur calls for, obviously improves the profitability of exporters around the world, the overall macroeconomic consequences of a devaluation strategy have been shown again and again wherever that strategy has been tried to be a disastrous failure. In my own lifetime the first devaluation strategy I was old enough to understand was the devaluation strategy of the Wilson Government in Britain in 1967. It broke with the original Bretton Woods Agreement and devalued the pound by 10 per cent, I think. The consequences for the British economy in the longer term were utterly disastrous. It is interesting to· consider how countries such as West Germany and Japan have survived, grown and strengthened despite the sheer strength of their currencies. It is.c1early a chicken and egg argument that some currencies are strong because economies are strong. The two propositions feed on themselves. Countries with strong currencies typically have strong economies. They have benefited in the longer term through the restructuring that a strong currency has forced on them. However, I do not want to digress from the important political stunt that the Government has put forward-important in that what the stunt does is draw attention to aspects of public policy which are not addressed sufficiently in this Parliament or. in the broader community. Effectively, this legislation reminds us, as members of the Commonwealth Parliament, of what a shambles our current federal system has. become. Australians need to have a much clearer view of federalism, of what federalism means and what it is all about. The present ad hoc mishmash of law and practice leaves enormous uncertainty about the nature of Australian federation. It also creates duplication and in many instances unnecessary confrontation between the Commonwealth and the States, as we saw last week. Australia needs to decide whether it wants to become a unitary state, with the State governments being little more than the agents of the Commonwealth, or whether it would rather have a proper federation which provides a practical and enduring role' for the States. Over the years I have changed my mind on this, but I think some substantial advantage certainly would flow to our country if we had a more effective system of federation. One of the reasons I stand on this side of the House and not on the other side of the House is that I know that the Labor Party, unlike the Liberal Party and the National Party, is not committed to the division of political and, for that matter, economic power. The Labor Party believes in the concentration of political and economic power. It always has done and it always will do. On this side of the House we believe that the freedom of the individual is best guaranteed by ensuring that power does not become concentrated in the hands of a few in various walks of life who control a narrow range of institutions, be they social, political or economic. We are also aware that there is a dangerous propensity in any democratic society, indeed in any society, for power to become increasingly concentrated. It is that concern which the system of federalism, so carefully crafted in the latter part of the last century by our Founding Fathers, directly addresses. Our federal system of government defines the limits of the Federal Parliament's powers and, guided by a written Constitution which can be changed only by the people, was expected to provide a very real guarantee that power remained divided between the national Government in Canberra, the national Parliament in Canberra, and the regional governments at the State level. The second aspect of federalism is that Australia has different regions which have different values and different priorities. In a federation where decision-making is decentralised to the greatest degree possible, local communities are able to express their differences free from centralised conformity. Through that process, individuals are more likely to want to live in societies where cision-making reflects their own priorities and values rather than the mores of more nutralia merous but remote communities. I feel that very strongly, as someone from so-called 'minor' States-it is rather a pejorative way of putting it. Our attitudes, our aspirations and our concerns are continually being submerged as they have been since Federation by the interests, in particular, Sydney and Melbourne. The third aspect of federalism which· think remains as relevant today as it has been is that federalism recognises that not everything can be well done from tax. Canberra. It provides for local decisions be taken by local communities, not by a remote government in Canberra with little knowledge of and, as. all of us as members of the Federal Parliament would know, even less sensitivity for local concerns. It reflects what I would describe as' the liberal view that efficiency, especially economic effinancially, ciency, comes from diversity and competition and not from centralisation and conformity. Federalism allows for local decision-making to operate within a national framework. We will always have the national framework but it allows local decision-making to operate within, that .framework. It recognises the overriding need to establish broad national jectives. It is important to make that point because people often tend to think that when we talk of federalism we are not concerned about the national well-being or the national perspective when, naturally any advocate the federal system tacitly and, I guess, tively as well recognises that that is a very important part of what it is all about. That brings us to the whole issue of Commonwealth-State financial relations. I am glad to see that in the amendment moved by my friend the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hews'on) he says that the Treasurer Keating) is devoid of any policy on Federalbut State financial relations. That is right. It H years since a government in Australia-it - eally goes back to the legislation in 1978of has had any real perspective about FederalHouse State financial relations. The financial tionship between the Cdmmonwealth and the States is fundamental to a successful and genuine federal system. It is a relationship which has developed, however, since 1901 dean incoherent and ad hoc way, mainly at times of national crisis, and it has left Auswithout any proper basis for State finances. Any State Premier or State politione of the cian will tell us that. If one looks at the history of it it is quite interesting to see how this relationship has evolved. The First World War was the catalyst which eventually gave the Commonof wealth its borrowing powers through the Loan Council. The Great Depression gave I rise to the Grants Commission. The Second ever World War was the cause of the Commonwealth gaining exclusive control over income These changes were not made as part of to a nati6nal framework for the successful operation of federalism. It is important that people remember that. Furthermore, the Commonwealth-State financial relationship is, as we saw last week at the Premiers Conference, a relationship of coercion which makes a mockery of the theory of federalism.' Fithe States have very little bargaining power. I think one could go as far as saying that they ,have no bargaining power because the Commonwealth determines the basic structure of the nation's taxation system, levies ,most of its taxes and then farms out grants to the States as it sees fit. Last week, at the time of the Premiers obConference, a commentator asked why the Prime Minister and the Treasurer simply did not send a fax to the State Premiers telling the State Treasurers what the arrangements were going to be and leave it at that. When of that proposition was put by the commentaactor, the person he was speaking with on the radio found it difficult to explain why the Premiers and their Treasurers come to Canberra other than through convention. This system has many disadvantages. My colleague the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) not only has an electorate (Mr which, geographically, is adjacent to mine also has a great deal in common with is me in terms of attitudes on this issue. He made some points about the disadvantages the present relationship which I think the should take note of. Politically, as rela- members of the Commonwealth Parliament, we all know that the States simply blame the Commonwealth for many of their policy failures on the ground that Canberra simply in has not provided enough money. Of course, we all know that the States can raise taxes of their own, such as payroll taxes, business franchise fees, royalties, gambling taxes, stamp duties and the like, but it is worth remembering that Commonwealth grants account for about 46 per cent of all State government outlays-just under half of all State government outlays. I agree with the honourable member fQr Sturt. I think the current arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States are fundamentally unsound for a number of reasons. First, the States are unable to raise a large proportion of the funds they spend. Consequently, they are unaccountable to their own electorates for much of their expenditure. It is worth remembering that it is likely that States are more willing to spend funds they receive from the Commonwealth than they are to spend funds which they have raised themselves through local taxes. Secondly, the States rely too heavily on a very narrow range of taxes which fall disproportionately on the business sector-at least in the first stage. Thirdly, there is a substantial overlap between the spending functions of the States and .those of the Commonwealth. As the honourable member for Sturt pointed out, both the States and the Commonwealth are extensively involved in the funding of education and health, but also housing, local government and transport. It is worth' remembering that, at one stage, these were once areas of exclusive State involvement. Frankly, it is unlikely that administrative efficiency is maximised by sharing spending responsibilities between those governments. When I was shadow Minister fo- housing, I am glad to say that in the policy development work. I did I directly addressed those inefficiencies. fourthly, the ad hoc nature of the Commonwealth-State financial relationship has created an enormously complex set of arrangements which are subject to errors from time to time and, in some instances, the obfuscation of the true financial position of the States. Finally, the relationship between the Commonwealth and the States on borrowing I think is completely unsatisfactory. The global borrowing limits set by the Loan Council are continually circumvented by the States through the use of financial institutions which are not subject to Commonwealth controls. In my State of South Australia, the South Australian Financing Authority (SAFA) uses the State Government Insurance Commission (SGIC) to go out and borrow money for it so that it can circumvent Loan Council guidelines. It has been doing that fairly fre. quently in recent years. I have a lot of evidence of that, including a letter from the South Australian Financing Authority on behalf of the Premier to the SGIC asking the SGIC to borrow funds. That is a disgraceful way of circumventing the Loan C01lncil. State governments have been involved in a whole range of lease back schemes. For example, the South Australian State Government has leased out the Torrens Island power station. People in South Australia probably do. not know that the State Government is planning to lease the major power lines of the, Electricity Trust of South Australia running through the State in order, ultimately, to circumvent the limits imposed by the Loan Council on its capacity to borrow. So all this talk we have had from honourable members on the other side of the House, and from the Treasurer himself, particularly at the recent Premiers Conference, of reducing the States' capacity to borrow in the interests of reducing the public sector borrowing requirement, is simply cant and nonsense. The Commonwealth is not, stopping the States from doing that because of the wide variety of methods the States have to circumvent Loan Council guidelines. ' I think we really ought to be seriously considering a new Commonwealth-State financial arrangement. I think the new arrangement could incorporate several broad characteristics. First, I would retain the principle of equalisation-remember I am a South Australian-and the current advantages accruing to the less populous States would remain in place. Secondly, section 96 specific purpose grants should be used only as they were originally intended to be used-that is, for the furthering of specific Commonwealth objectives and not as a means by which the Commonwealth simply hijacks functions which have been the traditional responsibility of the States. Thirdly, the Commonwealth should define the proportion of Federal income tax revenue needed for its own functions, and we could consider a system where it asks the States to indicate the level of expenditure anticipated by those States in the forthcoming year. After taking account of equalisation factors, I suggest that we could have a system where the Commonwealth would then add the State revenue requirements to the Commonwealth's tax requirements and levy. the rel-vant rates of income tax in each State. In the first year of operation, the level of tax in each State would be identical if the proposed State expenditure remained at the same proportion of total income tax receipts as it had been in the previous year. Adjustments would be made only if those proportions changed .. In other words, the simple proposition is this: if we were to change the current financial relationship, we would ensure that the States became more accountable for their own expend,iture decisions. It would give States the opportunity more easily to change the mix of taxes within their boundaries. Some States might opt to abolish payroll tax, which I think is. a very regressive and unintelligent form of taxation when unemployment is a major. social problem, and replace it with, for .example, higher rates of income tax, or they might reduce income taxes and place a greater burden on traditional State taxes and charges. That would be up to the State governments and they would have to face their electorates on the basis of those decisions. I know that there is some concern that changes of this kind would reduce too drastically the capacity of the Commonwealth to manage the national economy. But where the States have been given autonomy and where the States have, in a fiscal sense, competed with each other, we have actually had very beneficial results. From recollection, I think it was the Queensland Government which first abolished State death duties. Because of that decision other States felt that they had to follow suit. Quite remarkably, the New South Wales Labor Government, despite its being in total opposition to the dogma of the Australian Labor Party, eventually had to abolish death duties because investment was not taking place in New South Wales. Particularly, people were not retiring in New South Wales, because there was clearly advantage in doing so in States without death duties. If we had competition between the States at this time, we would actually reduce the burden of taxation. We would generate greater overall macro-economic efficiency for our nation, because competition is a sure way of getting effective results.",109
244,Mr ROCHER,DEFENCE SERVICE HOME LOANS,"Therepeal of the Income Tax (Arrangements with the States) Act represents a particularly important stage for this fading Government, which is flailing around for issues on which to fight the next election. It represents an end to the pretence of fiscal responsibility in which this Government has indulged. There can be no real fiscal responsibility in Australia unless governments are made responsible and accountable for the taxpayers' money which' they spend and for the way in which that money is spent. This legislation places political expediency above the most fundamental responsibilities of governments at every level of the Federation. There is little doubt that in recent years the actions of State governments have been inconsistent with the need to reduce the size and role of government. I remind the House that for most of this decade, four of the six States, including the two largest States, have had Labor governments. State governments have added burdens to business, with a plethora of new regulations and interference in economic endeavours, which make a mockery of the half-hearted claims of the Federal Labor Government about deregulation in some areas. . Why have State governments so often acted in such an irresponsible manner? 1t is because in a very real sense they have not been responsible or politically accountable for both raising and accounting for the money which they spend. This problem goes back a long way, to when the wartime Labor Government sought to place a uniform rate of income tax, levied by the Commonwealth, on Australians in all States. As a wartime measure that change might have been justified but, since the war, the imposition of uniform income tax to the exclusion of the States has led to the growth and centralisation of Australian Government and, ultimately, a higher taxation burden from a Commonwealth Government which has grown well beyond the role envisaged for it by those who drafted our Constitution. , Since that wartime measure was introduced there have been two major challenges to its constitutional legitimacy in the High Court. The uniform tax case and its successor have become landmark cases in Australian constitutional law. Those cases institutionalised the actual dominance of the Commonwealth in, financial and revenueraising ability, as well as giving the Commonwealth new ability to dominate, State activities, which the Commonwealth has no constitutional responsibility for, through the means of applying tied grants under section 96 of the Constitution. Incidentally, the uniform tax legislation alsQ saw the Commonwealth Government take c;ontrol of large parts of State taxation authorities' to form what is now the Australian Taxation Office which; 'in turn, has increasingly broken free of constraints on the administrative authority of government under the supervision of the present Treasurer (Mr Keating). The fiscal irresponsibility of the States, which the Treasurer openly acknowledges in his second reading speech, largely derives from those chariges. In that context the,policy which became known as New Federalism began as a serious attempt to deal with the deterioration of the federal system and the ensuing incentives which long standing Federal-State funding arrangements offered for State governments to overspend. It is now a fact of history that the policy was not successful in achieving its goal. However, that is not sufficient reason to abandon the important planks of that policy. Indeed, if this legislation were allowed to remain in place it would be there to qe used by any current State and Commonwealth government in concert, in accordance with its provisions. It is clear, that the Labor Government has no effective policy alternative which wjll deal, with the long-term problem of ensuring that State governments take a responsible attitude to their spending. The repeal of this legislation will do nothing to answer the long-term questions or solve the long-term problems which face Federal-State financial relations. It will remove one possible way of addressing those problems in the future, and that is to be regretted. The legislation which is being repealed sought to ,allow States to exercise fiscal restraint by having the taxation levied on people in any State reduced if that State reduced its drawings on the grants from the Commonwealth. Similarly, it allowed States to levy their own income tax, collected by the Commonwealth, to meet the extra demands of State expenditure. For what, in hindsight, are obvious but not good and sufficient reasons, the State governments did not take up the option and continued to spend to the limits of their resources and beyond, while arguing for increased Commonwealth grants. Of course, taxpayers in the States still pay for the profligacy of State governments, but they do so through the hidden taxes of fees and charges for State governments' services, and through the increasing burden of taxation collected for them by the Commonwealth. One has only to look at the Commonwealth's Budgets to observe that no lasting cuts in Government expenditure will be made unless there are reductions in the largest items of spending. Amongst these, assistance to other levels of government represents the second largest Budget item-some 16 per cent of total outlays. The Government's approach to Federal-State financial relations is both irrational and destructive of federalism in the short and long run, and one would have to suspect that that is part of a deliberate policy. At the annual charade of the Premiers Conference the Commonwealth introduces across the board cuts to the rate of growth of general purpose payments to the States. The States jack up charges, thereby fuelling inflation in the process. They jack up charges on a range of services which they provide, and both levels of government go away with no reduction in the overall burden on the taxpayers of this country. The Treasurer then abuses the States; the State Premiers, in turn, condemn the Treasurer; and nothing happens. Yet this little exercise which we are indulging in today demonstrates' the double standards of the Treasurer. He has indulged in the largest taxing bonanza in the history of this country, with revenue booming as taxpayers fear the draconian efforts of the Australian Taxation Office to squeeze a little harder, to get that last drop. Labor's actual spending restraint has been minimal, and largely illusory. At the same time the States are SUbjected to cuts in grants, which the States use as an excuse to raise still more revenue from the limited sources available to those State governments. As the Treasurer observes, the taxes which the States impose are more distorting in their economic effects than many of those which the Commonwealth imposes. He acknowledges that, but then he feeds it. He allows it to breed and grow. Those State requirements add to the direct costs of businesses and families through indexed government charges. This whole procedure of indexing government taxes and charges to take account of inflation is, in itself, lacking in logic. While the consumer price index (CPI) does reflect the general rate of inflation, through measuring increases in the cost to consumers of a basket of goods, it has nothing at all to do with the particular costs of government, its trading instrumentalities and other agencies. The CPI includes, on a weighted basis admittedly, things like the price of bread and milk. What has the price of bread and milk to do with the expenditure approved by the Commonwealth Government to the States, and with the spending of States and their instrumentalities? It obviously has nothing to do with it at all. Nevertheless, we still hear argued around this country that the CPI measurement of inflation is a sensible basis on :which to measure increases in government spending in all its various forms; While the CPI does reflect the general rate of inflation, it has absolutely no relevance at all to the spending of the States; indeed, to the spending of Commonwealth governments. It is distorting the price mechanism for the increase in prices charged by State government instrumentalities to be based on any other factor than the changes in their costs or, perhaps, in isolated cases, the market situation that authority faces. This type of indexation institutionalises inflationary pectations, increasing the pressure for wages growth and reducing the pressures for fiscal restraint. It also makes it terribly easy and simplistic for States to say that because inflation as measured by the CPI is, let us say, 7 per cent, they should get 7 per cent more money from the taxes collected by the Commonwealth. It is equally simplistic and easy for the Commonwealth to claim-as it does ad nauseam-that it is justified in increasing expenditure in certain areas on the basis of CPI measured inflation, when in fact that inflation, as measured, has absolutely nothing to do with the functions of government in any of its forms. In his second reading speech, the Treasurer justified this legislation, involving this trivial repeal, by saying that it removes all possibility of the imposition of what he calls double taxation. In fact what the present regime in Federal-State financial relation-, ships has achieved has been to encourage State governments to replace taxes on the present generation with debt, which debt will have to be paid off by future generations. The failure of State governments, aided and abetted by the Treasurer, is a direct consequence of not being directly responsible to the people who pay for the bulk of the expenditure of the States. In recent years, the accountability of State governments has reached an all-time low. The growth of loss making ventures into the private sector in 'Western Australia and Victoria was justified by those State governments on the rationale of t>roducing greater revenue for State Labor governments to continue their profligacy. The bodies involved were not accountable to anyone. They were not accountable to Parliament; they were not accountable to the public. In fact, both State Parliam.ents were denied basic informationand they still are to this very d-y. The Budgets of the States were revealed as being quite unsatisfactory when the Greiner Government in New South Wales blew the whistle on the mess which had been left to it by the previous Labor Government in New South' Wales. The New South Wales Commission of Audit demonstrated that the total State' Government liabilities in New South Wales could be as high as $46 billion-but nowhere' was that to be found in the information left ex- by the previous Labor Government in that State. For many years State governments have produced artificial Budget surpluses by effectively treating borrowings as revenue. The Western Australian Government has deliberately tried to hide the size of its artificial surplus so as not to attract the' eye of those' in Canberra who are looking for cuts. This, illustrates the incentives for State governments to go into debt and avoid fiscal restraint. Again, in his second reading speech, the Treasurer outlined the excessive burden of business regulation at the State government level. There is plenty of room for State governments to reduce their role and their expenditure, but they are unlikely to do so when they expect the Federal Government to pick up where they left off. That is precisely what is happening, and we saw a classic example of it today in relation to the corporations legislation which was dealt with in the House this morning. Eventually, the only way in which the States will join efforts at fiscal restraint and budgetary reform is if they are primarily responsible for raising the revenue which they spend, and Commonwealth taxation is reduced commensurately. This might not result from the imposition of a State income tax. Indeed, such taxes are not a very desirable or efficient means of raising revenue, but it is necessary if Australia is to reduce the size of government, reduce the growing foreign debt and restore the strength of the Federal system. Only then will the total burden of taxation on Australians be permanently reduced. I support wholeheartedly the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson). It reads: (I) the Treasurer is devoid of any policy on Federal/State financial relations; (2) the Treasurer has been unable to achieve effective restraint in State expenditure; (3) the Treasurer remains exposed to the effects of increases in State charges on the cpr; and (4) the global borrowing limits are a fiction given the extent to which they can be regularly circumvented. Who could not, in all good conscience, fail to support the amendment. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

246,Mr NA BROWN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Menzies) (8.00)The Australian Federal Police Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 makes a number of amendments to the law governing the Australian Federal Police. Therefore, within the context of having an efficient system for. the maintenance of law and order within this country this is, of course, an important piece of legislation. There. are in substance four areas where the Bill makes changes to the law applying to the Australian. Federal Police. First of all there is a mechanism set up within the Bill which in effect denies superannuation benefits to members of the Australian Federal Police where they have been convicted of serious offences and where, in particular, they have been convicted of offences described as corruption offences. That I would venture to say is the most important part of the Bill. I will return to that part of the Bill in a little more detail later on in these remarks. However, to continue, the second part covered by the Bill can be described as redeployment and retirement. In that part of the Bill there are contained some streamlined provisions relating to the redeployment and retirement of police officers. The provisions in the Bill provide in effect that, where the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police is satisfied that a member's service cannot reasonably be' used in a particular position in his or her rank, the member of the Australian Federal Police force may be appointed to a specified position in a lower rank than the rank he holds or indeed he may, if it is necessary, be retired. In other words, they say they are streamlined provisions to enable the best people to be occupied by work in the position which is most suited to them. If that means they have to be appointed to a lower rank or, indeed, even retired, that course of action can be followed. There is an appeal mechanism by way of a committee set up under the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employprovided. ees) Act 1984 which will, as I understand preserve and protect the .interests of members of the Australian Federal Police who are affected by those redeployment and rein tirement provisions. The third area covered by the Bill is the witness prote-tion program. The Governexecutive ment has announced that there is to be witness protection program. For practical purposes So far as the Commonwealth is senior concerned, this Bill provides the ambit within which that witness protection program will be set up. There has been, of course, as House knows, a demand for some time for such a witness protection program. Such program has been recommended by the Parto liamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. I think it would be comHaving mon ground to say that an efficient and effective witness protection program is an essential weapon in the fight against crime. Crime, as we all know, has become in recent years much more sophisticated. Inare deed it has become much more brutal and ruthless to the extent-this is also common ground I would imagine; these are the of the matter-that where a criminal syndicate finds that the only thing that stands its way of being able to continue without conviction or on its course of organised crime is a witness, it would not be above removing that witness. It would do so either by intimamendments idating or terrorising the witness. It would even go further than that if it found that witness stood in its .way of being able continue with its criminal course of conduct. It is important, of course, that a stop be to that course of conduct. The witness tection program is one way of achieving that, that is, to provide the witness evidence has been given with opportunities to go to earth even if it means a change of name and identity and presumably with some financial assistance as well. This Bill, as I said, will enable such system to be set up. The Commissioner has been given power under the Bill to make arrangements with State and Territory police forces or with the National Crime Authority or with other authorities so that the services that are necessary to be provided to set up such a witness protection program may be With respect to the other parts of it, . the Bill, we support those proposals. The fourth area covered by the Bill is that relating to fixed term appointments. The Bill effect will enable fixed term appointments to be made of police· officers to what are described as prescribed or,if you like, senior ranks. As I understand it, the in a tention is to deal with those ranks in the police force which are the equivalent of the executive ranks in the Australian Public Service. The view amongst .the police force in general is that, on the understanding the that what is proposed is to appoint people for fixed term appointments to the ranks of a commander and assistant commissioner, then that extent it is a proposal which the people who are concerned are able to accept. fixed term appointments is consistent with the modern way of appointing people in appropriate areas of the public service. I use the expression 'public service' in the broadest sense. It enables the best people to be obtained for terms or periods whilst they available. No doubt attractive terms can be held out to them so that very competent and able people can be appointed for specific facts terms to those particular positions. We support that proposal, as we support in the proposal with respect to the witness protection program and as we support the proposals on redeployment and retirement. We support the Bill although we propose some to the other area which I referred to in my opening remarks as probably a being the most important area covered by to the Bill. That area relates to the loss of superannuation benefits by those police offiput cers who have been convicted of serious procriminal offences which go to the root of having an efficient, effective and incorruptibefore or after ble police force. The purpose of this part of the Bill is to cancel the superannuation benefits of members of the Australian Federal Police who are convicted of a corruption offence, as it a is called, and who are sentenced to imprisonment for life or for a term longer than 12 months. A corruption offence is defined as being an .offence that involves the abuse of office; an offence which was committed for a corrupt purpose; or an offence associated with perverting or attempting to pervert the course of justice. Of course one cannot have a police force where anyone is convicted of that sort of offence. It is important that a police force be above reproach. The Federal Police force has a very good reputation indeed. But with the Federal Police force, as with all other law enforcement agencies, it is very important that the Government and indeed the nation as a whole make it perfectly clear to law enforcement officers that the community will not tolerate a corrupt law enforcement agency. The views of the community as a whole, the view of the Government, and certainly the view of the Opposition are common to some extent; that is, that it must be made perfectly plain that the community will not accept law enforcement officers who are corrupt or who appear not to be above reproach and, more importantly, that there will be very severe consequences in addition to the normal criminal penalties when a law enforcement officer is found to have acted contrary to the standards that are expected of such an officer. It is important that this sort of law should be on the statute books. One hopes that it will never be used or need to be used, but it is important to put it there so that everyone knows where he stands. This Bill sets up the system I have described and it will work in the following way: after conviction and sentence for such an offence the Australian Federal Police member will, in effect, run the risk of having his or her superannuation benefits cancelled, or at least those parts of it which can be described as the employer's contribution. The cancellation of superannuation benefits will be affected by an order made by the cou.rt which has heard the original charge. If the court order is made, the member loses the Commonwealth contribution but is repaid the employee's own contribution and accrued interest. My understanding of some superannuation systems that apply in the general public service area is that in such circumstances accrued interest would not be paid-I may be wrong on that-and in any event in this case the situation is that the employee's contribution and accrued interest will be repaid to him or her. But far more than that, the most important consequence is that the bulk of the contribution and entitlement-that is to say, the Commonwealth contribution-will not be paid to the corrupt policeman or policewoman. The provision applies to both present and former members who are convicted after this Act comes into operation. Going on in more detail, and I do that because it will highlight the areas where we believe there should be an amendment to this Bill, we find that there are equivalent provisions which will lead to the loss of superannuation benefits in the case of those members of the Federal Police who are convicted not of the specific corrupt offences which I have mentioned but of declared disciplinary offences under the Australian Federal Police discipline regulations. In addition, there are specific provisions with respect to the Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioner. Special provision has to be made for them because they are not subject to the regulations. I have said that the mechanism that is set up to deny superannuation benefits to corrupt policemen and policewomen will operate not only with respect to those corruption offences but with respect to cases where the police officer has been convicted of declared or specific, if you like, disciplinary offences under the regulations. That gives rise to our first area of concern and we will be proposing an amendment which I could foreshadow at this stage. As things stand at the moment, one does not know from those words in the Bill which particular disciplinary offences will be declared· disciplinary offences. Some. offences in those regulations are serious and substantial; other disciplinary offences in those regulations are important but not as significant as others. For instance, the regulations create disciplinary offences where the police officer does not behave at all times with courtesy to the public. I assume the Government's intention would not be to deny superannuation 'Yhen the police officer has been guilty of that offence. A police officer is required to give prompt attention to all matters that come within the scope of his duties. Again, I assume that it would not be the intention of the Government to deny superannuation benefits to a police officer who has been found guilty of such an offence. One would have thought that offences such as being absent from duty, late in reporting for duty and other comparatively minor offences should not carry the severe consequence of a loss of superannuation entitlements. However, there are other offences in the regulations which are very significant. For instance, regulation 15 provides that a member shall not directly or indirectly solicit or accept a gift or gratuity from a person concerned directly or indirectly with any matter in which the Australian Federal Police or the member in the performance of his duties is interested or concerned. In other words, as one would expect the regulations to provide, a police officer is not allowed to accept or solicit bribes .. If a police officer does that, that is an offence under the regulations. With that background in mind, we make the point that we believe it is important, particularly for police officers and indeed the Parliament, to know which of those offences are to be regarded as so significant and so serious that they could result in a police officer losing his or her superannuation entitlements. These are proposed to be done by regulation and our amendment will provide that the declaration of which are significant offences and which are not will be an instrument which could be disallowed by the Parliament under the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. We support the thrust of the proposal. We say it is obvious that there are some disciplithere nary offences which should activate this mechanism and there are others that should not. We know for' a' fact that the police officers are concerned as to which offences will activate the mechanism and which will not. We believe very firmly that the Parliament should at least be able to see, and if it is serious enough to disallow, the declaration of which offences are in and which offences are out. Our first amendment will require that the declaration declaring which of those offences are so serious that they operate this mechanism may be disallowed under the Acts Interpretation Act. That will give a continuing and ongoing responsibility to the Parliament in this respect. There is a second matter in this same area where our second amendment is called for. Although the Bill is expressed, I regret to say, in the usual cumbersome language in which these provisions are becoming increasingly expressed, my understanding is that the substance of what is being done in the Bill seems to be, first of all, to cover the obvious case where there has been a conviction. The consequence of that is that, as a punishment and a deterrent, the superannuation entitlement will not be paid. One might say that that is the obvious and clear case. The second case which also seems to be covered by the Bill is where the police officer is charged and when he or she then resigns and in effect seeks to be paid out before the conviction. The result of that again. is a denial under the Bill of superannuation entitlements. It is proper that that case should be covered. My understanding is that that is covered by the Bill as presently drafted. It seems that a third case is not covered by the Bill and this has given rise to some for concern on the part of the Opposition, that is to say, where the police officer concerned has already been paid .. For example, he or she might get wind of something being up, apply for superannuation on resignation or retirement and be paid, but after the payment is made there is a situation where the police officer has been charged and convicted and in the normal course of events the entitlement to superannuation would fail. But by that time the money has been paid over and we believe that there would be a very serious difficulty in recovering it. In other words, is a danger of it being dissipated. We are not for one moment saying that this sort of case will arise,or that there are any particular cases which justify such a provision. We are simply saying that it is possible for such a case to arise and that, in so far as the Parliament has an obligation to ensure that all areas are covered by legislation, we believe this particular area should be covered by the amendment that we propose. My understanding is that the Government, in effect, supports the thrust of what I have just been putting. I understand also, however, and agree with this course of conduct on the part of the Government, that it is' a complicated matter which will require close examination and close study; it will require a detailed examination' of superannuation provisions to ensure-which is the proper thing to do-that all areas are covered. We would be quite satisfied if the Government, having had this amendment moved, takes it away to examine the situation and to see whether we have got the words right and whether we have covered the whole situa-_ tion--We would propose to move this amendment which .I am foreshadowing in both respects that I have referred - o.· Indeed, wq propose to move these two amendmel1ts to cover the cases that I have been referring to. We believe that this Bill, in the four areas that I have referred to, will in effect assist the Australian Federal Police, The provisions with respect to redeployment and retirement, if properly exercised, will make the police force even more efficient .and effective in terms of the allocation of its resources. The provisions with respect to the witness protection program will, as I have. said, provide an additional weapon in the armoury to be used in the war against crime, particularly in those very serious and ruthless areas of crime where criminals are certainly not above murdering a potential witness if the testimony of that witness is more .likely than not to lead to a conviction for a serious offence. We support that provision quite strongly. As I have said, we also support the fixed term appointments provision. So there will be improvements to the Australian Federal Police and for that reason we support the proposals. The Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen), I suppose, will be able to take some pride in the fact that he can add these reforms to the list of reforms for which he has recently been commended by the President of the Australian Law Council in the latest issue of its magazine the Australian Law News. In that issue the President, Mr Denis Byrne, makes the point that on occasions the Law Council has to criticise the Government; but he points out also that there are times when the Law Council feels it is appropriate to praise the Government. One area where the Council feels it is appropriate to praise the Government and the Attorney-General is with respect to some of the reforms that have been introduced during his term .ofoffice, particularly in the crime prevention area, and setting up the mechanism that is needed in any modern society to carryon effectively the war agains- crime. The President praises the Government on this occasion for the Proceeds of Crimes Act, for the Mutual. Assistance in. Criminal Matters Act, for the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Act 19,87 and for the <:;ash Transaction Reports Act. He 'praises in advance the work being done through the United. Nations (UN), and particularly through the United Nations Crime Congress, on developing a model mutual assistance in criminal matters treaty which it is hpped will be adopted by the eighth meeting of this UN body in 1990. The Government has had some praise in those areas and it has been acknowledged. We in the Opposition likewise believe that these measures have been improvements in the structure of laws in this country which are so necessary if we are going to fight crime effectively, particularly organised and more sophisticated crimes. We believe that the proposals in this Bill, with the amendments we have proposed, will be· additional weapons in that armoury and will make their own contribution to our having an efficient and effective law enforcement system within Australia. We have other comments to make, of course, which are in effect criticisms. I simply say that this is not the occasion to go into those. With respect to the specific matters I have mentioned, we certainly support the proPQsals. ,",116
247,Mr GRIFFITHS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Maribyrnong) (8.25)First, I would associate myself with the implied or explicit congratulations to the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen), not only in relation to this legislation, the Australian Federal Police Legislation Amendment Bill, but in relation to that. whole raft of anticrime legislation to which the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown) has referred. In this instance, without being immodest-something that would not become me in any event-1 can claim some association with the genesis at least of this legislation.It came about in large measure as a result of my outrage, which is not too strong a word, that in a certain Australian State there appeared to be the possibility that people who at that stage it could reasonably be assumed had engaged in corrupt activities had the prospect of being entitled to take out of the public purse via superannuation payouts very large sums, of up to nearly $lm for senior police officials-in Queensland, of course. ,To my mind that was abhorrent and in the longer term it would be inimical to the interests of a democratic society. More particularly, it would send a very bad signal if those who were subsequently convicted of serious corruption offences were going to be rewarded-even though that was not the' intent-by very large payouts out of the public purse for a period in office during whiCh they may have profited by the corruption of that public office. The legislation that I proposed in Caucus has been developed to the extent that it is now in this House embodied in this legislation in so far as it applies to the confiscation of the proceeds of corruption by Federal police officers. It is the Government's intention to extend the ambit of that philosophical approach to this issue to other beneficiaries of Commonwealth superannuation, such as judges, politicians and ordinary public servants. In my view, it is an important measure, not in the sense of retribution against those who have almost certainly engaged in widespread corruption; it is not meant to be primarily a method of retribution. In essence it is about a disincentive. It is probably fair to say that most people who serve in the public arena accept that they are not going to be the recipients of large salaries. In large measure they engage in the pursuit of their particular vocation as a judicious mixture of public service and issues such as security of tenure. Certainly one of the ongoing themes ill terms of basic security, given that they do not earn large amounts of money in their working lifetime, is the prospect of meaningful superannuation entitlements to ensure security with dignity into old age. So it is my submission that people who would be affected by this sort of legislation-namely, police bfficers, or subsequently in proposed legislation, beneficiaries of other forms of Commonwealth superannuation-are very conscious of the fact that' their long term security and their peaceful and secure retirement is related to their superannuation payouts. This raises the issue of why people are encouraged or inveigled or otherwise brought into contact with corruption of their particular public office. Obviously the prospect of a windfall financial gain or, over a longer time frame, receipt of income over and above that which they honestly earn is a major incentive. In my view it was sensible to bring about a change in the law so that people who were always conscious of this retirement nest' egg would consciously put that neSt egg in some danger were they to be tempted by that' short or medium term gain via corruption of their public offices. I looked around the world-although I had not satisfactorily ,completed the research, simply because at the' end of the day it was not relevant to whether we proceeded down that path-and found that only one country, the United Kingdom, had legislation remotely similar. The United Kingdom in the context of treason offences had legisla.: tion providing for confiscation of the superannuation entitlement of a public official convicted for the offence of treason. It seemed to me to be sensible to extend the ambit of that philosophy to other people who may be tempted to corrupt their public office. As I indicated, the United Kingdom was the only country that appeared to have similar legislation. Following that investigation, I pursued through the Labor Party Caucus the possibility of bringing in the legislation that we are now looking at. As it happened, only some days later the Premier of Queensland, Mr Ahern, was asked whether Qpeensland would follow the Commonwealth initiative-although at that stage it was not a Commonwealth initiative; it was simply a matter before the Caucus-and invoke similar legislation. Clearly at that stage it was a matter of great controversy, given the prospective retirement of senior government Ministers and senior members of the police force. Prospectively, they would be entitled to superannuation payments of many hundreds of thousands of dollars. To the extent that there appeared at least a strong prima facie case that those individuals had engaged in significant corruption of their public office, Mr Ahern was put under some pressure at his press conference in relation to his preparedness to invoke similar legislation. It is now' a matter of record that he indicated in the affirmative. The end result of that is legislation that certainly is not as strong as our Commonwealth legislation, but it embraces that philosophical approach to the potential receipt of superannuation by public officials who have corrupted their public office. So Queensland brought in legislation, and with its unicameral' system it took a little less time to get it through than we are used to here. Without wishing to go too much into matters currently before the courts we can say, without naming individuals, that at the very least it is likely that significant public figures in Queensland who have corrupted their public office over an extended period will not, as they had anticipated, be in receipt of hundreds of thousands of dollars by way of superannuation payments. To that extent I am gratified that once I raised the matter in the Labor Party Caucus, the Attorney-General fast-tracked it and had the issue investigated much more thoroughly than I could with my resources. It now represents another arrow in the quiver of the Labor Party's record in anti-crime measures. The honourable member for Menzies was gracious enough to acknowledge, at least implicitly, the role of the Attorney-General in the formulation and· enactment of legislation such as the proceeds of crime legislation, the telecommunications interception legislation and the cash transactions legislation, and the move for the first time towards a meaningful mutual assistance in criminal matters treaty. Taken together, those bits of legislation represent over a relatively short time frame the most significant response to corruption issues and, importantly, to organised crime matters in the history of this Federation. I It is always possible for people, to argue that we could have gone further, that we have not done enough, but the reeord speaks for itself. I emphasise that we are talking here about an area of public policy where it is common sense to hasten slowly. When we are enacting legislation with quite often very significant ramifications for Civil liberties issues and the like, it is incumbent upon us to hasten slowly. Most objective observers looking at that raft of legislation over the relatively short time frame to which I referred would see that it is not a bad record and is a credit to the Attorney-General. To be fair to the honourable member for Menzies, he did imply as much. It will be one of those areas that will stand the test of time because there has been a judicious mixture of balance and concern for. basic issues of civil liberties. Importantly, there has also been an acknowledgment that organised crime and corruption in its contemporary form, its multi-dimensional form, requires creative and sometimes quite strong legislation t9 ensure that it does not become so powerful that it starts to undermine the basic democratic processes that we are used· to. The honourable member for Menzies raised a number of technical aspects of the legislation. The first issue that he raised is not to do with the drafting of the legislation, and the Attorney-General will respond to the latter two issues the honourable member raised. In summary, it is important that people understand that this legislation did not come out of the bowels of bureaucracy. It came out of the debate in the Federal Parliamentary Caucus. It represents a unique and creative way of going about ensuring that public officials, be they politicians, police, judges or other members of the judiciary, public servants, or anyone who is in receipt of a Commonwealth superannuation entitlement will in due course-obviously it is not consequent upon this particular legislationbe subject to the sorts of sanctions that are articulated in this legislation. To that extent, it is important and creative legislation, which is mindful of the civil liberties issues that we must all maintain vigilance in relation to. I thank the Attorney-General for taking up the issues when I first raised them in the Caucus. It is gratifying to me to see that the Queensland Government was forced into adopting similar legislation. If I do nothing else in my time in public office, I will go out of this place very much gratified in the knowledge that a raft of crooks-particularly in one State-who have corrupted their public office, be they senior policemen, bureaucrats or politicians, will have many hundreds of thousands of dollars confiscated which otherwise would have been beyond the reach of the law. That superannuation is meant to be a reward for the discharge of public duty. It is quite abhorrent to contemplate the possibility that people can receive hundreds of thousands of dollars in superannuation entitlements not for discharging their public duties but for corrupting their offices. I thank the House.",120
248,Mr CLEELAND,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"1 join my colleague the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths) in expressing support for the view that the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) in a very short space of time has been responsible with the Hawke Government for passing the largest raft of anti-organised crime and anti-corruption legislation in the history of this country. That is an unarguable proposition, and demonstrably so. I might just consider the sort of legislation that this Government has passed in its short time in office. The Australian Federal Police as now constituted is a creation of this Government, and it is a vastly different organisation from that which was once composed of the Commonwealth Police, the Australian Capital Territory Police and the Narcotics Division of the Australian Customs Service. There is a vast difference today whereby those bodies are now amalgamated into a national police body, thus improving their performance on an annual basis. That body has become an important part of the national fight against organised crime. My particular concern in relation to the Australian Federal Police Legislation Amendment Bill is that finally, and for the first time, the Federal Parliament and the Government are moving towards the establishment of a national witness protection scheme. That is a vital weapon in the fight against syndicated and organised crime. There are problems in this country, as a report of the Joint Committee on the Natiollal Crime Authority (NCA) has already indicated, in that ultimately witness protection requires the ability to create a brand new identity for the protected person. This legislation will achieve that, but it will start the process whereby the Witness Protection Unit of the Australian Federal Police will be able to undertake the national witness role, as the Committee envisaged. However, the problem we still face federally is that the State Attorneys-General together with the Commonwealth Attorney must instigate the necessary State and Federal legislation enabling the creation of a new and separate identity. I can cite an . example. I have contact with a protected witness and, for the purposes of this debate tonight, I shall call her Miss X. She was a vital witness and, with the evidence of other witnesses, her evidence ensured that Domican and Rogerson are now behind bars, people who, I suggest, should be behind bars for a long, long time and that should have occurred many years ago. They seem to have led, together with Saffron, quite protected lives in New South Wales for many years. However, with the establishment of the NCA and the new attitude of. the Commonwealth Government, these people are now where they belong-behind bars. And they are behind bars because of the action of Miss X, among other people. Miss X lives only because she cannot be found. There is no argument whatsoever, on my knowledge of the matter, that her life would be worth nothing if associates of those people could get their hands on her. Currently she is being funded in her safe house where she lives with her children. A false identity was given to her, but that identity will not stand up to examination, so she receives a stipend. Recently, she applied for a job. She wanted to be able to work for herself and to get out of the stipend situation. She wanted to become a new person, away from the fear and risk of being detected and having the satisfaction of working and becoming a useful member of our community once again. I cannot say much about the new identity that was created for her, but the reality was that when she applied for the job she could not satisfy, in any way, shape or form, her identity. She could not really apply for the job, because her status and her identity could not be proved. None of the normal documentation that we take for granted in terms not of proving our identity is available to her. Regrettably, Federal departments such as the Department of Social Security and the Australian Taxation Office will still not accept, and I suspect that they cannot accept, that they should change official records to record a new identity. I understand that. In fact, the Australian Taxation Office would probably be committing a breach of the law if it allowed a person's name to be changed in taxation records knowing that the. identity was false or assumed. There is still much that we need to do to ensure that people in the position of Miss X, after they have given their evidence and have been of vital importance in the fight against major crime in this country, are given the ideal protection that they require for the rest of their lives. In this case it is protection not only for Miss X that is involved; her children also must be protected. Let us imagine being removed from the place where one is known and taken elsewhere in this vast country of ours to start a new life with a false identity and with young children. Such a person would always be afraid that young children at school might suddenly utter the name that that person wants to hide. That fear would always remain in the mind of these unfortunate people. There is much we need to do in this country to overcome the problems for that one person, but Miss X is not alone. There are other protected witnesses in our community who are or will be in the same circumstances. Very few people in this country require a change of identity, but I hope that the number will increase as the attack against organised crime continues and as the fact that protection is available for people becomes known, because those quality witnesses will come forward only if we can guarantee that their lives will be safe forever. I might add that there are certainly some people in that category whom we cannot help and who, despite being given the necessary protection, assistance, change of location, and whatever identity change the police can now achieve, will resist and throw themselves back out into the community, taking on the risk of being attacked by those against whom they have given evidence. That is my concern and through this, Parliament I urge the States and the Territories to get their act together. It has been more than 12 months since the Committee reported to this House. The States must pass legislation and the States collectively with the Commonwealth must be a bit faster in getting the process under way. Another matter that concerns me in the general area of the police and policing is the horrific number of people in this country who are dying at the end of a police firearm. It is true to say that a large number of people in uniform are dying at the end of criminal firearms, but what concerns me most is the apparent lack of training that many of our State and Federal police officers seem to have in the proper and appropriate use of a firearm. I recall that only last month there was an unfortunate occurrence in New South Wales where a young constable accidentally shot dead another person with his service revolver. Undoubtedly, that was an accident. There was some newspaper publicity as to the fact that yet again a service revolver in the hands of an off-duty constable had caused an unfortunate death. Yet I was horrified to see on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald the next day a photograph depicting three or four police instructors in the use of firearms in New South Wales pointing their hand guns at the camera person. We may say that that was a good photograph; it showed three people holding out hand guns. My fear and concern in relation to the photograph is that the first and fundamental principle that one is taught in firearm drill is that one never points a firearm at anyone, yet three instructors from the New South Wales police force allowed themselves to be photographed on the· front page of the Sydney Morning Herald while each of them pointed a firearm at a newspaper reporter or photographer. If that is the quality of the training the police force is getting, all Australians should be worried. It is of concern if instructors in the use of firearms do not understand the first and basic principle of firearm drill: never point a firearm at anyone. It is the loaded firearm that kills. Our newspapers are full of stories of supposedly empty firearms killing people. What hope do trainees have? No wonder there appears to be a cavalier view around Australia of the use of firearms. I express this strong concern as a person who for many years owned hand guns as a member of a police pistol club and who has fired a hand gun on many occasions. It is time for a rethink on the availability and use of hand guns throughout this country. One death at the hands of a police officer should always be questioned. Numerous deaths should give rise to concern, particularly when some of those deaths occur in circumstances where it appears alternative courses were open to the police to apprehend the suspect or criminal. Mr MCGauran-Which one are you talking about? How about a few specific examples? Mr CLEELAND""--I cite the case of a person sitting in a caravan park in daylight surrounded by armed police who are holding high-powered rifles, amongst other weapons, and who then fire into the caravan. I would have thought that they would have sat off that ,suspect and not exhibited a wish to use firearms. The first rule of all policing is to get the suspect alive. A dead suspect is not worth anything. Often one. never proves the rightness or wrongness of one's 'views on a suspect. I have given a good example. One can question why the use of firearms in that instance was necessary. I hesitate to use another example that occurred in New South Wales. One can question why a number of armed policemen burst into a small tenement without warning or notice and unfortunately-and one assumes accidentally-shot a person in bed who was not the wanted suspect. If we think that is desirable behaviour, we have to rethink our attitudes. I say this with due deference to and respect for all members of the police force. Unlike most honourable members, I know what it is like to be frightened in the middle of the night, to be dead scared that one is under attack. I know what it is like to carry' a firearm in my pocket, feeling quite happy that it is in my pocket. I know the fear that can be created in a person, the fear that makes one pull out a firearm to protect oneself. Unlike most people, I have been there and I have done that. That gives me, I think, the ability to stand in this place and question, some years down the track, why so many firearms are now being used. All life is sacrosanct to me. Criminals and suspects should be treated the same. It is a great concern I have for this country. I have raised this matter as an adjunct. It is not often that I get the chance to speak on police legislation. Not a great deal of it goes through this House. I have, I guess, strayed from relevance to the Bill. I appreciate the indulgence of the House and of those opposite who have not interrupted my thought process. I recommend this legislation to the House. I again urge the State Attorneys to get their. act together and look more seriously at the legislation which is required to enable new identities to be given to witnesses in this country to protect them.",122
249,Mr MCGAURAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"1t was with some alarm that I listened to the previous speaker, the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland), address the final issues in his speech to this House, or the adjunct, as he quaintly termed it, coming as it did from the Chairman of the parliamentary committee overseeing the National Crime Authority. In response to a challenge from me to provide some specific examples of his generalised allegations that police are, to paraphrase his words, trigger-happy, the honourable member seized on two examples which have not yet been the subject of coronial inquest. He dares to stand before this Parliament and judge the police in both cases, one being the shooting of the alleged butcher of the Walsh Street victims in Melbourne and the other being the tragic death of an innocent man in Sydney, although the premises definitely harboured the prime suspect in the fatal shooting of a policeman in Sydney. The honourable member dares to make a decision before the coronial inquest. If they are the only two examples that the head of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority can put before this House, there is something sadly wrong either with his view or with his thought process. His supposed due deference to the police rings fairly hollow.",125
250,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Order! I listened carefully to the remarks of the honourable member for today MCEwen to ensure that, because those matters were subject to external judicial process, he was not drawing conclusions about them. I can assure the honourable member for Gippsland that he did not trespass in that respect. The Chair was cognisant of that.",125
251,Mr MCGAURAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I find it a little odd that you would intervene in such a fashion to protect a member on your own side of the House. The Hansard is open to anybody's judgment, to' draw the conclusions he wishes.",125
252,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Order! The honourable member for Gippsland is not in a position to say that the Chair is intervening with respect to .either side of the House. The Chair is here to manage the debate and also to pay due respect to Standing Orders. It is in the light of that that I make my comments. I suggest that the, honourable member for Gippsland continue his speech with respect to the substantive matters he has to talk about.",125
253,Mr MCGAURAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I look forward to reading the Hansard record of the contribution of the honourable member for MCEwen. In 'my own mind I am quite convinced that he was citing the shooting of the alleged murderer of Walsh Street at a Bendigo caravan park and of an innocent man in Sydney in the last two or three weeks, names being omitted, as evidence of police carelessness with firearms. Having been on the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority since its inception some four years ago, I have had the opportunity of meeting and observing a number of Australian Federal Police officers of both senior and junior rank. Over that time. I have developed a very high regard for them. I have an immense respect for both their <!edication and their ability. Sadly, I have a number of concerns that the Australian Federal Police (AFP) is being allowed to run down. I serve notice on the Government that the Opposition intends to pursue the matter of the obvious low morale within the Australian Federal Police and the disharmony which has emerged from within its ranks. We have to be cognisant of the fact that one does not make gratuitous criticisms of a police force. For that reason I wish to do no more than signal my sense of unease and that of my colleagues about what is occurring within the AFP at present. Landing on my desk during the past week, and no doubt on all other members' desks, was the latest edition of the journal published by the police officers association. It is well worth reading. Page after page contains an outpouring of frustration and anger at the present system. There are a whole number of strands of complaint but it is not like any other police journal I have read. It is a very bitter catalogue of frustration and anger .. There is something seriously wrong with morale within the AFP that certainly needs a more urgent addressing than this Government to date has displayed. It was, after all, that same officers association that so criticised the Government for such funding reductions that the investigation into the murder of the most senior police officer in Australia's history, I would think, although I stand to be corrected, Assistant Commissioner Colin Winchester, has been severely hampered. I think it is in the interests of all police forces, indeed, the community at large, let alone the AFP itself, that that murder investigation came loa satisfactory conclusion as quickly as possible. So, if the police association is prepared to criticise the Government for its mishandling of the most important police investigation under way at present, I think that is prima facie evidence of a deep-rooted problem within the AFP. I do not wish 'to dwell any further on these matters. As I have said, I wish to raise a growing concern within the Opposition ranks that something that is very wrong is deeply centred within the AFP. If the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) would be good enough to reassure the House that the conflict of the police association with the Government is nothing more than the often expected traditional competition for funding between police forces and tightly strung governments, that would go a long way towards reassuring us. But he would also need to reassure the House, so as to ease our concerns, that the amalgamation of the former Australian Capital Territory Police, the Narcotics Bureau and the Commonwealth Police has worked successfully . and has resulted in a hanrionious partnership in the form of the AFP. I do not think that we have heard the last of this matter. The Federal Police them- . selves believe that government neglect, in tandem with government cutbacks in appropriations, has led to a demoralised Australian Federal Police force.",126
254,Mr CLEELAND,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL," Mr Deputy Speaker, I claim to have been misrepresented and wish to make a personal explanation. .",126
255,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Only with respect to a factual matter.,126
256,Mr CLEELAND,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) suggested that I had accused the police in Australia of being trigger-happy. That is not true. I did not use that expression or suggest in any way that any police in this country are trigger-happy.",126
257,Mr SCIACCA,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise to support the Australian Federal Police Legislation Amendment Bill, a very important piece of legislation which seeks to make amendments to both the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 and the Superannuation Act. I commend the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) and the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), who contributed to this debate earlier, for their initiative in bringing forward this legislation as part of a total package of measures that this Government has introduced over time to try to do something about the rorts and the corruption that occurs out there in society. The cash transactions legislation, the tax file number legislation and this sort of legislation are all part of a scheme of things that this Government is putting forward to make sure that the corruption and rorts out there in the community are got rid of as soon as possible. The particular aspect of the Bill on which I wish to concentrate my remarks relates to the provisions which provide the Commonwealth with the power to withhold superannuation benefits from existing and former members of the Australian Federal Police (AFP) who are found guilty of corruption. Of course, coming from Queensland, I know a lot about corruption. All my Queensland constituents and anybody who lives in Queensland would be familiar with the web of corruption that has existed in that State and that, I dare say, still exists in that State. I want to address some of my remarks to the situation in Queensland because I believe that a lot can be learned about what not to do about corrupt police from the National Party State Government under the direction and dithering leadership of the Premier, Mike Ahern. The National Party Government in Queensland has had ample opportunity to lead the way on this very question of corruption in the police force. Mr Courtice-Thirty years.",126
258,Mr SCIACCA,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"As the honourable member for Hinkler has said, it has had 30 years. Many members of the police force and a member of that Government's own parliamentary party provided it with plenty of opportunities to practise its response to exactly the sorts of things that this amendment covers in respect of the Australian Federal Police. Regretfully, they have bungled and mishandled each and everyone of these opportunities as they have arisen. They have yet to make the right sort of decision on any of the cases that have come before them. The Bill which is currently before the House-",127
259,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Order! I may be pre-empting, but I will be listening to the honourable member for Bowman to make sure that his remarks relate specifically to this legislation, which is the Australian Federal Police Legislation Amendment Bill and its superannuation provisions.",127
260,Mr SCIACCA,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"May I suggest, Mr Deputy Speaker, that one of the main reasons why this legislation has been introduced-it was raised originally by the honourable member for Maribyrnong-is the corruption that has arisen in Queensland, about which there has been ample publicity over the whole of Australia. I am giving a stark example as to why the Government has found it necessary to introduce this legislation. To preempt any possible objections by those opposite, I also say that no charges have been laid and that the commission of inquiry has in fact not been",127
261,Mr NA BROWN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: quite apart from the fact that what the honourable member is saying is out of order, this Bill relates to the Australian Federal Police and not the police in Queensland, Tasmania, Afghanistan, or anywhere else. The honourable. member for Bowman should confine his remarks to that police force and to this Bill, and not seek to get things in under the cover of a discussion of the point of order.",127
262,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"As the honourable member for Menzies will recall, I have already suggested to the honourable member for Bowman that that is the ambit within which the second reading debate should take place.",127
263,Mr SCIACCA,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The amending Bill before the House provides that no existing or former member of the Australian Federal Police who has been found guilty of corruption will be able to continue to have Commonwealth contributions paid to him. That is the way it should be, regardless of whether a person is a member of the Australian Federal Poli<;:e or any other police force. It is entirely inappropriate for a government elected by the people to continue to pay superannuation benefits to a member of the police force who has betrayed the confidence of the public. I again refer to the situation in Queensland as an example. In Queensland, the State Government has allowed many police officers, including many senior officers, to retire from the force well before they were due to retire, simply because they knew they would be facing the Fitzgerald inquiry. The reason they left and cashed in their superannuation was that the Leader of the Opposition in Queensland was repeatedly calling for some action.",127
264,Mr NA BROWN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to raise a point of order. The basis of my concern in raising this point of order is that I hope I will have time to move my amendment before the guillotine falls on this Bill. That is all I want to do. I do not intend to sit here and listen to the honourable member wasting time and repeating points which have been made time and time again by everyone and which are common ground between the Government and the Opposition. There is no dispute about this. With respect, he should confine his remarks to the Bill, which relates to the Australian Federal Police.",128
265,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,It seems that there is common ground. The only question in dispute· is the question of geography in relation to police forces. I have indicated to the honourable member for Bowman that we are debating a Bill relating to the Australian Federal Police.,128
266,Mr SCIACCA,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I take your point, Mr Deputy Speaker. I understand the time constraints. Nevertheless, I find it difficult to understand what the shadow Minister is saying, particularly given that this legislation has been brought forward because of what has been happening in other areas. I find it a strict interpretation of the question of relevance if one cannot use examples to illustrate why the Bill has been introduced. I find it extraordinary. Mr Courtice-It is embarrassing for the other side.",128
267,Mr SCIACCA,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"It obviously is embarrassing. It is obvious to me that honourable members opposite do not want to listen to these things. This Bill makes it very clear that it applies only to situations of corruption involving sentences of life imprisonment or a term of imprisonment longer than 12 months, or if a member is' found to be guilty of a relevant disciplinary offence and dismissed from the Australian Federal Police. The superannuation payments cease when the appropriate court makes what is known as a superannuation order. This sort of provision, I submit to the House, is entirely appropriate and absolutely necessary to ensure that the rights of those who are merely suspected of corruption are protected. It is obvious that these provisions of the Bill should apply only once the person is found to be guilty of corrupt conduct. Again, to give an example, this legislation has been followed to some degree by the Queensland Government because it saw its merit. I understand that the Attorney-General in his second reading spee-h indicated that it is the Government's intention to introduce similar legislation to cover corrupt Australian public servants and other Commonwealth employees. It is open to interpretation at this stage as to whether this will also cover politicians, for instance. I am firmly of th- view, and I am sure that. every member of the House and the Attorney-General will agree with me, that it should. I hope future legislation will include members of this Parliament. The Attorney spoke of .the financial disincentive presented by the legislation to anybody who may be considering corruption and I ask: why should we politicians not have the same det-rrent? No doubt that is something which the Attorney-General will think about at a later stage. Indeed, it may be appropriate that the deterrent be further strengthened by including in the provisions of future legislation the ability to withhold even the contributions made by a person found guilty of corruption, regardless of whether that person is a public servant, a police officer or a politician. One wonders again whether corruption would have reached the highest levels of politics, the police force and the public service in Queensland if this sort of deterrent had been in place 15. to 20 years ago. I wish to reinforce the comments made by the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) in respect of the witness protection scheme. This legislation is much needed, given what has been happening in other States. It is legislation which has been properly thought out, and I think in due course it should probably be further strengthened. It is something of which the honourable member for Maribyrnong should be very proud. Certainly the Attorney-General should be very happy that he has obtained the full support of the parliament-ry Labor Caucus, and no doubt this Parliament, in bringing it forward. I commend the legislation to the House and again congratulate the Attorney General for having brought it to fruition.",128
268,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"in reply-1 thank all speakers for their remarks. I particularly thank the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown) for his graciousness in referring to comments made by legal counsel, Mr Denis Byrne. It is true that we do not always see eye to eye, but I very much appreciate his comments. We are dealing with an issue which is of common interest to all of us; that is, the problems of and the increasing difficulties it presents. I am indebted also to the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), because it was his idea that we should deal with this issue. I acknowledge that without any hesitation whatsoever. The honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) was very concerned about witness protection. That is a very valid concern. This issue requires the cooperation of the States and firm arrangements for continued· negotiations to get adequate legal measures to enable an identity to be given to a witness. It requires not only Commonwealth cooperation but also State legislation. I understand that has been a matter for further discussion between officials, even today. We have here an acknowledgment of the value of police forces as well as the difficulties presented by human behaviour. In that respect I want to acknowledge the great work done by Mr MCAulay, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, who has a difficult and most responsible task. I cannot think of a more diligent officer, together with his senior officers, to pursue iour and encourage legislation of this type on the basis that if there is to be corruption it ought to be dealt with severely. Such a forfeiture penalty as this would be a disincentive, as was said at the beginning of the debate in the second reading speech, for anybody interested in corruption. I know the honourable member for Menzies wishes to move amendments, and I want to allow him to do that. At this stage the Government is not able to accept the amendments-though he is entitled to move them-and perhaps later I might have a chance to indicate why. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) mentioned the Australian Federal Police. There are difficulties at 'times concerning the matters that he mentioned which I do not want to go into in detail. As far as getting resources increased, I understand that at this stage they are quite adequate and there is no problem in that sense. Difficulties arose in respect of a particular matter .that is the subject of a coroner's inquiry. I do not want to comment on that. Funding has always been increased but whether it is always adequate for. all the crime emergencies that arise is another matter. Certainly, I would not want to think there is any problem with morale. It is news to the that that might be the case. I do not think it is appropriate that I should dive into that issue at the moment. The matter of major interest to us is to attract people to that force who I think might have other qualifications. If I may just deviate a little, the arrangement could be on a contractual or fixed term basis and not necessarily a permanent basis and people could have tertiary qualifications. It is very innovative and I think it would be helpful. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. In Committee The Bill.",129

It is expressly provided that a declaration of a disciplinary offence as a relevant disciplinary offence under the Australian Federal Police (Discipline) Regulations is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901."".

(c) the member has been paid an amount un c der a superannuation scheme; then, if the Commissioner believes on reasonable grounds that the offence is a corruption offence, the Commissioner shall notify the Minister in writing of the charge, indicating the particulars of the charge and the reasons why the Commissioner considers that the offence is, or may be, a corruption offence. . '(2) Where, after receipt of a notice under subsection (I), the Minister is of the opinion that the offence is a corruption offence, the Minister may apply to the Federal Court and the Court may, if it is of the opinion that it is reasonable to do so, make an order restraining the member or any other person from using, disposing of or dealing with by any means, any part of the amount paid to the member under the superannuation scheme other than ·an amount equal to the sum of the member's own contribution and interest accrued on that contribution.

During the second reading debate 1 advanced the reasons why in the view of the Opposition these two amendments are needed. I do not think it is necessary for me to repeat the reasons. They were given once and 1 trust that they were clear. 1 do· not intend to call for a division on these matters but 1 would be quite satisfied if the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) were to take them away and consider them, although it would be useful if he could give an indication at this stage of the Government's general attitude.",129
270,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"1 would like to indicate to the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown) that there is merit in the prop,osal. But 1 would like to say by way of explanation what is intended. Referring to the first amendment, the honourable gentleman said quite appropriately that the Opposition wants to ensure that we are not dealing with what might be called minor offences. My advice is that it is not intended that minor disciplinary offences be declared as a relevant disciplinary offence. Only serious offences will be declared. Certainly, all serious offences will still be subject to parliament scrutiny by way of regulation but it is emphasised that only disciplinary offences linked or associated in some way with corruption and sufficiently serious to warrant dismissal will be prescribed under the regulations. On that basis it is respectfully submitted that the first amendment, to that extent, is unnecessary because, once it becomes a relevant disciplinary offence, it is connected to corruption-and that is sufficiently serious to warrant dismissal. It, of course, becomes a regulation that is subject to disallowance by the Parliament. We would submit in those circumstances that the proposed amendment need not be pursued. The second amendment relates to the fact that there should be an opportunity virtually to restrain-",130
271,Mr NA BROWN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Freeze.,130
272,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"That has got merit as well. But could we make the point that originally the amendment was circulated under the heading of a relevant disciplinary offence. 1 do not think that is the intention of the honourable member's amendment; it is a matter of corruption, which we agree with. The difficulty seems to be-and 1I have discussed this with the Police Commissioner-that most of the superannuation payments that might have been made would be in the form of a pension, although payments might have been made in the form of a lump sum. The Police Commissioner thought that there might be difficulty in trying to trace the actual pension equivalent that would have been paid over a period of adopted. time. However, all is not lost in that sense and we intend to pursue the matter. While we are in no way criticising honourable member or the drafting of the proposed amendment, it might have a restraining aspect about it and, technically, as the provision is expressed, it would not allow us to recover payment. However, the Government intends to amend part VA of the legislation during the Budget session, to include provisions dealing with restraining orders in relation to corruption offences and where benefits have been paid for a former member. We believe that this will take up the thrust of the Opposition's proposed by Mr Kerin: amendment and it will address the difficult constitutional issues involved, and also the question of third party rights and what is called the corporate veil. It seems that some people whose assets might be frozen might say that the acquisition of those assets no way related to payments received. There is merit in what has been proposed, and I give the honourable gentleman assurance that the Government has this matter in mind, and we propose in the Budg-t session to deal with it. The issue that we ad idem on is the fact that there is corrupthe tion, and there is certainly proof of it. will try to recover any benefits that might have been obtained in those circumstances. We would certainly want to freeze such efits as well. The problem we have is in tracing some of these payments which could perhaps be subject to claims that they are not the assets of the person who was disthe missed. It might well be claimed that they are assets of the wife, the spouse, members of the family or something of that nature. Such assets might be difficult to trace. It on that basis that we need a little more time to think this matter out. I think that the honourable gentleman would agree that the Government's view in this regard is the same as what he intends. We do not see the need to pursue amendment No .. 1, and we propose to introduce in the Budget session a satisfacindustry, tory legislative amendment that should encompass the intention of amendment No.2.

273,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HORTICULTURAL EXPORT CHARGE,"I understand that it is the wish of the House to debate concurrently the Hortiis in cultural Legislation Amendment Bill, the Horticultural Levy Amendment Bill and the Horticultural Export Charge Amendment Bill. There being no objection, the Chair will the allow that course to be followed.",131
274,Mr ANDREW,HORTICULTURAL EXPORT CHARGE,"1 are welcome the opportunity to participate in debate this evening on these three Bills, We namely, the Horticultural Legislation Amendment Bill, the Horticultural Levy Amendment Bill and the Horticultural Exbenport Charge Amendment Bill. The Opposition spokesman on primary industry matters, the honourable member for Murray· (Mr Lloyd), had wished to lead this debate for Opposition. He was very anxious to do so but was unable to participate in this debate because of the changed scheduling due to the guillotine and a commitment that he is ha? already agreed to ih - is own electorate. There are three parts to this legislation, and I would like the House to consider each of them this evening. The purpose of the first amending Bill being considered is to provide for the participation of the nursery industry and others, such as the blueberry in the Australian Horticultural Corporation. and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation. The second amending Bill allows opportunity to providfor more cost effective levy and export charge collection arrangements for the .citrus industry, which is already participating in the Austr-lian Horticultural Corporation and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation. The third Bill provides for an increase in the maximum rate of levy and export charge. These Bills are particularly significant, and their importance could well be overlooked in the debate this evening. I remind the House that among the most pressing economic problems currently facing this nation is the problem we face as a result of our failure to trade our way out of debt. What is known as our balance of payments deficit is a major problem to the country and can be partially addressed if these Bills are effectively put in place. Consider the sobering and inescapable reality that in January of this year-the month in which we would normally expect to have among our best balance of payments performances-'-we had a balance of payments deficit of $1.7 billion. In February the deficit was $1.2 billion, in March $1.6 billion, and only last week the deficit that was announced for April was $1.2 billion. Who knows what our trading deficit for the year will be.",131
275,Mr NA BROWN,HORTICULTURAL EXPORT CHARGE,The Treasurer doesn't know.,132
276,Mr ANDREW,HORTICULTURAL EXPORT CHARGE,"As the honourable member for Menzies rightly points out, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) does not know. He has been asked. But it is certain to be in the vicinity of $15 billion or $16 billion. Only this afternoon, .when discussing these Bills and other matters of major significance to Australia's rural industry with representatives of the National Farmers Federation, those representatives volunteered the opinion that the major problem presently facing the nation is the question of how we address our balance of payments· deficit. Someone said that the problem that the Government faces right now with the balance of paymentsthe BOP, as it is called-is that the Government itself knows too little about the POB; that is, the pressure of business. There are real advantages for the Government in looking at the way in which it can encourage horticultural industry in this nation. Horticultural industry has the capacity to be a major income earner from a relatively nominal capital base. Let us take a look at what has happened to principal horticultural exports in this nation over the last three years. Government speakers will be anxious to point out to me that these figures are for the period that this Government has been in office;.I am grapious enough to acknowledge that. 1 would only want to add: what could they have been had the Government been a bit more sensitive to the BOP and the POB? The export of fresh grapes, an industry with which I am familiar, has gone from a value of $16m in 1986 to $38m in 1988. The export of fruit and nuts has gone from a value of $128m in 1986 to $154m in 1988. Plants, seeds, flowers, bulbs and live plants have gone from $13m in 1986 to $15m, in round figures, in 1988. The House should consider the sort of growth there has been in the cut flower industry, a horticultural industry with real promise, whose worth has gone from $5.5m in 1986 to almost $l1.5m in 1988. There is real opportunity for real.export earnings. The total value of horticultural products exported from Australia has gone from $199m in 1986 to $262m in 1988. The uncomfortable truth is that, despite that export growth from the very industries that these Bills address tonight,we have to sit here and watch the Government fumble with the export account and fail to produce a tradin- surplus. The advantage of the horticulture industry and the advantages of the industries addressed by these Bills is not only the potential they have properly encouraged for export growth but the opportunities they offer the Government to increase employment. There are· few other industries as labour intensive as the horticultural industry. Honourable members should ask anyone but principally those on this side of the House who represent labour intensive horticultural industries. One will discover what it is to be involved in an industry .that is prepared to employ people and generate export dollars for Australia. It is something of an uncomfortable truth that this labour intensive industry-I am referring to the wine grape part of the labour intensive industry-in a period of high unemployment was unable in the last vintage to find sufficient people to harvest the crop. That tells me two things. It tells me, firstly, that we have unfortunately a number of people in Australia who when work is available are not prepared to do it and, secondly, that we have here an industry that can thrive if it is allowed to generate further jobs. I make one other statement about the horticultural industry which is specifically addressed by the Bills before the House: we ought to be excited about what the horticultural industry has to offer the Australian economy and the lifestyle of Australians. Someone once said that agriculture is essential for life but horticulture makes life worthwhile. Horticulture has something to do with improving the lifestyle of Australians because it generates export dollars from pur near neighbours. The real problem the horticultural industry faced in export terms it faced when it was locked out of such markets as the European market as a result of the European Economic Community. But in the last decade, and even more pronounced in the last five years, there have been real opportunities emerging for horticulture in Asian markets. The figures I quoted illustrate that very point. We have our near neighbours, particularly Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong and I suppose to a lesser but an expanding degree, Thailand, Taiwan, Korea and areas like that, experiencing rising living standards. These people are seeking to adopt a way of life more closely aligned to the way of life that we take for granted. We have export opportunities begging to be picked up by the hor-' ticultural industry. It is to that very end-I am gracious enough to concede-that the Government brought into being the Australian Horticultural Corporation, the Australian Horticultural Research and Development Corporation and the Horticultural' Policy Council. The legislation before the House tonight is designed to change the levy arrangements that apply particularly in the nursery industry to allow it to participate in the Australian Horticultural Corporation and the Australian Horticultural Research and Development Corporation. The nursery. industry, as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) in his second reading speech indicated had a particular levy collection problem. The levy collection problem was that it was difficult to find a single point of sale for nursery products. So the nursery industry in cooperation with the Department of Primary Industries and Energy has COme up with an alternative. This alternative for levy collection is addressed in' the Bills presently before the House. The alternative allows the levy to be set on the pots that are used to house-for want of a. better termnursery plants. Those pots will have a l-vy set on them. When the nursery men. p'urchase those pots or trays or whatever form of container he may use for his nursery product, he will have paid part of the levy that he is obligated to pay particularly J for the Australian Research and Development Corporation. The Opposit,ion endorsed this action by the industry and the Government and supports the legislation before the House. The nursery industry is also excited about this, because it believes it will give an opportunity for smaller parts of the industry, particularly the blueberry industry, to enter the Australian Horticultural Corporation and to participate in the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation. However, the Nursery Industry Association of Australia has expressed a concern that I want to bring to the Minister's attention. Mrs Jan Davis, writing to the honourable member for Murray as the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, having endorsed the action that has been proposed in the House tonight, wrote: However, one matter of great concern has r-cent\y come to our attention. We believe the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation has recently completed allocation of funds for the 1989-1990 financial year. No money has apparently been set aside for nursery industry projects. We had been led to believe that some funds would be made available to the nursery industry for use during the 1989-90 year whilst our Levy funds are accumulating. She suggests that the Minister had led' her and the industry to believe that arrangements would be made to make it possible for there to be a phasing in of funds so that while the funds were being collected from those who produce the pots and the trays in which nursery plants are grown some funds would be advanced in the industry's interests. This is the understanding she had from the Minister and it is an understanding that apparently at this stage is not being delivered. She would like' some assurance that what was in fact the original agreement of the Department will be adhered to. I bring that to the Minister's attention tonight. A further change in the legislation before the House is a change in the technique used for the collection of levies, and this applies particularly to the citrus industry. Mr David Pollock, the Executive Director of the Australian Citrus Growers Federation, writes these telling words to the honourable member for Murray about the state of play in the citrus industry and the need for the changes currently before the House: The present method of collection of the citrus levy was imposed on the industry prior to the decision of the Government, announced in the May 1988 Economic Statement, to impose a cost recovery regime for industry levies. The Federation has long tained a more effective method would be to have levies collected, wherever possible, by the likes the State Boards. Our views have been fully vindicated by advice that the cost of collecting an anticipated $600,000 citrus levies per annum is about $122,000. Consider that for a moment; it is costing $122,000 to collect $600,000 in citrus indus"" try levies. He goes on to say: The cost of collection . . . would be reduced to $5,000 to (at worse, we are advised) $20,000. This dramatic fall in the cost of collecting the citrus industry levies will be' possible as a result of the changes currently proposed by the legislation. Obviously both the sition and the citrus industry are only anxious to see these changes put into place. While I am on my feet I want to make particular reference to the Australian Horticultural Corporation and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation and, to a lesser degree, the Horticultural Policy Council. The Opposition reserves its right coming to government to review the role that these industry bodies are playing. again we serve notice, as we did when the legislation to set up these bodies was introduced into the House, that we retain the right to dismantle these bodies if they prove to be little more than an ineffective bureaucmade racy. We will not frustrate them for we believe, as I said in my opening remarks, that there are great opportunities for AustraWe lian horticulture in the Asian markets, great opportunities to address part of Australia's present disastrous balance of payments cirpainted cumstanc,es by looking again to further ticultural exports. But if these bodies prove to be nothing more than an ineffective bureaucracy, we will certainly look at their role in the horticultural industry. It is obvious that there are great opportunities for horticultural exports. From one or two articles I have read recently, it is clear that what our major exporters demand of Australia's horticulturalists is that they be prepared, first, to offer a continuity of product and, secondly, to produce their product and market it in an attractive and effectively packaged way. I restate that one of the great advantages of the horticultural industry to Australian agriculture and to the Australian economy is mainthat the industry allows industrious people who may not have a large capital base to get of into business. We as a Parliament should be doing all we can to encourage industrious people without a large. capital base to get into business in the interests of the nation's economy. Obviously, every successful horticultural primary producer becomes a small businessman, a proud little capitalist, an entrepreneur enthusiastically addressing our balance of payments deficit. I commend the Bills to the House.",132
277,Mr SNOW,HORTICULTURAL EXPORT CHARGE,"1 support many of the remarks made by the Oppohonourable member for Wakefield (Mr Antoo drew). He referred to the balance of payments deficit and to the fact that it was high. He tended to say that it was this Government's balance of payments deficit; it is not, of course. Only a small portion of the deficit is due. to Federal Government debt. In fact, only a very small proportion of total governon ment debt is due to the Federal Government. Much of it is State and local government debt. Slightly less than 50 per cent is total Once government debt and of that the Federal Government probably has not more than 8 per cent of the total at the moment. The point the honourable, member has is very relevant. The National Farmers Federation has correctly pointed out that this is the main problem facing Australia. are confronted with the fact that exports need to go up and imports need to go down to help solve this problem. He has correctly the picture in horticulture. If we horcompare 1984-85 with 1986-87, we see that there has been an increase from 15 per cent to 25 per cent of the gross value of production in the contribution of horticulture to exports. In 1986-87 a total of $550m was exported, which is a very high proportion compared with other export industries. Only four or five other industries beat horticulture in that year. I am glad the honourable member for Wakefield did not try to offer protection as a solution. The image of Bert Kelly would probably appear in this House if he put that. The honourable member correctly pointed out that there are great opportunities in Asian markets, and that is true, but land degradation could kill those opportunities. A recent initiative by the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) of a three-year program aimed at combating land degradation is a very important move for horticulture. The Federal Government has earmarked $45m for.· this program to deal with a problem which has grave implications right across the primary sector and· is our most impressive environmental issue. Horticulture is a valued sector of our overall primary industry. The total value of domestic horticultural production in Australia is over $2 billion. As I said before, approximately $550m, or 25 per cent, is exported. Currently, horticultural industries are for,the most part based on the domestic market, receiving natural protection from imports because of quarantine barriers and Australia's isolation. The current situation and short term outlook for the bulk of the horticultural industry continues to be favourable, but the industry is entering a highly significant stage in its development. Producers of most agricultural commodities in Australia are only too aware that one of the few certainties in agriculture, apart from taxes, is that the future is. unpredictable. Things over which we have little control are the vagaries of the seasons and developments on overseas producing and consuming countries. We do· know though that the environment in which the industry will operate in· the future will be one of increasing competition on both the domestic and international markets. There are difficulties for the medium to long term environment in which the industry will be operating. The citrus and apple industries certainly illustrate those difficulties. In the case of citrus, the inability of. the domestic market to absorb substantially increased production means that the industry must look to exports of fresh fruit in large volume to survive and prosper. While some success has been achieved in developing export markets for citrus, a much greater effort is required over the next few years. Industry will need to devote financial and other resources to this task. Many other horticultural industries face similar challenges to those facing the citrus industries. In the case oapples, increased competition from both juice and fresh products, particularly from New Zealand as closer economic relations is progressively implemented, together with the development of quarantine protocols, will mean that the domestic market will not remain the private domain of Australian producers. A number of people in the apple and pear industry fear the relationship that we have with New Zealand. They fear some of the implications of imports from New Zealand, including the possibility of the disease fire blight. I understand that this is a disease which does not exist in Australia and which is a real problem in New Zealand and would certainly be a problem if it came to Australia. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) made it clear yesterday when he answered a question from the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron) and said that fire blight was not transported by the export of apples. He said that substantial scientific and research investigation has shown that fire blight will not come with the import of apples; it would come with the import of plants. I certainly agree with the honourable member for Maranoa that we have to be very careful. We have to watch and closely monitor imports from countries such as New Zealand. It is imperative that horticultural· industries improve efficiencies in both production and marketing and that they develop a commitment to export through marketing through the development of quality produce and through a commitment to sustain long term production for export. In the early 1970s Australia was second only to South Africa as a Southern Hemisphere exporter of fresh, fruit and vegetables, particularly. apples and pears. Since that time our market share has been eroded, most notably by South Africa and Chile, but New Zealand, whose population equals only 20 per cent of that of Australia, has also been exporting significantly more than Australia in recent years. As the domestic horticultural industries come under increasing pressure in domestic markets from international competition they will have to look to world markets. Exports can absorb product displaced by imports and any increased production which otherwise would depress local prices. A commitment to exports is a commitment to improved efficiency and a commitment to meet competitors on all markets. Australia is part of the world market. Those industries which do not meet the challenge of exporting are doomed to stagnate or even contract in the face of increasing competition on the domestic market. I congratulate the horticultural industry on the increase that we have seen in the last four or five years. We need to increase exports or decrease production. The choice is clear and all horticultural growers must recognise these facts. For its part, the Government has shown its readiness to assist the industry to expand exports. The industry needs to develop medium to long term strategies to achieve a sustained increase in exports. Now is an appropriate time to tackle some problems which the industry has with Government policies and decisions. I am pleased to support the legislation we have 'before us. The decision by the Government to recover the cost of collecting industry levies has generated a great deal of heat, with protests being lodged by industry. However, it has also generated much action in terms of reviewing the revenue collection arrangements. As a result, action has been taken or is in train which will substantially reduce the cost of collecting levies, including regulations to allow small levy payers to make annual rather than monthly payments. The amendments will provide for new levy arrangements for such industries as the nursery industry and open the way to further reducing levy collection costs by the use of State authorities as levy collection agents. The use of State authorities has particular application to the citrus industry, where it is planned that State citrus boards will collect citrus levies. I should also mention that the Government has put in place appropriate institutional arrangements to assist the horticultural industry to adjust to the more competitive and challenging international marketplace. Hence, the performance of the corporations which have been mentioned by the honourable member for Wakefield-the Australian Horticultural Corporation, the Horticultural Research Development Corporation and the Horticultural Policy Council-will be watched. The Government certainly welcomes the Opposition's determination to watch, as the Government wants to watch, how those corporations and the Policy Council operate. It is extremely important. We need to do that. We need to listen to industry views on their operation and take full account of them. We also need to understand and adopt a cooperative approach on quarantine policies. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) plays an important role in negotiating with foreign governments to overcome quarantine barriers. Some people are sceptical as to whether the Service serves the industry well by protecting producers from the introduction of exotic pests and diseases. It is a service well performed in difficult circumstances. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has given a commitment that AQIS will approach its overseas counterparts to seek agreement to the service being available during the bilateral quarantine discussions, so those points are particularly important. The Government is concerned to ensure that the right policies are in place to provide a climate conducive to growth, particularly in exports, unfettered by unnecessary regulation .or protection. I know that this is where we can have arguments with horticultural industries, but I know also that they agree with and appreciate the point made not only by the Government but also by organisations such as the National Farmers Federation and sections of the Opposition that we cannot afford to go along the road of heavy protection. This will be necessary to ensure the industries' survival as they come under pressure from increasing production and competition in all markets. A challenge lies ahead. The industries are fortunate in having a short time to develop appropriate policies and a long term export market development strategy to ensure their continued well-being and growth. I am confident that they and their leaders will meet that challenge and succeed, in partnership with the Government. I am pleased to support the legislation.",134
278,Mr IAN CAMERON,HORTICULTURAL EXPORT CHARGE,"Maranoa) (9.53)I have much pleasure in supporting the Horticultural Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, the Horticultural Levy Amendment Bill 1989 and the Horticultural Export Charge Amendment Bill 1989, which are being debated cognately. Before I start to get into the depths of horticulture and the debate involved, I would remind the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) of the nation's current debt structure, which is a very important subject. I am fascinated to kriow how he comes up with the calculation that the Commonwealth owes only 8 per cent of our total debt, when we have a figure in the annual Budget of $8 billion in interest. It does not take an expert in banking to work out that, even given an average rate of 10 per cent on borrowings, the Commonwealth owes at least $80 billion. How on earth the honourable member comes up with a measly 8 per cent of our total borrowings is beyond my imagination. Mr Snow-;- What is the total, including the private sector?",137
279,Mr IAN CAMERON,HORTICULTURAL EXPORT CHARGE,"I am not worried about the private sector. I did not think the Commonwealth was in the business of paying the private sector interest bill. The fact is that the interest bill for taxpayers in this country from the Commonwealth, out of this Parliament, is between $8 .billion and $10 billion. It is one of the biggest items in our yearly Budget. That is the sort of interest we are paying on the money that this Parliament has borrowed to continue to finance this Government. The proceedings of this chamber are being broadcast tonight and I think it needs to be made clear to the nation that the Opposition is not going to cop this nonsense from the Australian Labor Party about the small debt structure that it is meant to have put us in. This nation is in a calamitous position. We are flat out paying our interest bills, let alone being in a position to borrow any more money. Horticulture is very important to the electorate of Maranoa. Stanthorpe is a very lovely area at the eastern end of my electorate. Apples, pears and citrus fruits have been grown there for many years. There has been a great expansion of the industry in this area since the First World War. Many people settled in that area on small farms. Through sweat and tears these farms have been developed into profitable businesses. Glenn Best is a leader in the industry. We met recently with a group of people in that area who were very concerned about the introduction of fire blight, which has been mentioned here tonight. I question the point the honourable member for Eden-Monaro raised tonight regarding this disease. New Zealand is even more isolated than Australia, yet it has fire blight. I do not know whether the Minister for AborigiQal Affairs (Mr Hand), who is at the table, knows anything about fire blight. I am sorry that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) is not here. I know that the Minister at the table has his hands full with setting up commissions to inquire into Aboriginal Affairs but I do not know how much he knows about fire blight. It is amazing how New Zealand got the disease; How did it arrive in that country? The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy says that that disease cannot come here, but how did it get to New Zealand, which is even more isolated than Australia? It is a much colder nation and these diseases do not normally flourish in colder temperatures; they usually die out. We have fruit coming into Australia illegally. In fact, 248 double trays of nashi pears came in illegally from New Zealand. The Minister admitted this in an answer to a question I put to him on this matter yesterday. I referred to the fact that the fruit has come in illegally and that it has been distributed up and down the east coast of this nation. Departmental officers are running around madly trying to trace all the boxes. They are still 100 boxes short. The Minister has the audacity to say that fire blight will not bear in this fruit. The disease is bacterial and if it gets into the fruit trees it will kill them. It is as simple as that. It could wipe out the apple, pear and citrus fruit industry in Australia overnight. The effect. would be as devastating as foot and mouth disease. We know that the growers of this country are not keen on importing apples and pears from New Zealand, and I support their concerns. I do not see any point in bringing in fruit from New Zealand that may be contaminated. It is better that we do not allow any fruit imports at all. I am fully behind the growers of Stanthorpe, in my electorate. I know that departmental officers have been negotiating under the free trade arrangements that Doug Anthony, the famous former leader of the National Party of Australia, signed some years ago. I know that the great white leader, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke); re-signed the agreement about 18 months ago when World Expo 88 was on. I was rather amazed when I turned my television set on one night to find the Prime Minister signing the agreement with Mr Lange. I thought that was strange. When I first came into the Parliament one of the first things of interest I did was watch Doug Anthony sign the agreement with the New Zealand Prime Minister of the time. I cannot remember who it was. Most of the Australian Labor Party's policies just get recycled, repackaged and sent out. The sad thing is that most Australians believe the rhetoric this Government tries to sell them. I hope that will change at the next election. The sooner that comes around the better, because we will win it. The original Horticultural Levy Act is costing the Commonwealth hundreds of thousands of dollars. That would be a normal amount for the imposition of these levies. Obviously it is cheaper to have the State and local governm-nts collect these levies. I support the proposal that these charges be picked up at the point of production. For a change, we might save some money. The Commonwealth is not all that clever at doing a lot of these things. It is good that the States, in conjunction with industry, are prepared to impose these levies. The Bill transfers this, responsibility from Commonwealth to the States. The Horticultural Levy Amendment Bill increases the levy to a maximum of 5 per cent. The old levy was set at a maximum of 2 per cent. These days, with inflation running somewhere between 8 and 10 per cent with the Labor Government in office"" the trend is for the Government to impose the maximum levy. Otherwise, it would have to change legislation every six months to keep up with inflation. I guess the 5 per cent levy will probably apply for a few years to come. I think it is up to the industry to fix the levy each year, or at least the percentage it will charge. Some of the money is used for research. The Government contributes dollar for dollar with the .industry across a range of research, as it ought to do. In the last two or three years the Government has made massive cuts in funding to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. We have seen a repackaged Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). One day he is a greenie; the next day he is a scientist. God knows what he will be tomorrow; maybe a shearer or, getting back to reality, a union official again. Mr Nehl-He never stopped being that.",137
280,Mr IAN CAMERON,HORTICULTURAL EXPORT CHARGE,"That is right. Every time he makes a statement it is .about some new package deal. He made one the other day, with Minister Jones. He has become a revamped, born again scientist because Barry's been crying. Hawke does a fair bit of crying. Bimy did a bit of crying, jumped up and down and said he was going to resign. """,138

282,Mr IAN C,HORTICULTURAL EXPORT CHARGE,"MERON-I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Prime Minister does a bit of crying and the poor Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones)-Mr Hand- Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. We have had an around the world. version of what is happening, with little regard to the legislation before the House. Like others, I am interested to learn what the honourable member knows about the the issue that is before the Parliament.",138
283,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HORTICULTURAL EXPORT CHARGE,Order! There is no point of order.,138
284,Mr IAN CAMERON,HORTICULTURAL EXPORT CHARGE,"I am pleased to hear that the Minister has been listening; at least he helps me concentrate. He obviously has great expectations about what I might say next. I am not an expert on growing apples and pears. But a lot of growers in my electorate are very concerned that the Government is allowing illegal imports of apples and pears covered with the disease fire blight. This disease can spread across the east coast and up and down this nation and wipe out these industries overnight. That concerns me and it ought to concern the Minister. The legislation provides for contributions to major research, which I go along with. I just mention that the Prime Minister, a born again scientist, along with the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, has just""iannounced a revamped package of born again scientific discoveries that are about to be made. There is meant to be more money available. I am told that there is not; it come from some other fund. Even so, we support the drive towards more research because, if we are to get ourselves out of the balance of payments hole that the Government has put us into, we have to look continually at developing the markets in South East Asia. There is enormous growth in the demand for horticultural products that can be shipped, mainly on aircraft. Small attractive packages can be sent to rapidly expan<;fing markets in South East Asia and China. China is freeing up its markets; the Chinese are now marching up and down Red Square or whatever it is called. Mr Tim Fischer-Tiananmen Square.",138
285,Mr IAN CAMERON,HORTICULTURAL EXPORT CHARGE,"Yes. They want democracy. Democracy is not a bad idea. In Question Time today the Prime Minister was not prepared to support that concept. He never mentioned it. A good question was asked of him, but he was not prepared to mention the fact that he supported democracy in China. The Prime Minister is a good old socialist from way back. He learnt those tricks when he was a union leader. But markets are opening up. Even good old socialist Russia is becoming more or less a free enter, prise society and the people have marched there in support of freedom.",139

287,Mr IAN CAMERON,HORTICULTURAL EXPORT CHARGE,"You would be surprised, Mr Deputy Speaker.",139
288,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HORTICULTURAL EXPORT CHARGE,"I will be, but not for long. The honourable member had better get back to the Bill.",139
289,Mr IAN CAMERON,HORTICULTURAL EXPORT CHARGE,"You would be surprised at the sorts of opportunities that are opening up in that part of the world for horticultural products. I can assure you that every jet that comes here loaded with tourists flies back half empty. Those jets could be filled up with containers of fruit and other horticultural products: cut flowersyou name it. There is a tremendous opening for those products to get us out of our balance of payments situation. Apparently, even Nobby Clark, the Chairman of the National Australia Bank, tells us that we will face a $2 billion deficit this month, to be anis to nounced at the beginning of next month. That is the horrific position we are in. We are here to encourage exports, and eVery little bit helps. In the past, .we have not exported these products in large quantities, but there has been a rapid expansion in the last few years. As the member for Maranoa, the member representing this growth industry around the Stanthorpe area, I do all I can to help. There is also an export charge, of course-nothing happens for nothing. This charge, too, has a maximum of five per cent. The fact that I am prepared to support this legislation is known. The· Opposition supports the three cognate Bills fully. I only hope that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has been listening. I wish that he were in the House today.",139
290,Mrs KELLY,HORTICULTURAL EXPORT CHARGE,I am listening.,139
291,Mr IAN CAMERON,HORTICULTURAL EXPORT CHARGE,"I wish that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy were listening. I hope that he will make a great effort to wipe out the dreaded disease of fire blight. . Mr COURTICE (Hinkler) (10.07)-These Bills will provide for participation. in the Australian Horticultural Corporation (AHC) and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation (HRDC) by the nursery industry and the blueberry industry. As well, they will provide more cost effective levy and export charge collection arrangements for the citrus industry, which is already participating in the corporations. I should like to compliment the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), both of whom mentioned the need for, and the potential of, exports. This industry is all about expanding our potential for exports, particularly to nations such as SingflPore, Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea. The contribution from the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron) was entertaining, but it sounded more like a preselection speech than a contribution to the debate on a Bill. I understand that he has preselection problems. The number crunchers are after his blood. Mr Sciacca-He, is not a bad bloke. ,",139
292,Mr COURTICE,HORTICULTURAL EXPORT CHARGE,"He is not a bad bloke, but that does not help ,him in the Natiqnal Party in Qu.eensland. The towns of Gayndah and Mundubbera in the Burnett district of my electorate are important citrus growing areas. They are not only important in the context of Queensland; but also they are the leading citrus growing areas of Australia. Last year, the Mundubbera factory received a large Federal grant to assist with juice extraction. This, of course, adds value to the industry and creates job opportunities in our area. Mr Sciacca-We always look after the farmers.",140
293,Mr COURTICE,HORTICULTURAL EXPORT CHARGE,"We most 'definitely do, as the member for Bowman says. Of course, he too has a large horticultural industry in his area. Mr Nehl-He would not know a farmer if he fell over one. . ,",140
294,Mr COURTICE,HORTICULTURAL EXPORT CHARGE,"He certainly does. The in famous Redlands area is in his electorate. That was once the leading area in Queenstural land for horticulture, although it has now been surpassed by my area of Hinkler-in particular, Bundaberg. During the picking season, many hundreds of people are given the prospect of employment. These Bills, in enabling State authorities to collect horticultural levies on behalf the Commonwealth, will aid this ihdustry. They will address the citrus industry's cerns with a less costly mechanism for lecting levies and charges. I congratulate industry on being a founding participant in the AHC. The Corporation was· established to assist all horticultural industries to velop export marketing and research efforts. Every honourable member who has spoken tonight has commented on the need to excado pand our export potential, and I compliment all of them on that. The Corporation advises the Minister on policy matters relative to the horticultural sector. Participation is voluntary, and the industries can join on a formal or an informal basis. Formal participation is through a statutory levy and informal participation is through fee for service voluntary contributions. Establishment of the corporations is assisted by provision by the Federal Government over five years of $S.8Sm for the AHC and $1.2Sm for the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation. In the longer term,the AHC is to be funded fully by way of industry levies and fees for service, and that is as it should be. The funding of the HRDC will be on a SO:SO basis between industry and the government but with the government contribution b-ing limited to the ceiling figure of O.S per cent of gross value of production as applied for other primary industry research agencies. The horticulture industry as a whole is very important within my Federal division. Not only is it of huge importance in the Burnett region but it is <;If massive importance in the Bundaberg and Isis district. Of course, Bundaberg is now the leading producer of tomatoes in Australia, one of the most famous in the world, and we have the opportunity to value add to that with technology and technological research. That is the way in which this Government is leading agriculture. The horticultural industry has given these districts the diversity in agriculproduction which so many other areas find elusive. The industry now is comparable in my area with the sugar industry and is providing employment for thousands of people. It has proven to be self-reliant and full of enterprising people. Representatives conducted an outstanding of display at World Expo 88 and have conducted an Austrade seminar to make their conmembers fully aware of exports. Through colthe Department of Primary Industries and the. Energy, a Federal grant has been made for the conduct of further seminars to highlight export' potential. I encourage the horticuldeture sector in Bundaberg to look at its own best interests and see how it lines up with the AHC. Bundaberg has a successful avoand cut flower industry. I understand that the avocado, potato and cut flower industries Australia-wide are having discussions about participation. I urge them to become involved because we, as a nation, want as many industries as possible to join. The horticultural industry faces .many challenges. In my own area, there are enormous capital costs in setting up in the industry. As with any other agricultural endeavour, we are subject to the vagaries of weather. The abnormal recent wet season in my area has resulted in . crop losses. No matter how efficient our farmers are-1 believe that in my area the majority are outstanding-because they have large acreages on which to carry out their tasks on fertile land, they still have to market their product, often under disadvantageous conditions. This is wl1ere the ARC can playa positive role. It is no use producers growing and presenting a product for export simply because we in Australia like it that way. The Managing Director of the Australian Horticultural Corporation, Mr David Goodman, claimed that Australia had a .poor reputation as a marketer. He said quality had to be improved, supply had to be reliable and continuous, and presentation, packaging and service· had to be enhanced. The Australian Horticultural Corporation .is attempting to change the industry from being produce driven to being market driven. In essence, the market should indicate what it wants our fanners to grow rather than farmers simply growing a product and then hunting around for a market. The other problem we face is with the waterfront. Australia, according to Mr. Goodman, .uses liner shipping which delays arrival times. As a result, Australian produce can take up to 70 days to reach the United Kingdom. New Zealand uses charter. s-ip­ ping and its produce can reach the Uhlted Kingdom in 35 days. The .lesson is quite clear. We can no longer have a. number of small suppliers 'doing their own thing. Exporters need to get together to supply the volumes. needed to justify using charter shipping. The Corporation, I believe, can be the vehicle for helping that process to get under way. Before concluding, I cite an example of innovation that another nation has used. The Taiwan sugar company, faced with a small land· mass and encroaching urban industrial development, sent its experimenters in the plant breeding of sugar cane to Holland to learn tissue culturing. Since then Taiwan has become the largest exporter of tulips in the world and is now exporting tissue. cultured orchids to Japan. If Taiwan· can do it, we can do it. I believe we could beat everyone if we put our minds to it, if we were united. I believe that these Bills, put forward byt-e Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), are a positive approach and will do just that. I commend the Bills to the House. .  I rise to support this package of legislationthe Horticultural Legislation Amendment Bill, the Horticultural Levy Amendment Bill and the Horticultural Export Charge Amendment Bill. The Bills do three things. They pr(;>vide for participation by the nursery industry, and others such as the blueberry industry, in the Australian Horticultural Corporation (AHC) and the Horticultural· Research and Development Corporation. They also provide for more effective levy and export charge collection arrangements for the citrus industry, which is extremely important to the Sunraysia area in Q1Y electorate which is already participating in these two c-rporations. The Bills also provide for an increase in the maximum rate of the levy and export charge. I remind the House that the··Horticultural Legislation Amendmen.t Bill has been prepared at the specific r.equest of the indus-ry to provide foralternabve means of collect-ng . levies on horticultural products. We remmd the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) that when the AHC was first developed, the means of levy collection were inefficient and amendments would be needed., I am pleased that we are now amending the legislation. I think it is important to look at the· background of the Horticultural Corporation. When it was established in 1987 it had just two members-the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation and the citrus industry. At that time reaction to the package of financial incentives offered by the Government was mixed and until now it had not been embraced by any additional horticultural industries, despite an open invitation for them to join and financial incentives from the Commonwealth Government, such as dollar for dollar funding for these industries to join horticultural r-earch and development program. At the time, the Government, and for particularly the Minister, could not underThe stand why all our horticultural industries. not readily undertake to participate in this Corporation. I simply point out, as I pointed out then, that a very large number of our horticultural industries, particularly the tralian dried fruit industry, which is a major part of my electorate and also that of my colleague the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) have an excellent industry and marketing structure. In some ways an industry such as the dried fruit industry must be regarded as a miracle industry, as it able to operate under Australia's high cost structure, yet is still able to compete world markets with low cost countries such as Turkey and Greece. Of course, it is able to do this because of its efficiency of tion and quality of product. While some industries wanted to join the Corporation at the time it was set method and cost of collecting levies under the present legislation made it uneconomical or impossible for them to join because levies and charges were paid to the Comthat monwealth on behalf of the producer by the first purchaser, selling agent or exporting agent. Some of these products have many purchasers, as we know. To overcome this tration costs. problem the Government has now decided to introduce a system whereby a levy. is paid at the point of purchase or on certain prescribed inputs that are necessary for the of these products. The Commonwealth will now also be able to enter into agreement with the States so that levies and charges can be collected by State bodies and transferred to the Federal Government. These Bills also provide for an increase the maximum rate of the levy and export charge in line with other similar Bills have passed through this House. Because of ants-in jobs. the very rapid rate of inflation that this country suffers, our research allocations now insufficient to meet the demands of the industries. It is to the credit of so many our rural industries that they have for many years made very significant contributions research in their own industries. It is a shame that so many of our manufacturers and secery ondary industries have not made the same the sort of levy contributions to research. These new provisions have opened the way other industries. to join the corporations. first two to ask for legislation to allow did them to participate are the nursery industry, which wants to join the Horticultural Corporation and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation, and the blueberry Ausindustry, which wishes to join the Horticultural Corporation. These changes-they are significant to me-will also .benefit the citrus industry by allowing a more cost-effective levy and export charge collection arrangement. The citrus industry advises me that the present method of collection of the citrus is levy was imposed on the industry prior to the Government's decision announced in the on May 1988 economic statement that it would charge the industry what it cost to collect the industry levies. The Citrus Industry Fedproduceration has long maintained that a more efficient method would have to be used to collect the levy wherever possible by bodies up, the such as the State boards. I cite again the figures used by my colleague the honourable member for Wakefield the (Mr Andrew) this evening. He pointed out the cost of collecting an anticipated $600,000 citrus levy this year is expected to be $122,000. In other words, almost a fifth of the levy collected is taken up in adminisMr Nehl-Too much.  sale We can see how much it is when we note that collecting the same levy through State boards or agents would bring down the cost from $122,000 to between $5,000 and $20,000. Therefore, the change in this new legislation will greatly assist growers by putin ting the collection of the levies on a more equitable basis and will keep growers-prithat mary producers rather than public servI acknowledge how important it is that are the nursery industry has now joined these corporations. We all recognise the groundof swell of effort and skill that has been put into our nursery industry, particularly in the to maintenance and reclaiming of so many of our degradable lands. This input by the nursindustry will ensure that sustainable agriculture in ,this country is maintained and that horticulture, which plays such a very important part in this nation's economy, continues. I acknowledge the public profile that now exists regarding the issue of sustainabie agriculture. This legislation in its own small way will play a part. I understand that the nursery industry has already reached an agreement with pot man-' ufacturers. Their levy will be collected at that point. Other industries may prefer to pay their levy when they buy the trays they pack their fruit on. I believe that this lation is flexible enough for each individual horticultural industry and that levy· collectioncosts should no longer prevent the industry from joining the Australian Horticultural Corporation and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation where industry funds attract Commonwealth money on a dollar for dollar basis. The National Party supports this legislation. I draw attention to some of the statements made by our Minister for Primary Industries and Energy over recent weeks, particularly regarding the wheat debate and the views of National Party members. National Party members do no more than sUpport the producers, the people who create the wealth, who produce the sorts of products that ensure that this nation keeps its head above water, despite the massive debt that has been built up overseas by this Government in an endeavour to maintain a consumer-led economy and a standard of living that is simply not supportable by this country- Our electorates are not impressed by the farce and the theatre that sometimes take place in this Parliament. There will be grave economic and social consequences for this nation if more incentive and encouragement are not given to our exporting industries to produce the income that is so vital to our future.

NA (ELECTRICITY) BILL 1989 Second Reading Debate resumed from 23 May, on motion  That the Bill be now read a second time. DrEWSON (Wentworth) (10.28)-I am delIghted to have the opportunity to lead the Opposition's contribution .to. the. debate on the Northern Territory (Electricity) Bill 1989, one of my particular areas of interest. The purpose of this Bill is to obtain the approval of the Parliament for the payment of $40m to the Northern Territory to continue the' Commonwealth's . assistance for electricity operations for 1989-90 in the Northern Territory. We do not oppose the Bill, although' I will make a number of comments on it. As a background to this Bill, arrangements were 'commenced in 1985-86 to provide for an annual indexed payment of $40m until 1988-89. The assistance was to terminate in 1988-89. A lower amount was paid in 1986-87 because of reduced oil prices and budgetary considerations. The amount provided for 1988-89 was $50.9m. It was always envisaged that the electricity assistance to the Northern Territory would be terminated after this financial year. However, it became evident, following an assessment by a working party of Commonwealth and the Northern Territory Treasury officers set up following the 1988 Premiers Conference.' that discontinuation of the electricity subsidy would be an important element in subjecting the Territory to a greater burden of restraint than had been imposed on the States. S.o consideration was given to the significant fiscal disability that would exist in the case of the Northern Territory. It was concluded that this was. basically due to the fact that this year the electricity subsidy made up about 5 per cent of the payments to the Northern Territory. As was reported in the second reading speech of the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assist referred to representations on this matter made by those representing the Northern Territory in both Houses of Parliament, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) had agreed that Territorians should be shielded from massive electricity price rises. As I understand it electricity charges in the Northern Territory are already among the highest, if not the highest, in Australia. The Government made no provision for . electricity assi-tance after 1988-89 in the Forward Estimates that were released in November last year. In this sense it could be argued that this is an example of the Government making Forward Estimates look better than was' justified, given that there was probably a reasonable expectation-given that a working party was in progress following complaints made at the 1988 Premiers Conference-that Northern Territory electricity assistance would continue after 198889. Apparently, similar circumstances exist in the Forward Estimates in relation to the treatment of various forms of industry assistance. I· will come back to that point in a moment. Although this is not dealt .with in the Northern Territory Grant (Electricity) Bill, the Minister's second reading speech outlined a - ew timetable for phasing out electricity aSSistance to the Northern Territory. It is intended that the grant will be reduced to $30m in 1990-91; to $20m in 1992; and to $1Om in 1992-93. The grant will be discontinued now in 1993-94 rather than this year. Grants for these years will be provided under the normal Appropriation Bills in the relevant years. In addition to these payments in relation to Northern Territory electricity, the Government has decided to waive from 1 July 1989 the Northern Territory's electricity debt to the Commonwealth, which has a net present value of about $31.9m. This will relieve the Territory of scheduled repayments of principal and payments of interest to the cash value of about $6.4m for each .of the next nine years. The Northern Territory will also be able to continue to submit requests to the Treasurer for special additions to its global borrowing limits to fund the remaining electricity operating deficits of the power and water authorities. I wish to make two comments. Firstly, a reasonably generous package seems to have been put together in the name of significant fiscal disability for the sake of the Northern Territory. But to me, waiving the debt and sustaining the assistance for three or foul' years seems reasonably generous. I imagine that it has nothing. to do with the fact that we are probably in an election year but I will put that to one side. Mr Snowdon-How cynical!",143
297,Dr HEWSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY GRANT,"My colleague the honourable member for the Northern Territory agrees. with me that that would not be true.' Secondly, I go back to the comment I made about the Forward Estimates and I just put on the record one more time my total and continuing dissatisfaction with the treasurer's inability to supply any reasonable Forward Estimates of government expenditure. The ones released in November' 1988 were based on the most fictitious set of assumptions that I have seen in many years. They followed a year in which the Forward Estimates were really off the mark as well as far as forecasts were concerned. We saw as recently as earlier today that the Treasurer is never prepared to put his forecasts on the record any more. So we are left with absolutely no idea of where this country is in terms of the state of the Treasurer's assessment of this country, and where it might be going in terms of the Forward Estimates of Government expenditure. This is a ludicrous situation. It just gers me that against that background and given the Treasurer's continuing. capacity to move the goalposts-my friend, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) would understand the football analogy of moving the goalposts up to halfway all the time'-I am very suspicious when I see Forward Estimates fiddled around with. It seems to be the case in this instance that the Forward Estimates were probably knowingly m-de to look an awful lot better than they shOuld look. Against that background, we ,will not be opposing the Bill.",145
298,Mr SNOWDON,NORTHERN TERRITORY GRANT,"I am .sure that the Opposition's Treasury spokesman, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), is pleased that he has now allowed me 25 minutes to speak on this matter, Opposition members-No!",145
299,Mr SNOWDON,NORTHERN TERRITORY GRANT,"And here I was thinking that I was in luck! I welcome the opportunity to speak in support of the Northern Territory Grant (Electricity) Bill. Quite clearly, it is extremely important to the residents of the Northern Territory. The deal that has been strl,lck for the Northern Territory is significantly generous or, to use the words of the shadow Treasurer, 'reasonably generous'. The need for this subsidy should not be underestimated. The Northern Territory needs special assistance. It has a small revenue base and a high cost of capital infrastructure and these, together with a fluctuating population which until recently was in decline, mean that industry development is a very expensive process in' the Northern Territory. Electricity costs are an essential part of the costs in any industrial development and are basic to the living costs of individual Territorians. It is worth pointing out that the Commonwealth has always subsidised electricity costs in the Northern Territory. On our gaining self-government in 1978, the Commonwealth agreed to a subsidy based on the, difference between the actual operating costs of the Northern Territory Electricity Commission and revenue based on the average north Queensland tariff. This is when the coal-fired power station at Stokes Hill wharf was in operation. The Northern Territory.Government incurred a debt of over $50m at the stagtime of self-government when it bought the Stokes Hill power station from the Commonwealth. The subsidy that the Commonwealth has granted in successive years, and indeed in this year as a result of last week's Premiers Conference, is conditional on the Northern Territory Government agreeing to investigate the means of providing cheaper electricity to Northern Territory residents. In 1984, feasibility studies were commissioned into establishing a new gas-fired plant, and the new Channel Island power station just outside Darwin got under way. The Commonwealth provided a capital grant of 40 per cent of the cost of Channel Island and agreed to provide recurrent grants from 1985-86 to 1988-89. As the honourable member for Wentworth accurately and correctly pointed out, this grant was to expire this year. It is worth noting, however, the amount of money that the Commonwealth has, provided in support of, initially, the Northern Territory Electricity Commission and, more lately, the Northern Territory Power and Water Authority isince recurrent and capital grants were first made for that purpose. If I may, I will cover the period from 1985-86 tq 1988-89. During that period, the total amount paid in recurrent and capital grants to the Northern Territory Electricity ,Commission was $228,299,000, which is quite a significant amount of support and an accurate recogni-' tion of the special needs of the Northern Territory community. ,It is clear that the Commonwealth has provided, significant assistance, which I Wholeheartedly support, to the Northern Territory for over a' decade. I am happy to say to the honourable member' for Wentworth,:who alluded to the fact that this might be an election year, that the commitment we have' received from the Commonwealth Government' has been an ongoing one; it is not one just made this financial year. Indeed, as he rightly pointed out, the ,package that WliS announced last week commits another $100m to the Power and Water Authority and relieves the Northern Territory Government of it $6.4ni. debt in interest payments 'over 'nine years' for a' total of $57.6m. So in addition to the $228m or thereabouts which has been made available since 1985-86, $157.6m will be made available by the Commonwealth in support of Northern Territory electricity costs. - lectricity prices at the moment,even the subsidy, are higher in the Territory than anywhere else in mainland Australia and Tasmania. This fact hasqeen a topic for debate in the Territory fora number of years. One of the main Country-Liberal Party (CLP) election promises in 1987 was that would produce a real and substantial. reducHe tion in the cost of power to Territorians. Unfortunately, despite the continuation of this subsidy, so rightly provided by the monwealth",145
300,Mrs KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY GRANT,Due to the effectiveness of the local member.,146
301,Mr SNOWDON,NORTHERN TERRITORY GRANT,"Of cours-. I will come of to the effectiveness of the local member moment. As the Minister rightly says, the fact that we have been able to get these continuing subsidies is a result, as acknowledged by the Minister Assisting the Treas speech, of the work done since the 1987 election of my colleague in the Senate, Senator Collins, and me. We have been well received by senior Ministers,including the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). We have been able to put the, case for the Northern Territory clearly and succinctly. We have been assisted in that process by the officer to officer relationshiJ? between Treasury officials from the Northeni Territory and from the Commonwealth. I return to the promises made by the CLP politicians ,in the Northern Territory to reduce power charges. Instead of decreasing power charges, we have seen those politiciansdisplay, a confused approach to a strategic energy plan for the Territory. That is unfortunate because it gives different messages to - ifferent sections of the community, and most importantly the business cqmmunity. One Minister is on record as saying that the Territory is about taking gambles, taking big risks, ar:td spending lots of money. We have already had a succesSion of claims about reduced electricity costs, but we have seen that these Northern Territory Ministers, who are so fond of making such pronouncements and promises, are unable to deliver. The attempt last year to put a power line through Kakadu National Park is a case in point.' The' Northern Territory is arguing that it would reduce' electricity costs,- by linking with Jabiru and Ranger into the Channel Island system- It' then condemned the Federal Government when approval was withheld. That was done for quite sound environmental reasons. Yet at that stage the Northern Territory Minister concerned had no commitment it from Ranger to use Channel Island power. seemed to be floating the idea that they could produce cheap power and reduce the costs without getting any agreement with the Compeople to whom he was going to give the power and thereby reduce the costs. In June 1988 the same man announced that power costs would fall by half within two years because of the introduction of one or more eight projects under consideration by the in a Northern Territory Power and: Water Authority. In the Northern Territory News on 12 June 1988 there was an announcement that power costs were to fall by half. Of course, this has not happened. These stories are almost apocryphal as Northern. Territory Government Ministers try to assuage the concern of their electorate in terms of their poor administration of the Territory economy. Nevertheless, in the context of this subsidy which is being provided to the Northern Territory Government, and which will expire after a period of time, I would like to congratulate the Government and thank the Minister for being aware of the concerns of the Northern Territory. Indeed, I want to thank the shadow Treasurer for supporting this legislation. It is important that we recognise that places like the Northern Territory have unique features which require special assistance. I would like to think that the need for that special assistance is recognised by both sides of the House. I thank the Minister responsible for putting this legislation through. Mr TIM FISCHER. (Farrer) (10.44)-1 reaffirm that the Opposition is not opposed to the Northern Territory Grant (Electricity) Bill, and therefore this Bill will pass through this House within the next three minutes .. I draw the attention of the House and the nation to the fact that this is the twenty-sixth Bill to be dealt with by this House in two days. Clearly it is an example of sausage machine legislation production of tl1eworst kind which comes at the e.nd of a session. Thilt, frankly, is simply not good enough if Parliament is to do its job and give proper consideration. to legislation. Hence, we had to have drafting .error amendments to. the previous package. This is part of the chaotic log jam of legislation, partly brought on by the Senate; nevertheless, it is the responsibility of the Government. It has demanded that 26 Bills. pass through this House of· Representatives in two days. No one can say that that is giving. proper consideration to· some quite ,complex legislation, notwithstanding the fact that we have finally reached the end of the second day after sitting until 2 o'clock this morning in accordance with the guillotine schedule. I hope that the Government will moved forthwith. do better if its puts the House through these machinations, should it have the opportunity to do so, at the end of the Budget session. MrPETER MORRIS (Shortland-Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (10.46)-in replyI would like to thank the honourable members who have participated in the debate. I particularly commend the honourable member .for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) and Senator Collins in another place for the very positive role they have played in bringing the Government to the decision it has made in respect of the Northern ,Territory Grant (Electricity) Bill. I would like to say to the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) that his remarks are the height of hypocrisy. This House is being denied the opportunity to provide the time it would like for debate by the decisions of the honourable member's colleagues in the· National Party of Australia and the Liberal Party of Australia ill' the other place. They have effectively gagged this House by setting a deadline for the receipt of legislation from this House. That deadline has to be met; otherwise the legislation will not be dealt with by the Senate.. The Government does not like that;· the Government. does not want it; the Governl11ent does not have any say in it. But we will not under any circumstances accept criticism from members of the Liberal Party or the National Party about· the deadline and the guillotine that has applied to legislation over the last two days and which, I understand, will be applied tomorrow. This arrangeme.nt has been forced upon the Government, by the honourable member's colleagues. It is a pity that he did not make the remarks he has just made in his own party room. He could .. have prevented the gag having to be applied. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Govenior-General recommending appropriation announced.

Gliders: Tow Pilots Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 28 February 1989: (I) Is it proposed to change the Operations Reguhitions which apply to gliders in Australia. (2) Are new requirements proposed For Tow Pilot endorsements. (3) What Fee does the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) propose to charge For the issue of a tow permit. (4) What procedures will the CAA Follow beFore issuing a tow permit.",152
306,Mrs KELLY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. Civil Aviation Order 95.4, which specifies the manner in which gliders may be operated has been extensively reviewed in consultation with the Gliding Federation of Australia (GFA). A new issue of the Order will become effective by mid-1989. The Order will require that gliders be operated in accordance with procedures and standards contained in the GFA's Operational Regulations, as approved by the Civil Aviation Authority. (2) The requirements for the issue of Tow Pilot permits were reviewed in consultation with the GFA in 1987/88 and new requirements were put in place in March 1988. (3) The present fee is $10, but at a recent meeting with industry it was advised that the fee would be $15 as from I July 1989. (4) An applicant for a towing permit must have at least a restricted Private Pilot Licence and have successfully completed a training course approved by the Authority. The training and flight testing of applicants for the issue of glider towing permits is carried out by experienced glider towing pilots who have been approved by the Civil Aviation Authority for that purpose. On receipt of an application endorsed by an approved pilot the Authority will issue a glider towing permit. The CAA procedures are detailed in.a Flying Operations Instruction promulgated in March 1988 and made available to the Gliding Federation of Australia. Commercial Pilots: Flight Tests (Question No. 1537) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, upon notice, On 28 February 1989: (I) What is the cost of having a commercial pilot licence initial flight test conducted at Bendigo. (2) If such a test is required does the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) provide a quote for the cost to provide the service; if so, (a) how is that quote costed and (b) what are the components of that cost. (3) Did the CAA quote $851.81 to conduct a (Question No. 1536) commercial pilot flight test at Bendigo, if so, how was that total. cost composed. (4) What would be the cost of having this test conducted at Mildura.",153
307,Mrs KELLY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to thehonourab1e member's question is as follows: (I) There is no fixed charge for a commercial pilot licence flight test at Bendigo. The policy of the Civil Aviation Authority is that flight tests can be arranged at set times at designated test centres for a scheduled fee of $90. A pilot who wishes to have a service provided at another time and place is given a quote for the additional cost of providing that service to his speci-cations. (2) On receipt of an application a quote would be provided detailing the additional costs which the Authority would incur in providing the service. The costs would typically include the standard $90 test fee, the salary of the Examiner for travelling time, a flying training component in respect of the Examiner, and travel and accommodation expenses if necessary. (3) Yes. In that case the costs involved were: Salaries and related costs of staff performing service-$505 Fares and travelling allowance-$254.80 Other costs-$92 (4) $90. Mildura is a designated test centre. International Conventions, Treaties and Agreements (Question No. 1553) Mr Hollis asked the' Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 1 March 1989: Which international conventions, treaties and agreements have been implemented by federal legislation since the Minister for Foreign Affairs answered question No. 3910 (Hansard. 16 September 1986, page 640.).",153

Brown asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 4 April 1989: (I) Has Australia protested to the Government of Romania over the abuse of the human rights of people living in . the part of Romania known as Transylvania as most recently demonstrated by the destruction of villages and churches; if so (a) when was this protest made, (b) what form did it take and (c) has there been any action taken following the protest. (2) Is the conduct of Romania referred to in part (I) in breach of any international covenant relating to human rights. .",155
310,Mr DUFFY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) Australia has on several occasions protested to the Government of Romania over abuses of human rights, including in' Transylvania, and over the policy known as Systematisation which involves the destruction of villages, particularly affecting Romania's ethnic Hungarian minority. Representations expressing Australia's concern about Systematisation have been made on the following occasions: 18 August 1988, by the Australian Embassy in Belgrade which is accredited to Romania 31 August 1988, by the Australian Ambassador, to the Romanian Deputy Foreign Minister 24 and 25 October 1988, by the outgoing Australian Ambassador, to the Romanian Foreign Minister, Mr Totu, and the Deputy Foreign Minister respectively 13 March 1989, by the incoming - ew Australian Ambassador, to the Qeputy Foreign Minister Australia also co-sponsored a resolution on the human rights situation in Romania at the recently concluded 45th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights. An Australian statement at that meeting included an expression of concern at human rights abuses in Romania. Since these protests, and many similar expressions of concern by other governments, implementation of the policy of Systematisation has slowed and little further destruction of villages has taken place in the Transylvania region. Systematisation remains official Romanian policy, however, and villages· elsewhere in Romania have been destroyed. (2) A number of Romanian Government policies and practices, including aspects of the Systematisation policy, are .clearly in violation of international covenants relating to human rights, for example Articles 12 and 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Article IS'of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Such practices are, moreover, contrary to provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Trade with South Africa and Zimbabwe (Question No. 1736) Mr Cobb asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 6 April 1989: Is the Minister able to provide broad details concerning the total amount of trade between (a) Australia and South Africa and (b) Australia arid Zimbabwe:",155
311,Mr DUFFY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: In 1988 Australia's exports to South Africa totalled $134.3 million. The principal commodities were aluminium and aluminium alloys, power generating machinery and live animals. Our imports from South Africa totalled $89 million and were comprised largely of silver and platinum, iron and steel, paper products, and textile yarns. Australia's exports to Zimbabwe in 1988 totalled $9.67 million. The principal commodities were wheat, animal oils and fats, and machinery and transport equipment. Our imports from Zimbabwe totalled $9.97 million, of which tobacco, and structures and parts of iron, steel and aluminium, were the main commodities. Civil Aviation Authority: Complaints (Question No. 1767) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, upon . notice, on 13 April 1989: Has she received complaints from the den Brinker family of Websters Road, Clarkefield, Vic.; if so, (a) what was their substance and (b) what response was provided by the Civil Aviation Authority.",156
312,Mrs KELLY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: ' Yes. (a) The substance of the den Brinker family's complaints relates to aircraft operations in the vicinity of the their home and their dissatisfaction ,with the efforts of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to resolve the matter. The den Brinker family has expressed these concerns to the Ombudsman. As a result of this approach, an investigation was carried out by the Ombudsman's office which subsequently concluded that the actions of the CAA in this matter were reasonable. However, the den Brinker family was dissatisfied with this finding and requested a review of the matter. This was agreed to and Dr R Bell, the Deputy Ombudsman, is personaily conducting a fully review of the matter; (b) The den Brinker family has been advised that no, further action can be taken until the outcome of Dr Bell's review is known.

Aboriginal Development Commission (Questi\ln No. 1456) Mr Miles asked the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 21 December 1988: What action did he 'anticipate the Aboriginal Development Commission c-uld take to avoid an Abo"" riginal enterprise foundering when he wrote to the Commission on 20 October 1988 concerning the situiltion of Middar. Mr Hand-The answer to the honourable member's'question is as follows: I wrote to the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) on 20,October 1988 asking the ADC for its, further views on developments which had occurred to that date. I also pointed out that any decision made was a matter for the ADC. (Question No. 1464) Mr Macphee asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 28 February 1989: (I) Did he, at the launch of the ALP's 1987 election campaign, promise that his, Government would eliminate child poverty by 1990; if so, what were his exact words.

(7) Do the changes in the Government's indices of child poverty and of the level at which it is not necessary for children to live in poverty take into account effects of inflation. Expenditure' , Projected",156
313,Mr HAWKE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honour1987-88 1988-89 able member's question is as follows: ' ' $ (I) In my 1987 Election Speech I made the state$ 1,500,000 ment: 500,000 'For our next term, we are setting achievable new goals for Australia's future in the world. 1,500,000 And at the head of these goals is the future of all our children. 250,000 4,534,500 So we set ourselves this first goal: By 1990 no Australian child will be living in poverty.' In supporting material accompanying the policy speech I gave details of Labor's planned improvements to income support for low income families, pledging in that context ""that by 1990 no child will need to live in poverty"". ' (2) I have not subsequently modified those statements. I have, however, expanded upon them on a number of occasions. For instance, I said on 8 June 1988 that Labor's aim is for the young to be decently sustained and to have full and equal opportunity for their total development. ' (3) There is no definitive index of child poverty, nor has there been in the past. Government agencies hav,e for some time used ABS elata, particularly household expenditure and income distribution survey data, to measure trends in family income and expenditllre. The Department of Social Security also monitors research on the costs of children in Australia. The H,enderson poverty line, developed in the late Child, Pov-rty 1960s, is one of the better known indices of poverty levels. Henderson poverty line data is monitored by Government agencies but is not regarded as a reliable and accurate index of those in poverty. For example: the lines are arbitrarily based on' the 1966 Melbourne basic wage plus child endowment for a couple with two children rather than a measure of the actual minimum needs of families and individuals; and the lines use equivalence scales based on relativities of expenditure of families in New York in 1954. (4) Relevant data on the number of children living in families in various income brackets are not yet available for 1987 or 1988. However, reflecting the introduction of Family Allowance Supplement in December 1987, the number of families receiving additional pension for children, additional benefit for children and Family Allowance Supplement (or its predecessor, Family Income Supplement) increased from 551,200 in July 1987 to 1,126,500 at the most recent dates for which data is available (JanuaryApril 1989). The number of children in respect of whom such payments are made increased from 451,000 to 818,600 over the same, period. (5) The Government has expressed its child poverty commitment in terms of the achievement and maintenance of benchmarks of adequacy' of total child payments (ieFamily Allowance and Family Allowance Supplement). The benchmarks are set relative to the combined married rate of pension and are 15 per cent for children under 13 and 20 per cent for 13 to 15 year olds. The benchmarks were developed after thorough consideration by the Department of Social Security of available information on the costs of children in Australi!! and in· comparable countries overseas. Research by the Social Security Review on the costs of children in Australia and comparable overseas countries involved the review of nearly 30 research studies of equivalence scales. (6) Following pecember 1988 increases in the Family Allowance Supplement and Additional Pension/Benefit, relativities in total child payments are 14.1 per cent of the combined married rate of pension for children aged under 13 years and 17.5 per cent for children' ,aged 13 years to 15 years. This compares to 11.9 per cent in June 1987, before the Family package was introduced. From July 1989, Family Allowance will be increased to $9 a week for each of the first three children and to $12 a week for each subsequent child. The rate of Family Allowance Supplement for children aged 13 to 15 years will be increased to $34.10 a week from July 1989. These increases will result in relativities in total child payments of 15.3 per cent for children aged under 13 years and 20 per cent for children aged 13 years to 15 years. In other words, the benchmarks will have been achieved six months ahead of'schedule. (7) Setting the benchmarks as a proportion of the combined married rate of pension, which is indexed according to changes in the CPI, ensures that the benchmarks take account of the effects of inflation. In the Economic Statement, April 1989, the Government announced that Family Allowances will be indexed each January for movements in the CPI and that the rates of Family Allowance Supplement will be adjusted annually to ensure that the benchmarks of adequacy set down in (5) are maintained over time.

(3), Has her attention been drawn to concerns expressed by Ansett and Australian Airlines that it costs $1 m to have their Boeing 737-300 aircraft certificated to Australian standards; if so, are these costs reasonable: (4) Why is it not' possible for Hazelton Aviation to obtain a certificate for a Beech 1900. (5) What modifications were required for that aircraft. (6) Are there over 100 examples of this aircraft flying commercially in the US. (7) Is she able to say ',\'hy this aircraft able to the US aviationauthoritie's' but not to the CAA.",157
314,Mrs KELLY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) No. (2) No. (3) I am aware of this claim. The direct cost of certification was $39,936, mainly being the salaries and expenses of the lIirworthiness inspection team. I understand that Boeing has ,stated that indirect costs of $651,342 were also incurred but the company was unable to provide a complete and detailed breakdown of this figure and the claim could not therefore be verified. The total cost of certification is very small as a proportion of the total aircraft cost and is completely reasonable given the legislative requirements and aims of the aircraft certification process. (4) It would be possible for Hazelton Aviiltion, or any other operator, to obtain a Certificate of Airworthiness by making a Beech 1900 aircraft and its documentation available for inspection, and completing the other application process requirements .. The First of Type certification proces's for the Beech 1900 should be completed shortly and a Type Certificate will be issued to the manufacturer. Any Beech 1900 which meets the specifications y.:ill then be able to obtain a Certificate of Airworthiness. '(5) The following modifications' were required for the Beech 1900: (a) Twin tab actuator dual drive (b) Dual stall warning system (c) Emergency lighting '(d) Pilot heat annunciators (e) Engine fire warning-silenceable warning and fault, annunciator (f) Accident recording equipment (g) Windscreen reinforcing. (6) The CAA does not have information on the number and types of aircraft flying commercially in the, US. It is understood that there are 107 commuter aircraft of thi- type in service around the world. (7) The aircraft is acceptable to the CAA when incorporating the modifications required. These modifications enable the aircraft to meet the standard for aircraft designed to small llircraft standards but operating in the weight, range of transport category aircraft with regular fare-paying passengers. Many of these modifications are also required by other overseas aviation regulatory authorities. Christmas Gifts Campaign (Question No. 1496) Mr Scholes asked the Minister representis accepting the Minister for Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 28 February 1989: (I) Has his attention been drawn to a television campaign by Westfield to have customers purchase an extra item in their st,Ores and donate it to provide Christmas gifts to those in need. (2) As many thousands of Australians would have responded to this worthwhile objective, will he make inquiries to ensure that the stores involved also donate all profits from the sales to assit those in need.",159
315,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Consumer Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's questions: (I) Yes. The campaign involved Westfield Shoppingtowns sponsoring the Salvation Army Christmas food AppeaI'in l!lte1988. Consumers were encouraged to buy extra food at supermarkets' and deposit it in bins provided at all Westfield Shoppingtowns. The bins were cleared by the Salvation Army and the food distributed to families in need. (2) A campaign of this kind is vol\lntary in nature, and the extent of sponsorship or of contri,butions by consumers are not matters which, on the available information, I believe warrant further inquiry. I understand that the Salvation Army was extremely grateful to Westfield for organising the appeal as it provided a valu,able supplement to their limited resourCI;S, and was of great benefit to families in need. Westfield went to some effort and expense to promote the appeal and I am not aware they derived any direct monetary reward from the event. There was no obligation upon consumers to buy food at 'supermarkets within Westfield Shoppingtowns. Westfield own the shopping centres not the individual supermarkets, and it seems severfll major food retailers each donated 1000 cans of food to the appeal. Senior Executive Service (Question No. 1514) Mr Reith asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 28 February 1989: (I) Will the Minister identify each Senior Executive Service or equivalent position within the Minister's department or authorities responsible to him which has been reclassified since I July 1988 and to' which the occupant has been reappointed, indicating in each case (a) result,ant increases in salary and other entitlements and (b) whether or not the reappointment followed normal selection procedures. ' (2) On what,basis is it claimed that the reclassifications conform with the national wage fixing principles. (3) How many Senior Executive Service or eq,uivalent positions are there within the Minister's portfolio. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: ' (I) Assistant Secretary Senior Executive Service Level 2 Overseas Students Programs Branch Position Number 12291 (a) Increase ,in salary-$5055 , Increase in other entitlements-NIL (b) Reappointment followed process (2) The reclassification conformed with the national wage fixing principles in that' it was considered that there was a change in the nature of work which constituted such a significant net addition to work requirements as to warrant reclassification of the position. (3) 72 Legal Proceedings of Mr Koowarta (Question No. 1571) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, 2 March 1989: Further to the answer to question No. 98 (Hansard, 18 February 1988, page 318), what is the, present position of the proceedings which ' Mr Koowarta has taken following the successful proceedings he took under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 in the High Court in the case of Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen. Mr Hand-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Futher to my answer to question No. 98 (Hansard, 18 February 1988), Mr Koowarta's claim for damages in the Supreme Court of Queensland remains extant. It seems that the matter has progressed very slowly. There were problems in finalising the costs which were awa'rded to Mr Koowarta by the High Court. Following resolution of the costs issue, an order for production of documents was sought and obtained by Mr Koowarta against the Crown in the right of the State of Queensland (the Crown), production having been resisted on grounds of Crown Privilege. ,After examination of the documents, Mr Koowarta's legal representatives sought 'to have the 'matter set down for trial. The Crown, however, refused to agree. It now appears that it will be necessary for Mr Koowarta to seek an order of the Court that the matter be set down for trial. Australian Industry: Development Corporation (Question No. 1633) ' Mr Campbell asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, upon notice, on 6 March 1989: (I) What sum does the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) have invested in shopping centres or other sorts of building developments. (2) What proportion comprises (a) equity and (b) loan finance. (3) What percentage of the AIDC's lending does normal selection this investment constitute. (4) How many of the projects to which the AIDC has loaned money have any involvement with Mr W. Anderson, a developer from New South Wales. Mr Barry Jones-The ,answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) AIDC operates in' a competitive mar\<et environment and bases its Investment decisions on commercial principles. As such, it adheres to confidentiality conditions expected of a financial corporation acting in accordance with sound business practices. ConsequlintlyI do not have precise details as to what amount AIDC has invested in building developments. However, AIDe's ,annual reports for 1987 and 1988 indicate that it has provided loans and equity, and has arninged, syndicated and participated in funding packages for a number of building developments. These include the: Fairmont Resort at Leuni NSW where AIDe: is a partner in the $55 million development.' The 1988 annual report shows that AIDC has a 27 percent interest in the resort. Becton Group of Companies, AIDC has' provided a loan to the group for the cOnstruction of a - ommercial building in Melbourne. 120 Collins Street Project, AIDC is co-lead manager and arranger for the $305 million construction finance for the project. Merifield Cooksey Holdings Pty Ltd, AIDC provided a loan to the company to support its expansion of its regional shoppingcerttre developments in Western Australia. Kims Toowoon Bay Pty Ltd, AIDC has provided finance to help complete the final stage of rebuilding this holiday resort on the NSW Central Coast. (2) Again on grounds of confidentiality it would not be appropriate for me to provide details of 'the breakdown between equity and loan financing by AIDC for building developments. (3) AIDC's 1988 annual report indicates that during the year ,ended, 30 June 1988 new financing commitments of $132.9 million, were made for Construction/Property activities ,and '$48.5 million for Tourist Facilities and Accommodation activities. This represents 23.'5 percent and 8.6 percent respectively of ' total new commitments of $563.8 million made during t,hat year. (4) It is similarly not appropriate for me to comment on whether AIDC has had any involvement with Mr W. Anderson. Civil Aviation Authority (Question No. 1673) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for'Telecommunications and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 4 April 1989: Have the officers of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) been issued with commemorative medallions and key rings; if so, (a) will she allow me to see these items, (b) what was the cost of producing them, (c) where were they prodl,l(;ed, (d) who designed them, (e) if all medallions and key rings have not been distributed, how many remain in stock and (f) is it proposed that ,the cost of produ'cing these items be recovered from the industry. ' Mrs KelIy...c..:. The anSwer to the honourable' member's questi0!l is as follows:' Inaugural staff members of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) were supplied, with key:rings to mark the establishment of the, CAA. However, the CAA have nO'record of a commemorative medallioo being issued. (a) Arrangements have been made to supply a sample key ring to the honourable ll1ember. (b) The cost of producing the 7000 key rings was $20,755. ' (c) & (d) The key rings were designed and produced in Sydney, by Burnie Advertising. (e) The CAA believes,that all stocks have been distributed to staff. (f) All costs of the ,CAA are recovered from its customers (except those costs in the areas under Government contract). The key rings were issued as part of a program' to encourage employees to identify with the newly established CAA. The key rings' have a negligible impact on CAA charges. Gladstone Airport (Question No. 1677) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, upon . notice, on 4 April 1989: (I) Has the Goverri-ent imdertaken to provide funding for improvements to Gladstone Airport rurt"" way; if - o, what sum. (2) Is she able to say w-ether the Member, for Hinkler has been informed that the Commonwealth would assist the Gladstone/Calli'dpe Aerodrome Board with the extension and widening of the runway at Gladstone Airport; if so, (a) how and (b) when, was, the Member given that advice. (3) Has the Government's position changed; if so, (a) how has it changed and (b) what'was the reason for the change. (4) Has she discussed the matter with the Member for Hinkier; if so, when.",160
316,Mrs KELLY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question' is as follows: (I) No. (2) My predecessor wrote to the' Member for Hinkler on 22 December 1988 informing him that the Government did consider Commonwealth funding of the cost ($185,000) of completed upgrading works at Gladstone in the 1988 Budget context, but that, budget circumstances were such that the Government was unable to accede to the provision of  the Member for Hinkler that the'proposal would be included in consultations with the aviation industry seeking agreement on cost recovery measures associated with development works proposed for Commonwealth funding under the Aerodrome Local Ownership Plan. If a suitable cost recovery arrangement could be reached, a proposal for reimbursement of the cost of the completed works would be submitted for consideration by the Government in the 1989 Budget context. The airline concerned has indicated its agreement to the proposal which has been submitted for consideration in the 1989 Budget. (3) The Government's position has 'not changed on the funding of the upgrading works at Gladstone. (4) I have not discussed the matter with the Member for Hinkler and I am not aware that my predecessor did. (Question No. 1702) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister representing the Minister for Consumer Affairs, upon notic-, OQ 4 A.pril 1989: (I) Has the National Health and Medical Research Council recommended the addition of thiamine to fortified wine. (2) Is there to be a new food standard relating to the use of thiamine in beer and fortified wine. (3) Will the use of thiamine in beer and fortified wine be compUlsory.",161
317,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Consumer Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) Yes. The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) at the 104th Session of Council in NQvember 1987 recommended that appropriate standards be developed for the addition of th.i-mine to beer, .fortified wines and cask and flagon wmes.' , The matter was referred to the Australian Food Standards Committee (AFSC) for their consideration: At their October 1988 meeting the AFSC unanimously rejected the proposal on there was insufficient scientific evidence to justify the m-ndatory fortification of alcoholic beverages. (2) The AFSC has been directed by the Public Health Committee of the NHMRC to develop appropriate standards to require the addition of thiamine to the above products. This matter has been placed on the. agenda for its meeting to be held on 18-19 May 1989. (3) Should the standard being developed by the AFSC be ehdorsed by the National Food Standards Council, the addition of thiamine to beer and fortified wine would become compulsory under State and Territory food law. Sale of Hercules Aircraft (Question No. 1580) Mr Fife asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 1 March 1989: ' (I) Has the sale of all twelve C 130A Hercules Aircraft, which were the subject of a Four, Corners program in the latter half of 1987, been completed; if so, what was the total sum received for the aircraft. (2) What is the state of the investigatioris by the Australian Federal Police into the refurbishment and operation of one 'of the Hercules used for aid work in Ethiopia in 1986 and the alleged theft of aircraft spare parts from the Commonwealth. (3) Why has the investigation taken so ICing and when is it expected to be concluded. (4) Will he present to the House the result of the Thiamine investigation or ensure that the findings 'are made public in some other way.",162
318,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: , (I) The Minister for Administrative Services has advised that of the twelve C130A Hercules aircraft acquired by the RAAF only eleven were declared I for disposal and one of these was subsequently resumed by the RAAF. Sale of the remaining ten aircraft was completed on 3 March 1989. The Commonwealth received $10.072 million for the aircraft and the stock of spare parts peculiar to the model. ' (2) and (3) I am advised, by the Australian Federal Police that the investigation has been an extremely complex one requiring the interviewing of many ,witnesses as well as the detailed examination of copious quantities of documents. I am further advised that the AFp recently arres.ted two of the alleged principals in, the case who have been charged with numerous counts of defrauding the Commonwealth. Documents seized from the houses of those arrested are currently being examined. The investi, gation will be, completed when all avenues of enquiry have been, pursued,' (4) I expect that the findings of the police investhe grounds that tigation will be made public in an appropriate way. How that is done, will, of course,depend upon the outcome of the investigation., At,tendant 'Care· Scheme (Question No. 1697) Mr Braithwaite ask-d the Minister for Community Services and Health, upon notice, on 4 April 1989: (I) How many applications for the Attendant Care Scheme which were lodged, (a) by State. and (b) in total, with his Department (i) in 1987-88 and (ii) from I July to 31 December 1988 were (A) approved and (B) not approved and why. (2) Will the Minister extend eligibility for the Scheme beyond those who are discharging from approved nursing homes.",162
319,Dr BLEWETT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's questio ll is as follows: (I) The following tables show applic-tions for the Attendant Care Scheme by State and in total (parts (a) and (b» and the 'breakdown of those approved and not approved (parts (A) and (B» at 28 February 1989. Table I sho-s total app,lications received by, State and by the success of the application. Table 2 sh.ows the reasons for"" - he 244 unsuccessful applications. Of the remaining 248 successfl!l applicants at 28 February 1989, 183 people were fully approved participants and 65 were in the process of being assessed for the Scheme.

Australian Capital Territory Total Cumulative figures to the 'end of February' 1989 1987.;88 and I July to 31 December 1988 are not available organised'to show cumulative data only. (2) The current eligibility criteria already includes people who are'long-term patients in hospital. After 35 days stay in hospital, most patients are reclassified as 'nursing home-type' patients by the hospital and if they have no other permanent living are eligible to apply for the Scheme. Eligibility for the Scheme is therefore not striclly confined to only those being discharged from nursing homes. , A broad review Of the operation of the Sche'me proposed and will be complete by the end of this year. This will consider eligibility issues and the management of the, Scheme beyond this financial year. Any major extension or variation of the bility criteria beyond the current target await the outcome of the review and further consultation with interested groups. (Question No. 1719)",163

321,Mr HOLDING,APPLICATIONS ATTENDANT CARE SCHEME,"The Minister for Imm,igration, Local Govermnerit and Ethnic Affairs eligihas provided the following answer to the group must honourable member's question: (I) The Government offers for sale various books, manuals and handbooks' relating, to Australian imImmigration migration policy, procedures and administration. It also offers for sale an ""Application,Jor migrato Australia package"" at a price of $5, or its equivalent. The package contains six pamphlets, an explanatory booklet of 14 pages and the approved application form of 27 pages, three subsidiary forms of nine pages and country-specific information material. The sale of the package was promoted by the considerable cost of translating where relevant, printing and distributing the package to domestic and overseas offices, and by the heavy demand for and known waste of material previously provided free of charge. For example, of about every five applications taken in the UK when they were free, only one was used as an application. In light of that experience, the Department is able to provide free of charge a Preliminary Enquiry Form of four pages to help inquirers determine whether there is value in continuing to pursue their inquiry. In law, there is no current obligation on any client to use the Department's application form. Provided that submitted forms are substantially the same as the approved forms they will be accepted, if not welcomed. Other forms (and many information publications) offered by the Department are free of charge. To control known waste, the Department currently regulates their supply by, for example, requiring clients to approach the counter for forms. Because the resulting queues impose a real cost on clients, and because of the cost of this method of supply to the taxpayer, the Department is investigating other means to regulate supply (such as that used by its counterpart Department in the Federal Republic of Germany which provides access to forms from a selfaccess machine). (2) The question goes beyond the responsibilites of my portfolio. Use of Special Purpose Aircraft (Question No. 1769)  ence, upon notice, on 13 April 1989: Did he grant approval during 1986-87 for special purpose aircraft· to be made available to persons other than those defined as entitled persons; if so, (a) on what occasions, (b) to whom, (c) for what purposes and (d) what was the cost.",163
