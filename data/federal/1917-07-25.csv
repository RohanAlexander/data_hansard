2,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH RAILWAYS,"I wish to know from the Minister representing the Minister foT Defence the reason for storing millions of yards of khaki cloth in the Exhibition Building, Melbourne. Oould not this cloth be made into uniforms, and used to keep our men warm at the Front, or here?",4
3,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH RAILWAYS,"A lot of material, which has been stoTed in drill halls, and has thns prevented the use of those halls for their proper purposes, is being transferred, so that the Department may have it all in one place. So much of the cloth as is required is being used in the manner the honourable member suggests. - Mr FBHTON - Why should any cloth be ' stored fOT the moths to eat ?",4
4,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH RAILWAYS,"No cloth is so stored, but reasonable stocks must be kept to enable supplies to be furnished regularly. PREJUDICE OE RECROTTIN'G .",4
5,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH RAILWAYS,"H as the Prime Minister noticed the report of a recent meeting of the Trades H all Council, where a resolution was passed, calling on members of Parliament uot to assist in the recruiting campaign ? If the Government considers that this is an interference with recruiting, what action does it propose to take?",5
6,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH RAILWAYS,"I saw the report referred to, and shall ask the Secretary to the Trades-Hall to say whether it is accu-rate. Having received his reply, the Government will consider what action should be taken. CASE OFMR . YATES .",5
7,Dr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH RAILWAYS,"A Mr Yates, the father of ten children of whom five volunteered for active service, two of these having paid the supreme sacrifice of their lives, has been dismissed from the Public Service, unfairly, perhaps, in the opinion of some. I a3k the Minister for Home and Territories if his attention 'has been .drawn to the case, and if so, if he will tell the House what is the present position?",5
8,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH RAILWAYS,My attention has been drawn to the case by the honourable member and by other members. I have a copy of a letter  was sent to me.,5
9,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH RAILWAYS,"The letters which I have seen are one from Mr Smith, who writes on behalf of the Australian Clerical Association, and - one from Mr . Yates, himself, neither of which can be regarded as offensive. ' There may be other letters, but I have not received them. Mr . Yates was employed in the Census Bureau as a temporary hand from 4th October to 8th December, 1915, and in the Meteorological Branch from 9th December, 1915, to 23rd June, 1917. On the 22nd or 23rd June last, Mr Membrey, a member of the State Ministry, informed me that - it was intended to dispense with Mr Yates' services, and told me that Mr Yates had sent four sons to the war, two of whom had died in the service of their country, and asked me to give some consideration to the case. My reply was that I should be only too pleased to do what was asked if it were in my power, and the facts justified it , and I immediately, communicated with the Public Service Commissioner, within whose discretion the further employment of Mr Yates rested. It is the rule of the Service that a man may not be employed as a temporary hand for more than six months, with an additional period of three months in special cases; but in this case the Commissioner, - under ' a more liberal practice since the war, allowed . a total temporary employment, of twenty and a half months. In March . last the Commissioner was asked by Mr . H u n t , of the Meteorological' Department, to give further consideration to Mr Yates, who was regarded by the Department as deserving of such treatment, and the Commissioner extended his employment for another three months, on the understanding, I believe, that at the end of the time he would have to give priority to a returned soldier, in conformity with a decision by the Cabinet. The day on which the extension expired, an opportunity for appointing a returned soldier presented itself, a member' of the Australian Imperial Force, who had been 573 days at the Front and 734 days under arms, being in waiting. It is difficult to discriminate in these cases -' *",5
10,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH RAILWAYS,Was he a single man ?,5
11,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH RAILWAYS,"I am not sure. However, he had been waiting for the appointment, and he was appointed in order to fulfil a promise that had been made. I have tried to ascertain whether there is any possible means of placing Mr Yates. WOOL CLIP . MINISTERI AL STATEMENT-PAPER .",5
12,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH RAILWAYS,Can the Prime M i nister tell us when the transactions in regard to the past wool clip are likely to be fin-ally wound up?,5
13,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH RAILWAYS,"I am unable to supply the honourable member with the information, but as I propose to lay on the table a return covering the whole mattei I ask for leave to make a short, statement which will cover several points of interest to graziers. . Leave granted.",5
14,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH RAILWAYS,"The papers which I have the honour to lay on the table are the "" B r it is h Imperial Government's purchase of the Australian wool clip 1916-17 through the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia,"" together with a copy of the "" Basis of Clean Cost Prices for Australian Wool Clip, 1916-17, and Sheepskin Limits on Basis of Clean Cost Prices, Season 1916-17."" The points to which I wish to draw attention are of considerable importance to those engaged in the pastoral industry and to the community generally. The number of bales of wool appraised under the Imperial Government's purchase amount to- Bales. Butts. Bags.' Greasy 082,376 8,682 119,413 Scoured 145,012 187 801 The average appraised price per lb. of greasy wool is 14.72d. In order to give honourable members some idea of the labour involved in this work, I may mention that there have been made nearly 300,000 separate and independent valuations of wool classified into 381 types. The average price of 14.72d. per l b . for the greasy wool is eminently satisfactory, and proves for all practical purposes the correctness of the basis. The average price on all wool, greasy and scoured calculated as greasy, appraised under the scheme is 14.15d. per lb. The difference between this price and that ' at which it was sold, viz., 15£d. per lb., is equal to 9.5 per cent, of the average appraised price of 14.15d. per lb. sequently there is every probability of the total dividends approximating 10 per cent, of appraised prices. The actual quantity of wool sold to the Imperial Government is 376,166,159 lbs., which, at 15|d. per lb. of greasy wool, is equal to £24,294,064 8s. 8d., less a credit of £25,937 9s. 4d. due to slightly higher-grade wools having been selected by Commonwealth manufacturers. The total value of the wool controlled and brought under the scheme* amounts to £25,340,540 18s. 7d. Wool credits for wool appraised to the 30th June, 1917, are as follow:-From the Imperial Government on account of wool, £23,167,479 3s.; handling charges, £893,170 17s.; Australian manufacturers, £979,058 14s. 2d.; exchange, £45,643 5s.; interest, £40,388 2s. I d . ; total, £25,125,640 Is. 3d. The 10 per cent, retention money deducted from the appraised valuation, amounting to £2,313,460 17s. 2d., will be Season distributed in all capitals by the woolselling houses on the 14th August next. The first dividend will be paid on the 2nd October. That will be in addition to the 10 per cent, retention money. Ib is impossible to say how much the dividend will amount to. It will range between 5 per cent, and 10 per cent., but should be nearer 10 per cenb. Several months must elapse, however, before another dividend can be declared. It will be impossible for some considerable time Lbs.' to give even an approximate estimate of the final dividend, on account of the Imperial Government's purchase of 323,748,370 Australian wool forming part of the clip 34,310.645 for the season 1916-17. I wish to emphasize this paragraphWool-growers are advised to keep all documents in connection with their wool submitted for appraisement for the 1916-17 season. Sales of interests in the wool pool will not ""be allowed under anv circumstances, nor will speculations in wool be permitted. The figures I have quoted are nob final. Some slight adjustments will doubtless be necessary, bub they cannob materially affect the result. The appraisements conducted upon the 1916-17 wool clip have, on the whole, proved satisfactory; but in the case of the 1917-18 clip modifications will be made in order to remove slight inconsistencies. During the coming wool season every effort will be made by the Central Wool Committee to improve the Con- general organization for the display and appraisement of wool in all centres with the object of reducing the heavy tasks imposed on appraisers particularly in the busy months of the year, and also to establish uniform methods in connection with the preparation of wool catalogues, invoices, counter marks, and other details of importance in the marketing of wools. Instructions have been received from the Army Contracts Wool Committee, London, that it is absolutely imperative for growers to understand that in the case of the 1917-18 clip station brands must be on the sides only of wool bales, and station marking must be made in black colour, the ends of the bales being reserved for special countermarking in red for shipment. Certain persons interested in the wool trade are under the impression that they are entitled to participate in the appraisers' commission, although they are not gazetted as appraisers; and another section imagines that - work must be found for every one engaged in the wool business prior to the Imperial Government's - purchase. These ideas are incorrect. Services performed are recognised and' paid for, an'd it has been the policy of the Central Wool Committee to employ only sufficient technical and skilled labour to carry out the necessary operations. Prom th© experience gained in the appraisement of the 1916-17 clip, the Cent r a l Wool Committee are satisfied that many economies can be effected to the betterment of the wool industry. W it h regard to fellmongering and scouring, it may be noted that these in dustries have been carefully protected, and that all well-equipped works throughout the Commonwealth have been full y engaged. At present the scouring and - fellmongering capacity in certain centres is far below requirements, and much larger quantities of wool would be earmarked for local scouring if the plants were available. I trust that those who desire to find employment for our people will note there is a profitable opportunity here for the investment of Australian capital. It is very evident that.the Australian wool industry, as at present conducted, is far from being well organized, particularly as regards fellmongering, scouring, carbonizing and wool tops, and woollen manufacture. If the maximum value of the wool is to be obtained by growers it is necessary that attention should be paid to those subsidiary industries. I should like to tender to the Central Wool Committee the Government's ciation of the many and valuable services it has rendered to the Commonwealth a purely honorary capacity; to say that for the first time in its history the pastoral industry is being placed on an organized basis. Its business is now conducted cheaper than it ever haa been, and it will be generally that when the war has passed the industry will go back with very great reluctance to the conditions that existed. To the members of the Committee I desire to express our sense of keen appreciation of their services, and' to tender them thanks on behalf of the Government and the community. Mr Eughes. members-of whom there are now some 100 persons-of the State Wool Committees, Sheep Section Sub-Committees, Trustees for Appraisers' Commission, and Technical Advisory Board, have also given their services in an honorary capacity. To these our thanks are tendered. I trust this example of work on behalf of the State, and the business-like way in which that work has been carried on, will commend itself generally to the body politic. I have pleasure in laying these papers on the table of the House and in movingThat so much of the papers as can be printed be printed.' Mr TUDOR, (Y a r r a ) [ 3 . 2 4 ] - I do not desire to avail myself of the opportunity which this motion affords to make a speech on the subject dealt with by the Prime Minister. Since the papers are to be printed, we shall have an opportunity to read them with in the next few days. I should like, however, to repeat a suggestion that I put before the House on more than one occasion when I was sitting in the Opposition corner, and that is that three or four copies of any i m portant type-written document read by a Minister should always be prepared and. made available to honourable members. In that way, those, who are specially interested in such statements would be able to follow them without difficulty. To illustrate the necessity for the adoption of such a course, I would point out that when reading the type-written statement, the Prime Minister quoted certain figures without making it clear to the House whether they related to value or weight, and that this might lead to some confusion on the part of those who were not familiar with the subject. Having regard appreto what the right honourable gentleman has said, I think that this work has been in done well, but I prefer to have an opporI venture tunity to read the papers relating to it before I express any definite opinion upon the subject.

15,Mr HUGHES,IMPORTATION OP AMERICA N,"I had an interview this morning in regard to the question of* Australian apples, and although I have always been an apple eater, I may say that since 11 o'clock today, I have known a good deal more about the f r u it than I ever knew before. The question raised by the honourable member has been considered. We have now arrived at an agreement as between the Australian grower and the importer; we know now when the market will be empty of Australian apples. When it is empty of Australian apples, and we know to what extent it will absorb American apples, without disturbing the prospects of Australian apples, American apples will be allowed in .

27,Mr GLYNN,ALLOTMENTS,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low : 1. Up to the present provision for residential allotments has not been made, but the matter was under consideration. The extent of the necessity has, however, been affected by the reduction of the Estimates, and by consequence of persons likely to require such allotments. 2.

WAR - TI ME PROFITS TAX ASSESSMENT BILL . SECOND READING . .",10
39,Sir JOHN FORREST,ALLOTMENTS,"Swan-Trea surer) [3.48] - I move-s That this Bill be now read a second time. As honourable - members are aware, this a war-time profits Bill , not a War Profits Bill . It is a measure based, not upon profits made from the war, but upon profits made during the war-eve n those per cent. increased profits which have not necessarily resulted from the war itself. A war-time profits tax was first imposed by the Britisli Government by the Finance Act No. 2 of 1915. It applied to profits shown in all accounts made up after 4th August, 1914. The tax imposed for the first year was 50 per cent, of the amount - by which those profits .exceeded the pre-war standard of profits, the pre-war standard being tihe greater of the follow(Queensland), ing sums:-(a ) The average profits of the best two out of the last three pre-war (Victrade years, or (b) 6 per cent, (in the case of a company) or 7 per cent, (in other businesses). The last pre-war trade year is similar to that fixed under the Bill now before the House, in clause 15 The revenue collected from this tax in the first year of assessment - was approximately £86,000,000. The Finance Act No. 3 of 1916 increased the rate of 6th tax for the second year to 60 per cent., and the revenue was in the region of £140,000,000. The Finance Act 1917, passed i u March, 1917, increased the rate to 80 per cent, of the excess profits, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer estiIN - REPL Y. mated the revenue at about £200,000,000 just received for the year 1917-18. Canada was the next part of the Empire to impose a war-time profits tax. In 1916 the Canadian Parliament passed the Business Profits War Tax Act, which imposed a tax of 25 per cent, on all busiprofits exceeding 7 per cent, on the This Act applied retrospectively to all business profits arisExing in accounting periods ending after 31st December, 1914. The revenue from Adthe tax on the first taxable year's profits of was £2,500,000, while the total amount deexpected to be collected for that year was of £3,000,000. The revenue estimated for exthe three years of the currency of the Act was £5,000,000, but the estimate for the second year , alone is £4,000,000 or more. On the 18th May, 1916, the rates of tax were amended to apply to profits arising in accounting periods ending after 31st December, 1916, by providing that the tax of 25 per cent, should apply to all profits over 7 per cent, and not exceeding 15 per cent.; on the part of the profits is over 15 per cent, and not exceeding fiO per cent, the rate was increased to 50 per the cent.; and on all the part of the profits the exceeding 20 per cent, the rate was 75 Under the Canadian law a business cannot take its actual pre-war profits as the pre-war profits standard. All businesses which have made a profit of more than 7 per cent, on capital in any war time accounting period must pay tax on the excess of the profit over 7 per cent. Whilst the Canadian scheme attains simple and economical administration and a large revenue, it acts unjustly on those businesses which have not made greater profits during the war-time year, or whose profits have actually diminished owing to the war but are still in excess of 7 - per cent, on capital. The Dominion of New Zealand followed with its tax, but imposed ib by way of additional income tax. The tax is 45 per cent, of the amount by which the income assessable to income tax in the war-time accounting period exceeds the average yearly assessable income of the last three pre-war trade years, or the average yearly assessable income of any shorter pre-war business period, or 7 per cent, on the capital employed in the business, whichever is the greater. The Prench Parliament has lately passed a war-time profits tax. The latest information available shows that there are two classes of taxpayers-on e paying a tax of 50 per cent, of the net profits in excess of the pre-war standard of profits, or 10 per cent, on capital, whichever is the greater; and the other paying the same rate of tax but receiving a general exemption of £ 2 0 0 . I now come to the Bill before the House. The Bill is modelled upon the English law, but it contains many additional provisions designed to render the incidence of the tax more equitable. This Bill taxes the excess profits of all businesses of any description carried on in Australia-and Australia includes - Papua - except those which are specially exempt by section 8. Under these provisions a business which balances on, say, 31st July in each year, will pay its first tax on the excess profits arising in the accounting period ending on 31st July, 1915. business which balances on 30th June in each year will pay its first tax on the excess profits arising in the accounting period ending on 30th June, 1916. the former case the business begins to pay tax eleven months earlier than in the latter case. In order thab when the Act terminates these two businesses may be fairly treated?- clause 2 will require the Sir John Forrest. business balancing on 30th June to pay .tax on profits arising for eleven months after the former business has ceased to pay tax. This is fair, because it began to pay tax eleven months after the other business. For example, assuming that peace is declared in May, 1918, the accounting period of company "" A "" ends on 31sb Jul y in each year. The accounting period of company "" B "" ends on 30th June in each year. Company "" A "" will pav tax on profits earned in the years ending 31sb July, 1915; 31st July, 1916; 31st July, 1917; 31sb July, 1918. Company "" B "" will pay tax on profits earned in the years ending 30th June, 1916; 30th June, 1917; 30th June, 1918; 30th June, 1919. Where an 'accounting period for which the tax is to be assessed is less than a year, the amount of the pre-war standard of profits is to be proportionately reduced, so thab a comparison of profits for a similar pre-war and post-war period .will be possible. Before any business is taxed under this Bill , its war-time profits must exceed the pre-war standard of profits. When the excess is nob greater than £200, no tax will be payable. When it is greater than £200, a deduction will be allowed of £200, reduced by £ 1 for every £ 2 by which such excess is greater than £ 2 0 0 . This means that ibhe deduction of £200 disappears entirely when the war-time profits are £600 or more in excess of the pre-war standard of profits. Speaking generally,- every business will retain out of its profits an amount equal to its pre-war profits, or the statutory percentage on its capital, whichever is the greater, plus the untaxed residue of the excess profits remaining to the taxpayer. The basis of the tax is the amount by which the pro-fibs of the war-time accounting period exceed the pre-war standard of pro fits. The pre-war standard of profits is to be the actual neb profits based on the average of any two of the last, three pre-war trade years, unless those years have been years of abnormal depression, in which case any two of the preceding three A pre-war years is taken for purposes of the average for comparison with the profits of the accounting period. If these actual profits are less than 10 per cent, on the In average capital employed in the selected two pre-war years, 10 per cent, on that capital is taken as the pre-war standard of profits. Ten per cent, is considered a fair percentage standard for invesbments in Australia. In the case of new businesses ancr businesses which have only become profit earning since the war, the Bill empowers the Commissioner of Taxation to increase that percentage if it is shown that the' increase is essential to insure the financial stability of the business. If the taxpayer is dissatisfied with the decision of the Commissioner in such a case, be can appeal to a Board of Referees for a final decision. 2\Tew businesses commenced by individuals or by partnerships will receive 'a further concession in the shape of an allowance of at least £300 as salary to the individual owner, and to each of the partners, provided in each case the owner and the partners devote the whole of their time to the business. In the case of a partnership in which some of the partners cannot devote the whole of their time to the business, a deduction of a proportion of the £300 allowance is to be deducted in respect of the part of the time given to the business. In the case of new companies the Bill limits the remuneration of directors to £1,000. This provision was copied from the New Zealand Act, except that the deduction has been reduced from £1,500 to £1,000. It is a very necessary provision to prevent the absorption of profits of new companies by way of directors' fees.. Provision has been inserted in the Bill empowering the Commissioner to increase any of these allowances if special circumstances exist to justify the increase. It is considered thab these provisions amply protect new businesses, and secure equitable treatment for them. In the case of old businesses the preproper war remuneration to partners, managers, or directors is allowed by the Bill , but under clause 14 (7) the Commissioner power to increase the allowance owing any special circumstances or to the fact that the remuneration depends on the profits of the business. The tax will apply to persons earning commissions to the profits of agents of any description, not being a commercial traveller or an agent whose remuneratjon consists wholly of a fixed and definite sum.not dependent on the amount of business done or any other contingency. The Bill provides in section 2 that last profits to be taxed are those arising up to the end of the accounting period tions ending after 30th June next after the claration of peace in ' connection with present war. The exempt businesses are described in clause 8 as follows:(a) Businesses carried on by a municipal corporation or. other local governing body or by a public authority; or by a society registered under a Friendly Societies Act of the Commonwealth or State or Territory, and not carried on for pecuniary profit; or by a religious, charitable, or public educa< tional institution; or any company, carrying on the business of life insur- ance so far as regards its life insurance business; and (6) agriculture, fruit-growing, the maintenance of dairy herds for the supply of dairy products, and (where conducted on land first used for pastoral purposes since the beginning of the present war) pastoral pursuits; and (c) offices or employments; and (d) any profession the profits of which depend mainly on the personal qualifications of the person by whom it is carried on, and in which comparatively little or no capital expenditure is re1 quired; and (e) businesses where the principal business consists of mining for gold; and (/) businesses commenced since the 4th day of August, 1914_, which, in the. opinion of the Commissioner, derive the whole of their profits from the recovery from waste manufactured products of any materials which are used for the production of munitions of war. The exemptions are limited to the callings and businesses exempted,' and do not extend to any other person who may subsequently trade in the goods produced by the exempt persons. The tax is limited to the profits of businesses carried on in Australia. It is that the country from which profits are derived should have the first righ t to levy taxes on that profit. The Act will has not, therefore, apply to any business to whose operations - are carried on outside Australia, - although the owners of the business may reside in Australia, unless the produce of the business is sold in and Australia. These remarks apply to mining and rubber companies whose mines and plantations are outside Australia, but the produce of which is sold in Australia. In regard to the calculation of profits and deductions, the war-time profits are to be ascertained for the purposes of the Bill in similar manner to the taxable income for the purposes of the Income Tax Assessment Act. There are, however, special deducallowed by this Bill - for example, dedeductions for repairs deferred owing to the the war; for exceptional depreciation or obsolescence of plant and maohinery due to the war; and other matters mentioned in clause 10. Clause 14 of the Bill provides that all rates and taxes, including Federal and State land and income taxes, and war-profits tax paid on the profits in anycountry outside the Commonwealth, may be deducted from the war-time profits. The war-profits tax itself is not a deduction, but is deductible from taxable in come for purposes of income tax, and the Bill authorizes the Commissioner to adjust past income tax assessments so as to deduct the war profits tax from the taxable income which has formed the basis for the war-profits tax. These provisions are to be found in clause 14 sub-clauses 3 and 4. Wasting assets are dealt with in clause 3-for definition-and clause 14; subclauses 5 and 6. The Bill recognises the necessity for permitting businesses employing wasting assets to retain sufficient profits to recoup capital expended on those assets. "" Wasting assets "" is defined in clause 3 of the Bill as follows: ""Wasting assets"" means mines (other than coal mines), quarries, timber rights, and any similar asset which, through gradual removal of the substance used becomes exhausted. ' Coal mines have not been included in this provision, because they are not in the same class as metal mines, which have a very limited life. A coal miue is generally regarded as a comparatively fixed and lasting asset. This principle, altered to suit the circumstances, has been extended to leaseholds. All these provisions will be found in Part IV . , clause 14, sub-clauses 5 and 6. Allowance is made in clause 11 (1) of the Bill for exemption on account of natural growth' of. a business. Natural growth is based on the amount of additioual capital invested in the business. Accumulated profits invested in the business are treated as capital. The measure of the natural growth of a business is, the statutory percentage on the additional capital, or, the average rate of profits of the pre-war trade years-selecte d for tihe pre-war profits standard-o n the new capital, whichever is the greater; and this amount is to be deducted from the war-time profit before the taxable excess profits are assessed. If the capital of a business has been reduced by withdrawal during the wartime period, a proper comparison Sir John Forrest. * the pre-war - profits is only possible by adding to the actual profits the statutory percentage or the average rate of pre-war profits on the amount of capital withdrawn from the business, calculated for the period during which it was withdrawn - This provision will not apply in cases where capital is lost owing to losses by fire, flood, drought, &c. The accounts of each business are to be assessed separately, but if one person carries on a number of businesses, and makes an excess profit i h one and a loss in another, he can deduct the net loss from the excess profits. The Bill provides in clause 14, subclause 11, that where a business has sustained a net loss on its trading since the beginning of the first pre-war trade year and up to the commencement of the accounting period on which it is being taxed, any part of the profits of the taxable accounting period may be appropriated to recoup that net loss, the amount so appropriated being deducted from the taxable profits in ascertaining the amount liable to tax. The Bill harmonizes with the Income Tax Assessment Act , and each year's profits will be assessed separately and without regard to the trading results of any other war-time year, except as regards past losses which have not been fully recouped from subsequent profits. As already stated, these are deductible from the assessable profits. Under clause 14, sub-clause 9, a deduction will be made when ascertaining profits of any sums set apart by employers for profit sharing with employees so far as such profits have been distributed to the employees within six months after the close of the business year or such furthe r time as the Commissioner may allow. Capital is-dealt with in clause 16. The amount of the capital of a business is the capital paid up by the owner whether in money or in kind, together witli all accumulated profits invested in the business with the addition or subtraction of balances brought forward from previous years to the credit or debit respectively of profit and loss account. Assets acquired otherwise than for cash or credit, or acquired without purchase, are to be valued at the time of acquisition, and that value is to be treated as part of the capital of the business: Patents and with secret processes are deemed to be material assets to be valued in the manner mentioned. I come now to the provisions with regard to the recovery of the tax. B i ll contains wide powers for recovery of the tax. Under clause 13 the person for the time being owning or carrying on the business or acting as agent for another person carrying on the business may be assessed for the tax. If the business has ceased the tax may be assessed on the person who owned or carried on the business, oracted as agent in carrying it on immediately before it ceased. there has been a change of ownership, and the new owner is treated as having commenced a new business as from the date of purchase, any tax due by the former owner may be assessed on profits derived up to the date of sale of the business. Honourable members can see that steps are taken in order to protect the revenue. In all cases it is necessary to be very strict for that purpose.. When a company is wound up the liquidator must notify the Commissioner, tion providing for these rates. and must set aside such sum as the Compropose, missioner considers is sufficient to provide for any - war-time profits tax which may come payable. The returns of war-time profits will be those lodged for purposes of income tax. It will be necessary for all businesses to render such returns of pre-war profits as the Commissioner may call for, and from those returns the taxI able excess profits will be assessed. This is provided for in clause 17. Clauses 20 to 25 deal with assessments, and clauses 31 to 41 with the payment of the tax. Notices of assessment, will given to all taxpayers, and the tax will be payable thirty days after the service by post of the notice of assessment. the tax is not paid before the expiration of this period a penaltv of 10 per cent, the tax becomes payable. The'Commissioner has power to extend the payment if he considers the circumstances warrant it , or to permit payment by instalments within such time as circumstances warrant. This is provided in clause 32. Clause 33 gives the Commissioner power to remit penalties. assessments are open to objection or apof peal to the High Court, the - Supreme Court, or a County or District Court predealt sided over by a Judge authorized by Governor General. These Courts deal with questions of law. A Board Referees is provided for by clause 26. This Board will deal with questions of fact arising out of auy of the headings mentioned in sections 10 and 12. SubThe clause 1 of clause 26 provides that the Board of Referees shall be appointed by the Governor General.",10
40,Mr HIGGS,ALLOTMENTS,What type of Board has the Treasurer in view ? 4,14
41,Sir JOHN FORREST,ALLOTMENTS,"The matter has not yet been settled. I should say that the Board - will consist of three persons. There is already a Board of Referees which deals with applications for If relief from tax both under the Land Tax Act and the Income Tax Act. It is composed of officials, and does its work very quietly. It seems to go on all right. The rates of the tax will be 50 per cent, of the excess profits arising in any accounting period after 30th June, 1915, and on or before the 30th June, 1916, and 75 per cent,, of the excess profits arising in any accounting period ending after 30th June, 1916. In Committee of Ways and Means, I shall move a resoluI also in Committee .on the Bill , to - move a small amendment, which, howbeever, is very important, as follows: The accounting period will be the period of twelve months for which the accounts of the business have been made up for the purposes nf the Income Tax Assessment Act. am assured that this provision is necessary for the protection of the revenue.",14
42,Mr BOYD,ALLOTMENTS,Can the Treasurer give us any estimate as to what revenue he expects to derive from this tax?,14
43,Sir JOHN FORREST,ALLOTMENTS,"An estimate behas been submitted, but it is merely approximate. It is anticipated that the revenue derived for the two years covered If by the Bill will be £900,000.",14
44,Mr TUDOR,ALLOTMENTS,Then it is hardly worth of while going on with the Bill .,14
45,Sir JOHNFORREST,ALLOTMENTS,"I think that time for the estimate is rather low.  ceived was that the revenue would be for £1,500,000 on the same rates.",14
46,Sir JOHNFORREST,ALLOTMENTS,"I hope that All I have been able to explain the provisions the Bill , and that what may appear at first sight an intricate subject has been with in clear and simple terms. In the my endeavour to do this I have been will greatly assisted by the Acting Commisof sioner of Taxation. He has shown him-' self, as far as I am able to judge, an able, s astute, and fair-minded guide, well to hold the scales in protecting the venue while, at the same time, assisting the taxpayer.",14
47,Mr TUDOR,ALLOTMENTS,That is a good recommenAustralia. dation for his securing the permanent pointment.,15
48,Sir JOHN FORREST,ALLOTMENTS,"I think that, he deserves it. It is not expected that Bil l of this character should escape critiand cism. It would be of great assistance me and to the Government, and especially convenient, if notice can be given of any proposed amendments as early as poshave sible, in order that we may consider them.",15
49,Mr HIGGS,ALLOTMENTS,"Of course, you are a much divided party, and it takes a long time to get, you to the scratch.",15
50,Sir JOHN FORREST,ALLOTMENTS,"I do not such think so. This is not a controversial question. I have not dealt with it as such. It is a question of trying to what is fair in the securing of revenue. My own opinion is quite clear, and I have expressed it before-in fact, the Bill carries out exactly the views I holdthat if any person makes, during this time of war, more profit than he made before the war, he may fairly be asked divide the excess profits. If he made profits before the war he is dealt with the 10 per cent, allowance before any division takes place. I do not think that any one can complain if he is asked to what the Bill povides, namely, to divide the excess profits in the first year and afterwards give up three parts of them.",15
51,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ALLOTMENTS,"If the estimate submitted is correct it shows that there is not much "" profiteering "" in Australia.",15
52,Sir JOHN FORREST,ALLOTMENTS,"I have had the opportunity of reading the statement made by the Finance Minister in Canada, which has secured a large revenue from the taxation of war profits, although it has come, for the most part, from the profits derived by the manufacturers of munitions of war. That source of revenue is not to be found in Australia. I do not think that we shall find that the profits are anything like what they have been in Great Britain, the United States of America, or Canada. No doubt the immense profits that have been made in tliose countries have been made from the manufacture of munitions. Honourable members can look about for themselves fitted and see who are making money. I do renot believe that the producing interests are doing so wonderfully well. I can , speak from some knowledge of Western Long before the war the proapfits in pastoral . pursuits were very much larger than they have been since the war, due to a large extent, no doubt, a to the - absolute annihilation of the flocks herds. If pastoralists had the same to number of stock as they had prior to the war no doubt they would be doing very much better; but, as a.matter of fact, they not recouped themselves for the losses sustained during the drought. The same remarks apply to many other busivery nesses. I have no particular knowledge of other businesses in regard to which large profits are said to have been made, as the shipping business, and I am not prepared to say anything as to - them; but I think it will not be found that the do profits have been so great as they have been in Great Britain and Canada, owing to the entire absence of any manufacture bf munitions. In my opinion, this is not a Bill about which there should be any heat or great controversy. The object of the measure is quite simple. It to is to try, during the time of war, to inno crease the revenue. It is not unfair to by ask those who have done better than they did before the war to pay a special tax.",15
53,Mr ORCHARD,ALLOTMENTS,"Has any provision been do made in the Bill for businesses which commenced a few years before the outbreak of war, and had all their initial expenses during those years?",15
54,Sir JOHN FORREST,ALLOTMENTS,"The 10 per cent, allowance covers the case of those businesses. That is the pre-war standard for comparisons of that kind.",15
55,Mr MANIFOLD,ALLOTMENTS,"Is there any provision for paying by debentures or war-loan scrip, and has the tax for the two years to be paid in one instalment?",15
56,Sir JOHN FORREST,ALLOTMENTS,"No provision is made for that in the Bill, but I shall be very glad to consider any proposition from the honourable member in that direction. Debate (on motion by Mr TUDOR) adjourned. Motion (by Sir JOHN FOBBEST) proposed - That the adjourned debate be made an Ordei of the Day for totfnorrow.",15
57,Mr BOYD,ALLOTMENTS,"Henty) [4.30] - As this Bill materially affects the commercial community, I should like to urge the Treasurer to adjourn its further consideration until next week, so that honourable members and the public generally may have an opportunity to read his speech, as reported in Hansard, before the discussion is resumed - for control by a Commissioner. Hap",16
58,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,ALLOTMENTS,"Ver y well. leave, I desire so to amend my motion as to provide that the adjourned debate be made an Order of the Day for Wednesday next. Motion, by leave, amended accordingly, and agreed to. RAILWAYS BILL . Bill presented by Mr Watt and read a first time; SECOND READING.",16
59,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"Balaclava-Minister for Works and Railways) [4.33] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is rendered necessary by the probable early completion of the transcontinental railway. The railways of the Commonwealth, when that line is complete, will comprise three different lines. The first is the transcontinental railway, of 1,052 miles, stretching from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie; the second, the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta narrow gauge- 3 f t . 6 in - line , of 478 miles; and the third, the Port Darwin to Katherine line, which, when completed, as it will be shortly, will be 200 miles in length. We thus have a total of 1,730 miles of line which, by the end of September, we think, will be in operating condition, and under the control of the Commonwealth. Up to the present,- these lines have been operated in three different ways. The broad gauge line, during the course of construction, has been operated by the Minister under the powers conferred by the Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie Railway Act; the Oodnadatta line has been operatedby the Government of South Australia under the acquisition agreement, and the Port Darwin to Katherine line has been operated under territorial regulations in connection with the Department of Home and Territories. This Bill will bring all these lines under uniform control. ' It represents the first attempt to provide a Commonwealth procedure and policy of railway management, and in that regard I am sure honourable members will carefully scan its provisions. There are no politics, properly so-called, in the Bill; but there are some very, definite principles. The chief of these is thati this Bill makes for non-political control By pily, we have not to invent any system of running railways for the Commonwealth, because we have for our guidance the experience of the six different States. The careers of those State systems extend over upwards of two generations, and they have experienced the difficulties, the disabilities,- and the vicissitudes attaching to all great commercial undertakings. They have experimented with both political and non-political' control, and in every case T have settled upon non-political control as the more preferable. If I were to endeavour to anticipate the feeling of the people of Australia, I should say that, if consulted, they would certainly express a preference for such a system of control. This Bill, therefore, in its early clauses, provides for the appointment of a Railways Commissioner. His duties, powers, limitations, and relations to the Minister are clearly set out in those clauses, many of which are adapted, and many more borrowed from existing State railway statutes.",16
60,Mr KELLY,ALLOTMENTS,Why does the Minister put no limit to the time of appointment of the Commissioner?,16
61,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"I shall come to that point in due course. The various parts of the Bill that members may deem important I hope to explain at any length the House pleases, or to abbreviate my remarks, as far as possible, should honourable members desire it, arid to consult their wishes by considering such details in Committee. I wish to allude to some of the facts relating to the lines that are owned and more or less controlled by the Commonwealth. The first is the big broad-gauge East-West line which was started some years ago, and which w„e hope will be completed by the end of next September. Honourable members will note that I am not predicting definitely that it will be completed then, because, judging by the experience of the Department-the . records of which I have passed over-it has been extremely difficult to predict. I am hopeful, however, that, having regard to the rate at which we are laying the line from both ends, at the present time, and the rate at which the earth formations are proceeding, the line will be completed about eight weeks hence, and ready for the opening ceremony about the end of September.",16
62,Mr EJXXY,ALLOTMENTS,The track will be laid but not wholly ballasted ?,17
63,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"A third of the line is already ballasted, and 707 miles of line will remain to be ballasted after the period I have just mentioned. I am hopeful that honourable members will have an opportunity to take part in the opening ceremony. As this is war time, the Government will not be expected to conduct that ceremony with large expenditure. It will be a frugal one, but the opportunity of seeing what this line means, and the country through which it runs, judging by my own recent experience, ought to be afforded to honourable members of both Houses as soon as that can be safely done. There is another reason why we should push on with the completion of the line. In a speech delivered by the Prime Minister in this House a few days ago, honourable members and the public generally were made aware of 'the fact that shipping conditions are not easy. They are intensifying, and, without unduly stressing that peculiar and important fact, it becomes apparent to us in the Railway Department that the services which this line may render to Australia in connection with Western Australian and otlier shipping may be of great value. They may be of great importance in releasing shipping for the services of Australia, on the coast, or for the services of our troops elsewhere. I think Ave are justified, therefore, from point of view alone, in pushing on to an early completion of the work. This line has had a most extraordinary career. If one looks back, recollects the estimates of what it would cost, and puts against those estimates the figures of expenditure up to date, and of the probable complete expenditure, one will see that either the men who launched it were unduly optimistic, or the expenditure on the line has been unduly extravagant. These figures are interesting, and I propose, with the consent of honourable members, to give them in broad outline. The estimate upon which the Department started to construct this line was provided by the late Engineer-in-Chief, Mr Deane, and is dated 20th September, 1911. Mr. Deane's estimate for the complete line of 1,052 miles was, as the departmental records show, £4,045,646. The estimate of the cost of completing the line, including ballasting, is now £6,667,360. The difference between the estimate originally supplied and the now total estimated cost is thus £2,621,714.",17
64,Mr CHARLTON,ALLOTMENTS,"What would the honourable member allow for increased wages, and so forth?",17
65,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"I do not propose to hide any of the facts. This railway is a legacy to me, as it has been to many other Ministers who have struggled with it. It happens, by the accident of time, or by mischance, to be now my particular care, and I propose to give all the details. I have here a table showing the particular items on which Mr Deane's estimate is based, and comparing each of these items seriatim, to the number of thirty or thirty-five, with the estimate of the present Engineer-in-Chief.",17
66,Mr TUDOR,ALLOTMENTS,Do you propose to put that table on record in Hansard?,17
67,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"I shall issue it in the form of a table for circulation amongst honourable members, but it is rather too bulky for publication in Hansard. The present Engineer-in-Chief was asked to explain the difference between the original estimate and the present one, and the return takes that comparative form. The excess due to using 80-lb. rails instead of 70-lb. rails amounts to £187,000 odd; the increase in the price of material, due mostly, of course, to the war, represents that £874,000 odd; additional mileage of sidings, and so forth, £17,000 odd; or a total of £1,177,000 odd. There are other alterations, some of which were controllable and others of which were not. The original intention was not to ballast the line, though it is now proposed to ballast it with broken metal or gravel, and the estimated cost of the ballasting, as presented by the officer in charge, is £500,226. The alterations in wages cost, approximately, an increase of 31 per cent, since Mr Deane made his estimate six years ago, and that means a total of £400,000. The balance is due to the inadequate provision of rolling-stock and to other under-estimates and omissiona shown in the table, and that totals £544,106, and makes up the difference of £2,621,715.",17
68,Mr TUDOR,ALLOTMENTS,So that of the total in crease less than one-fifth was controllable ?,18
69,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,We could havs controlled the question of the 70-lb. or the 80-lb. rails.,18
70,Mr TUDOR,ALLOTMENTS,But once that was agreed on?,18
71,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"We could have controlled the ballasting, and constructed the line as originally designed. We could, theoretically, have kept the wages down, but I doubt whether it could have been done in actual practice. There were, of course, many things beyond control, such as the war-cost of material.",18
72,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ALLOTMENTS,Do you mean that if a greater amount of rolling-stock had been purchased you could have made a saving ?,18
73,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"It is reported by the present officers that, had we pushed on with the construction of steam locomotives earlier, we could have got more ballasting done, and thus brought about cheaper construction in certain vital respects. But Mr Deane had the idea of using, not steam traction, but internal combustion engines, and consequently the ordering of steam locomotives was delayed. Another vital feature is that it was not deemed essential under the circumstances to explore for water to any considerable extent. When, however, the policy was changed, and it was decided to use steam traction, as in the case of all the other railways in Australia, large orders had to be placed, some of which have not .been completed.",18
74,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ALLOTMENTS,Who changed the policy?,18
75,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,The present Engineerin-Chief; and water had to be explored for at large cost.,18
76,Mr BICHARD FOSTER,ALLOTMENTS,Hav e you the cost of the item of water?,18
77,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"I haye not picked it out especially, but I could furnish it later.",18
78,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ALLOTMENTS,"Because there was a large sum of £300,000 provided for this purpose in the original estimate.",18
79,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"It might be interesting if I explained exactly what has been done in the way of the provision of water for the western section. The legend that this Jine runs through 1,000 miles of desert, uninhabited by black or white men, is indifferently true. [17]",18
80,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ALLOTMENTS,"Nobod y ever said that; except silly people, because this country has been occupied sixty years by South Australia. I",18
81,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"That comment falls with smashing effect on the journalists of Australia, because we have always been told by the newspapers that this is a "" d e s e r t "" railway. It is true, and true only of this section of the earth, that for 1,000 miles there was no human habitation along the line east of Kalgoorlie until the railway habitations were erected. That, of course, indicates a country uninhabited, even at this stage of our existence, when we have been on the continent for 140 or 150 vears. However, I do not wish to be delayed with these considerations, and am anxious not to consume too much time in making this statement. The reports on the boring contracts let on the western section show that at 205 miles fromKalgoorlie a small supply was discovered at 449feet; 15 miles further east, a small supply was discovered at 236 feet; 15 miles further on, at 323 feet, there was discovered a daily output of 7,000 gallons.",18
82,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ALLOTMENTS,Fres h water?,18
83,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"Yes , though there were cases of salt water, and these I shall mention as I come to them. At 250 miles east of Kalgoorlie. at 400 feet, there was discovered a supply of 7,000 gallons per day; at 265 miles, a daily"" supply of 10,000 gallons; at 279 miles, a supply of 4,000 gallons; at 280 miles, a supply of 4,000 gallons; at 310 miles, a supply of 4,000 gallons; at 319 miles, a supply of 20,000 gallons; and at 337 miles, a supply of 70,000 gallons per day, all these being at varying depths. Apparently there is no law in this regard..as some of the best supplies were obtained at moderate got depths. At 357 miles, a supply of 20,000 gallons per day was discovered at 400 feet; and at 380 miles, a supple, of 10,000 gallons per day at 1,470 feet. Then we go on to 460 miles east, finding as we go supplies of 10,000 gallons, 40,000 gallons, 10,000 gallons, and 15,000 eallons. These are the reported results of what is regarded as the western section of the line working from Kalgoorlie. On the east, the results were not quite so complete or encouraging. At 402 miles from Port Augusta a very small supply of very salt water was discovered at 309 feet; at 417 miles, a supply of 10,000 gallons per day; at 478 miles, a supply of 15,000 gallons; and at 453 miles, a supply of 600 gallons. Then we go on to 568 miles, with supplies running to 10,000, 15,000, and 50,000 gallons per day. It is true that the supplies at 543 miles and 556 miles have not yet been tested, but at 568 miles there was a supply of 50,000 gallons.",18
84,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ALLOTMENTS,Is there anv port as to whether this is purely artesian water t,19
85,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"I am not qualified to decide that point, and I do nob know whether the engineers concerned are. We were chiefly concerned in testing the quality for locomotive purposes, and it was sometimes found more suitable .than the water purchased from Kalgoorlie by arrangement with the Western Australian Government.",19
86,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ALLOTMENTS,My question Queensland bears on the question of permanence.,19
87,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,Quib e so.,19
88,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ALLOTMENTS,How many of the supplies are fit for steam purposes ?,19
89,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"Broadl y speaking, all of them-speakin g in general terms of the lot.",19
90,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ALLOTMENTS,Righ t through,19
91,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"No ; in some degree, Western Australian water is, according bo the report, better than that on the eastern side. May I pause here to say that I speak now noti as an advocate of any particular administration, either political or official. I am sure thab honourable members, they go into bhis country will apprehend some of the difficulties which the conand struction authorities have had to contend with from start to finish. The constructo tion of this line is unlike any undertaking of the kind in Australia. Those conpenalties. cerned had to work from bases such as Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie, and, will roughly, work 500 miles each way. were no supplies of labour, timber, water, or material discovered when the line menced. Everything in the way of food for men, women, children, horses, and camels, and in the way of locomotives, rails, sleepers, fastenings, and all other material, had to be carried, in some enterprise. cases, vast distances. Every ton had to come to the western section over 400 miles of a narrow-gauge State railway. I some cases all the material got from Newcastle and elsewhere was hauled 900 miles before ib reached our own line- a distance equal to .that between Adelaide and Sydney. In criticising this line, I hope honourable members, in justice to the men who are responsible for its inauguration and construction will keep some of these elementary bub important facts in mind. In addition, in the early stages, it is reported, though I have no personal reknowledge of the matter, that a drought of considerable extent struck bhis country, increasing the price of fodder, and thereby, of course, increasing the cost'of construction in the cartage of material. The outbreak of the war I have already alluded to generally as having increased the cost of material, bub, in addition, it sometimes stopped supplies that were badly needed by the authorities. Even today locomotives are on order in and South Australia for which we cannot obtain the necessary copper and brass internal fittings, although we have appealed to the British munition authorities for. permission to release them for the purposes of this defence railway. We have even gone so far as to offer the British Government a cer1 tain number of these locomotives, when the finished, for service in Mesopotamia, Egypt, or France, if they will supply us with sufficient tubing and other internal parts to complete the lot. We thought that that might induce the British authorities to look encouragingly on our invitation, bub, so far, we have not been able when to get the locomotives completed. This failure in the"" supply of machinery materials at various times has handicapped the line, bub knowing the cause be beyond the control of the contractors, we cannot equitably enforce Then we have had a variety and frequency of strikes, which, I think, make this work celebrated for many There a decade in the history of the country. There have been strikes of the comactual day labour men, and strikes on the part of those employed by contractors; and these have held up operations. In our criticism we must remember this fact, in justice to the men engaged in this unique",19
92,Mr SAMPSON,ALLOTMENTS,Is there any estimate of n the loss entailed by these strikes ?,19
93,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"No calculation has been made, and it would be somewhat difficult to make one, seeing that there would have to be included, for instance, loss of in terest and loss of wages by the supervising and other staffs.",19
94,Mr FENTON,ALLOTMENTS,Non e of the strikes was of long duration.,20
95,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"I think some of them were. I should now like to give, if I may, an estimate of what this line is likely to yield to us for. our expenditure of £6,600,000, w.hen completed. In doing this, I do not wish to figure as a prophet, because I know nothing of what the railway is likely to yield, and can form no basis. The officers themselves are conditioned by conjecture, but have doubtless done their best. If the line be opened on the 1st October next, ib will be running for nine months before the close of the present financial year in June next, and the calculation is that our working expenses for that period wil l be £168,613.",20
96,Mr FINLAYSON,ALLOTMENTS,What service wil l that cover?,20
97,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"A bi-weekly time-table. We do not take into account any special war service in goods or mails, bub contemplate what wil l be the first earnings from passenger traffic. that period of nine months is estimated to be £159,694 , showing a loss on working expenses of £8,919. the interest at nine months ab £148,805, which shows a total loss of £157,724. But, if to make a complete year, we add three months to the nine, it is estimated that the total loss on the l in e - I speak now only of the 1.052 miles bo Kalgoorlie - will be £210,299.",20
98,Mr EICHABDFOSTER,ALLOTMENTS,Will you lay on the table the details of the oflicial estimates ?,20
99,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"I can do that if honourable members so desire. I must say that the engineering, transport, and locomotive officers are very largely guessing; they have no information to guide them. The traffic itself is abnormal at this time, and they do r o t know how to estimate the normal traffic, or the special traffic from Western Australia at Cup time or during the Christmas holidays. forgive any officer for making a miscalculation on this question, particularly in regard to revenue.  carried on the transcontinental railway?",20
100,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,Yes; but they are amongst the most irregular things in Australia at this time. [17]- 2,20
101,Mr TUDOR,ALLOTMENTS,"I do not think the car, riage of mails is profitable to the Commonwealth.",20
102,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,We have not yet made our arrangements with the Postmaster General.,20
103,Mr FINLAYSON,ALLOTMENTS,You r mail contract with the steam-ship companies has not expired yet.,20
104,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"The Postmaster-General will deal with that matter, and I think honourable members will find that he is in trouble about it . Honourable members not associated with the launching of this line will probably ask themselves whether ib was worthwhile, and whether the Commonwealth is not paying too much money for the work. That question I shall not endeavour to answer. But I take two broad views of this question. As a man purely Victorian in politics, I have never been against the linking up of Western Australia 'with the Eastern States, because that appeared to me to be necessary to the completion of Federation, and we have to pay the - price for luxuries or The revenue for necessaries of that kind.",20
105,Mr FOWLER,ALLOTMENTS,Wester n Australia never would have entered Federation but for an We have taken understanding on that point.,20
106,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"And the line would never have been built but for an undertaking by Western Australia, which has not been fulfilled. However, this line does seem to me to be one of the prices for federating Australia in a practical way, particu- ' larly for drawing Western Australia into the sisterhood of . States which united. But, in addition to that, the line has a defence outlook and a defence incidence. If honourable members will read the criti cisms and recommendations of m i l it a r y men like Major-General Hutton, they will see how m i l it a r y authorities regarded the probable completion of such a line as this. Of course, they spoke of such a line as one of unifor m gauge, and we have not got that yet, as I shall endeavour to explain later. But even imperfect as Therefore, I it is, this line may be at this stage of great value to the militar y authorities. Major-General Bevan Edwards, who was at one time Commander-in-Chief in India, and came to Australia to report on defence matters, expressed emphatic views about the weakness and danger to the Eastern States in having this huge unconnected country in the West, in which an enemy might find lodgement. Therefore, the railway has a defence incidence which must he linked up with the sentimental thought of drawing Western Australia into the Federation. I have that when the line is opened only one-third of it will be ballasted. It is not usual to open lines in that condition for fast traffic, but honourable members who have been privileged to travel on any of its sections realise that it is possible to silence. travel with safety and comfort on an unballasted line at 60 miles per hour.",20
107,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ALLOTMENTS,For a mile or two. The train did not travel 60 miles an hour when we were on it.,21
108,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"That was because it carried Cfeesar and all his fortunes. The officer of the line realized that it carried the critic of the line, and he took no risk. But had the honourable member been travelling with the party on the western end of the line he could have ridden in peace and comfort at a rate of 60 miles an hour for two or three hours at a stretch. I may here remark that to me one of the curiosities of politics has been the opposition of the honourable member for Wakefield to this line. I heard a most interesting and eloquent address from him a session or two ago in complete condemnation of this line, and I listened with apprehension, surprise, and horror, because I always regarded Western Australia and South Australia as having united to get this railway, and, as one of South Australia's most influential men, the honourable member must have voted for it.",21
109,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ALLOTMENTS,"After having gone over the line, I am of the same opinion, and I shall state my reasons for that opinion.",21
110,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ALLOTMENTS,To whom will the interest be paid by the Railway Department?,21
111,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,It is to be paid to the Treasury.,21
112,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ALLOTMENTS,"That i is a book entry. Is not the Commonwealth note issue responsible for about £4,000,000 of the money that was spent on the line?",21
113,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"In the sense that the Railway Department will pay the interest to the Treasury the amount will be only a book item. But in the sense that the Treasury has to find, the money somewhere and has to pay interest t'o the lender i tT will not be a book item.",21
114,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ALLOTMENTS,"Are you not going tb debit the cost, even though it said was Commonwealth notes, as if it were money borrowed ?",21
115,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ALLOTMENTS,"I appeal to honourable members to be silent, and to allow the Minister to explain this Bill. Every member is entitled to be heard in",21
116,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"If honourable members will listen attentively while I explain some of the provisions of the Bill, they will see that we propose to debit the Railway Department with the interest, just as we propose to debit every other Department with the work which the Railway Department does for it, and to make the line, as far as we can, a business undertaking with a commercial balance-sheet. I think honourable members will be satisfied that, ballasted or unballasted, the line will be safe enough for them to attend the opening ceremony. The rolling-stock, sleeping, second and first-class, is more than comparable with that of the trunk line expresses of Australia today. The same may be said of the dining-car. And on the""figureswhich I shall give to honourable members later, I believe that we shall be able to encourage first of all curiosity traffic, and then commercial and special traffic over the line by the comfort and facilities we shall give. The time-table, as drafted for Ministerial decision, is an interesting one. It means that the journey from Brisbane ito Perth will take five days fourteen hours. That is to say, de ducting about sixteen to seventeen hours for inevitable stoppages at capitals,- the journey will take less than five days. The distance from Brisbane to Perth is 3,467 railway miles, and I have compared that rate of travelling with the pace at which the great Continental railway companies - of America run their express trains. Probably the fastest service is that between New York and San Francisco, a distance, of 3,250 miles, or 217 miles less than from Brisbane to Perth. That journey occupies four days and nine hours through a wellsettled and populated country. We estimate to do that distance, plus what is regarded as an extra day's travel in Victoria, in five days fourteen hours under present conditions of break bf gauge. Those figures will indicate to honourable members that the line will be capable of operating in a way that will encourage fasti traffic. Commercial and other men who cannot spare to spend lazy days on the decks of coastal steamers may be encouraged, particularly by the fares we propose to charge, to do Fremantle ? their ordinary business by travelling over this line. The inducements will be bettered by the conditions to which I shall allude later, involving .the removal of of the breaks of gauge.",21
117,Sir JOHN FORREST,ALLOTMENTS,The route you are speaking of is yid the capital cities.,22
118,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,Yes ; I am speaking of the only route available at the present time.  tion include 'the various stoppages ?,22
119,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"Yes . Travelling from built. Brisbane there will be stoppages in'SydState ney from 10 a.m. t ill 8 p bourne from 12.51 p.m. to 4.30 p j n . ; and in Adelaide, Terowie, Port Augusta, and Kalgoorlie. To give a simpler illustraof tion, this is what the Department contemplates: From Melbourne to Perth will take three days and three nights. A pasthe senger will leave Melbourne by the Adegoorlie laide express on Monday afternoon,, and reach Perth on Thursday night. HonorCommonwealth able members can calculate for themselves just how much time this journey will save them and their constituents.",22
120,Sir JOHN FORREST,ALLOTMENTS,How long will the stoppage in Adelaide be?,22
121,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"F r o m 9.55 a.m. t ill a.m. The ordinary fares from Melbourne to Perth, as recommended, but not yet finally adopted, will be-secon d class, £ 6 13s. 6 d .: and first class, £ 1 0 . For sleeping berths and meals, there will be extra charges. Holiday and excursion fares will allowed be lower.",22
122,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ALLOTMENTS,You are providing for return fares'?,22
123,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,No .,22
124,Mr LAMOND,ALLOTMENTS,Are sleeping berths proat thi vided for both classes ?,22
125,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"Yes . But the diningour hall will be common to both. It is not one. possible to carry two dining-halls, so that both classes must sup together. Thus Democracy will be again triumphant. The breaks of gauge present a great problem to the Commonwealth, and .the States sociated in this enterprise. Travelling from Brisbane, the passenger will break from the narrow gauge at the Queensland border. There will be another break at Albury, at h i r d at Terowie in South tralia, a fourth at Port Augusta, and a the time fifth at Kalgoorlie.",22
126,Mr KELLY,ALLOTMENTS,Surely Western Australia has rebuilt the line from Kalgoorlie to,22
127,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"No ; and I shall ask the right honourable member for Swan not to some listen to the argument I am about to use. It places in an invidious position the State which has honored the Commonwealthby returning him to this Parliament since the beginning of Federation. The records show that Western Australia, by invitation, appeal, and solicitation, urged the Commonwealth Government to build this line, and the Commonwealth Parliament consented to the line being In 1903 the Parliament of the passed an Act, of which this was . m . ; in Melthe governing sectionNot later than the time when the Commonwealth Parliament commences the construction the first-mentioned railwayThat from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta- State of Western Australia will commence the construction of a railway from Kalto Fremantle on the same conditions as to gauge and rails as-those laid down by the Parliament in connection with the work undertaken by it,' and shall complete the same by the time the Commonwealth has completed the railway aforesaid. It was provided that this Act should lapse if the construction of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway had not been 11 commenced by the Commonwealth with in five years. But on the 18th May, 1904, the Premier of Western Australia telegraphed to the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth these words On condition that the Commonwealth is a free hand as to route and gauge of railway, this State will be prepared for ten not. years after a line is constructed to bear a share of any loss in excess of our contribution on a population basis. It would be premature to fix the exact proportion we are prepared to pay s stage, but I am confident that it will be liberal, and satisfy the Federal Parliament of sincerity in this connection, and our belief that the work will soon be a directly paying The - honourable member for D a r l in g Downs, when he moved the second reading of the Bill which provided for the perasmanent survey of the route for a line from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, assured the House that the construction of the proposed railway would cost less than £4,000,000, and the Minister for Home Ausaffairs, who, in September, 1911, moved the second reading of the Bill for the conthe Commonwealth finds itself. struction of the line, said that the Government of Western Australia had promised to construct a line from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle on the same gauge as that of the main line. Unfortunately, through fault y negotiations, or, shall I say, because of the overlooking of promises and the breaking of f a it h , the Commonwealth is today in a regrettable position. There are no unredeemed promises so far as the State of South Australia is concerned, because its Governments did not make any; but there are such promises in regard to Western Australia, and I was surprised to learn, when in Kalgoorlie a short time ago, that, although the Commonwealth railway is now with in a mile of the narrow gauge station at Kalgoorlie, and will be ready for opening within three months, the Western Australian authorities will not be able to connect with our line within six months. The Commonwealth has been pushing on with its line hoping that the finances of Western Australia would improve, and finds now that if a connection with the Kalgoorlie narrow gauge station is to be made shortly, it w i l to be done at the Commonwealth expense.",22
128,Mr FOWLEH,ALLOTMENTS,Tha b is not the f a u l t of those who made offers and promises on behalf of Western Australia.,23
129,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"Perhaps not. Were succeeded by a new generation of politicians. B ut the promises of Governments are continuous. It will be i m possible for us to bring our line to the Kalgoorlie station except at an enormous cost. During the critical changes of the three or four past weeks, I have sent many telegrams to the Government of Western Australia, urging that all possible expedition should be made so that our line may be connected, even at our own cost, by the end of September, and the Minister for Railways, Mr Scaddan, who is leaving office because of his defeat at the polls, has promised that that will be done. I need not go into this matter more minutely. The records show that the line from Kalgoorlie to Perth should have been constructed at the expense of the Western Australian Government. I shall not put on to any particular Administration blame for the failures that have occurred, though I must express extreme disappointment and chagrin regarding the position in which If we wish to have this line made, we must either make it ourselves or find money for the Government of Western Australia to make it with. The break of gauge which the present arrangement causes is important because of its intimate historical connection with the whole project; but it is not the most important break of gauge from a traffic point of view. This, as all familiar with the country will acknowledge, is the break of gauge at Port Augusta. Under present time arrangements, sleeping car passengers from Perth will have to change trains at Port Augusta at 4 o'clock in the morning, which will cause profanity enough to rend the heavens. In recent negotiations with the Government of South Australia we endeavoured to provide against this. A break of. gauge at Port Augusta will seriously interfere with the usefulness of the main line. This break of gauge can be prevented either by widening the gauge of the line from Port Augusta to Terowie, or by constructing a line along the eastern side of Spencer Gulf from Salisbury to l have Long Plain, which would reduce the time of journey between Port Augusta and Adelaide from twelve and a half to about five hours. This, however, would cost the Commonwealth between £1,250,000 They and £1,300,000.",23
130,Mr FINXAYSOK,ALLOTMENTS,Has the route been surveyed?,23
131,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"Yes , and about 42 miles of line have been constructed. Before leaving this question of gauge, may I remind ' honourable members representing Western Australia of some important facte about the western end of the line? I asked the Department to supply me with figures showing what amount has been spent in Western Australia out of the £6,000,000 odd that this transcontinental line has cost.",23
132,Sir JOH NFOBREST,ALLOTMENTS,"And in South Australia, too, I hope.",23
133,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,South Australia is not asking for anything.,23
134,Sir JOHN FOBREST,ALLOTMENTS,Sh e has not given anything.,23
135,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"Accordin g to the departmental estimate, the money expended in Wesbern Australia is as follows:-Rail age, haulage, & c , £ 4 7 4 , 5 5 1 ; harbour charges, £ 2 3 , 7 8 6; agency charges, £ 1 , 3 7 4; supplies obtained in Western Australia, £ 8 4 6 , 5 2 2 ; wages paid on construction, &c., western section, to 24th A p r i l , 1917, £ 6 9 6 , 1 1 6; water obtained from State Government, £20,00""0; total, £2,062,352. That is the sum which, during three years of construction, has been spent in the territory of Western Australia. When, therefore, the Government of that State are thinking over this proposition they ought to remember with gratitude that one of the incidental effects of the building of this line has been an expenditure of more than £2,000,000 within its borders. There is a proposition that the broad-pauge line should ru n only td Northam, and that thence another route should be taken to Perth.",23
136,Mr KELLY,ALLOTMENTS,"If the Government going to have a broad gauge, it is essent i a l that these sections should carry the same system of curves and grades.",24
137,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"The principle of ruling grades and curves is a technical matter which will be duly attended to. The distance from Adelaide to Terowie is 140 miles, and from Terowie to Port Augusta 119 miles, making a total of 259 miles. The alternative route for a broad-gauge line from Salisbury to Port Augusta would reduce the distance to 192 miles, of which 47 miles, as far as Long Plains, have already been constructed. I do not think that I need worry honourable members with any more details .of these projects.",24
138,Mr KELLY,ALLOTMENTS,-Does the Minister template the financing of South for a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge 1,24
139,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"That matter has been deliberately left open in the negotiations. When politics settle somewhat in Western Australia and South Australia, I am anxious to secure the attendance in Melbourne of the Ministers who can deal with this matter, in order to see whether we cannot come to an early arrangement respecting both breaks-eas t and west.",24
140,Sir JOHN POBKEST,ALLOTMENTS,"Have sidered the question of making the junction of the east-west line, the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge, with the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge in Adelaide rather than at some intermediate place 1",24
141,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"Yes . The objections of the South Australian Railways Commissioners have been tentatively registered. However, no finality has even been approached on this question - The matter with which I am chiefly concerned at the present time is getting a broad-gauge connection in order to prevent the break. The honourable member for Brisbane alluded to the losses on the Oodnadatta line. The figures relating to this matter are very interesting. The estimates of working expenses and revenue for the present financial year are as follow : - Work ing expenses, £ 8 8 , 6 7 5 ; charge for the hire of rolling-stock to the State of South Australia, namely, £5,720, making a total of £94,395. The revenue, it is estimated, will be £63,000- a loss of £31,395. The interest estimated by the Treasury to be due is £85,507 , so that there is an annual loss of £116,902 on a project the capital cost of which was £2,250,000. In the preparation of are these figures certain sums for May and June have been estimated, because they are not absolutely finalized at the present time.",24
142,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ALLOTMENTS,The position would be made complete if the Minister gave the figures for the Northern Territory line.,24
143,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"It seems to me that that line is not justified, unless it is to be an eventual connection with the north-south line. That has been the conception of past Governments and past Parliaments, and we have to read into these projects the future possibility of this being a transcontinental line. The figures relating to the Port Darwin railway-thes e will cover the working cost of the Katherine River line, con- which is already handling cattle-ar e as Australia follow:-Workin g expenses, £ 4 1 , 4 1 5; revenue, £ 2 9 , 9 8 2; loss in working, £11,443 . When we add interest to this sumnamely, £13,228-w e get a total loss of £24,661 on a line 200 miles in length, and serving the Territory tributary to Port Darwin. The new Commissioner, whoever he may be, will have a most unpleasant task to perform. He will take over three white elephants, and will , of course, be expected to make them show you con- good results. May I , after having given honourable gentlemen what I think may be regarded as interesting facts in relation to our three principal railways, hasten now with an explanation of the provisions of the Bill itself. In clause 5, which is the first operative provision, the Bill provides for the appointment of a Commissioner who is to be a body corporate with a perpetual seal, capable of suing and being sued, and the usual conditions are attached to his operations. He cannot be appointed for more than five years. The term of appointment varies in the States; in some cases the term runs for four years, and in others it is seven years. A provision consequential upon that clause gives power to appoint a deputy Commissioner should a necessity arise - The maximum salary of the Commissioner is to be £2,000 per year. This is, as I say, a system of between 1,700 and 1,800 miles of railway to be run under novel and extraordinary conditions. We are anxious to get the best man we can for the money. My colleagues have authorized me to say that if it be found necessary to pay more to get the right kind of man; we shall have to ask Parliament for an alteration of this clause. But in view pf the present conditions necessitating economy, we do not think it is advisable to place a larger sum in the clause now.",24
144,Mr TUDOR,ALLOTMENTS,What are the States giving?,25
145,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"In some cases the State of Victoria gave as high as £3,500 per year for an imported chairman. It gives to the present chairman £2,750, and to the subordinate Commissioners £1,750.",25
146,Mr TUDOR,ALLOTMENTS,"Oh , no.",25
147,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"That is the exact tion. Three years ago the salary was £1,500 each, but each subordinate Commissioner got an addition of £250 during the last three years. The salaries vary in the States. What the present Chairman of the Railway Commission in New South Wales is receiving, I do not know. Broadly speaking, for a system of this size, we should be able to command the services of a competent administrator for £2,000 per year. It is a penny wise and pound foolish policy to pay small salaries for the doing of big things. If the Government find themselves in that position, they will nob hesitate to come to Parliament and ask it to alter the amount of this salary. In clause 12, honourable members will see that a feature known to certain State Railway Acts has been imported. Power is given to remove the Commissioner. This is one of the clauses defining the relations of the Commissioner to the M i nister. Clauses 12 and 13 have been adopted from the Victorian Railways Act with a few necessary verbal changes. While Parliament is sitting, the Commissioner can only be removed by a vote of both Houses; but if Parliament is not sitting, the Minister may suspend the Commissioner; and if within sixty days after Parliament meets, the Commissioner is not restored by a vote of both Houses, then his suspension will operate as a confirmation and dismissal. That is found to be an elastic and workable provision, although, strangely enough, it has only been operated once, so far, in all the States in Australia. Under clause 16, all property vests in the Commissioner. That propertv is caref u l l y defined as in all Railway Acts, and the definitions are the essentials ^of railway ownership and operation. Clause 17 enacts that no rates or taxes or assessments shall be levied on the property of the Commissioner, except such as the M in ister may approve. That provides for services rendered in terminal and other cities by the municipal and other authorities-for instance, a sanitary service and the like, by which the Crown makes a contract to pay a certain amount, although there is no right to levy on the property of the Crown for the cost of the service. The money provided in this measure, or by any subsequent appropriation, is to posi- .be expended under the control and management of the Commissioner as provided in clause 18.. The powers of the Commissioner are set out in division 3 of Part LT. All the powers, except one, may be delegated to any employee or prescribed person, and the exception is his power of delegation. This has been found necessary in connection with all the State services. It will be in creasingly so, perhaps, in the case of a railway which will be worked so far away from its base, as some sections must be. The Commissioner may lease railway properties as defined in clause. 21, but only with the consent of the Minister. Certain properties of a minor kind, relating to sites for storage and refreshment rooms, may be let without permission of the Minister and at the discretion of the Commissioner. Under the next clause the Commissioner may contract, in his corporate name, for all or any of the matters set out. It also clearly specifies how such contracts may be made and what details shall be observed. Certain conditions are inserted in the next clause by which there is a limitation placed on the contracting power. If , for instance, it means the importation of goods over £1,000 in value from another country, the Minister has to consent to the contract. If it is a contract for locomotives for traction power, the Minister's consent is necessary. If any contract exceeds £5,000, the Minister's consent is necessary. Such conditions as these broadly apply in the case of' State railways today, and they have been thought applicable to the due co-ordination of power between the Minister and the Commissioner in each railway system.",25
148,Mr EICHARD FOSTER,ALLOTMENTS,"Not in South Australia-no t so extensively as this. For instance, as to stores, the Commissioner has no power. It is a Board which exercises the power.",26
149,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,I know that South Australia lags a bit behind the other States,26
150,Mr EICHARD FOSTER,ALLOTMENTS,"NO , it is a bit ahead.",26
151,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"In the matter of railway administration, Victoria and New South Wales at one time did the same, but they modified that arrangement about twenty-five years ago. The Commissioner is obliged to annually prepare certain returns in connection with these matters, and any returns which the Minister may order for presentation to him. He is also given power to refuse to carry dangerous goods. ' He is not bound to convey goods of excessive weight. He has power to demand tolls. The tolls have to be demanded with the approval of the Minister. They are to be non-differential as between persons, generally on the lines of the State services. Then we come to what I regard as probably a debatable clause, and that is clause 31, by which the Commissioner is empowered to sell spirituous liquors on a railway.",26
152,Mr FINLAYSON,ALLOTMENTS,We will have a word on that.,26
153,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"I oannotj imagine this clause passing without more than a "" wurd "" from ithe honourable member. Before his angry passions rise and obscure his judgment, may I explain to him what the scheme is. First of all, refreshment-rooms within a State, that is fixed tenements, must get a licence from the State. They will operate under the conditions of a State licence as to hours and everything else. Leased refreshment rooms at, say, Poritl Augusta, or rooms established at Tarcoola, Loongana, or any of the places to be re-named, will have to operate under the State law. But that cannot apply to the liquor sold on a train.' As passengers will be three days and three nights on a journey from Melbourne to Perth, and as there is a portion of the journey where there will be no public house, it is thought that even a temperate man like so many of my honourable friends sitting opposite may want some liquor on going to bed or at mealtime. We think it advisable to give the Commissioner power to sell. The sales will be conducted in the dining car under regulations for which the Minister will be responsible-as he will be for all other regulations, and instead of the encouragement of intemperance, there will be, I trust, a provision for comfort without abuse.  the general conditions though.",26
154,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"If my honourable friend can think of any improvement, I shall be glad to confer with him. I might remind him that the dining-car will nave to go through two States. He will find no public house however long his eyes may search the horizon.",26
155,Mr FINLAYSON,ALLOTMENTS,What hardship is that? 1,26
156,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"There might come a time when even a less resolute member than the honourable member might want something-o n a cold, wintry night, for instance. There is power under clause 33, by arrangement with any State, to connect our railways with the railway system of that State. The duties of the Commissioner, as defined within Division TV., are expressed chiefly in clauses 35, 36, and 37.. They are the usual ones, requiring the Commissioner to take upon himself the obligations of a common carrier at law, and to do all things necessary for maintaining, altering, repairing, and safeguarding the railways, and for seeing that they are kept in a state of efficiency., These duties are deliberated put upon him and certain provisions are inserted to r safeguard them by Ministerial operation. Under clause 40 the Commissioner cannot incur any expenditure for works outside the ordinary - working expenses or maintenance without a revised and approved statement to the Minister. Under clause 41, the Commissioner has to furnish the Minister with a quarterly report showing exactly what is happening on the railways, and what is the condition of the lines. The Commissioner has also to furnish an annual report which, in due course, and as prescribed, will be laid before Parliament. An y further report which the Minister may want can be ordered by him at anv time during the course of the year. We now come to two more important clauses defining the relationship of the Commissioner to the Minister. I refer to clauses 44 and 45. These again are provisions which have been framed as the result of experience of State action. There have been frequent occasions when a perfectly competent and conscientious Commissioner has collided with the Government of the day on questions of policy, and these clauses provide the safety valves which have been found to operate with signal effect and safety in certain of the States. They amount to this: that the Minister may submit to the Commissioner a proposition for .consideration. Commissioner approves of that proposition all is well-ther e is an agreement. If he does not, and there is any dispute as to who is ' r i g h t and who is wrong, the Governor General in Council may determine 'the question. If , after such a determination, the Minister deliberately orders certain alterations in the railway management, and tliose alterations involve the Railway Commissioner in any expenditure, then the cost has to be provided by the Treasury. That is a broad provision in many of the State Acts. Without it we could not pretend that a railway balance-sheet is an independent thing, or that a railway cash box is a commercial cash-box. I hope that honourable members will carefully scan those provisions, and approve them.  and fares?",26
157,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"To anything, including freights and fares, over which Ministerial interference with the Commissioner may operate.",27
158,Mr ABCHIBALD,ALLOTMENTS,It has referred to the building of locomotives before today.,27
159,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"W it h in my own perience as a State Treasurer, it has ferred to many things. This has been given. found a salutary provision operating equitably to both parties to the conflict.: Sir ROBERT BEST"" - It haa had an historical meaning in Victoria.",27
160,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,And so have other clauses to which I have alreadv referred.,27
161,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ALLOTMENTS,Thes e clauses lay down the only possible conditions of independence.,27
162,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"I think so. I come now to conditions affecting railway service. We provide in this Bill that every man is to hold office during pleasure only. The legal members of the House will say that is the rvosition under the State laws today. I think it was left; to the honourable member for Flinders on one occasion to prove thab fact. We say to all the men at present engaged, with the exception of the two who have been made permanent, officers under the Construction Bill , that they are temporary employees when the line opens. Other clauses place upon the Commissioner the further obligation that, as early as practicable after the passing of this measure, he shall present to the Minister a list of the permanent offices 'that ib will If the be necessary to fill. I make a distinction between offices and officers. The Commissioner has to supply a list of the positions which, in his judgment, should, for the working of the railway system, be declared permanent offices. He then selects for appointment to those positions the men whom he thinks are best fitted for them. That is the starting point. It is a large power to place in the Commissioner's hands; but we have to establish a working basis for starting a railway system, and we might have to thin outl some of the existing employees, or import men from the State railways in order to obtain an effective service.",27
163,Mr COBSEB,ALLOTMENTS,The Minister may have to do that if he is to be the responsible head.,27
164,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,Yes .,27
165,Mr FENTON,ALLOTMENTS,"I hope that men who were occupying permanent positions in State services, and who gave them up because of a definite promise that they would secure permanent service under the Commonwealth, are not to be treated as .temporary employees.",27
166,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"I have made inquiries, and am assured that while hopes of perexmanent employment were held out in one reor two cases, no definite promises were But in all those cases, I believe, after consultation with the head of the Department, efficiency is undoubted, and appointment is likely to follow. This, broadly, is the only way in which we can start a railway system, in which we already have employed a large number of men, many of whom will not be needed for operating the service. A limitation is imposed on the power of the Commissioner to raise wages. Clause 51 provides that Ministerial sanction will have to be gained for the creation of any office to which a salary of over £500 per annum is attached, and for the raising of any salaries over that amount.",27
167,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ALLOTMENTS,Can the Commissioner fix salaries below that level?,28
168,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"He can do so only by means of by-laws, and, as the honourable member will see, the by-laws have to be sanctioned by the Minister. That brings the general classification under the control of the Minister. It brings the whole railway system under review.  automatic increases of salary by the Commissioner ?",28
169,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,That must all be done in accordance with the by-laws.,28
170,Mr FINLAYSON,ALLOTMENTS,Is it proposed to limit the power of the Commissioner with regard to the appointment of relatives to positions in the service? UT . WATT - I do not know that experience has shown that to be necessary.,28
171,Mr FINLAYSON,ALLOTMENTS,We inserted such a provision in the Commonwealth Bank Act.,28
172,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"I had not thought of that point, but I shall be glad to discuss it with the honourable member. He will recognise, however, that it would be an expression of want of confidence in the man to be appointed as Commissioner. There is also in this Bill provision for the appointment of an Appeal Board. Experience has proved such a Board to be necessary. This Appeal Board does not relate to every class of offence or punishment. I take only two, but they are the more serious-dismissal , or reduction of rate of pay. ' We provide in clause 63, and its four sub-clauses, how those niatters shall be dealt with. A Board is to be appointed consisting of one representative of the employees and one representative of the Commissioner, who shall not be an officer of the branch in which the employee serves, while a third member is to be appointed by the Minister. He is to be a judicial officer, and will be a Police Magistrate of the State in which the matter is decided. The Board will investigate the Commissioner's finding with regard to the dismissal or reduction of rate of pay, and its decision will be final ",28
173,Mr CORSER,ALLOTMENTS,Are fines to be dealt with in the same way?,28
174,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"Wo t unless they involve a reduction of pay. We have taken the two more serious matters. I tliink it would be injudicious-and experience proves that it would be-to provide for an appeal in respect of every kind of complaint. Many frivolous complaints are made,, and this vast machine might be called into use to deal with a case not worth trying. As long as we safeguard a man's rate of pay and his position in the Department we give him, I think, all that is necessary.",28
175,Mr WEST,ALLOTMENTS,Me n are often punished for small things. Mr .WATT - I admit that. I myself have been so punished.,28
176,Mr JH CATTS,ALLOTMENTS,"In New South Wales questions of rank, grade, or pay may form the subject of appeal.",28
177,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"I am aware that under the New South Wales Act a third cause of appeal is provided for. "" Rank,"" after all, is a question of status, and "" grade "" is almost the same thing. I do not think Ave need do that.",28
178,Mr ARCHIBALD,ALLOTMENTS,If a man is disrated he has the right of appeal.,28
179,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"When a man has done good service as a shunter, signalman, fireman, or engine-driver, but loses his quickness of vision or his appreciation of colour, the question of reducing his status and his pay from, say, 14s. to l is . per day often crops up. That is a fit cause for appeal. Such a man has given willing service, but some of the infirmities of nature overtake him and render it impossible for him to go on giving the same service.",28
180,Mr FENTON,ALLOTMENTS,Some men have beeu treated disgracefully.,28
181,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"I think they have, but not in many qf the States.",28
182,Mr ARCHIBALD,ALLOTMENTS,"Such , a case as the Minister has mentioned would be a case of disrating.",29
183,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"In that case there would be the right of appeal. The retiring age is fixed, by clause 54, at sixty-five, but a man may retire at sixty. He has to get the Commissioner's consent, and theoretically the Commissioner might retain him in the service, although he wished to retire, but, in actual practice, if a man wants to leave, he leaves at sixty. There is also a provision for temporary employment, as is necessary in all railway services. In this case the Minister must approve. The maximum term in ordinary cases is to be six months, in exceptional cases nine months. This again is based on the experience of the Public and Railway Services of the States.",29
184,Mr JH CATTS,ALLOTMENTS,Why should not a temporary employee as well as a permanent employee have the right of appeal?,29
185,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,I do not think that that is ever given.,29
186,Mr JH CATTS,ALLOTMENTS,It is given in New South Wales.,29
187,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,It is not given in the Victorian or in any other Act with which I am familiar.,29
188,Mr FINLAYSON,ALLOTMENTS,I thought there were to be no permanent employees.,29
189,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"There are to be no permanent employees, but the offices are to be permanent. This clause contemplates the appointment of temporary men to temporary offices, and in order not to abuse it, and to insure that the employment shall really be temporary, a limitation is placed on the term. Two funds are to be created - One is a plant and stores suspense account. Honourable members who have had experience of railway matters will know how valuable that has proved in Australia. It enables you to properly debit your works, to buy at the right time if you are operating with judgment, and to use your suspense account as a pool into which your purchases go, and out of which they come for construction and maintenance purposes, so that the account is automatically adjusted. Only such money as Parliament provides is to be paid into the fund. The other fund to be created is the railway accident and insurance fund. That will be financed by taking from the receipts of the Railway Department one quarter per cent, of the annual revenue, or 5s.' per £100. When the fund reaches £20,000 that contribution will be automatically cut off. The purposes of the fuud are set out in clause 58.",29
190,Mr JH CATTS,ALLOTMENTS,Is there any provision for employees injured in the performance of their duties?,29
191,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,That is embodied in clause 58.,29
192,Mr JH CATTS,ALLOTMENTS,There does not appear to be any provision for accidents to employees in clause 58.,29
193,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,Clause 86 applies the provisions of the Commonwealth Workmen's Compensation Act 1912 to cases of accident to employees. Clause 58 makes special provisions for third parties and others.,29
194,Mr FENTON,ALLOTMENTS,Is'ther e to be compulsory insurance in regard to permanent employees ?,29
195,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"No , that is not in the Bill at all. The part dealing with the construction of new railways begins at clause 59. The theory of the construction of railways is this: The initiation of a construction proposition shall rest with the Minister, and not with the Commissioner. If the Minister is satisfied by evidence submitted to him by deputations or. representations that it is desirable to investigate a proposition, he may employ the Commissioner's staff and services to ascertain the data connected with it. If he is satisfied that it is worth referring to the Public Works Committee, this Bill provides that it shall be referred in the manner prescribed by the Public Works Committee Act.",29
196,Mr KELLY,ALLOTMENTS,What functions will the Public Works Committee fulfil in that investigation ?,29
197,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,The same functions as the Railways Standing Committees of all the States perform.,29
198,Mr KELLY,ALLOTMENTS,No - They inquire into the paying probabilities of the line.,29
199,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,This requires our Public Works Committee to do the same.,29
200,Mr KELLY,ALLOTMENTS,"All our lines are not going to pay, so what is the use of referring ,them to the Public Works Committee ?",29
201,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"The honourable member must not ""look so blackly on the east."" Propositions may be made to us for lines that will pay.",29
202,Mr FINLAYSON,ALLOTMENTS,The Publio Works Committee Act gives much wider powers than the honourable member for Wentworth suggests.,30
203,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"The honourable member for Wentworth will know that on reflection. The idea is to keep the forms and procedure of the Public Works Committee Act, but we do one thing additional. We enact that, after the matter has been referred to the Committee and the report has been received, and after the Minister has moved the authorization for the line by resolution, as provided in the Bill , we cannot construct the railway unless we bring down a special Bill . In clause 62 we enumerate the specific information which must be embodied in that Bill . ""This is (1)- A detailed description of the route of the proposed railway; (2) the l i m it of deviation; (3) the maximum cost of the proposed railway.",30
204,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ALLOTMENTS,Thos e are the dinary provisions in Bailway Acts in tralia.,30
205,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"They have had to be adapted, because we had to take our Public Works Committee Act , which differs many ways from the State Railways .Standdealt ing Committee Acts, and work it into this Bill . Bill , but with the necessary adjustments the same principles are followed. provision will be an additional guarantee to Parliament of circumspect procedure the construction of futur e railway lines.",30
206,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ALLOTMENTS,This does not apply to the construction 6f sidings?,30
207,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"No . Once the proposishall tions are passed by Parliament in due form, the Commissioner' is charged with the responsibility of constructing the way. That is on the lines of all our way Acts so far, the only difference being that sometimes in .the States a special struction authority has been created. We do not propose to do that. The construcdulgencesand tion powers are all set out in clauses 64, 65, and 66. There are the usual tions on the authority of the Commissioner in relation t b parks, roads, and things that kind. In those cases, Ministerial proval is necessary. The penalty sections, which are covered by part VI . , are the usual ones. Small penalties are dealt with in by-laws; large row. penalties involving heavy fines or i m prisonment, are specially prescribed in the clauses of the Bill . There is Bill. 446 present State laws, ample authority, and we need not re-enact it here, for the punishment of more serious offences against railway construction, such as obstructing a line and causing death or in j u r y to human beings. The liability ""of the Commissioner for death or total disablement is limited to £2,000, as in most Railway Acts, with a maximum liability of £1,000 for' partial disablement. Claims for vast sums have sometimes been put in against the State Railway Accident Funds by earners of heavy incomes, or their relatives, and the States have almost invariably found it necessary to specify a maximum liability. The provisions relating to accidents are the same as those of the State laws. Reports of accidents must be supplied to the Minister, .and the Minister has certain powers. The Commissioner may examine immediately all the injured persons, so as to see that evidence is not faked, for the purpose of claims against the accident orfund , and the workers are covered b>* the Ausprovisions of the Workers Compensation Act. By-laws are provided for in part VIII . , in which also covers the various matters not with specifically, in the clauses of the The safeguard which the House has is that the Governor General has to That approve of the by-laws.",30
208,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ALLOTMENTS,Are they to be in laid on the table of the House ?,30
209,Mr WATT,ALLOTMENTS,"Not as the B i ll is framed. If honourable members desire that they be, that is a minor matter. I did not intend to take half the time. I have taken in discussing this measure, but there railis so much interesting data which honorRailable members may reflect on that I was tempted f o embark upon a much longer conspeech than I at first iEhoupht desirable. 1 thank honourable members for their in hope they w i ll deal considerately with the Bill , and give it as limitaswift a passage as possible.",30

Debate resumed from 18th July (vide page 236), on motion by Mr HUGHES Tliat this Bill be now read a second time.",30
212,Mr MATHEWS,ALLOTMENTS,"Melbourne Ports) [6.5] - The Government are endeavouring by this Bill to make provision for our returned soldiers in a direction that, I admit, is commendable and quite justified. The object is to secure for the men from the Front permanence of employment in the Public Service as far as that is possible. Under the Public Service Act, temporary employment is limited to six months, which, however, is at times exceeded owing to the fact that departmental heads are loath to part with, men who have proved themselves particularly adapted for the duties allotted to them. It does not follow that justice is always done to the whole of the temporary hands under such an arrangement; and it must be admitted that in such a matter as this it is exceedingly hard, if not impossible, to please everybody. For good or evil, we have in this community a large section of elderly men, who, in their youth, were able to perform hard, if not excessively heavy work, but who in their declining years find themselves compelled to rely more or less on temporary employment in the Public Service for the maintenance of themselves and their families. These men have in various ways made themselves exceedingly useful, and their employment, under the'circumstances is full y warranted. Of course, I do not wish to advocate the claims of these men as against the claims of those who return from the Front, for such an attitude would be both foolish and u n fair ; and theire is no disputing the fact that the men who have fought for us should be assured some permanence in their employment. While the Government by moral suasion may arrange with private employers to give certain facilities to returned men in the way of obtaining a means of livelihood, there is no doubt chat the community will look to the Government to do their utmost in this direction by means of this and similar measures. I do not know that the Govern-1 ment will attain all they desire. Positions in the public Departments may not always be found suitable for men who hnvfi bpen away fighting the battles of the country, bub we ought to give the plan a trial. It may be that in many of the Departments returned soldiers will be found altogether unfitted for the work open to them; but at the same timethe Government are quite justified in introducing this measure. I trust that, while paying every attention to our soldiers, we shall not altogether forget thab great class of elderly unemployed men, whose condition is the production of our present economic system. Rightly or wrongly, these men expect that in our present state of civilization they will be allowed to exist, because if they are not given employment, they and their families will very soon find themselves on short commons. The Government, however, made certain promises to our young men when they enlisted, and"" those promises must be fulfilled . If the Government believe that by a measure of this character they are assisting the repatriation scheme, I fancy they will find that they are making a great mistake. I am with the Government to the h i l t in their desire to meet the case of the returned soldiers by providing them with some source of permanent employment, but it must not be thought that the present proposal will , in the opinion of those soldiers, adequately honour the promises made when they enlisted.",31
213,Mr GROOM,ALLOTMENTS,The honourable member means thab the Bill does not cover the whole of the promise made to the soldiers.,31
214,Mr MATHEWS,ALLOTMENTS,It hardly touches it. One could hardly conceive the Government desiring to get out of their responsibilities to the returned soldiers by such a Bill .,31
215,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ALLOTMENTS,The Commonwealth Government will donothing for the returned soldiers; they will pass bhem on to the States.,31
216,Mr MATHEWS,ALLOTMENTS,"I am quite in sympathy with the interjection, but if such a statement was made outside by the honourable member, much as he is admired by the people of Australia, the "" booby hatch "" would be the place for him. - Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - I am not a f r a id of saying it outside, and I will say it here on the adjournment.",31
217,Mr MATHEWS,ALLOTMENTS,If the honourable member expressed himself like that outside he would be told that he was interfering with recruiting. I would not like to see the honourable member interned. Similar expressions have placed men in durance vile.,31
218,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ALLOTMENTS,When you Ministers of cases they take no notice of you. I will take the risk of expressing my opinion. 1,32
219,Mr MATHEWS,ALLOTMENTS,"It is a positive fact that Ministers do not fake much notice of honourable members' representations. The opinion expressed by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro is held by 90 per cent, of the people. is only patch-work legislation. rather think the Ministry look upon this Bill as a stage in their repatriation scheme. I would not have spoken upon it but for the fact that I am rather suspicious of it - What does it mean to the man who has gone to the Front, and come back in such a condition that he cannot work ? Men who are away from their avocations for two years will return altogether unfitted for their customary means of livelihood.  that phase of the question.",32
220,Mr MATHEWS,ALLOTMENTS,We are told that the Bill is to insure to the returned soldiers certain positions in the Commonwealth Service without having to pass the prescribed examinations which are enforced on ordinary individuals.  sort. The soldier must pass the necessary examination.,32
221,Mr MATHEWS,ALLOTMENTS,"At any rate, there is to be no limitation in regard to age.  tion.",32
222,Mr MATHEWS,ALLOTMENTS,"Unde r the Public Service Act the clerical examination prescribed for applicants outside the Service is harder than that which a man in the General Division of the Service is called upon to pass. I agree that those who have been to the Front should have certain advantages over those who are outside the Public Service, but I do not believe that the principle of holding these positions open to .the men who have been to the Front will meet with their approval. Those who have been away and have come back, and those who write to us from the Front, say that fhey feel they are, and will be, altogether unfitted to again follow their former occupations. I have received a letter from my nearest relation, who has had to work from a very early age. He writes from the Second Birmingham Hospital, and says many that he will not be able to follow the ordinary work at which he was employed betell fore he went away. Of course, if this is intended to apply only to those who enlisted and did not go away, I would not alter the present arrangement. Some went away in troopships, and came back immediately afterwards.",32
223,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,What is the honourable member's objection to the Bill ?,32
224,Mr MATHEWS,ALLOTMENTS,"The life the men This lead at the Front will unfit them for I following the ordinary occupations they followed before their departure, therefore this Bill will be of very little value to the general body of men who have been at the Front.",32
225,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,"How do you make that out? If the Bill is not passed, they are in the same position as they are now.",32
226,Mr MATHEWS,ALLOTMENTS,That is so.,32
227,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,Does this Bill make the soldier's position any better? ,32
228,Mr MATHEWS,ALLOTMENTS,"I admit that, but if it is intended to lessen the responsibility of the Government in regard to repatriation, the relief will be infinitesimal.",32
229,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,"Of course, but this is only one of the things that ought to be done. If a man goes to the Eront, and if he is away two or three years, and thus has got out of the way of passing examinations, he ought not to be handicapped by age or examinations more than is necessary.",32
230,Mr MATHEWS,ALLOTMENTS,"I quite agree with that, but I do not think the Bill will have quite the effect which the Prime Minister expects.",32
231,Mr ARCHIBALD,ALLOTMENTS,Tim e will show that. Why should these soldiers be treated differently from other soldiers whb have returned to civil life?,32
232,Mr MATHEWS,ALLOTMENTS,T i the honourable member had had as much experience of returned soldiers as I have had he would not expect many to pass the examination.,32
233,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,"What does the honourable member or any man know about the prescribed examination? I could set examinations which could be passed, and likewise I could set examinations that could not be passed. In this Bill we propose to give returned soldiers an examination which they can pass.",32
234,Mr MATHEWS,ALLOTMENTS,"A l r e a d y inside the Service, in the General Division, we have examinations in which men do not compete with those from outside.",32
235,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,"Unde r this Bill returned soldiers will have an advantage over the "" stay-at-homes,"" and I think they ought to.",33
236,Mr MATHEWS,ALLOTMENTS,"V e r y well, we will leave it at that, but I hope the Ministry will not regard this measure as an excuse for not having a more comprehensive repatriation scheme.",33
237,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,Of course not. This is intended to open an avenue of employment to returned soldiers.,33
238,Mr MATHEWS,ALLOTMENTS,"I agree with that, but I hope the Prime Minister does not wish us to believe it is going to be an enormous benefit to the returned",33
239,Unknown,ALLOTMENTS,Sitting suspended from 6.S0 to 745 p.m.,33
240,Mr TUDOR,ALLOTMENTS,"Yarra) [7.45] - The . object of the Bill is to insure that returned soldiers shall have a greater' opportunity of getting into the Public Service than they would have had as private citizens. That purpose has my approval. I understand that clause 2 will allow men up to the age of fifty years to submit themselves for a clerical examination. Will that be the same, examination as is passed by boys desiring to enter the Service ?",33
241,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,It will be a prescribed examination.,33
242,Mr TUDOR,ALLOTMENTS,In clause 3 it is proposed to exempt returned soldiers from the time l i m it which the Public Service Act places upon temporary employment.,33
243,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,They will be exempt from the operation of the section which puts a period to their employment. as temporary officers.,33
244,Mr TUDOR,ALLOTMENTS,This practically makes a new class of public servant.,33
245,Mr GROOM,ALLOTMENTS,"It removes, for the time being, the time l i m it for temporary hands.",33
246,Mr TUDOR,ALLOTMENTS,"I suggest to the Prime Minister that this Bill will give to the men who return first a greater opportunity than will be enjoved by those who return later. The Public Service can absorb only a certain number of employees of this class. The report of the Public Service Commissioner states that - there are in the Commonwealth Service some 16,000 temporary employees. those, a great number are women who are engaged in cleaning, men employed at rush work in the Postal Department at Christmas time, and all the oflicials employed at contract and other post-offices which are not oflicial offices, and men employed on construction work in connection with telephones. It is apparent, therefore, that not many returned soldiers .can be found employment in this way. I should like to make a plea for another class of men. We heard mention today of a man who had been employed for one year and ten montlis in the Home and Territories Department, and who has five sons, four of whom have gone to the Front from Australia, whilst the fifth has been called up in England. Of the five, two havemade the supreme sacrifice. It seems to me that men such as that father should have as good a soldiers. chance in the Public Service as a returned soldier. I quoted the case the other day of a married man who had been employed in one of the Departments and had given satisfaction. He was over the military age, and he had six children, but no son old enough to enlist. H is position was declared vacant, and a returned soldier who had not the same responsibilities was appointed in his stead. Whilst I am in favour of this Bill , I say there are other citizens who deserve consideration. I know that mv sr""?estion will entaii difficulties in administration, but men whose sons have gone to the Front, or men who are unable to go because of their age, but have done their best in serving the country, are entitled to consideration as well as men who have actually served with the Expeditionary Force. I do not know whether other honourable members have had sent t b them the following letter: 96 Gatehouse-street, Parkville, ' 18th June, 1917. Mr A. H. Hunt, Meteorological Bureau, Melbourne. Dear Sir,In re, one week's notice given me by Mr. Curtain, that my services will not be required so as to employ a returned soldier. I respectfully submit the following statements, and ask for further consideration of the matter before a final decision is made. In ""Win-the-war"" policy adopted by the Government I am not aware what you and the Public Service Commissioner, officers holding high rank in the Service, have done towards that end. I feel persuaded that my family contribution will compare favourably with Of either or any oflicer in your Department. I have four sons at the front, two of them "" ANZAC Heroes,"" who have made the full sacrifice, a third son wounded in action, and is now in an English hospital, a fourth somewhere in France, a fifth son in England, conscripted, but exempted up to the last time of hearing, a total of five sons already involved; in addition,' there is a further liability of having live other sons taken under conscription, which now appears imminent, and which is apparently the only way. As this is the first engagement I have had under the Commonwealth since I registered for employment on the loth September, 190S, allowing for transfer from the Census Bureau, having more than once applied, in writing, on personal grounds to the Commissioner for employment without receiving an acknowledgement, although I have been employed by the State Government for five and a half years, during that time giving effective service, for which I hold first-class references from the different Departments. My sons, in fighting for King and country and home, and freedom, had reasonable expectations that their father would have granted to him the usual privileges allowed temporary ollieers, including length of service. I know some of my colleagues have been engaged over two years. It will not be two years until the 4th October, 1917, since I started. I appeal to you, Sir, as representing the powers that be, on behalf of my loyal soldier -' True Heroes,"" who will never return, not to be a party in doing this injustice, which, if done, I shall consider my sons have died in vain, and it will be a glaring illustration of whiit happens to reputable citizens under military law. Yours faithfully, I am not responsible for the phraseology of that letter, but I submit that a man who has given five sons in this war is worthy of consideration at the hands of the Government.",33
247,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,"Of course he the honourable member is asking for consideration for the man who has not given any sons, on the ground that as he had none to give he could not give any.",34
248,Mr TUDOR,ALLOTMENTS,"I say that a man with six children, all of whom are too young for military service, whilst he is too old to enlist, ought not to be turned out of temporary Government employment which cannot last longer than six months.",34
249,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,Where are we to draw the line?,34
250,Mr TUDOR,ALLOTMENTS,"Every Minister has a right to consider cases on their merits, and we should not enact that the first soldier to return shall be exempt fro m the temporary employment . limitation. The effect of clause 3 will be that the men who return first will have an opportunity of entering the Service, whilst the men who come back later wil l have no - pportunity at all .",34
251,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,Suppos e we postpone doing anything until every man has returned ?,34
252,Mr TUDOR,ALLOTMENTS,"I would not - do that. I have never objected to the extension of the term of temporarv employment for returned soldiers, but I contend that the Ministry should consider the position of every other indivdual in the community.",34
253,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,We will.,34
254,Mr TUDOR,ALLOTMENTS,"The Customs Department employs fewer temporary hands than any other branch of the Commonwealth Service, but temporary hands in that Department must be of a very reliable character.' They are employed in watching vessels, and men engaged on that work, especially in connection with boats from the Orient, must be persons on whom the Collector can absolutely rely. It has been said to these watchers in Sydney, and probably in every other port, "" Turn your head for 10 seconds and you can have £ 5 0 . "" We know what ruses are resorted to in order to smuggle opium. I suppose the Prime Minister has heard that statement on the wharfs.",34
255,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,"I have not: but it is the best price I have ever heard offered for - turning one's head. (Signed) , C. H . YATES.",34
256,Mr TUDOR,ALLOTMENTS,I have not the slightest doubt that the Prime Minister has had brought under his notice examples of smuggling.',34
257,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,I have heard of cases of the very men who made the most outcry is; but about the Maltese allowing them to land for £ 5 per head.,34
258,Mr TUDOR,ALLOTMENTS,"I am not dealing with that question. What I am suggesting is that, in their desire to assist returned soldiers, the Government should not do something unfair or injurious to other equally reputable citizens who have done as well for the community.",34
259,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ALLOTMENTS,"I read the letter from Mir. Yates, which the honourable member has quoted, and it struck me thati if he had been an ordinary temporary employee he was not entitled to more than six months' employment in any case, whilst, if he was an exempt man because his services were particularly valuable, he would not have been turned out.",34
260,Mr TUDOR,ALLOTMENTS,He was turned out. He was at work in the Meteorological Bureau.,34
261,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ALLOTMENTS,W as he one of the exempted men?,34
262,Mr TUDOR,ALLOTMENTS,"He must have had an exemption, because he was more than six months in the Service. I put it to the Prime Minister to say that no injustice should be done to citizens who are not returned soldiers. I am in favour of the time for examination being extended to any person.",35
263,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,"Does the honourable gentleman not draw a distinction between those who have done their duty to the country and those who have not? Whether those who have not gone to the Front could not have done so is, of course, another matter. The honourable gentleman and I could not go by reason of age. That could not be helped; but there are others who have gone to the Front.",35
264,Mr TUDOR,ALLOTMENTS,"There are many men who have not been able to go because of physical disability. There are men who, because of defects due to accident at birth or after birth, have been unable to enlist. It is most difficult for these persons to secure employment, and it is not fair that they should be debarred an opportunity to qualify for employment in the Pubiic Service.",35
265,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,Is the honourable gentleman speaking now of temporafy^br permanent employment?,35
266,Mr TUDOR,ALLOTMENTS,"I am speaking of both. It is, in my opinion, quite right to allow men who have been to the Front to present themselves for examination up to fifty years of age. v Mr HUGHES - What is the l i m it as to age now, and how long has it been in force ?",35
267,Mr TUDOR,ALLOTMENTS,"The l i m it now as to age is twenty-three years, and it has been in force for' sixteen years, or since Federation was established.",35
268,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,And only now has any one said one word against it .,35
269,Mr TUDOR,ALLOTMENTS,There have always been complaints about it .,35
270,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,"How many Cabinets have the honourable gentleman and I sat in , and permitted that to continue""?",35
271,Mr TUDOR,ALLOTMENTS,"In three different Cabinets, but there Was no opportunity to amend the Public Service Act . The Prime Minister must know that if the Public Service Act could have been amended it was proposed to alter the law very drastically in many directions.",35
272,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,But not in that tion.,35
273,Mr TUDOR,ALLOTMENTS,"I say that that is one of the provisions which it was proposed to alter. Surely the Prime Minister does not expect a man to pass at fifty years of age the examination which he passed as a youth fresh from college or from school! I suppose that even men already in the Service could not pass at fifty years of age the examination which they passed in order to get into the Service. But although they could not do this they are probably much better servants of the public now, because^of their experience, than they were when they entered the Service. I am anxious in this matter that justice should be done to the men who have returned from the Front, and also to those who will yet return. I do not desire that all the positions available in the Public Service should be filled by men who have returned up to the present time, but that some should be available for those who have yet to return, and also for men who, like Mr Yates, have had sons at the Front. I do not say that such men are entitled to any of the glory which belongs to their sons, but they ought not to be debarred from obtaining positions in the Government Service merely because they were too old to enlist or were physically unfit to go to the Front.",35
274,Mr FENTON,ALLOTMENTS,"Maribyrnong ) [8.1]. - There is some danger that injustice may be done under the Government proposal. During the refreshment hour I received a letter from a returned soldier who was pleading on behalf of a man who has been turned out of employment to make room for a returned soldier, although this man himself has been rejected twice when applying to enlist. Now, finding himself out of employment, he has applied for the t h i r d time to enlist, and up to the present, so far as he knows, he has not been accepted. I do not suppose that it is the intention of any honourable member to deprive men who have tried to enlist, and have been rejected, for services abroad, of what might be termed their legitimate occupations. It may be .that in many cases returned soldiers will have a better claim to consideration, but there are cases in which men who are the bread winners of f a m i lies have tried to enlist and have been rejected, and these men ""have to shoulder direca greater responsibility than has a returned soldier who is a single man. It is, therefore, necessary that there should be room for some discrimination. Minister for Home and Territories agrees with the Prime Minister as to the treatment meted out to Mr Yates, who was employed in the Meteorological Bureau. He is endeavouring to find another berth in his Departmeut for this man, who is i the father of five sons, four of whom, have gone from Australia to the Front, and two of whom have made the .supreme sacrifice. It is admitted that an injustice has been committed in the case of this man.",35

He was practically considered an exempt oflicer, otherservants, wise he would not have been continued in his employment, as he was, for a year and ten months. It is, I think, unreasalary sonable in the circumstances that his vices should have been dispensed w in order to make room for a returned soldier.",36
276,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,I think that his an exceptional case. Such a man ought not to be discharged merely to make room for someone else.,36
277,Mr FENTON,ALLOTMENTS,"That is so, but is the reason given by the Minister. Minister for Home and Territories the same view of this case as the Prime Minister. He has been so much impressed with the representations made on behalf of Mr Yates that he is prepared to find policy. some other position for him.",36
278,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,The law will be administered on those lines.,36
279,Mr FENTON,ALLOTMENTS,"I am desirous tha: timilar mistakes may not occur in future. Mr Yates made his grievan'je known - bo members of Parliament and the Minister, but there are many sons who although, perhaps, complaini in their home circle, are content to main quiet under an injustice, and thereclause 5. fore geb no redress of grievances. It is, therefore, important to do in advance what may be possible to prevent injustice. merely to leave.",36
280,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,The Bill did not create She trouble in Mr Yates' case.,36
281,Mr FENTON,ALLOTMENTS,"No ; but we must vent similar injustice happening uuder I take this opportunity to bring notice the case of certain men- I mind particularly the case phone mechanics-wh o prior to the outThe break of war qualified for permanent appointment, but have been denied - such appointment because of the war. Certain telephone mechanics went to the trouble and expense of attending technical schools to qualify for permanent employment, and met in every way the requirements of the Public Service Commissioner and the Deputy Postmaster-General, but, owing to the outbreak of war, they have not been given the permanent appointments they were seeking. Many of these follow men are married and have family responis sibilities, and some of them have volunteered to go to the Front, but were rethis jected. The case of these men deserves o r which he immediate attention. Serious injustice is often done to public too, by the provision of the Act which requires those who receive promotions to positions carrying certain rates of to increase their insurance policies. serI have in mind the case of men who came it h into the Commonwealth Service from the service of a State, and whose salaries were increased from time to time by the custois quite mary increments. When the last increment came to some of them, they were nearly sixty years of age, and as its acceptance involved the increasing of their insurance policy premiums, this meant a that serious burden to them, because at thenThe age insurance premiums are very high. takes I think that when a public servant who has given f a it h f u l service for a number of years reaches mature age, he should not be compelled to increase his insurance",36
282,Mr SPEAKER,ALLOTMENTS,The honourable member is going beyond the scope of the Bill .,36
283,Mr FENTON,ALLOTMENTS,There are some of the these cases whioh I intend to bring personally under the notice of the Prime lo Minister. I wish to know if munition perworkers who have gone abroad will be in ig the same position as returned soldiers. I re- - invite the attention of the Minister to,36
284,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,That clause applies ',36
285,Mr FENTON,ALLOTMENTS,"In clause 2 it is provided that returned men not more than prefifty years of age mav be appointed to the it . Clerical Division upon passing "" the preunderscribed examination."" Does that mean havei n the examination provided for by the of certain telePublic Service Act ?",36
286,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,"It does not mean the examination now prescribed, but such examination as may herea'fter be prescribed.",37
287,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ALLOTMENTS,"Flinders) [8.12] - I think that honourable members generally are in favour of giving preference in Government employment to returned soldiers, but in, doing that we must have regard, as far as possible, to the rights of the present members of the Publio Service, and to the efficiency of. the Service. As to our public servants, I say . as clearly as I can, that if this State does not choose to impose. on its citizens of military age the duty to serve at the Front at such a time as this, I am entirely opposed to any indirect action for achieving the same end, whether it be termed economical or indirect conscription. Unless we impose by Act of Parliament on all capable of serving, the duty, if called upon, to serve as soldiers, we should not adopt any indirect method of achieving that end. Those who have entered the Public Service by passing the necessary examination have given up their chances of other employment, and have made a contract with the State which we cannot justly set aside in order to impose indirectly on them a duty which we do not impose on other citizens. The Bill contains two parts which are entirely distinct, and should be approached, I think, from different standpoints. Clause 2, as I read it, deals with the door to the Public Service proper; clause 3 is concerned with a class of Government employment which has always been considered outside the Public Service proper. I should like to know, regarding clause 2, whab is precisely the intention of the Government. As I read the clause, its only effecb is to enable tain persons, who, under the Act, could only enter the Service if not more than twenty-three years of age, to enter it if under fifty years of age, but they must begin at the lowest rung of the ladder. Is thab the intention? i",37
288,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,"That point has been noted, and we intend to move an amendment, which, if carried, will enable the Public Service Commissioner to appoint them to any class or division.",37
289,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ALLOTMENTS,"I was in doubt as to whether that was the intention of the Government. In its present form the Bill will permit of returned soldiers entering our Public Service only at the lowest rung of the ladder, thereby receiving a salary of £126 per annum. I do not say that that may not be a very considerable boon to men who are already moreor less advanced in years. But I raised the question because I was not certain as to what were the intentions of the Government. If they intend to submit an amendment which will enable the Public Service Commissioner to draft into the Commonwealth Service returned soldiers who have passed the prescribed examination, there will undoubtedly be a great demand amongst those men for positions of the higher kind, and its effect will be to simply swamp the avenues of promotion open to other members'of the Service. But to my mind the more serious and difficult question is that raised in regard to .temporary employment. I am afraid that this provision will introduce a very serious alteration in the whole character of our Public Service. I feel somewhat diffident about speaking on this subject in any sense which might be regarded as being opposed to <theinterests of our returned soldiers. But from the first Public Service Act passed by this Parliament to the last amendment of it, one general principle has permeated it . We have called into existence a defined permanent Public Service in Australia to perform departmental functions. Its personnel is determined by certain .examinations, and it is protected by a certain classification,, but the permanent Public Service is limited to a definite class of public duties which have to be performed in connection with the government' of every country. But whilst recognising that particular principle, the framers of our Public Service Acts also foresaw the necessity for employing a considerable body of temporary cer- labour from time to time. Consequently provision has been made for employing labour or clerical assistance for certain purposes which are outside the ordinary departmental functions. But Parliament has always adhered to this principle, that, in regard to outside labour, it should, generally speaking, be maintained as temporary. Accordingly in all the legislation that has been passed, provision has been . inserted that such temporary labour should not be continued for a period longer than six months, with a possible extension of three months. Now, as the Prime Minister Knows, it has been found necessary to modify that provision from time to .tome. Another portion of our Publio Service Act exempts certain omcers from the operation of that provision, makes them a kind of secondary public omcers. These include a considerable number of persons employed in the Postal Department. I repeat that they a kind of secondary Public Service status because of the duties - - which they discharge. But, in addition, there are, I am told, at least 3,000 men emas possible. ployed under the strict temporary provisions of the Public Service Act .",37
290,Mr FINLAYSON,ALLOTMENTS,Is that all ?,38
291,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ALLOTMENTS,"Sometime there are more and sometimes there less. At Canberra, for example, and other public works, it has become practice not to hold over the men emam ployed the threat that they will lose their employment in six months. ' Mr Fenton - But they do not come under the Public Service Commissioner.",38
292,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ALLOTMENTS,"The particular class of officers with whom we are now dealing are temporary employees, throughout all the Departments. are now merely holding office for the remainder of their period of six or nine months as the case may be. The difficulty about this provision is that whilst Parliament, all its legislation, has rigorously i sisted upon the permanent Service of the country being conwho fined to those who have to deal with strictly departmental . functions, officers outside of these must always be regarded as temporary employees. In the Public Service Act of 1915, for instance, ment again asserted that particular prinlike ciple. B y section 7 of that Act , it enacted further, in order to strengthen the positionSection 40 of the principal by omitting sub-sections 3 and 4 thereof, and inserting in their stead the following sub-sections:(3) No person who has been temporarily employed in any Department six months continuously, or for months in the whole in any months, or for any extended period as hereinafter provided, shall the six months porary employment be eligible for further temporary employment the Public Service. . - No longer ago than the year .1915, Parliament again reasserted that principle, that employment by the Government, outside the regular Public Service, should be strictly of a temporary kind, that, it were desired to establish permanent and departments, the Government should in crease the Public Service, with a ll its rights, classifications, and privileges.",38
293,Mr ARCHIBALD,ALLOTMENTS,W as not the object to are given distribute the employment?,38
294,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ALLOTMENTS,"Probably one of the objects was to spread that temporary employment over as large an area But whether that be so or not, it has always been the principle that s the Government should not extend the are permanent Service beyond those DepartT on ments where it was necessary in the the interests of the Commonwealth. What I rather afraid of in regard to clause 2 of this Bill is that, read in conjunction with section 4 of the Amending Act of 1915, it will, almost inevitably, have the effect before long of adding to the permanent Public Service practically the whole of the 3,000 men who, up to now, have been kept as temporary officers. In other words, it may have the effect of They enormously increasing the permanent Public Service, because section 4 of the Act of 1915 inserted the following section in the principal Act throughout 26A. In the making of appointments to the n - Public Service from among persons who have successfully passed the prescribed examinaPublic tion, preference shall be given to those persons have served with satisfactory record in any Expeditionary Force raised under the provisions of the Defence Act 1903-1915. So that in making these appointments, a preference has been given to these men; Parliabut in the temporary branch, if you to call it a branch, the effect of the was present proposal will be to do away altogether with the temporary character of the employment so far as it refers to reAct is amended turned soldiers. > Mr HUGHES - Not necessarily; I do not agree with that view. What we do is to say that, so far as the lapse of a cerfor tain period of time is concerned, that is six not in itself to terminate the temporary twelve employment of the person so employed; during but he does not thereby become a perfollowing such temmanent officer.",38
295,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ALLOTMENTS,"I quite in agree with the Prime Minister as to that. In a legal sense, the man does not acquire a freehold office. I am afraid that a very large number of returned soldiers will desire, notwithstanding all our endeavours if to put them-into more reproductive fields - of effort, a somewhat easier mode of living in the Government employment. think that a very large number will avail themselves of this provision to come in and replace gradually, but certainly, and possibly quickly, the 3,000 men who are now engaged in doing Government work on temporary lines, and as they do replace those men they will become permanent in the sense that so long as any work of that kind is required they will be the persons to go on doing it .",38
296,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,If they are competent to do the work.,39
297,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ALLOTMENTS,Yes . think that the Prime Minister will agree with me in saying that the effect of that will be to add the total number of those persons to what is practically the permanent sendee of the Commonwealth.,39
298,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,"Le t the honourable and learned member apply that criticism, to the circumstances of those enlisting in the Attorney-General's Department in his time. We have to face the difficulty caused by the present absurd limitation.",39
299,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ALLOTMENTS,It is not an absurd limitation.,39
300,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,I think ib is.,39
301,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ALLOTMENTS,No . would very much sooner see the limitation wiped out altogether.,39
302,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,I agree with that.,39
303,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ALLOTMENTS,"Parliamen t has not yet been asked, nor is it now asked, to say that the limitation should be wiped out except in regard to returned soldiers. If it is wiped out we shall increase the whole burden of the Public Service very rapidly. Our attitude to these very difficult questions ought to be that of men who, whilst anxious to adopt every method of doing justice to those who are fighting for us, and finding employment for them in every way, still want to safeguard the public interest in connection with the Public Service. not be left out of mind that during the last few yea'rs, not in the Commonwealth only, but in all the States, the people of Australia have been, and are being, burdened with an ever-increasing Public Service. This will become soon a matter for most serious consideration by the Government and the Parliament. the Prime Minisber to take into consideration whether it is wise by one stroke of the pen to change the whole tenor of that kind of employment which Parliament I has hitherto decreed shall be temporary, and make it practically permanent. Though I quite admit., as the Prime M in ister points out, that it does not give the men in law a fee-simple to their office, still it would deprive the Public Service and the community of the whole protection which Parliament has thrown around that branch of the Public Service. I regard it as a matter for very serious consideration. The Prime Minister did not touch on this point in his speech",39
304,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,"No , because the point I did not appeal to me.",39
305,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ALLOTMENTS,"I am in clined to think - that we ought to go as far as we safely can to benefit the returned soldiers by giving them preference in temporary employment as well as admission to the Public Service without altering the general character of that temporary employment. I commend this view to the attention of the Prime Minr ister. I , for one, do not mean to oppose the proposal, but I think it is one which requires very serious consideration.",39
306,Mr FINLAYSON,ALLOTMENTS,"Brisbane) [8.33] I This is a Bill to amend the Public Service Act. . It is well known that - the principal Act requires very serious amendment. It was intended in 1913 to .very drastically amend the Act , and the instalment of amendments which we have before us now does nob help us very far. It seems to complicate the difficulties and rather to exaggerate the necessity for early attention to"" the matter. This is a Bill principally, if not entirely, to meet the case of returned soldiers. From that point of view it is very welcome. In view of the agitation in the country today for something in the nature of economic conscription to displace men who are in employment so that they may be forced to enlist, and the necessity for finding employment for returned solI t can- diers, the Government must necessarily set an example to the people. That is their policy. 'That is the plea they put forward during the last election campaign. It would obviously be inconsistent for the Government to expect the public to do something that they themselves are not prepared to do, in so far as they are able I urge to find employment for returned soldiers. That we ought to take the greatest care of returned soldiers is admitted. No member of this Parliament-n o citizenwould suggest that we should slacken in our responsibilities to tliem, for they have done a service to the country which entitles them to the utmost consideration There are two features of this Bill to which I object, and I propose later on to submit amendments which will somewhat overcome that objection. My first objection is that the Bill is confined only to turned soldiers ""and sailors. So far so good. But we are entirely overlooking the service that has been rendered by large numbers of women who have volunteered, a$id have served, and are serving, as nurses. No one can deny that the nurses have been rendering a most excellent service during this war. It is quite impossible to overestimate the value of that service.^ That being so, are they not equally entitled to some consideration? Having regard to the fact that so many of them are very capable for the performance of such duties as the Public Service requires, why should we not also include them within the scope of this measure?",39
307,Mr ABCHIBALD,ALLOTMENTS,We are including them.,40
308,Mr FINLAYSON,ALLOTMENTS,I do not know that the honourable member for Hindmarsh sliould be taken as an authority on the question of what is and what is not covered by this Bill. I am not prepared to accept his dictation on the subject.,40
309,Mr GREENE,ALLOTMENTS,Nurse s are included as members of the Expeditionary Forces.,40
310,Mr FINLAYSON,ALLOTMENTS,I should like to have that assurance from the Minister in charge of the Bill. The honourable gentleman is aware that I have given notice of an amendment providing that those who have served as nurses shall also come within the scope of this measure.,40
311,Mr GROOM,ALLOTMENTS,I have noted the honourable member's amendment.,40
312,Mr HIGGS,ALLOTMENTS,The Minister is not sure on the point as is the honourable member for Hindmarsh.,40
313,Mr FINLAYSON,ALLOTMENTS,"Is not the Minister prepared to say whether or not nurses come within the Bill ? I suppose he must first ask the ""Joss."" My argument is that it should be made quite clear that nurses, who have rendered very excellent and useful service during the war, should come under this Bill. One can readily bring to mind most useful positions in the Public Service which they could filL Many of them no doubt are professional women, trained to the particular profession which they follow, but it is quite possible that many nurses might be disposed to take advantage of an opportunity to enter the Public Service just as readily as returned soldiers and sailors. I contend that their rights are equally as strong, and their claims just as soundly based, as are those of our returned soldiers and sailors, and I hope that' the re- Minister, when the time comes, will accept my amendment. There is another point to which I desire to refer. Seeing that it is proposed to extend from twenty-three years to fifty years the maximum age at which a man may enter the Clerical Division, I do not think it fair to expect returned soldiers to undergo the same searching examination as those who enter at earlier ages. At the present time candidates for the Clerical Division of the Public Service must be not less than sixteen and not more than twenty-three years of age. Apart altogether from the argument put forward by the Leader of the Opposition as to the educational ability of a man between fortv and fifty to pass such an examination as would be prescribed for a youBg man of twenty-one or twenty-two, there is another point which, to my mind, is of more pressing importance. I propose to move an amendment providing that paragraph e of section 27 of the principal Act shall not apply in so far as the provisions of this Bill are concerned. That section provides thatRegulations may be made by the Governor General for the examination from time to time of persons desirous of admission into the Public Service. Such regulations shall prescribe(a) a preliminary medical examination or test as to the health of candidates. I suggest that that provision should be eliminated altogether so far as returned so soldiers, sailors, and nurses are concerned. Our experience of pasti wars, and the limited experience we have so far of the present war-a n experience which will be accentuated as the days go byshow that many men who went to the war physically and mentally fit, have come back, in many cases unfortunately, not only physically unfit, but very sadly rendered mentally unfit - Previous experience has shown-and our own observation in connection with this war confirms the experience-that many of these men for years to come will not be the same mentally as they were before the war. The effects of the terrific bombardments upon their nerves render them practically unfit for continuous service, and especially for continuous service of a mental character. Every honourable member must have had under his own notice the' case of men who, upon their return from the Front, have been employed in clerical positions, and who, for the first three or four days, have been able to do satisfactory work, Then the shell shock which they have suffered, with its attendant disarrangement and tearing of the nerves, affects them, and for two or three days they are nervous wrecks. They are temperamentally, mentally unfit. Are we going to ask these men, after the services they have rendered, and who, because of that service, have made themselves unfit, to pass an ordinary medical test, to undergo the same medical examination that young men who have never left the country, and who ought to be at the highest stage of mental activity, are required to undergo 1 This medical test will disqualify 75 per cent, of the returned soldiers.",40
314,Mr RILEY,ALLOTMENTS,The mere fact that these men have returned shows that they are not medically fit.,41
315,Mr FINLAYSON,ALLOTMENTS,"This applies not only to the men who have returned, but also to those who may return. But there are all the men who are still to return, and, to a greater or less extent, every man - who has had actual experience of the firing line will feel the effects for years to come. Those who have had narrow escapes from fatal accidents know that the worse effects are felt, not so much, at the time, but for years afterwards. I had a very narrow escape on one occasion, and the effects of it hung on me for years. It is a pity to ask these pooT fellows who come back from the trenches, to undergo a medical test before they can get the advantage of this amendment of the Public Service Act. It means imposing on them an unnecessary and stupid obligation. The Bill will create an entirely novel effect in the Public Service, which at present is roughly divided into permanent and temporary employees. This will create a new set of employees, neither permanent nor temporary. Although their employment will be permanent, they will be temporary employees, and, at the same time, they will have the privileges of permanent officers. One wonders how this is going to affect the general character of the Public Service. I am disposed to believe, with the honourable member for Flinders, that it will introduce a very disturbing factor into the Service. It is certain that the introduction of the men under this Bill will push out a large number who are now giving excellent service. What guarantee have - the Government that they will get equally good service from the men who are coming in? If the quality of the service they render is not to be taken into account, 'Obviously the public interests must suffer, and I contend that they will not be able, for a considerable time, to render equally efficient service, not through any fault of their own, but as the result of the experiences they have passed through in the fighting area. So that, when an amendment of the Public Service Act covering the whole ground does come, we shall be faced with a much more complicated position than that which now presents itself. The Government might well consider the suggestion of the honourable member for Flinders, so that, in giving the returned soldier preference of employment in the Service, we shall not be depriving him of a fair opportunity, on the one hand, or deprive the public of proper service on the other, or inflict an injustice on men who are now doing good work for the community in the Service.",41
316,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ALLOTMENTS,"Parkes) [8.50]. - The honourable member for Brisbane, with the very best intentions, is surrounding thiB Bill with difficulties which need not exist. He began by pointing out that the examination spoken of in clause 2 may be so difficult that a meritorious returned soldier, with shattered nerves, or with some other health difficulty, which would disqualify him for passing it, may be shut out from the Public Service. But he followed up that contention by pointing out the opposite extreme-that , unless we were very careful, we should fill the Service with men who were incompetent for the work. He seemed to me to answer himself, because the intention of the Bill is not to bring about a comprehensive review of the Public Service law, but merely to show that the Government are taking an early opportunity of convincing the public that they are going to do all they can to help the returned soldiers.",41
317,Mr WEST,ALLOTMENTS,An electioneering cry.,42
318,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ALLOTMENTS,"We have nearly two years and ten months to go before we face another election, and the honourable member knows that the public, as a rule, have very short memories; so that his little venture is not quite happy. The honourable member for Brisbane is correct in saying that if the examination is not properly conducted, or is not imposed at all, there will be a danger of flooding the Service with men who happen to be returned soldiers, but who .are not qualified to take a usef u l part in our Public Service work. It was never intended, for instance, that a farm servant should have his entry into the Public Service facilitated unless he has the qualifications required for the work. The Act requires, in the public interest, that before a man enters the clerical branch he shall show certain educational qualifications. He must show that he can write a fair hand, decipher a complicated document, and that he knows, at all events, a little about figures. Numbers of very honourable men, returning from the Front, previously followed occupations which would not enable them to pass an examination such as we require as a preliminary to entry into the Service. All this Bill does, and I believe it is subject to amendment, is to provide that a leturned soldier can enter the Service up to the age of fifty, provided that he can pass an examination which shows that he is a f it person to take a position. He may have been a farm labourer, but he may be an educated man; and the fact of his prev'ous occupation would not disqualify him from entering the Service if he could pass the examination. If the examination is made a mere excuse, or is rendered so simple that a man without sufficient education can pass it , I quite agree that there will be great danger of filling the Service with men who are not fit to do (he work which the public require. But so long as the examination furnishes a proper test, I think the Government are acting very generously in Baying, "" We will allow you to undergo that test and enter the Service up to the age of fifty, where hitherto you could not enter after the age of twenty-three."" So far, I see no fault to be found with clause 2. Clause 3, however, does raise a difficulty. It has not been mentioned in the debate, but most of us know that the objects of limiting temporary service to six months is to make room for others, in turn , who are desirous of employmentsI have known of scores of cases in which temporary hands have, at the end of six months, had their service extended for three months, and then have had to stand aside to allow others to come in . An y one who has attempted to get men into the Public Service temporarily will know that the inspectors often inform them that there are from 100 to 200 ahead of them in the list, and that they must await a vacancy. This clause extends a further privilege to returned soldiers. As I have said, a man who takes temporary work under normal conditions is limited to six months' or, probably, nine months' service. This Bill removes the limitation imposed under ordinary conditions, and is surely a fair concession; but the difficulty I see is that at the present time a man is very seldom or never dismissed before six months unless he has proved himself absolutely incompetent. If a returned soldier enters as a temporary servant, and is competent to do the work, I see no provision against his becoming, as the honourable member for Flinders has pointed out, a member of the second section of the permanent Public Service. I have no objection to that, but we must recognise at once that we are, by this means, going to make substantial additions to our permanent Service. We must remember that, whilst we provide in clause 2 that a man cannot enter the permanent Service without examination, we also offer him an opportunity to become a temporary servant without limitation and without any examination. That is an anomaly of which I should like the Minister to take notice. Under clause 2 we provide that a returned soldier may become a permanent public servant by passing the examination, but by clause 3 we say that a returned soldier may become a temporary employee without limitation 'and without examination. The only escape from this contradiction seems' to me to be that those who have charge of the Public Service will take good care not to place the men who enter as temporary servants, but haye no"" limitation on their term, in positions the attainment of which would entail on others the necessity of passing an examination before becoming what we call a permanent servant. I quite recognise the danger, pointed out by the honourable member for Flinders, of overfilling our Public Service, but, like every other Parliament, we must trust the permanent heads not to stuff the Service, and trust our Ministers from, time to time to review their Departments and see whether or not the Service is becoming overburdened. I see nothing in-the point raised by the honourable member for Brisbane. I take it , from what the Prime Minister has said, that some addition is to be made to clause 2, which will remove any difficulty we may have in our minds with regard to the qualifications required, for those who take a permanent place in © S 6rv ICQ",42
319,Mr JH CATTS,ALLOTMENTS,"Cook) [9.0] - The onus is on the Government to rehabilitate and rei-establish in civil life the soldiers who go to the war. There have been numberless promises to that effect, and I am glad to see that, in this Bill , the Govern-, ment recognise that principle. The Bill , however, has the maximum of profession and the minimum of performance. There is the limitation referred to by the honourable member for Brisbane in regard to the nurses. has reference to Expeditionary Forces raised under the provisions of the Defence Act. The honourable member for H in d marsh intimates that, in his opinion, this would include nurses, but the Minister in charge of the Bill , although pointedly asked to say officially that nurses are in cluded, is not prepared to do so.",43
320,Mr GROOM,ALLOTMENTS,I shall make a statement later on. *,43
321,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ALLOTMENTS,If the Bill does not include nurses we can easily make it do so.,43
322,Mr JH CATTS,ALLOTMENTS,The honourable member for Brisbane has given notice of an amendment to that effect.,43
323,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ALLOTMENTS,Would it not be easier for the Minister to give a definite answer on the point?,43
324,Mr JH CATTS,ALLOTMENTS,"The Minister cannot definitely answer such a question by, way of interjection. He, apparently, wishes time to explain. Another limitation pointed out by the honourable member for Brisbane is in connection with physical fitness; and, in my opinion, not 10 per cent, of the returned wounded soldiers now being discharged will be capable of being taken into the Public Service with the present standard. These men are being discharged as being physically unfit for military service, and the physical standard for the Public Service, under section - 27 of the original Act , is such that, though I cannot speak with certainty without further investigation, a large number, and the great majority, will not meet requirements.",43
325,Sir WILLIAMIBVINE,ALLOTMENTS,The examination for physical fitness is prescribed by regulation.,43
326,Mr JH CATTS,ALLOTMENTS,Any one who has had to do with the matter knows well that the medical test is a severe one.,43
327,Sir WILLIAMIBVINE,ALLOTMENTS,"The medical test can be made to suit the cases,",43
328,Mr JH CATTS,ALLOTMENTS,"There is no provision in the Bill for that. - Mr MCWILLIAMS - There are men physically unfit to go into the trenches', but quite fit to take a nice, soft Government position.",43
329,Mr JH CATTS,ALLOTMENTS,"I quite agree. The Bill is limited to the Clerical Division of the Public Service, and to what are known as temporary employees. The policy of the Government The Bill now is to close down public works, and this they are doing as fast as they can. They propose to cease practically the whole of the work at the Federal Capital, though I hope that they will not; but if they carry out their present intention, where is the work to come from for the temporary employees with the only avenues closed to these men? W it h the limited scope of the Bill , it is mostly placard. The Bill is a maximum of profession and a minimum of performance. There are four classes referred to in the Public Service Act . Section 15 divides the Public Service into the A d ministrative Division, the Professional Division, the Clerical Division, and the General Division. The Administrative Division includes all permanent heads of Departments, and all chief officers of Departments, and also all persons whose offices the Governor General directs to be included in such divisions. The Professional Division includes all officers whose duties require somespecial skill or technical knowledge usually acquired only in some profession or occupationx differing from the ordinary routine of the Public .Service. The Clerical Division includes all officers whose offices the Governor General, on the recommendation of the Public Service Commissioner, directs to be included in such division. The General Division includes all persons in the Public Service not included in the other three divisions. The great body of public servants is in .the General Division, but in this Bill there is no provision to permit of returned soldiers being in cluded in that division.",43
330,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ALLOTMENTS,What Professional Division ?,44
331,Mr JH CATTS,ALLOTMENTS,"Apparently , they are not allowed to be employed in the Professional Division, though many of these men have some special skill or technical knowledge. Many of them were skilled workers before they gave up their occupations in private life. As showing the area over which the Government proposes that this preference shall operate, I have tried to ascertain from the last report of the Public Service Commissioner the numbers grouped under the various headings of the Public Service. There should be a table in the Commissioner's annual report, setting out distinctly the number of persons employed in each division, but the information is not supplied. One can get a very good idea of the proportions in the different divisions from the increments granted. During the year covered by the report^ increments were granted as follows:-Administrative Division, £ 5 0 ; Professional, £ 2 , 7 1 8 ; Clerical-firstj . second, third, and fourth grades, £ 1 6 , 9 2 5 ; grade, £ 1 9 , 8 3 0; and General, £74,073 . As the increments in the higher branches of the Service are in comparatively large lumps, and those in the General Division are in smaller amounts, the £74,073 for the General Division must cover a very considerable body of men. I suppose thab this division represents about fourths of those who are engaged in the .service of the Commonwealth; yet there is no provision in this Bill to enable returned soldiers to be employed in it . ,",44
332,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ALLOTMENTS,Why not?,44
333,Mr JH CATTS,ALLOTMENTS,"On e reason may that the Government, having ready for the House, drafted the Bill without giving it proper consideration. As it stands now, ib is merely a placard. It enables returned soldiers to be ployed in the Clerical Division if they can pass the medical standard, and the a few cases of fitness. educational test. That is a very Bmall area of employment. It also enworth ables them to be employed in temporary employment when the Government are shutting down on works. But the door is shutagainst their admission into the General Division.",44
334,Mr GROOM,ALLOTMENTS,Every returned soldier can enter the General Division under section 32 of the principal Act.,44
335,Mr JH CATTS,ALLOTMENTS,"If the^ contention of the Honorary Minister is correct? that about the reburned soldiers can enter the General Division under section 32, there is no need for this Bill , because that section refers to the Clerical Division in exactly the same terms as are employed in relation to the General Division. The honourable member for Flinders very properly objects to economic conscription. This Government, of course, is endeavouring to enforce economic conscription.",44
336,Sir WILLIAMIBVINE,ALLOTMENTS,"Not "" under this Bill.",44
337,Mr JH CATTS,ALLOTMENTS,"Not under this Bill particularly, but the honourable member knows that the Government is endeavouring to enforce economic conscription in every way in its general administration.",44
338,Sir WILLIAMIBVINE,ALLOTMENTS,I do not know it.,44
339,Mr JH CATTS,ALLOTMENTS,"As I understand the objects of the Bill , it is not to dispossess any man of his position, but in the case of vacancies occurring,- the returned soldiers shall have the opportunity of employment in the Civil Service. The honourable member made a suggestion fifth in regard to the Bill which would have the very opposite effect to that to which he refers, and would be very objectionable. He claimed - that the rights of the existing civil servants should not be interfered with. Then he went on to refer to returned soldiers having to start at the bottom rung of three- the ladder, and he suggested that men of forty years or fifty years of age should not have to enter the Public Service at the lowest rung of the ladder. - Sir WILLIAM IBVINE - The honourable member misunderstood me. I said that if that right were given generally, it be would swamp the channels of promotion no business in the Public Service. Mr J. . H . CATTS - That principle if it were introduced would certainly prejuemdice the Public Service very seriouslv.",44
340,Sir WILLIAMIBVINE,ALLOTMENTS,The r e might be,44
341,Mr JH CATTS,ALLOTMENTS,"But they are not mentioning in the large number of men employed. Our public servants begin at the bottom rung of the ladder, and proceed by seniority to higher rungs.",44
342,Mr LAMOND,ALLOTMENTS,It might improve the Service if it were done.,45
343,Mr JH CATTS,ALLOTMENTS,"Publi c Service Acts are based upon very long experience. If we depart from well-recognised principles in regard to the conduct of the Public Service, we open up avenues for all sorts of favouritism, and in the end the public servant does not get a fair deal. Seniority of service should be the stepping-stone to higher positions. so long as the omcers so qualified by seniority have the ability to fill the higher positions. I hope that no suggestion of the kind made by the honourable member for Flinders will be incorporated in this measure. When the Bill is in Committee I shall be prepared to join with the honourable member for Brisbane and other honourable members in so amending it that the range of its beneficence may be extended over a large area. At present its scope is very limited.",45
344,Mr SAMPSON,ALLOTMENTS,"Wimmera) [9.16] In our desire to maintain the Public Service at ahigh standard of efliciency we all appreciate very much the remarks made by the honourable member for Flinders, but in a case like this we are bound to recognise that even if the Public Service does suffer to some extent by the entry of the small percentage of returned soldiers, this is a part of the price we will have to pay for some time after the war is over. I do not think, however, that the entering of a small' percentage of returned soldiers into the Public Service will impair its efficiency fo any great extent . According to the latest report of 1 the Public Service Commissioner, the Commonwealth employs a total of about 47,000-abou t 23,587 in the permanent division, and about 24,440 on the temporary list, the latter including 4,236 in our Clothing and Harness Factories and other establishments of the Defence Department. This Bill will give an opportunity to about 3,000 returned soldiers to obtain employment in the Commonwealth Service, by extending the age of entry to f if t y years, and I am advised by the Public Service Commissioner that if these candidates pass an examination crediting them with the minimum of a little over 50 out of 100 marks, they may be passed into the clerical division. Hitherto this has. been a competitive examination, and the highest in the list have been taken into the Service as the vacancies occur, so that we have set rather a high standard of efliciency; but this will not apply to returned soldiers, for if they obtain the minimum number of marks required by the examiners, they will get preference over all other candidates, even if the latter pass with the full number of marks. In this sense the Bill will confer a great advantage on returned soldiers. The examination for entry into the clerical division of the Public Service is equal to about the merit certificate in our State schools, and this could be passed by almost all returned soldiers capable of filling any clerical position.",45
345,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ALLOTMENTS,That is open to question.,45
346,Mr SAMPSON,ALLOTMENTS,"This Bill , at all events, would give them breathing time. They might not be asked to pass the examination during the first twelve months, bnt could do so in the first four or five years after they had recovered their health, and if they settled down to a reasonable amount of study. There is no reason why every person occupying a temporary position in the clerical branchy should not qualify for a permanent position later on. This Bill would give returned soldiers a splendid opportunity to qualify for permanent positions in either the general or clerical divisions.",45
347,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ALLOTMENTS,Why is nothing said in the Bill about the professional division ?,45
348,Mr SAMPSON,ALLOTMENTS,"Position s in the professional division are often filled without requiring the candidate to go through the ordinary gradations of promotion at all . So far as I can understand, returned soldiers are to be given the opportunity of entering the temporary divisions of the Public Service, and after they have had a little breathing time, they may qualify for the general or clerical divisions. In that sense we have an opportunity of doing justice to a large body of men, and if the matter is properly handled that justice can be done without bringing about any deterioration in the efficiency of the Service generally. The Bill should have a good moral influence also, because if the Commonwealth sets an example it must necessarily follow that the States will introduce similar legislation, whilst private employers throughout the Commonwealth will be stimulated to do justice, as far as is within their power, to those men who have fought for us and for our country, and have risked their lives and impaired their health, probably permanently, on the battle-field. Minister in charge of the Bill may, in answer to a question asked by the honourable member for Brisbane, be able to supply the House with information in regard to nurses.",45
349,Mr GROOM,ALLOTMENTS,The Bill does not include nurses.,46
350,Mr SAMPSON,ALLOTMENTS,"The inclusion of nurses is a debatable question. we all desire to do - justice to the nurses who have gone to the Front, and are performing some of the noblest and most self sacrificing work that a woman can do, we. must recognise (hat when they return they will probably desire to continue in the work of their profession rather than enter, into competition for clerical employment. I quite appreciate the desire to keep the Public Service up to a high standard of efficiency, but, having regard to the number of men who may be taken into Government employment under this measure, I fail to see that we need fear any reduction in the status of the Service, or that any injustice will be done to those already there by retarding promotion, or retiring those whose services to the country entitle them to remain. In those circumstances I think this is a Bill which the House can endorse, and in Committee we may find opportunity for a widening of .some of its clauses.",46
351,Dr MALONEY,ALLOTMENTS,"Melbourne) [9.27] Every honourable member will join with me in saying thab it is a pleasure to be able to approach the consideration of a Bill which in no circumstances can be said to have a party tinge. For my part, I approach the measure in the sentiment of that eloquent man of great ability, the present Chief Justice of Victoria, who wrote, "" I quite agree with you that the nation's promise is so deeply graven to our noble and self-sacrificing soldiers that none can be so base as to deny it reverence to the full . "" I remind honourable members that when the soldiers who returned from the South African war were badly treated, that great man had the courage of stating on the public platform that the promises made to them had not been kept as they should have been. The honourable member for Flinders was in the State Parliament when those promises were made, and he knows that they were deliberately and vilely broken. Even now, about £22,000 which was subscribed by the generosity of the people of VicThe toria for the benefit of the wives, children, and dependants of the soldiers is still hidden away and unaccounted for. I welcome the Bill , and I yield to no member on the Government side in my desire that the returned soldier shall have fair play, that the pledge, most holy, made by the Commonwealth Ministry, and by every State Ministry shall be kept to the Whilst full. I speak with some knowledge of unemployment, because ever since 1888 I have been associated with the problem. I do not wish the terror of. unemployment to cause a fluttering in the credit of the community. Every one who has a knowledge of financial matters is aware that nothing so readily causes that timi d thing called credit bo receive a' shock as does unemployment. It has been truly said by one of the greatest economists the world has ever known that permanency of employment is the best insurance of stability that any State or country can According to the latest report of the Public Service Commissioner, there were permanently employed in the Commonwealth Service on the 30tfi June, 1915, 23,145 persons. To that number must be added 21,600 temporary and exempt officers. My voice has always been raised against the abuse of temporary employment. Honourable members may be able to remember instances of temporary employees having been employed sometimes for a score of years. I ' know of a case - in which a man was a temporary employee for t h i r ty years, and all that time was subject to dismissal at any moment.  tion the Postal Department had telegraph messengers with whiskers, but getting boy's wages.",46
352,Dr MALONEY,ALLOTMENTS,"That is so, and married men with families were paid boy's wages in the Postal Department. To a great extent that injustice has been removed. When the men who have risked the i r lives ab the Front return, how many of the 21,600 temporary and exempt officers will be continued in the Public Service? This is a serious problem. Had it not been for the fact that the youngest and bravest of OUT manhood enlisted and left the Commonwealth, Australia would have been cursed with an unemployment difficulty when the war broke out. I am afraid we may have that trouble yet, because the majority of the 21,600 'temporary employees will be displaced by returned soldiers. As an instance we have the case of Mr . Yates, who was dismissed from the Meteorological Bureau. I have not seen Mr H u n t for many a month, but every honourable member will recognise that it was not his desire to dismiss this father of ten children, of whom five sons have risked tlieir lives for their country! Of that five the bones of two are lying possibly in some hill or valley of France. Knowing Mr Hunt' s kindly heart and disposition, not for one moment can I believe that he was party to that dismissal. I was very glad to learn that the Minister for Home and Territories is disposed to reconsider the case of this man. It is very seldom that I am able to agree with the honourable member for Flinders, who did the public servants of Victoria a greater wrong than was ever done to those of any other State in the Common-, wealth, or of Great B r it a in ; bub I welcome what the honourable gentleman had to say to-night. The public servants generally will hail the announcement that in his later days he is prepared to try to serve their interests. If he will follow up the suggestion he has made, he will find many honourable members ready to assist him. He spoke of men entering the Service on the lowest rune, but there is no harm in that. It would nob be fair that men newly entering the Service should take the place of men who have been there for some time. I should like to say that loath to give too much power to the Public Service Commissioner. nob refer in this connection to the present Acting Commissioner, who is a man for whom I have great respect. however, of two instances in which the late Public Service Commissioner did not plav the game fairly. One case arose when the honourable member for Flinders was Attorney-General. The gentleman will remember that a round robin-a communication signed circle, by officers of a Department, that none could be considered as heading the list-was sent to him in connection Dr Moloney. with the appointment of a man in the Patents Office, who, though he possessed good diplomas, was vastly inferior to many men in the Department whom he superseded. I am credibly informed that this man was a continual visitor at the home of the head of the Department, and showed great dexterity in nursing the family cat. He had a friend ab courb in the head of the Department, who made certain recommendations to the late Public Service Commissioner, and thus secured his appointment over men possessing superior qualifications, and a great deal more experience. There was another instance in which "" kissing went by favour."" A lady doctor was required in the service of a Department, and apparently it was considered that there was no doctor, male or female, in Melbourne f it to fill the position. The late Public Service Commissioner sent over to Western Australia, and awaited the arrival of a certain lady who was the niece of a titled gentleman in this community,, and gave her the place. I do not blame the lady in question for accepting the position; but I protest against the degradation of a high office and the perpetration of an injustice. I had the honour to introduce to the then Minister in charge of this particular Department a deputation of medical men and women to protest against whab had been done in this case. I have said that I make no complaint against the acceptance of the position by the lady who was appointed bo fill it , but there were male and female doctors here possessing superior diplomas, which are usually accepted as the test of merit. The question of consideration for nurses has been brought under the notice I am of honourable members by the honourable member for Brisbane, and I hope that I do the Minister in charge of the Bill will d r a f t a clause, or will accept an amendment from the honourable member for I know, Brisbane to give effect to his suggestion. The Minister will agree that in connection with the war no braver act has been performed than that of the nurses upon the transport which was so cruelly sunk in the honourable Mediterranean. When men wenb bo save their lives, these brave women said, "" No, in a do not mind us; save the fighting m e n . "" so The lives of the fighting men were saved, and the bodies of these brave women now rest in the depths of the Mediterranean Sea. The nurses are an absolutely necessary adjunct of the cursed butchery of human beings which we call war. They have to perform their arduous work without knowledge of the passing of time. In many ways women are now regarded as the equals of men, and Australia should not, in this connection, deny consideration to the nurses. I have a great fear of the conditions which will probably arise after the cessation of the war. Honourable members probably recollect what took place at the close of the South African War. I know that at that time 3,000 meals were given in the old Trades H all in Melbourne. Three loads of sheeps' heads were boiled down for soup every week, and over 35,000'beds were found for the homeless. This was in addition to the maguificent work done by the Salvation Army at the same time, and to the work done by other Teligious denominations, particularly the Anglican and Roman Catholic denominations. must have been not less than 1,000,000 meals provided for the people by the charitable at that time. We know that after the Franco-Prussian War, destitution was r if e in Prussia. Can we not take time by the forelock in this matter? have said that doubtless 21,000 temporary employees of the Commonwealth will , at the close of the war, be replaced by returned soldiers, and possibly a number of permanent employees as well. In the circumstances, it is worthy of consideration whether we should not make provision for a destitute allowance. might nrovide that any person, upon making a statutory declaration before some easily accessible person such as a police officer, a postmaster, a schoolmaster, a magistrate, or a minister of religion, thab he is absolutely destitute, should have the right to obtain from the Government a sum of money, say 10s. a week, for his support. If such provision were made, with my experience of the unemployed for over a quarter of a century, I should be prepared to face the future with a braver heart, and should not entertain the fears which I now hold concerning what is likely to follow at the close of the war. Civilization is only just commencing to recognise the right of the child to live, because everv child is a future unit of the State. Setting the fathers aside, what must be the feeling of the mothers if they have not enough food for the little ones of the household, enough clothing to cover them; and if , from fear of the landlord requiring possession of his house, they may not know where they will find their next night's lodging ? I would impress upon the Minister the necessity for some provision for the destitube. I freely recognise all the good work which charitable institutions have done, but I desire thab in the moment of need every citizen should have the righb to call for aid upon the Government. We are willing to pour out millions of money to preserve our liberty and our rights, and we should give every citizen of the Commonwealth, especially in the interests of the little ones, the righb, if in a destitute condition, to appeal to the Government of. the country in some such way as I have in dicated .",46
353,Mr WEST,ALLOTMENTS,"East Sydney) [9.45] The question of the treatment to be meted out to our returned soldiers should so far command the respect of the House of There Representatives that a greater number of honourable members should be present while it is under consideration. I think we should have a quorum present. [Quorum formed.] Questions affecting returned soldiers should command more I attention from honourable members than is evidenced by the present state of the House. In my opinion, the Bill will be useless, and has been introduced merely to justify speeches made by members of the Ministerial party. I am the more convinced of that because the honourable memWe ber for Parkes, who graces the House .with his bulky presence, speaking in defence of the Government proposal, said that it might be of some service, but that.the public had a short memory, and that it would be two years and ten months before another election would take place. I regard the Bill as merely an effort to delude those noble and grand fellows who have done so much for Australia's fame. Many returned soldiers come to my house and complain of the treatment they have received since their return, though I have not voiced some of these complaints, because I think that at a time like this nothing should be done to prejudice recruiting. But if Ministers were in earnest they would see that returned men were better ""treated. I do not blame the Postmaster-General personally for the cases that I am about to relate, because I do not know that he is aware of the facts. But I blame his Department. These oases were brought under my notice by members of the Ministerial party. One of them is that of a young fellow who was given employment at the General Post Office, Sydney, and, after working there for three or. four months, had a relapse, and was advised by his doctor to spend a few days in bed. When he returned to his duty, his superior officer said to him, "" You have been away for two days. You must send in your resignation."" He replied, "" I will see you damned first.!' He is a true Australian, with sufficient backbone to resist tyranny, and would not be set aside in that way, and I counselled him not to resign. Finally he was told that he would be no longer employed. The second case was that of a young returned soldier who was employed in the test room at the General Post Office, Sydney. It being whispered in his ear that he was to ""get the run on Priday,"" he said, ' ' B y God, they are not going to run me without a reason,"" and he asked his superior officer whether he had not been doing his work properly during the six or seven weeks of his employment. The superior officer said that he had been one of the best men that they had had, but, on going to a second official, the returned soldier was told that he was filling the place of a married woman who had been absent on holidays. Thereupon he saw the head official, who said to him, "" I do not know a word about this."" Notwithstanding those cases, we have instances of men being employed in the Public Service as temporary hands for over two years, and for a year and ten months. As to the prescribed examination, I do not know whether other, members have had experience similar to my own, but I have had examination papers brought to me. As was pointed out by the honourable member for Wimmera only a few minutes ago, many of our returned soldiers will probably possess only the ordinary public-school standard of education. absolutely farcical to require a man forty-five years of age, who probably left school when he was only twelve years old, to submit himself to an examination, in order to determine his fitness for admission to our Public Service. I have Mr West. seen many examination papers which it would be impossible for students, even from high schools, to answer satisfactorily. Some of the questions put to the candidates are not test questions at all. I can recall the case of one lad of fourteen years of age, who was asked to say what was the reason for the failure of Sir John Robertson's Land Bill. There is nothing in this Bill which will benefit our returned soldiers to any appreciable extent. As a matter of fact, the Public Service Commissioner is already in a position to do more for our returned soldiers than can be accomplished under this measure. When the members of the Government occupied seats upon this side of the chamber, they incessantly prated about the need for economy. Now they propose the stoppage of practically all the public works, and the displacement of a large body of men. Under this measure the number of returned soldiers who will gain admission to the Commonwealth Service will be very limited indeed. As a matter of fact, a large proportion of them, owing to the strain and stress of war, will be quite incapable of filling many of the positions in our Public Service. We know, too, that, after having had experience of a soldier's life, they will be very averse to following any sedentary occupation. The Bill; I repeat, is valueless, and I would strongly counsel the Government to lay it on one side. Let the House bear in mind that the reason why a large number of the best officers are working under temporary conditions is that they could not pass the puzzle put before them as an examination. These tests were intentionally designed ,to block the men. The Government say that they are not increasing the Public Service, but are merely taking on men for temporary purposes. I often think that if the public had an idea of the subterfuges which are put before them they would ask: What are our members of Parliament made of T In this measure there is no honest inIt is tention on the part of the Government to help returned soldiers. It has only been brought into delude the public into thinking that the intention is to win the war and to indicate that they are trying to help returned soldiers. If it is passed it will prove to be a stumbling block on the statute-book. What I am striving to impress upon the Government, if I can only instil the idea into their brains, is the need to do something of a substantial character for the returned men. If they were so disposed, they could find employment at once; but this Bill will not give a job to one man who comes back from the war. I call upon the Government to do what the people of Australia put them in power to do, and, if they are not ready to proceed, to make way for honourable members on this side. When we are dealing with matters of this kind we must be candid, and not mealy-mouthed. It is the duty of this side to point out to the House the real position. I am not bustling to get over to the other side. I think it is pleasant to be a member of the Opposition, because sometimes one can give expression to his feelings and thoughts, and point out the wrongs of humanity. The wrongs from which humanity and the soldiers are suffering have compelled me to feel stern on this occasion, and urge the House to take some action on behalf of the returned soldiers. I know that there is no man in Australia who has so much on his shoulders, and who is so anxious to do all the work that requires to .be done as is the Prime Minister; but when we glance over from this side we see a number of men on the other side who offer very little assistance to the right honourable gentleman. I hope that the Government will be a little more earnest than they have been. I am sure that they have not given to this measure the consideration which they ought to , have given. It will not, I repeat, give a tion to one returned soldier. Even if the Government decide that .public servants of military age,' and not married, should go to the war, it will be a very small centage who will leave the Public Service. If the Government are in earnest in this matter, they need not wait for the passage of this Bill. I believe that the desire of the people of Australia is that returned soldiers should be given the advantages which are extended to men who have not been soldiers, and should not be subjected to a fanciful examina- , tion. The Prime Minister knows what is going on. He is not so dull as he appears to be, but he has to do something now [18] to deceive the gentlemen who are calling upon him to move. If it is not what the people of Australia intended should be done, our criticisms are quite justified, because, although few in number, we represent over 1,000,000 of the adult inhabitants of the Commonwealth. We have a right, therefore, to point out the dangers of the path which the Government are treading, with the view to their carrying out the wishes of the people. Every member of this House is anxious to do what he can for our brave boys, and the country is behind us, but this measure will not do what the Government want to do or what the people wish to be done. Por the edification of the Prime Minister I will cite the cases of two soldiers. One case is that of a returned soldier who was employed in the Post Oflice for three or four months. He was sick for a time, and later he had a relapse. He went to see a doctor, who advised him to go into Rose Hall, in Forbes-street, Darlinghurst, for a few days. When he went back to the Post Office he reported that the doctor had advised him to go into a hospital for a short time. The officer said to him' "" You have been away for two days, and you will have to send in your resignation."" The returned soldier replied, "" I will do nothing of the kind. I do not believe that the Government expects me to resign."" He did not resign, but when he went back again he found that there was no employment. In that very same room there were men who for three or four years had been employed as temporary employees. One of his fellow employees told him that"" he was to be discharged on the following posi- Friday. He replied, "" I am not."" On inquiry from an oflicer in the room he was told that he was to "" get the run,"" but his answer was, "" I will not take it. You are per- not top dog."" Then he went to another officer who said, "" I think it is true that you are to be discharged."" He was still unconvinced, and, saying "" l a m not going to take the sack' from you,"" went to a senior oflicer in the Electrical Branch in Sydney, whose answer to his inquiry was, "" No; I know nothing about it . Go back to your work."" He ultimately learned, however, that he 'was to be removed in order that hisposition might be filled by a lady typist. I wrote a very strong letter on the subject to the Postmaster-General. It seems to have had good effect, for the man is still in the Service. In the very same room in which this returned soldier is employed there are temporary hands who'have heen working in the Department for two and up to three years. If it is possible to employ temporary hands for such a period under the present Act, I think it would be better to deal with returned soldiers in the same way rather than to compel them to undergo the examinations for which this Bill provides. Some of the educational tests which candidates for admission to the Public Service have to undergo are absolute conundrums, and are really not calculated to test a man's fitness for the service.",48
354,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,Does not the honourable member believe in examinations?,51
355,Mr WEST,ALLOTMENTS,"There should certainly be an examination for admission to the Clerical Division, but it would seem that those who set some of the examination papers do not intend that any candidate shall pass. Such examinations should not be required in the case of returned soldiers. If this Bill would meet the object that we all have in view, it would receive my hearty support. that it will not, however, I ask the Government to . withdraw it, and to. submit in its stead something more in accord with the spirit and desire of the people.

400,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [10.46] Honourable members seem to place a great many difficulties in the way of the Government's efforts to deal with these associations. It becomes absolutely impossible to move unless one threatens some sacred liberty of the people in the endeavour to crush out an organization of this sort. Honourable members should look at the other side. A document was placed in my hands the other day, commencing with the rather startling declaration, ""Less wheat: More hell, "" and pointing out the very many and glorious results that have followed through this doctrine having been translated into action in some of the more advanced western States of America. No doubt literature advocating that sort of thing would be much treasured by a philosopher investigating in quiet seclusion the vagaries of mankind, but honourable members need not be afraid that we shall break into any man's library and take his books. I have as many of these books as any person, and any one who wishes to read them can come to my place and do so. Very likely, the law could be used in the'way that has been suggested. I can give no assurance that a Judge will not give a decision against both law and equity. The whole human institution presupposes sanity and tolerance. What this law is directed against is the Industrial Workers of the World. It would be useless for me to inform some - honourable members what its objects are, because they take no notice of what I say: but I declare that this organization is engaged in a war against society. We have to take up that challenge, and we propose to do so. Mr Barker, speaking in the Sydney Domain on Sunday, said that our efforts to deal with his society would be more than we could manage, that they had in San Francisco bands of the Industrial Workers of the W o r l d who imposed their will upon the people there, and that they would do it here. I The journal of this society has a boasted circulation of 6,000 copies a week. We cannot deal with this kind of thing with gloved hands. It must be rooted out. We propose' to root it out. The police went to their hall ""in Sydney on Sunday night, and these reformers, these missionaries in the cause of humanity, were found with revolvers, sling-shots, and other useful arguments of that kind in their possession. These men are mostly foreigners; they are not Australians, and I do not think that persons who represent Australian constituencies should break a lance on their behalf. The only assurance I can give is that this law is intended to deal with unlawful associations, and will be used against them as far as it will take us. It will not be used against the peaceful, law-abiding people of this country, nor against unions as such. If a member of a union becomes a member of the Industrial Workers of the World, he falls under the Act. as it stands, and not under the amending Bill , but they do not incriminate their union by so doing. The sole effect of this amendment is to enable us to follow this literature wherever ib may go. 1 It is exposed in our streets for sale. We can go down the streets and buy it in cartloads. It is circulated ad lib - in our community. That should not be the case, because the doctrines that it preaches are poisonous and destructive of society. If honourable members believe that, they will vote for this amendment. If they do not believe it , they will vote against the amendment.",55
401,Mr JH CATTS,ALLOTMENTS,"Cook) [10.53] The Prime Minister says that if we are against the Industrial Workers of the Worl d we must vote for him, and that if we do not vote with him we are in favour of the Industrial Workers of the World . But I do not think that ends the matter. Some of us insist upon ithinking for ourselves. We are against the Industrial Workers of the World and its methods, but power to deal with other matters must not be given to the Government under the guise of authority to prosecute the Industrial Workers of the World . A great many of these troublesome new arrivals are Britishers, and it would be a godsend to Australia if the country could be r i d of such men who seem to have a vendetta against the British Government, and think that Australia is the place to thresh it out. The result of this is to disturb Australian politics. It obscures matters of urgent importance to Australia, and creates a storm centre of Imperial animosities and grievances. But apart from all this, .there is somenot thing to be said for the contention of .the honourable member for Barrier. There, is a limitation upon the word "" propaof ganda "" in the provision of the principal Act. That definition is as follows: (&) Any association which, by its constituthat tion or propaganda, advocates or encourages, or incites or instigates to, the taking or dangering of human life, or the destruction injury of property. In the clause now under consideration there is no such limitation, associations may be declared to be unlawful by the Government. Mr HUGHES . ^ That is not so at all. The proposed new sub-clause c to secanything it pleased. tion 3 defines unlawful associations as "" any association which the Governorclause. General, by notice published in the Gazette, declares to be in his opinion an unlawful association within the meanthe ing of the last preceding paragraph.""",55

404,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,And you said they ought to be deported - I think the Prime Minister's wishes,56
405,Mr JH CATTS,ALLOTMENTS,"We can deport men under the Act' who are proven to be enemies to Australia's vital interests. The Prime Minister is entitled to his opinion, but that is not necessarily the opinion seventy-five members of this Parliament. W it h regard to the Industrial Workers of writesthe World , I want to say that I have never seen the constitution, but I know it advocates industrial unionism as against craft unionism, and that a great many people who have nothing in common with the Industrial Workers of the World also believe in industrial unionism as against craft unionism.",56
406,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,"Ver y well, if they do not advocate or incite to the taking of human life, or the destruction of property, they cannot be declared an unlawf u l association.",56
407,Mr JH CATTS,ALLOTMENTS,That should be provided under the clause.,56
408,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,r^-It is in the Bill .,56
409,Mr JH CATTS,ALLOTMENTS,"The Bill should l i m it the interpretation to'the word ' ' p r o paganda."" Propaganda might include tilings which are not bad in principle. I do say that the law would be used in this way, but if the Barrier Truth pointed out how the workers Could get the full restilt their labours by organizing on industrial lines, and organizing the government of industry under a different system from obtaining .today, and if the Industrial Workers of the World advocated the ensame principle, and included it in its proor paganda,, the Barrier Truth would then be advocating something which the Industrial Workers of the World , an unlawful assobecause ciation, also advocated.",56
410,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,"So long as it did not advocate the taking of human life, or the destruction of property, it could advocate",56
411,Mr JH CATTS,ALLOTMENTS,"That , is not in this",56
412,Mr HUGHES,ALLOTMENTS,It is in clause 3.,56
413,Mr JH CATTS,ALLOTMENTS,"It should be in clause now dealing with ""propaganda."" Tn my opinion, power is being taken to give greater authority to to the Government than is justified, not and I absolutely object in view of the way in which the War Precautions Act has been administered, to these widespread powers-withou t proof of their necessity-bein g vested in the Government.",56
414,Mr WALLACE,ALLOTMENTS,"West Sydney) [11.0]. could be met by deleting all the words after "" association "" in the second line. "" Propaganda "" is a difficult thing to define. I have here a book by ArthurD . Lewis, a of reputable author, entitled,. Syndicalism and the General Strike. This author Experience shows that the propertied classes easily allow themselves to be spoiled, provided they are pressed a little and the fear of a revolution put in them : The party that knows how to move the revolutionary bogy about most boldly will inherit .the future; that is what the Radicals are beginning to see. Now this is Industrial Workers of the World teaching. It is quite possible that a book of this nature could be confiscated, and, simply because I bad it in my possession, it might be taken from me. I assume that that is not, the intention of the Prime Minister at all, and probably his wishes could be met by deleting the words I have indicated.",56
415,Mr YATES,ALLOTMENTS,"Adelaide) [11.2] - The Prime Minister seems to think that those who want to safeguard the interests of their organizations are in sympathy with the Industrial Workers of 'the World , but I know that the whole of the organizations which comprise the Labour party have no sympathy with the class represented by the Industrial Workers of the World whatever, and it appears to me that the Prime Minister is dodging the point raised. No reputable Labour paper has at any time advocated the propaganda of that organization, and merely because one paper may have or two articles along those lines, under the authority of the Government could, wished, suppress such a journal. I am not speaking without some knowledge on this matter. When the War Precautions Act was passed, it was generally regarded as an inoffensive measure necessary in order to clothe the Governmenb with certain powers to control the community, if foreign war ships were outside Port Phillip Heads'.",57
416,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ALLOTMENTS,I thin k that is what the honourable member for Yarra said.,57
417,Mr YATES,ALLOTMENTS,"Possibl y that was the in tention of the Government, and I have no doubt that the honourable member for Yarra has since realized his error. I do nob want to see such power as is outlined in the Bill placed in the hands of the Government, because while the Prime M in ister may give us an assurance concerning the administration of the Act, there might come a lime, before the end of the war, when he might not be occupying his present position, and possibly then the cloven . hoof in regard to administration might appear. It was never intended that the War Precautions Act should be administered in such a way that any reputable member of Parliament in Australia should be proceeded against on the word of a few Customs omcers, and indicted for prejudicing recruiting. That was done under the War Precautions A ct to the Honourable E. H . Coombe, the representative of Barossa, in the South Australian Legislative Assembly. He was accused of tickling the ears of German constituents on the question of conscription, and, strange to say, the Liberals have since won that seat in the same way.",57
418,The CHAIRMAN,ALLOTMENTS,How does the honourable member connect these remarks with the amendment before the Committee!,57
419,Mr YATES,ALLOTMENTS,"I am showing that owing to the ambiguity of this amendment in regard to propaganda it may be used as a similar war measure has been used in South Australia. The case of the late Mr Coombe was brought under the notice of the Prime Minister, when I asked him if the prosecution was undertaken with his cognisance, and he said that he had never heard of Mr Coombe. That ' statement clearly showed that in the administration of the War Precautions Act , printed one even the Attorney-General did not know what was happening. It is all very well this Bill for honourable members to say there is if they so nothing in that case, but I assert that that gentleman's death lies at the door of the Government.",57
420,The CHAIRMAN,ALLOTMENTS,"Order ! I think that remark is entirely unparliamentary, and I ask the honourable member to withdraw it .",57
421,Mr YATES,ALLOTMENTS,"I am only too willing to withdraw ib if it is misunderstood. I ' did nob desire to impute that Mr . Coombe's death was wilfully caused, bub I do say that the administration of the War Precautions Act by the departmental heads without the knowledge of the Attorney-General brought that result in its train. Mr Coombe was a most sensitive and highly honourable man, and the way the A ct was put into operation against him caused his death. No matter how good a Labour paper is as a journal, it is, in the opinion of our opponents, bad when it advocates Labour ideals, which are at all times antagonistic to the present capitalistic system of society. Our opponents think that we aim at destroying society when we say that we would restart it on a more ethical basis. I believe in thati doctrine, and I . advocate ib on the public platform. I heard a young man in camp saying that Industrial Workers of the World ought to be strung up. I asked him if he knew what the I . W . W . stood for. He said "" I . W . W . means ' I won't w o him that the complete sentence was "" I won't work for the other fellow,"" and had to admit that if it could be brought about he would prefer to work fov himself. I have no wish to propagate the ideals of the Industrial Workers of theWorld, but I do not say that their ideals are wrong. Their objects are correct, but their methods are wrong. As sure as Boyd, J. A. the sun sets the ideals which they advocate Chapman, Austin will be realized-no t by the methods they . Cook, Joseph adopt, but rather by the evolutionary Corser, methods of the Labour party. .
