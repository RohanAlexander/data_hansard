2,Mr DOWNER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Foreign Affairs and Trade Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 is an omnibus bill which amends four acts administered by this portfolio: first, the International Organisations (Privileges and Immunities) Act 1963 (International Organisations Act) second, the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994 (Chemical Weapons Act); third, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 (Nuclear Safeguards Act); and finally, the Passports Act 1938. The bill addresses a diverse range of issues, mainly of a technical nature, including meeting formal legal obligations in respect of international organisations, strengthening international nuclear safeguards standards and false passport applications. International Organisations Act The bulk of the amendments included in this omnibus bill relate to the International Organisations Act. These amendments update a nearly 35-year-old act. They are necessary to keep pace with the increasing number and diversity of international organisations now being established. An important amendment will allow for the simultaneous entry into force of both the treaty establishing an international organisation and the regulations relating to that organisation. Otherwise Australia could find itself in technical.breach of treaty obligations if there were to be a delay in implementing associated regulations. This amendment will be particularly useful when the treaty is unlikely to enter into force until some years after agreement has been reached to establish the organisation. Another of the more important moves in 1997 this bill is to tighten the definition of an international organisation which can be eligible for privileges and immunities. Australia only grants privileges and immunities which are required by international law. When negotiating privileges and immunities as part of international agreements, this government takes the line that specific items should be included only where there is a demonstrated functional need. We have to be satisfied that the specific privilege or immunity is necessary for the effective operation of the organisation. Disarmament Issues-Chemical Weapons and Nuclear Safeguards Acts This bill also amends an oversight in the drafting of the original Chemical Weapons Act. It is highly unlikely that an inspection team will ever have to come to Australia to investigate another country's allegation that Australia was in breach of the convention. Nevertheless, should this occur, representatives of the country making such an allegation will now be extended standard diplomatic privileges and immunities, along with other members of the inspection team. On the occasion of making these amendments, I would like to set out for the House just how strongly Australia is committed to the international disarmament process. Australia enjoys a well-deserved reputation as a leading player internationally on arms control issues. That reputation has been enhanced by this government's successful efforts last year to help bring to conclusion the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty-a goal sought after by the international communi ty for over 20 years-as well as our work over the last year in leading the international drive to gather sufficient ratifications to bring the Chemical Weapons Convention into force. The appointment in May of Dr John Gee, an officer of my Department, as Deputy Director-General of the newly established Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons reflects wide recognition an ong parties to the convention of Dr Gee's professional background and experience. Moreover, this appointment reinforces Australia's prominent position in this sphere of disarmament activity. Similarly, our reputation is further bolstered by the appointment of .Richard - utler to t?e Chair of the United NatIOns SpeCIal CommIssion (UNSCOM), the body charged with ensuring the discovery and destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. This government's commitment to the cause of disarmament is evident in our substantial contribution to the international effort to address the problems caused by the misuse of anti-personnel landmines. In April last year the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) and I announced Australia's support for a global ban on the production, stockpiling, use and transfer of these weapons. In international forums the government has continued to add its weight to the growing international movement in favour of eliminating anti-personnel landmines as a weapon of war. After Australia co-sponsored a pro-ban resolution in the UN General Assembly in December last year, I addressed the Conference on Disarmament in January this year, calling for work to begin on such a treaty. Australia does not produce and will not export landmines. The existing .st?cks of landmines are used only for trammg and research purposes. This is important as it allows us to assist, through mine clearance programs, countries. such as Cambo-is. Mindful of the ternble human suffenng caused by landmines, the government has significantly increased fund.ing for inte-at.ionÂ­ al mine clearance and assIstance to VIctims, as well as working with other countries to improve de-mining technology. The government has also made major efforts to make headway in reducing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. As I have already noted, we took the courageous step in September last year of salvaging the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty from the Conference on Disarmament and submitting it to the UN General Assembly where it was overwhelmingly endorsed. We have also promoted the report of the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons. I presented the report personally to the UN General Assembly in New York last September and also to the Conference on Disarmament this year. I have urged its careful consideration by all governments. It is notable that the commission's recommendations relating to the removal and destruction of nuclear warheads from delivery vehicles, and transparency in accounting for the resultant fissile material, appear already to have been taken up. This was evident in the START III parameters agreed recently in Helsinki between Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin. Indeed, one of the major amendments in this bill is to the Nuclear Safeguards Act. This will implement the recently negotiated International Atomic Energy Agency Protocol to strengthen safeguards. This protocol was developed as a comprehensive global response to some limitations with the IAEA safeguards system which were identified following investigation of Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapons program. The new international system will supplement and extend the IAEA's existing safeguards agreements to increase assurances that states subject to comprehensive safeguards have declared all safeguardable nuclear activities. In Australia, Lucas Heights will be subject to increased international inspection. In addition, it is expected that uranium mines and, possibly, the area at Maralinga will be subjected to expanded declarations concerning nuclear and nuclear-related activities, and, possibly, to international inspections. The Australian Safeguards Office has consulted with the mine operators and with the private company undertaking research and development at Lucas Heights. They have raised no objections to this stricter regime. The Passports Act The last substantive amendment covered by this bill relates to the Passports Act 1938. This amendment tightens the provision relating to the offence of making false statements in relation to passport applications. It adds the concept of recklessness as a mental element in the offence of making a false statement in a passport application or in support of an application. The issuing of passports is of course an important service provided to the public by my department. This government attaches great importance to Commonwealth departments providing a high level of service to their clients. Indeed, the government gave a commitment at the last election to improving Australia's consular services in general. We have set about this task with enthusiasm and I have myself taken a personal interest in many consular cases. In particular, we will continue the process of developing our capacity to respond to consular crises, epitomised in the establishment of the Consular Response Group which was set up just over a year ago. We are also applying new technology to the consular area of DF AT and we are about to test a new 24hour, Canberra-based duty officer consular service. We will continue to expand the system of honorary consuls and to provide better training for our consular staff. Our emphasis on improved information for the public has already produced a Consular Information Service in DFAT which will provide up-to-date information to travellers. We will also continue to improve our flow of information to the public in other ways, including through a continuing stress on timely and informative consular travel advices. A critical element in this is ensuring that we give all the assistance we can to families in Australia of consular clients, supporting them in what is often a time of anguish and anxiety. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum for the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr MCMullan) adjourned. NA (TRIBUNAL APPOINTMENTS) BILL First Reading Bill presented by Mr Williams, and read a first time. Second Reading",13
3,Mr WILLIAMS,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill contains amendments to the Native Title Act 1993 that amend the qualifications for appointment of presidential members of the National Native Title Tribunal and provide a simplified mechanism for the temporary appointment of a registrar to the tribunal. The bill adds a further class of persons who may be appointed as a presidential member of the tribunal-namely, persons who have been admitted to legal practice for at least five years. Currently, only judges may be appointed as presidential members. It also provides that the president of the tribunal, instead of the Governor General, may appoint an acting registrar. The amendments ensure that a more diverse field of suitably qualified candidates may be considered for the role of president. They also ensure that the tribunal can quickly and efficiently deal with any temporary vacancy in the position of registrar. The bill will not have any significant financial impact. I present the explanatory memorandum and commend the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr MCMullan) adjourned. NA (SPECTRUM LICENCE TAX) BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Warwick Smith, and read a first time. Second Reading",15
4,Mr WARWICK SMITH,RADIOCOMMUNICA TIONS,"Bass-Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (9.43 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. 1997 The Radiocommunications (Spectrum Licence Tax) Bill 1997 seeks to apply an annual spectrum licence tax, to recover spectrum maintenance costs, to spectrum licences issued under the Radiocommunications Act 1992. The associated Radicommunications Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 will provide for collection of the tax. Spectrum licensees benefit from spectrum maintenance practices such as international coordination, domestic planning, interference investigation and policy development carried out by the Spectrum Management Agency, SMA, the Australian Communications Authority, ACA, from 1 July 1997, on behalf of all radiocommunications licensees. It is appropriate therefore that spectrum licensees should contribute to the recovery of associated costs, by paying a proportionate share of annual spectrum maintenance tax. The collection of an annual spectrum maintenance tax was supported in the bipartisan HORSCOTCI report 'Management of the Radiofrequency Spectrum' in October 1991. However there is currently no provision for spectrum licensees to pay a spectrum maintenance tax. Apparatus licensees have always paid these maintenance costs. With the first spectrum licences being issued in 1997, this is the appropriate time to correct the anomaly between the two licensing systems. The proposed act will harmonise arrangements between apparatus licences and spectrum licences and will make transparent the share of the ongoing costs of spectrum management paid by spectrum licensees. Now I tum to the details contained in the bill. The actual amount of the tax will be set by a SMA determination, as is presently the case for apparatus licences. There will not be a set maximum limit on the tax that can be imposed on a licence holder. This is because of the highly flexible nature of spectrum licences. Such licences can, for example, be traded, sub-divided and amalgamated, giving rise to the possibility that a single licensee could hold a large proportion of spectrum in a particular band. However, the following checks will limit the degree of discretion the SMA has in setting the amount of the tax. Once made, any such determination will be a disallowable instrument. Furthermore, in order to limit the SMA's discretion to increase the tax, the minister for communications and the arts, under section 235 of the Radiocommunications Act 1992, may give the SMA directions in relation to the performance of its functions and exercise of its powers. The amendments I have outlined will enable all radiocommunications licensees to share the costs of the SMA providing an efficient spectrum management service in Australia. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr MCMullan) adjourned.

5,Mr WARWICK SMITH,LEGIS LA TION AMENDMENT BILL,"Bass-Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (9.47 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Radiocommunications Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 seeks to collect an annual spectrum licence tax from spectrum licensees. This will be a tax for spectrum maintenance. The associated Radiocommunications (Spectrum Licence Tax) Bill 1997, which I have just introduced, seeks to apply the tax to spectrum licensees. Spectrum licensees benefit from spectrum management practices such as international coordination, domestic planning interference investigation and policy development carried out by the Spectrum Management Agency, the Australian Communications Authority-as it will be known from 1 July 1997-on behalf of all radiocommunications licensees. Therefore, spectrum licensees should contribute to the recovery of associated costs by paying an annual spectrum maintenance tax. The coIIection of an annual spectrum maintenance tax was supported in the bipartisan HORSCOTCI report entitled Management of the radiofrequency spectrum in October nation 1991. However, there is currently sion for spectrum licensees to pay a spectrum maintenance tax. Apparatus licensees have always paid these maintenance costs.

The proposed act will harmonise arrangements between apparatus licences and spectrum licences and will make transparent the of the ongoing costs of spectrum management paid by spectrum licensees. Now I tum to the details contained in the bill. In order to collect the spectrum maintereturned nance tax, the bill seeks to amend relevant development. acts including the Radiocommunications Act 1992, Radiocommunications Taxes Collection Act 1983 and the proposed Legislative InstruDevelopment ments Act 1997. The amendment to the mence proposed Legislative Instruments Act 1997 will provide that the SMA is required undergo a consultation process before making a determination setting the amount of a tax. There is also provision for regulations exempting spectrum licensees who satisfy certain criteria, including the provision non-profit safety of life services, from ment of the spectrum maintenance tax. The amendments I have outlined will all radiocommunications licensees to share the costs of the SMA providing an efficient spectrum management service in Australia. have already presented the explanatory memopotentially randum to cover both bills.

The Department of Defence proposes to enter into an agreement with Victoria's Urban Land Authority to dispose of the site of the former Albion explosives factory at Deer Park in the is the western suburbs of Melbourne. The property is around 460 hectares in area and is contaminated mainly by organic explosive compounds and requires decontamination before release.

7,Mr JULL,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Sydney Airport: International terminal-Olympic upgrade. Sydney international airport will be the gateway to the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games and in recognition of this the Federal i\irports Corporation has begun planning the services and infrastructure needed to support the Sydney promise to the world of providing Olympic and Paralympic Games to mark the turn of the century. The existing terminal and air site facility at Sydney international terminal will both require expansion in order to meet demands put upon them by the forecast growth in passenger movements over the next few years. Additional facilities required to meet the expected demand by 2003 are 10 additional aircraft parking positions, extensions to the aircraft taxiway system, new air side departure lounges and associated retail facilities at piers Band C, additional check-in and baggage claim facilities, associated building works and related engineering and building service improvements. Completion of the project will ensure that expected airline industry demands will be accommodated through to 2003, the level of service provided to passengers will be equivalent to the world's best practice, the commercial viability of the airport will be enhanced. and there will be an appropriate return on the investment. An elemental cost plan prepared for the project provides for a design and construction cost to completion of approximately $350 million. Work is scheduled to commence around July 1997 and to be completed by January 2000. The Public Works Committee, in its report tabled on 24 June 1997, concluded that there is a need for the project and recommended that particular attention should be given to the needs of people with disabilities during the detailed design phases and that any further development of Sydney airport should have appropriate environmental clearances before being referred to the committee.  sions and recommendations of the committee.

NA NA AMENDMENT (TSRA) BILL 1997 Consideration resumed from 19 June. Second Reading",17
8,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Mr Speaker, this bill proposes amendments to remove the budget for the Torres Strait Regional Authority (TSRA) from the budget of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), effective from the 1997/98 budget. The Torres Strait Regional Authority (TSRA) was established on 1 July 1994, following a review of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 which recognised the separate and distinct nature of Torres Strait Islanders. The current funding arrangements for the Torres Strait Regional Authority require that, on the Torres Strait Regional Authority's budget, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs consult the Chairperson of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, the Chairperson of the Torres Strait Regional Authority and the Commissioner representing the Torres Strait zone. Since its establishment on 1 July 1994, the Torres Strait Regional Authority has demonstrated its ability to discharge its functions and responsibilities in an exemplary manner. As the Torres Strait Regional Authority matures, increased autonomy should be accorded it to enable it to manage its own affairs and prioritise its functions. The separation of funding arrangements from ATSIC would facilitate this. This bill amends the act to allow the Torres Strait Regional Authority to negotiate its estimates directly rather than through ATSIC. Its budget bids will be competing with all of the Commonwealth Government's other spending priorities. The amendments are in line with the government's policy of the Torres Strait Regional Authority becoming more autonomous from ATSIC. Mr Speaker, I commend the bill to the House, and I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.",18
9,Mr MELHAM,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment (TSRA) Bill 1997 gives the Torres Strait Regional Authority financial independence. In doing so, it completes a process set in train by the Keating Labor government. The current act encapsulates the Keating Labor government's approach, which accorded the TSRA separate line funding within the ATSIC budget, with provision for ministerial consultation with a TSRA chair to ensure the TSRA's financial independence. That approach involved a process leading to independence from ATSIC for the TSRA. This bill completes that process. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 to enable the parliament to appropriate funds directly to the Torres Strait Regional Authority rather than through ATSIC as is currently the case. The TSRA currently requests annual funding from the board of commissioners of ATSIC. The board then puts a proposal for ATSIC' s funding, including the TSRA's, to the minister. Essentially the board finally decides on the level funding proposed for the TSRA. While the ATSIC act requires that, on the appropriation for the TSRA, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) consult the Chairman of the TSRA and the Commissioner representing the Torres Strait Island zone, this is considered to be insufficient recognition of the authority's separate status. The amendments will mean that the TSRA will negotiate directly with the minister about its annual funding. It will no longer need to go through ATSIC first. The amendments are intended to take effect for the 1997-98 financial year. As the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) said in his second reading speech: Since its establishment on 1 July 1994, the Torres Strait Regional Authority has demonstrated its ability to discharge its functions and responsibilities in an exemplary manner. As the Torres Strait Regional Authority matures, increased autonomy should be accorded it to enable it to manage its own affairs and prioritise its functions. The separation of funding arrangements from ATSIC would facilitate this. The opposition endorses those comments by the minister in his second reading speech. Mr Deputy Speaker, we should not forget that it was a group of Torres Strait Islanders, the Meriam people led by the late Eddie Mabo, who were the first indigenous Australians to have their native title recognised by the Australian common law. The proud, independent cultures of Torres Strait Islander peoples have their source in these ancient relationships with land and seas. In the past, Torres Strait Islanders have suffered negative consequences from being thrown under blanket legislation dealing with all indigenous people in Australia. That is the other important reason for the amendments proposed in this bill. We have to learn from the mistakes of the past and place control in the hands of the people who are affected by the decisions made. One additional concern I have is to ensure that the rights and interests of Torres Strait Islanders living on the mainland are not overlooked. While the TSRA's responsibilities are necessarily limited to the Torres Strait, a of significant number of Torres Strait Islanders live on the mainland. These people, like their brothers and sisters living in the Torres Strait, and indeed like all indigenous Australians, are entitled to their distinct culture. The opposition will keep a watching brief on that particular situation. I note that the chair of the House of Representatives committee is to follow in the debate and that there is a parliamentary inquiry looking into this matter. There has been consultation by that committee, and the chair is obviously continuing that consultation. So it is all part of a process. This situation is a shining example. These issues are being dealt with with cross-party support. This is something that the minister's office and our office have cooperated in and we have seen this legislation pass through the Senate very quickly, and pass through this House. It will pass through this House very quickly with cross-party support. Why? Because this is legislation that does improve the situation and does progress the situation. The opposition is prepared to cooperate with the government to improve the plight of indigenous Australians. It has always been my view that most of these issues can be dealt with with cross-party support. It is absolutely critical that indigenous Australians not be used as a political football. Contrast the way this legislation has been dealt with with the way the government proposes to deal with its response to the High Court decision in Wik and also, in effect, revisit what we did in government with our response to the High Court's decision in Mabo with the Native Title Act 1993. Contrast it, Mr Deputy Speaker, because the position is this: the Labor Party will not walk away from the High Court decisions in Mabo and Wik and our legislation on the Native Title Act. We will fight this government tooth and nail, line by line, clause by clause, when they produce their legislation, but we will do it in a constructive fashion. We will do it in a fashion where our response will be a principled response. Our response will be aimed at improving and facilitating the process, because the Mabo judgment, the Wik judgment and the Native Title Act mean that no-one is going to lose their backyard, that no-one is going to lose their farm or their pastoral leases. Everyone's title is guaranteed. Mining development can proceed in this country. There is no right of veto. What we have had is a scare campaign whipped up for political purposes by the National Party, particularly the Premier of Queensland, Mr Borbidge, and the federal National Party led by Mr Fischer. They have played politics. It will come back and bite them. It will haunt them. It is all unnecessary. From day one, we have said that we are prepared to assist in a process that improves the workability of the Native Title Act. We have said, 'Come and talk to us' - and we have been ignored. The one thing that this government will find out is that it is not above the law. It is not above the constitution, but I put that as an example in direct contrast to what we are doing here on this legislation and another piece of legislation that will be dealt with tomorrow to do with the Land Rights Act and hand back. I repeat, the current debate on Wik is being led by the lowest common denominator. Originally, it was the prejudiced leading the blind. Now it is the blind leading the prejudiced. I appeal to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and to the government to back off, to sit down and to engage all parties, to negotiate in good faith. We on the Labor side are prepared to cooperate, but we will not substitute, under the guise of workability, an attack on indigenous peoples rights. We will not support discriminatory and racist legislation that discriminates against the Aboriginal race by taking away the limited rights that the High Court accorded them. That is not the way forward. It is not necessary. That is why this government can posture and carry on as much as it likes. Its rhetoric is not in accord with its own policy platform, its own policy principles that were developed-and they have the fingerprints of the Prime Minister all over them-and the commitments that the Prime Minister gave this parliament to respect native title, to respect the Mabo decision, to respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. I appeal again to the government and say that what you are doing is dividing this community. The world is watching. It is interesting that the Prime Minister is under siege on these issues during his trip to the United Kingdom. It is all unnecessary. Today's example of how we are dealing with this legislation is an example of what we should be doing to Wik. Let us sit down and talk about procedures. Procedures can be improved. The Native Title Act can be improved to the benefit of all parties. But do not think the Labor Party is going to walk away from this issue. We will not. The proudest thing that I was involved in, in the Keating Labor government, was to be a participant in the Native Title Act and to see that act enacted. Another proud moment was being present in the High Court when the High Court decision on Wik was handed down. I actually read the High Court judgment before I said anything publicly, which is a lot more than can be said for a number of participants and premiers around this country. I only say this in this debate to signal very clearly that this is the way we should be dealing with indigenous issues-not in a political manner, because these issues are above politics. This is not about Aboriginal rights or Torres Strait Islander rights; it is about human rights. If you diminish the rights of indigenous Australians, you diminish the rights of all of us. We should be celebrating the 1967 referendum that took away the discriminatory aspects of the constitution in relation to indigenous Australians. Instead, we have the veiled threat from the Prime Minister that if he does not get his way on this legislation he might have a referendum on this issue. It is totally unnecessary, it is hairy chested and it is not on. The Labor Party will fight it, but we do not want to fight this issue. There is no need for it. This Prime Minister and this government, with a generosity of spirit, can send a signal to the rest of the community at a time when it is desperately needed, because the debate on race is out of control. We are being led by the lowest common denominator, and the Prime Minister has shown an abysmal lack of leadership. He has allowed it to happen. That is why his prime ministership has been diminished when it should have been enhanced. The way we are dealing with this legislation is the way we should be dealing with all legislation-on its merits. There are improvements that can be made. Let us learn from the mistakes of the past. Let us not repeat the mistakes of history. We had the report on stolen children tabled. What that showed was that in the past Commonwealth, state and territory governments sanctioned discrimination against indigenous people. This parliament passed the Racial Discrimination Act in 1975. The current Prime Minister had carriage of that matter for the opposition in 1975. That sent a signal to the Australian community which was the right signal. Australia has changed. Mainstream Australia is not the mainstream Australia of old. My definition of mainstream Australia is different from John Howard's. It includes Lebanese Australians, Chinese Australians, Asian Australians, Greek Australians and Italian Australians. So I say again, because it cannot be said often enough: do not come back and keep saying, 'Thirteen years of Labor government; you did this, you did this, you did this.' It is now 15 to 16 months of a Howard Liberal government. Indeed, it is not a liberal government; it is a conservative government with a capital C. If only it were a liberal government. Malcolm Fraser's name is hardly used in those circles. Why? Because he was a liberal Prime Minister. On these issues he was spot-on. On race he was without peer in the Liberal Party. He led the charge on apartheid. I finish up by saying to this government: do not think we will walk away on indigenous issues. We will not. We will fight you, because we all stand diminished if your proposal gets up. I commend this legislation to the House. I commend the work that the House of Representatives committee is doing under the chairmanship of the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman). He is doing an excellent job going out there looking first-hand. I appeal to the Prime Minister to get out of Kirribilli House and the Lodge and go out and have a look at how indigenous communities are suffering under your government. You can do something about it. You have the opportunity to do something about it, with our support. We will support you if you do the right thing, as we are doing with this bill. I commend the bill to the House.",19
10,Mr LIEBERMAN,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"I welcome the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment (TSRA) Bill 1997 and wish it a speedy passage. The bill amends the ATSIC Act and will allow the Torres Strait Regional Authority the first opportunity to negotiate its own budget bids directly with the minister rather than through ATSIC. Its budget bids, of course, will compete with all other competing bids from other Commonwealth government programs, but it is important that this parliament do all it can, as a matter of urgency, to increase the rights of Torres Strait Islanders to manage their own affairs and fight for the things that they believe in, and to help them achieve their hopes and aspirations. The present funding arrangement under the existing legislation, introduced by the Keating government, is in fact demeaning to Torres Strait Islanders. I know it was not intended to be when the legislation was put through some years ago, but it is. It requires the Torres Strait Islanders and the authority that was set up for them to go through an incredible maze of bureaucracy and of layers of government and inter-governmental arrangements before it can have its voice directly heard. I know this was not actually intended, but that is in fact what has happened. So this legislation brings in a very welcome improvement and reform, and I am proud that it is the government of which I am a member doing it in 1997. The shadow minister, the member for Banks (Mr Melham), who just spoke, is the deputy chair of the House of House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and I am very proud and honoured to be its chairman. I do thank all my colleagues from all parties for their contribution and support in the work we do. One of the most exciting and challenging things that I have ever had to face in my life is meeting the challenges of the reference that is currently before the committee and on which it is working hard. It is, in effect, to recommend to the parliament, the government and the minister ways of improving the autonomy of Torres Strait Islanders and to take into account the implications. While observing the protocols of the committee which is currently undertaking the inquiry-and I will not abuse those protocols in any shape or form-I can say that this amendment certainly would have very strong sympathy from my committee as being one of the essential ingredients towards achieving greater autonomy for Torres Strait Islanders .. When I fist visited the Torres Strait Island people on the islands last year, I was struck by their dignity and their commitment to each other, their great commitment to their Christian beliefs, their pride in their culture and their history, and their passion for this country. These qualities are on the public record, in transcripts that have been authorised for publication, so they are available for all to see. It was a wonderful thing to hear the Torres Strait Islanders teach us about their traditions and their involvement in this great country and talk about what they had done to help defend it against the Japanese invasion and to help us build, while enduring the most dreadful conditions, infrastructure such as railways. They are very proud of the fact that part of our railway network in isolated areas of Australia was built with the skill, dedication and fortitude of Torres Strait Islander people. One thing that made me very happy was their constantly saying to everybody that they are proud to be part of Australia and want to continue to be part of Australia, that they are Australians. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that some years ago there was a suggestion that some people on Torres Strait Islands wished to secede from Australia. That is not the case. Torres Strait Islanders passionately want to be part of Australia's future, to help build it and help it become even greater. That is why this legislation is a step in that direction. Without pre-empting my committee's deliberations or what it might recommend, I say that there are enormous barriers-and it is on the public record-between the decision makers in government and indigenous people in this country. There are barriers in terms of legislative frameworks, bureaucracies, authorities, agencies and the like. These barriers should not continue. Indigenous people, including Torres Strait Islanders, should have the same access to their governmentCommonwealth, state and local governments-as all Australians. The obstacles that our indigenous people face to have their voices heard, to have their hopes and aspirations analysed by government-and I invite honourable members to go into this more thoroughly when they get the time-are quite incredible. It is sad that we have allowed this to happen. I hope you support my view that the great thing we can do for indigenous people is to give them a great sense of self-reliance, a feeling that they have control over their own lives and their own communities, just as all Australians do. Let me assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, they do not have that control at the moment. Under the present legislative set-ups, Torres Strait Islanders are denied the right to have a direct say in their own everyday affairs. That is something that I, along with the committee, will be passionately addressing. We hope that we can come forward with ideas. When I was visiting one of the islands, I had the pleasure of spending some time with a young Torres Strait Islander who had recently qualified as a tradesman, having served his apprenticeship and done his TAFE training on mainland Australia. I asked him what his hopes and aspirations were for his young contemporaries, his friends, on the islands. He said, 'Lou, I'd like them to have the same opportunities that I've had. I'd like to be able to teach them what I've had the benefit of being able to learn. I'd like them be able to build their own homes on our islands for our people, rather than us having to have people from the mainland come over and do it for us-not that there's anything wrong with those people; in fact, I've learnt a lot from them. I would like to teach them. I would like the opportunity to teach them.' He told me that, as a very young boy, he had learnt to give his aunt a hypodermic injection into the abdomen because she suffered from diabetes. He told me that he expected that he would also develop diabetes because this was part of the health profile of people on the islands. I was shaken by that, I must say. I wanted to think about it and consider why this should be. I believe that part of the reason that the health of our indigenous people, particularly those on Torres Strait Island, is so bad in so many ways is that they have not been able to manage their own affairs as I think they should be able to. Unfortunately, they have become more reliant on others telling them how to do it and what to do. We all know that they have been great providers for themselves and their families. We know that they are skilled cultivators of intensive agricultural vegetable production. We know that their skills as fisher people are legend-incredible. They have sustained and fed their families for hundreds of years. But, regretfully, that sort of activity is no longer the norm on the islands. It is quite the reverse. They are no longer self-reliant in so many of those areas. That, unhappily, is because well-meaning people over the years have supplanted their own endeavours, their own enterprise and their own wish to be selfsufficient with the provision of government which has sapped some of their own selfesteem, I suspect, and certainly denied them the ability to get on and to achieve, as they have done so well over so many hundreds of years. I could see the great fish population as I got closer to the islands. I could see them swimming around the islands and in one conversation I had with an Islander I asked him how often he fished and he said, 'We only fish when we're broke.' I said, 'Please explain.' to And he said, 'Most of my friends and family only go fishing when we've run out of our allowance because we get our food from the supermarket on the islands. We buy our food there now. We don't go fishing as we normally might have done in bygone years.' Of course, the sort of food that you find in the supermarkets is processed food, processed sausages. I said to one young person, 'What did you have for breakfast today?' and he said, 'Processed pork sausage.' I said, 'What are you going to have for lunch?' and he said, 'Probably beef sausage.' 'What are you having for dinner tonight?' and he said, 'As a matter of fact, one of our mates is bringing over Kentucky Fried Chicken. We are having a community singsong tonight and we are having Kentucky Fried Chicken.' Those of us who happen to know a little bit about managing your own health would understand that, if at an early age that is the basic diet, as you grow older you may develop serious preventable diseases such as diabetes. I see a direct link between those sorts of things-those terrible blows to the health of those Torres Strait Islanders and other indigenous people-and the fact that they do not have a direct say over their future. They do not have direct links with government. They have too many layers interrupting the passage of good dialogue and advocacy for their needs. I see this legislation as being a long overdue and very welcome move to give them more access to ATSIC. But I can foreshadow-again, without breaching the protocols as the chair of a committee currently undertaking a very important and challenging inquiry-that this is not going to solve the enormous challenges and problems those people have in achieving the proper level of autonomy. That is why with some excitement I look forward to being able to deliberate with my colleagues and bring down a report to this government, to the parliament and to Australia which I hope will be an example to all as to the sorts of things that can be done by governments for indigenous people to enable indigenous people to go forward and to do all the wonderful things they should be able to do but which they are being inhibited from being able to do because they do not have the right access. I will just briefly make a contrast in relation to this. When I go back to my home in northeast Victoria, I think about these things: I have a municipal council under a local government, and I have a right to vote for candidates regularly. That council is responsible for certain very important things. It also interfaces with other local governments in the region and, of course, with state and federal governments. If you go to the Torres Strait Islands and look for that sort of model, you do not find it. There is part of a local government model, but it does not extend totally over all of the communities. In fact, some representatives are on one agency and not on others and you have different authorities involved, and the TSRA is a classic example of that. The TSRA is actually responsible for many things, but it does not quite do other things because other agencies up there are crowding it. They are involved as well. This legislation is just the beginning of what is, hopefully, going to be picked up by the parliament and governments for the Torres Strait Islanders. It will enhance their future and recognise at long last their right to improved and increased autonomy. Above all, it will help us to address the urgent health issues that present themselves in the Torres Strait Islands. Unfortunately, the death rate for women in the Torres Strait Islands is the highest of any indigenous people in the world. Their health problems cause them to die earlier than any other indigenous people in the world. Why should this be? What fine, noble, beautiful Australians they are. It should not be. This means that every effort has to be made by all of us in this parliament, those of us who are involved in the policy, to address the issues. In my view, it is so damned obvious that we can help the Torres Strait Islander people and we can improve their health. We can increase their self-reliance and give them all the things they are entitled to have by looking at the way in which governments interface with them. We can do all we can to remove the obstacles. My hope is to give them the maximum say over their affairs, no holds barred. Obviously the shadow minister's support and encouragement to me as chair of the committee is much appreciated, but I was sorry to hear the shadow minister referring to other issues in his contribution today, and I know he has the right to do that. Certainly, if I wanted to, I could answer most of what he said, but I will not. I will not take the opportunity, even though I am a politician and I am tempted to do it, in this debate. I will not weaken the importance of this legislation or the message that the government and I are trying to give our indigenous brothers and sisters by becoming involved in a squabble over politics which, I regret very much, the shadow minister has introduced at the level of intensity that he did in his contribution today. I know he has the right to do it. I just find it a bit sad. I am not daunted, however, and I know that he, in his own heart, will support good reforms for indigenous people. I certainly look forward to working with him to that end.",21
11,Mr TRUSS,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"Wide Bay) (10.30 a.m.}-I am happy to also support the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment (TSRA) Bill, which makes amendments to separate the current budget of the Torres Strait Regional Authority from the budget of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. These measures will certainly promote greater financial autonomy for Torres Strait Islanders. I am pleased to note that they are being supported by all members of the House. There is no doubt that there are significant differences between Torres Strait Islanders and mainland Aborigines. I listened with interest to the warm comments of the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) about his experiences in meeting Torres Strait Islanders. I think everybody who travels to that area comes away with similar impressions. They are, indeed, proud Australians; they have been prepared to demonstrate their loyalty to their country in wartime at considerable personal sacrifice; they played a front-line role in the defence of our country; and they have also been prepared to contribute towards the social and economic welfare of our country. It is sometimes a pity that because they are so far away from the capital cities few Australians know much about Torres Strait Island culture. I hope that one of the benefits of this measure before the House today will be that it will provide Torres Strait Islanders with control of their own resources so that they are able to make all Australians better aware of their culture, their contribution to our country and their capacity to contribute even more in the future. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), in his second reading speech, states: Since its establishment on 1 July 1994, the TSRA has demonstrated its ability to discharge its tions and responsibility in an exemplary manner. As the TSRA matures, increased autonomy should be accorded to enable it to manage its own affairs and prioritise its functions. The separation of funding arrangements from ATSIC would facilitate this. That paragraph sums up the intent of the bill and its objectives-and they are indeed laudable. I can also understand the wish of the Torres Strait Regional Authority to want to take this opportunity to distance itself in some regard from the operations of ATSIC. I know there has been a degree of internal disputation within that organisation and also, at times, between Torres Strait Islanders and mainland Aborigines. I have been somewhat personally disappointed at the lack of progress in improving accountability in the financial affairs of ATSIC and a lot of the Aboriginal organisations that operate around our country. It seems that corruption is almost accepted in some of those organisations and expenditure on a whole range of issues would not stand any degree of detailed public scrutiny. I note with interest the attention of journalists on the travel expenses of members of parliament. I wonder what they would uncover if they were to examine the expenses of ATSIC commissioners. I look at what is happening in legal aid funding for Aborigines and in almost every state there are serious allegations-and some seem to have substantial substanceabout the misuse of funding that is provided and about the internal feuding within these organisations, which is clearly damaging their capacity to undertake their functions effectively. There are also problems in dealing with the question of nepotism. In European societ-, nepotism is unacceptable. However, there IS a conflict when dealing with this European ethic and the traditional responsibility that Aborigines feel for their own families. It is difficult to deal with this issue of Aborigines feeling an obligation to do the best they possibly can for their own children and their own families against what we would expect in the administration of funding-namely, that it should be given to those in need or those who have the greatest demand. There are funcrepeated stories of housing corporations where the best houses are occupied by the chairman of the cooperative and his family and others who may have greater need have to live in houses where there is no money available for even basic maintenance. These sorts of things are really unacceptable. But whenever anyone draws attention to these matters they are immediately branded a racist and there is often no real effort made to address the issues of concern. It would be far better if ATSIC and the Torres Strait Regional Authority could address these matters internally and satisfy their critics from within through their own performance rather than these matters becoming the subject of bitter community debate and angry calls to members of parliament around the nation. It seems to me that almost every time a constituent of mine returns from a visit to the Northern Territory or the gulf parts of Queensland they phone me to complain about what they regard as wastage in funding for Aboriginal affairs-facilities provided that are falling into disrepair and the like. This sort thing damages reconciliation. It is very difficult for there to be real and meaningful reconciliation when there is a lack of public confidence in the way in which funds are being expended. Police are often reluctant to act because there is great pressure upon them and the court system not to put Aboriginals in custody following the national inquiry on this issue. Because of all the paperwork that is involved and because of the strong likelihood that even if there is a conviction there will be a minimum penalty and certainly no custodial sentence wherever that is possible, there is a reluctance on the part of police forces or investigators to take the necessary action to stamp out cases of law breaking and unmitigated corruption. Unfortunately also, often in these organisations the records are just so poor that it is impossible to trace where the money has gone. Everyone knows that it is missing but no-one can really prove who has taken it. The people who take this money and go away do not seem to realise that, whilst they may be getting some short-term personal benefit, they are damaging their cause. They are damaging public confidence in the reconciliation process and they are damaging public confidence in the whole range of Aboriginal organisations. In so doing, they are doing their people a gross disservice. They are doing their people an infinitely worse disservice than has occurred just as a result of the theft, not that theft can be justified and not that the misappropriation of the funds can in any way be justified. Where cases can be found, there needs to be a vigorous pursuit of the law. These people are damaging their own cause. That is a big loss to our society, particularly to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. By way of an example, an organisation in my electorate called Thoorgine has contributed significantly to the local community. They have instigated a number of worthwhile business projects but, unfortunately, poor management-maybe even corrupt management-has allowed the funds to dissipate. Seemingly financially successful businesses are now in deficit and there is not much doubt of that the organisation has been technically bankrupt now for several years. It has taken all of this time for the registrar of Aboriginal corporations to take any action. In the meantime, businesses in the community are awaiting their bills to be paid and confidence in all Aboriginal organisations in the area is therefore damaged. No-one wants to give any Aboriginal organisation credit because of their bad experiences with some poor managers and some corrupt officials. The people currently seeking to sustain Thoorgine seem to me to be working very hard and trying their best to restore the organisation and to rebuild public confidence, but the damage is done. It is important that action be taken in these cases. If the culprits can be identified, they need to be charged so that others who are innocent can have their good names cleared. This is the kind of thing that has caused a great deal of damage to Aboriginal organisations and needs to be addressed as part of the reconciliation process. The incoming government has moved swiftly to reform the administration of Aboriginal affairs and to better scrutinise expenditure. The government has reduced funding to a whole stack of organisations. Indeed, many have had their funding terminated, and justifiably so, because they have been unable to account for the money that has been spent in the past. Auditors are examining the financial affairs of many organisations. There are federal and state police investigations current in many instances. The government has rightly redirected its financial assistance towards Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to crucial areas such as better health care, education and work opportunities. Further restructuring of ATSIC has been foreshadowed. The government is seeking to upgrade management standards. It certainly rejects Labor's view that all of the problems in Aboriginal affairs can somehow or other be corrected by merely rewriting the history of our country's dealings with Aboriginal people. We are a country that has a right to be proud of our history and the efforts of our pioneers. Of course, not all that has been done has been perfect. We should in no way condone the efforts of some to denigrate the achievements of our forefathers. Nonetheless, Australia has a clear responsibility to its Aboriginal people to ensure that their standard of living is improved and that they enjoy equal opportunities with their fellow Australians. This obligation means that some special programs may be necessary to increase their life expectancy and to raise their standards of health, literacy and work skills to the national average. The facts are that life expectancy for Aboriginal males is 18 years less than the national average and 20 years less for females. At the end of 1995, 120 Aboriginal communities had inadequate water supplies, 134 had no sewerage and 250 had no electricity. One in two Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students left school before reaching 16, compared with one in four non-Aboriginal Australians. Despite the billions of dollars that have been spent over recent years, so many Aborigines lack basic services. That is the sort of record that the member for Banks (Mr Melham) seemingly was attempting to defend in his contribution to this debate. There is no evidence that granting large amounts of land title or aimlessly throwing money at Aboriginal organisations will provide any magical improvement to the lot of the people. Indeed, in many instances their circumstances seem to have become even worse. The main winners have been white lawyers and the so-called Aboriginal industry. I find it deplorable that some of the worse stories of violence, drunkenness and unemployment are coming from those centres where the Aboriginal community has had title to the land for decades. It is not a magic cure. I deplore those who seek to suggest that all issues can be resolved by a couple of words of apology or granting extra areas of title. The key to a better future for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders is meaningful employment opportunities so that they are able to contribute constructively to their country and raise their own self-esteem. Their culture and history needs to be recognised as a primary part of Australia's cultural diversity. The people should be accepted on the basis of their talents and abilities in any situation. The member for Banks, in his comments, called for bipartisanship on Aboriginal affairs but then sought to enter into a tirade of abuse against the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and this government for their efforts in dealing with Aboriginal issues. The fact is that, sadly, the member for Banks has himself been one of the most divisive figures in Aboriginal affairs. He has been divisive within his own party, and he has certainly contributed very little towards constructive debate on these important issues. When he says he wants a bipartisan approach and then, with a Churchillian declaration of war, promises to fight the government's native title proposals line by line, how can there be any acceptance of his claim that he is interested in bipartisanship and discussion? We do need to work together as Australians to promote goodwill and to promote reconciliation. That requires a two-way effort. It certainly requires all Australians to accept that they have an obligation towards Aboriginal people. But it also requires Aborigines to acknowledge that the funds that have been provided for necessary Aboriginal programs need to be spent wisely, and the Aboriginal community should respond positively to these initiatives. There is a great deal to be done. No-one suggests that this legislation will resolve the problems of Torres Strait Islanders or Aboriginal people, but it is a constructive step and I think it does give Torres Strait Islanders an opportunity to achieve a greater degree of financial autonomy and to demonstrate that they have the capacity to continue to manage their own affairs effectively and well. It is beyond doubt that the culture of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders has been irreparably damaged. It is beyond dispute that Aboriginal people like Kentucky Fried Chicken, as the member for Indi referred to previously, just as much as European Australians do. No-one should expect that they would want to go back to living on speared kangaroos or an exclusive diet of fish or the other products that they traditionally won in the past. Their lifestyle has been damaged by the arrival of television, the Internet, air travel and everything else that inevitably overwhelms their culture. We need to recognise the existence of this enormous threat to their way of life, but it is unrealistic to suggest that we can tum back the clock. It does not matter whether you go to a deserted island; modern medical science and the desire of the world to ensure that what is available in our society is available to all will overwhelm any proposals to seek to go back to a bygone era. We may regret that fact but it is inevitable that the world has moved on. So it is important that we provide for Torres Strait Islanders and for Aboriginal people a capacity to move into the 20th century to make the 20th century work also for them and to make sure that they are not a forgotten or lost generation in this day but that they have the opportunity to contribute to our country and to benefit from the many wonderful opportunities that Australia offers. I support the legislation. I hope that it will make a worthwhile contribution to improving the lifestyle and opportunities for Torres Strait Islanders.",25
12,Mr JULL,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"May I thank all those who contributed to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment (TSRA) Bill and the House for the bipartisan approach it has taken. This bill is in fact good legislation and does reflect a very real success story in terms of the Torres Strait Regional Authority. The bill will give a great deal of emphasis to the authority and indeed I think will be appreciated by Torres Strait Islanders, because the bill is going to give Torres Strait Islanders, and the authority, complete control of their own destiny that is provided with their financial autonomy. I would like to thank all the members who made a contribution for their full support of the bill. I think it will make a significant contribution to the better management of Torres Strait Islander affairs by Torres Strait Islanders themselves. Could I particularly thank the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) and the member for Wide Way (Mr Truss) for their contribution and for demonstrating that we all share a deep concern for and involvement in the future of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Jull) read a third time. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 18 June, on motion by Mr Ronaldson: That the bill be now read a second time.",28
13,Mr TANNER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"Melbourne) (10.50 a.m.)The Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) is an omnibus bill with five major amendments with respect to aviation policy and various pieces of legislation which have been outlined in the second reading speech delivered by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Ronaldson). I will run through very quickly the substance of the amendments to the legislation that is proposed in the bill. First, airport terminal operators are to be given some degree of responsibility for the maintenance of security in sterile areas because of the fact that, increasingly, the areas post the security check positions in airports are including commercial premises and activities, which therefore means that the airlines are at present effectively engaged in security arrangements with respect to a range of things that have nothing to do with people actually getting into planes. So it is therefore sought in these amendments to increase the responsibility that applies with respect to terminal operators to maintain security in those areas. This applies to a range of things, such as commercial deliveries and the like, which are necessary for the maintenance of those commercial activities. The second of the five major amendments is to allow for partial cost recovery for adminment istrative expenses incurred by the government, by the department, from airport terminal operators. The third major amendment is to insert a new objective into the legislation governs the operations of Airservices Australwhat is. This will require the organisation to have as its objective 'promoting and fostering civil aviation' . The fourth of the major amendments is to provide for compensation under insurance ports. provisions that apply with respect to loss of life in aviation accidents to be made available to de facto spouses or partners as well as those who are married to victims of such persuasions crashes. The final major amendment that within this amending legislation is to provide for the International Air Services Commission to have responsibility for allocating so-called fifth freedom rights to international airlines. Fifth freedom rights are otherwise known as 'beyond rights'. They are rights that apply between destinations which are both outside Australia. For example, in relation to an Australian airline seeking to fly between London and Singapore, the intention of this amendment is areas. to ensure that the separation of the role of the department of transport, with respect to the negotiation of international bilateral agreeobjective ments regarding aviation rights, from the International Air Services Commission, which has a responsibility for allocating those rights to carriers, is finally completed and therefore the fifth freedom rights allocation becomes the obligation of the International Air Services Commission. I will run through the opposition's view on each of these proposals fairly quickly. In total, the opposition supports the legislation, but I do have a few comments to make with respect to one or two of the amendments. The opposition supports the amendment which seeks to place security obligations on terminal operators in airports. We believe that makes sense, given the increasing change that is occurring with respect to operations in airports and the growing importance of commercial operations, including within security or sterile areas. We support also the move by the govern to allow for cost recovery, with respect to administrative costs associated with regulation of airport activity, to be taken from airport terminal operators. But, in passing, I that point out that I would be interested to know view the new airport owners and potential bidders for the remaining airports have with respect to this obligation being imposed on them, given that it is ex post facto the airport sale process for the three major airIt indicates, I think, something that I drew attention to at the time of the airport sale to process-namely, that governments of both in the future are likely to be faced is with issues emerging that require them to make decisions that impact on the commercial interests of airport terminal operators under the new privati sed regime that, in some instances, were not in contemplation at the time of the sale occurring. This is probably one pretty minor example of this, but I think it does indicate that the government needs to keep in mind how it is going to address such matters in the future, because I do believe these matters will eventuate in a range of The opposition does not oppose the third of the major amendments that provides for a new to be inserted into the Airservices Australia legislation-namely, to promote and foster civil aviation. However, it does raise some questions about what exactly is the purpose of inserting this amendment. I would be interested to hear, for example, the parliamentary secretary, in his summing up, indicate in what way he believes Airservices Australia at present either is not doing this or is in fact hamstrung from promoting and fostering civil aviation in a way in which it ought to be doing it. I suspect that this amendment reflects the thrill seeker in the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) that is never far below the surface-captured, as he is, by particular sectional interests within the aviation industry, interests that are in fact a relatively small minority part of the total industry and who are infected to a degree with attitudes that very strongly oppose many aspects of aviation regulation and that see organisations like the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Airservices Australia as bureaucratic, dictatorial organisations that impose unjust regulation and expense on poor individual fliers who just want to get up there, fly around and have the freedom to essentially do what they like. This view, I suspect, lurks beneath the surface of this amendment. It is, in my view, a harmless amendment. I cannot see any great purpose in inserting this into the objectives that apply with respect to the Airservices Australia legislation. If it is understood in an appropriate way, in a relatively narrow way in a certain context, then it is perfectly acceptable. If Airservices is to have the role of promoting and fostering civil aviation by providing the best possible air traffic control services, by ensuring that the best available flight path arrangements are going to be provided to the industry, by ensuring that the best available fire services protection is going to be provided to aviation operators, then, fine, it is no problem at all lllsert this objective into the Airservices Australia legislation. But it does raise some interesting questions. Sydney airport is a good example. What happens if we get to a situation where the interests of the industry are in conflict with other interests, such as local residents, and Airservices Australia is primarily responsible for making decisions on matters such as flight paths where some decision has to be made balancing those competing interests? If we insert into the legislation a provision that requires Airservices to promote and foster civil aviation in Australia, it could be argued that that imposes an additional obligation on Airservices in its approach to such matters. That may mean that its role has to tilt or be biased in some way more in favour of the interests of those who are aviation operators seeking to use the services of an airport, seeking to have the best available flight path arrangements-seeking those flight path arrangements, for example, which lead to the lowest cost with respect to fuel and the likeand that by definition the interests of local residents will have to be secondary. That is an interpretation of this provision that I would reject and I would be interested to know what the government has in its mind when it is putting forward this particular clause. I would be keen to hear the parliamentary secretary in his conclusion of this debate respond to this point and indicate whether in his view this will impose any additional obligation on Airservices Australia to favour the aviation industry when it is addressing such matters and to make more subsidiary or less important the interests of other interested parties that it has to deal with, such as local residents, when it is addressing flight path issues. As I said, I do not believe in the final analysis that this amendment will mean very much. I believe it has its origins in the peculiar view of the minister on aviation and his ongoing paranoia about organisations which he regards as bureaucratic enclaves that are full of Labor stooges and are there to make life difficult for good, ordinary, honest aviators when he is now in charge of them. He to might consider tackling some of the things he sees as problems by doing something rather than haranguing them. If the interpretation which I would regard is the correct one applies, I believe the amendment is inoffensive and, therefore, is capable of being accepted. The opposition supports the move to ensure that de facto spouses get access to insurance entitlements on the same basis as married partners with respect to aviation disasters. This is clearly a long overdue change which, from memory, comes out of experience with the Monarch disaster, a matter which the current minister was substantially involved in pursuing. We certainly agree that it is wrong that de facto spouses should be discriminated against with respect to insurance entitlements. Therefore, we support this amendment wholeheartedly. The final amendment of substance in this legislation relates to the fifth freedom rights question and the role of the International Air Services Commission in determining how fifth freedom rights are allocated. The opposition sees this amendment as essentially irrelevant and unnecessary but inoffensive, largely because fifth freedom rights are dictated by third freedom rights. For example, in order for Qantas to be able to fly a flight from Singapore to London, by definition it has to have the right to fly to London or Singapore from Australia. In other words, the mere existence of a possibility of exercising a fifth freedom right has its origins in the fact that third freedom rights have been granted to a particular airline. In order for Qantas to be able to fly, for example, from Singapore to London, by definition it has to be able to fly from Sydney to Singapore and London, then back to Sydney. In a sense, giving the International Air Services Commission the obligation to formally divide up, parcel out and authorise fifth freedom rights is unnecessary. There are only a handful of examples where there is any need to go through this process formally. I do have some minor concerns that this amendment may increase the burden that exists on international airlines and the processes that they have to go through to obtain rights to operate internationally. I suspect that that additional burden will probably be a fairly minor one but, given the point of view that I have expressed, I would be interested to hear the government's explanation as to why this is absolutely necessary. In overall terms, the opposition is comfortable with the legislation, having mentioned some of the reservations that I have. We do not oppose the legislation. We do, however, have a general concern about the government's aviation policy, in particular its attitude to regulation of domestic aviation activity and the behaviour of the minister to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority in particular, and to a lesser extent Airservices, on a range of issues which reflect a cavalier, cowboy attitude to aviation safety regulation. I think that is of considerable concern. As I mentioned, this attitude can be detected in parts of this amending legislation. Our second major area of concern is the international aviation sector and the increasing pressure that is being put on our two international operators-Qantas and Ansett-by government aviation policy, by liberaJisation of our bilateral rights arrangements. I certainly am happy with the notion of competition to ensure that Qantas and Ansett are kept on their toes and kept honest, and that we have a reasonable balance between Australian carriers providing international aviation services for this nation and foreign carriers. However, I am concerned that, if that pressure continues to intensify, there will be a serious risk of loss of Australian jobs, loss of Australian economic activity and loss of Australian exports. It is important again to remember that Qantas is our third biggest individual exporter, that by selling its aviation services Qantas exports a very substantial amount, and Ansett has now entered into that market. One would hope that it grows into a major exporter for Australia as well. More to the point, the types of jobs that emerge from this activity are almost invariably skilled, well-paid jobs which provide job satisfaction and value to those who are performing them. This is something which this country should not let go lightly. There is a substantial trend in international aviation away from national carriers. There are a number of national carriers in Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean countries, which are in some difficulties. Eventually a rationalisation process will have to occur there because those airlines are a drain on the public purse of a number of countries. Australia is in a slightly different position in this regard because we are a considerable distance away from almost everybody else. We are in a unique geographical position and therefore in a position where the logic of having national carriers has substantially greater weight than, for example, the logic of Luxembourg having a national airline. Therefore, I suggest to the government that it should move very cautiously with respect to the liberalisation of international aviation. It certainly does provide some benefits. We certainly have a strong interest in ensuring not only that costs are continually reduced and that we get better services-there is no question about that-but also that Australia continues to have world-class international aviation operators, and there is no question that Qantas and Ansett are world-class airlines which function effectively. Qantas and Ansett are getting into international alliances. We heard an announcement only a few days ago regarding the alliance that Ansett has entered into. I am certainly very pleased to see that. We want to make sure that they continue to operate in an environment which enables them to function and ensure that the proportion of our total aviation market that is held by Australian carriers remains at approximately what it is now. The opposition supports the legislation and will not be moving any amendments.",28
14,Mr MAREK,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"Capricornia) (11.08 a.m.)The Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997 makes several important amendments to existing acts: the Air Navigation Act, the Airports Act, the Air Services Act, the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act and the International Air Services Commission Act. I think it is important to touch on a few of the topics mentioned by the previous speaker, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). The shadow minister for transport, the honourable member for Melbourne, spoke of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) and his 'cowboy activities'. Relating that to the industry, I think those statements are rather farcical. What it is all about is having ministers, not only now but in the future, who know about the industry. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the Hon. John Sharp, is a pilot. It is important that people running this country know about their industry. This legislation is long overdue. It is good to see that this government is prepared to put ministers into ministries which they know about. The bill addresses the screening point and who does the screening. It is imperative that when people go through the various parts of airport terminals to be screened or checked through security it is done only once, if possible. In many ways people consider it to be somewhat of an invasion of their privacy to have their goods screened over and over again. We are implementing a system whereby operators will be responsible for the screening process and will ensure that screening is done effectively and correctly and, if possible, is user-friendly as well. The amendments are trying to make the system more user-friendly. At the end of the day, who would be better to control the system than the operators themselves? They are the people who have to sell the tickets and get people to fly in their aircraft. Those airlines, I would imagine, which tend to look after their passengers and give the best service are the carriers that will do well now and into the future. The bill also makes provisions in relation to sterile areas. Once people have been screened it is imperative that they are put into what is considered a sterile area. This is to protect the country from certain diseases carried in foods, et cetera. When people move from one end of the country to the other there are all sorts of things we want to ensure are not brought onto aircraft and transferred from one place to the other. Once again, we are putting together a system that makes it all user-friendly. Another area the bill deals with is the freedom rights of aircraft. We have in Rockhampton a very suitable airport which is being linked up with Capricornia International, a large tourist facility. The Capricornia International resort was built by Mr Iwasaki. He has a vision of being able to bring people from his country, Japan, directly to Rockhampton, rather than their having to go through international terminals like Sydney, Brisbane, Cairns and so forth. This legislation helps him as a business operator to bring aircraft to this country. That is what we are talking about in relation to freedom rights. The amendments will ensure that airlines remain responsible for what is carried on aircraft. Checks must be done to ensure various goods are screened for disease ous to being transported. We are making operators of terminals in sterile areas responto sible for access control and passenger screendare ing, with the Department of Transport and the past. Regional Development having the power to designate the sterile area and any conditions of operation. These amendments will provide a significant benefit. Once again, they will make the system more user-friendly. The bill also makes minor amendments to the Airports Act 1996, which allows fees be levied under the regulations made for the purposes of environment protection, at least in relation to airports. It is imperative have an effective system in this country only for the people who are being transported from one end of the country to the other but also for the people who are running it, so they can keep costs to a minimum to operate. Another area of amendment is Airservices. Its primary function is to provide for the safe navigation of aircraft. It is essential that in a large country like Australia, with population centres separated by long distances, we have aviation. rapid, safe and reliable communication links. This amendment aims to ensure that the systems within this country work to the ... greatest of benefit of all. I have been involved with the aviation industry for a number of years now. In the past I had my own aircraft and transited myself around the country. It is important that we have a system in this country that caters for large operators and small private operators so that we can frequent various parts of the country in safety, so that we are not only protecting ourselves, but protecting the rest of the country as well. That is why I keep coming back to the point of screening people. At the end of the day people do not really know what they can and cannot carry on an aircraft. It is important that these screening points are put in place and sterile areas are made workable. I commend the bill to the House. I hope that with future amendments-and not only their just in this portfolio--we can continue to that have ministers who are involved with and previknow their portfolios, rather than shadow ministers and people in the future who purport know something about the industry but I say never have had great involvement 1'1",32
15,Mr ALBANESE,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"I am pleased to speak in this House today on the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2). As I have stated previously, with any aviation issue which comes before this House it is important that the people of the to inner western suburbs of Sydney are represented. It is unfortunate that the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) does not necessarily join that we me in this view. When it comes to Sydney not airport he has an ostrich like approach: he puts his head in the sand and hopes the issue will go away. But the issue just will not go that away-just ask anyone living close to the and afford Sydney airport. This bill makes some attempt to improve security issues connected to the running of airports in Australia. The government, in its explanatory memorandum on the bill, states: The broad aim of aviation security regulation is to promote a secure environment for Australian civil members of the general public should be secure from the occurrence of acts of unlawful interference in relation to aircraft flying overhead ... This bill does not go far enough. On 6 November last year I placed a question on notice to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) regarding a widely documented incident where fuel was seen to spray from a jet as it took off from Sydney airport in the direction of Drummoyne. I received a response to that question from the minister in which he outlined that a US registered Evergreen Airlines aircraft did vent fuel over my electorate and the electorate of Lowe on 15 October 1996 and that, in fact, that particular flight vented fuel all the way from the end of runway to Drummoyne, a distance of some 10 kilometres. The Evergreen Airlines flight was chartered from Qantas and was a freight flight on the way to Hong Kong. A number of constituents had rung my office because they had seen fuel spraying out the back of that particular aircraft. In the hours afterwards they were forced to wipe away the black soot which comes off the fuel and lands on their cars, washing and homes. In response to those concerns from constituents, I raised the matter with the minister and received a reply. However, the reply from the minister was quite inadequate at that stage, so I placed a further question on noticequestion No. 1557-to the minister and received a reply to that yesterday. The minister has informed me that there were four separate incidents of Evergreen Airlines jets spraying fuel over my electorate and the electorate of Lowe. The first incident occurred on 30 July 1996 at 13.12 hours. A plane, which left on the main north-south runway in a direct line to Castle Hill, sprayed fuel all the way from the runway right up to Castle Hill. On 13 August 1996 another incident occurred at 13.23 hours. This time the aircraft sprayed fuel in a direct line to Baulkham Hills. On 15 October 1996 an aircraft left at 12.56 hours and sprayed fuel from Drummoyne in a direct line to Castle Hill. On 14 January 1997-it is important to note that this is some three months after I put questions on notice to the minister about this issue-at 14.19 hours an Evergreen Airlines flight sprayed fuel from Tempe all the way to Baulkham Hills. These aircraft were all Boeing 747 200s. They have a capacity to vent approximately 379 litres of fuel-that is 189.5 litres in each wing-through their venting system. That level of fuel spraying over people's residences, houses, schools, parks and cars on an ongoing, regular, systematic basis is just not good enough and is something which I am sure everyone in this House would agree is totally unacceptable.",33
16,Mr CADMAN,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"Hear, hear!",34
17,Mr ALBANESE,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"I am sure the member for Mitchell would be concerned about this issue for the constituents in his electorate. Evergreen Airlines have a pretty poor record. They are being investigated in Australia and have also been subject to investigations in the United States regarding the inadequacies of their maintenance procedures. I raised the issue of Evergreen Airlines in this House back in March, and I called then for them to be excluded from operation in Australia. It is simply not good enough for an airline to act with such contempt for residents under flight paths, be it at Sydney airport or anywhere else. The government should take further action against this airline. It is not good enough to have a slap and tickle approach. Quite clearly, even after the issue has been raised-and I first placed questions on notice way back on 6 November, 1996--and they have been brought to account by the government, they have continued to show contempt. Mr Ronaldson-I rise on a point of order. I do not want to pull the member to a close on this, but we have been fairly lenient. This is not related to the bill, and there has been a fair bit of indulgence over the last 10 minutes in relation to this matter. I think he has made his point.",34
18,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"I thank the parliamentary .secretary, and I uphold the point of order. I was on the point of saying to the member for Grayndler that I have been through the legislation quite carefully and, while I acknowledge his very sincere concern about the issues he is talking about, they do not, to my knowledge, appear in the bill. So, as he continues, I would suggest that he try to direct his remarks to the content of the bill.",34
19,Mr ALBANESE,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"Certainly. I will first express a view as to the honourable member opposite's point of order. The bill does change the objectives of Airservices Australia, so that they will promote and foster civil aviation. While the opposition is supporting this legislation, we are concerned that, in promoting and fostering civil aviation, the interests of residents be clearly taken into account and not just the interests of airlines. Further, I remind the House that, in the explanatory memorandum, it statesMr Ronaldson-I rise on a point of order. With the greatest respect, the honourable member is debating your ruling. Your ruling quite clearly said that the discussion was not in order.",34
20,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"I thank the parliamentary secretary. The honourable member for Grayndler will, of course, address his remarks to the contents of the bill, which are quite specific.",35
21,Mr ALBANESE,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"The particular part of the bill's contents to which I wish to draw the House's attention once again is in the explanatory memorandum, drawn up by the government. There it says that 'members of the general public should be secure from the occurrence of acts of unlawful interference in relation to aircraft flying overhead.' I can think of no greater example of members of the public being affected by aircraft flying overhead than when fuel is dumped literally on their heads as an aircraft goes over them. So it is very clear that this bill is relevant to the issue of fuel dumping on the residents of Sydney. I am pleased that the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) is here expressing concern as well, because this is not a partisan issue. This is something which anyone who is around the airport and represents the interests of constituents around the airport would be extremely concerned about. It is important that these issues be considered here and that they be further considered by the Sydney Airport Community Forum, which is chaired by the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey). The Sydney Airport Community Forum has considered these issues. It is a representative body which includes four members of this House: the members for North Sydney, Barton (Mr MCClelland), Lowe (Mr Zammit) and me. At its next meeting, we will certainly be taking up this issue again, because the ongoing breaches by Evergreen Airlines are only a more extreme example of what residents in my electorate have to cope with every day. Anyone who lives under the flight paths of Sydney airport can tell stories about having to go out and clean their car before they get into it in the morning and about incidents when they were able to smell jet fuel-and to see it coming out of aeroplanes, in more extreme cases. There are two ways in which that occurs. One is as a result of a conscious decision by pilots to vent air fuel. They make a conscious decision in order to change the weight of the aircraft. To me, that occurring over residences is an extraordinary proposition and something which-when the ongoing impact of this bill is considered, in terms of the explanatory memorandum about taking into account the concerns of residents--certainly needs to be addressed. Secondly, fuel comes out of aeroplanes through carelessness. Some aircraftparticularly taking off to the north of Sydney airport-have faulty maintenance and, therefore, fuel comes out through the vents. This is something which has occurred regularly and can be solved by a number of measures. One measure is to tell airlines like Evergreen that they are not welcome here. Another is to ensure that there are proper maintenance facilities for aircraft, and proper checks and accountability. Thirdly, and very importantly, where airlines digress, they need to be made to account for their digressions. There need to be hefty-not just slap and tickle-fines which provide a financial incentive for those airlines to lift their game and to make sure that their maintenance is of an appropriate standard to ensure the interests of the residents of Sydney are protected. Since the Telegraph Mirror ran the article today, many Sydney residents are once again ringing up talkback radio and telling their stories about particular airlines and flights. I am pleased that, in the minister's response to my question on notice, which I received yesterday, he has indicated that he will inform the Sydney Airport Community Forum of these events when they occur. I encourage the minister to do that so the community can feel more comfortable that there are proper arrangements in place. Because of the additions that this bill puts into the objectives of Airservices Australia of promoting civil aviation, there will be some concern-firstly, about the expansion of the airport through new international terminals and, secondly, about the decision of the government to support the extension of the third runway, effectively promoting the operation of parallel runways in contravention to Sydney Airport Community Forum decisions. The minister has informed the forum, through its chair, the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey), that he has rejected the community's input on these issues. At last Friday's meeting of Sydney Airport Community Forum, the forum expressed dismay at the minister's actions and called upon the minister to come and explain his actions before the next meeting of the Sydney Airport Community Forum, so that we know whether the decisions we make are going to be supported or given credence by the government or whether we are simply engaged in a talkfest. The continued expansion of Sydney airport-the cost of that infrastructure should be going into a second Sydney airport-is causing much concern and consternation amongst residents around the airport, particularly given the concerns of the tourism industry and their campaign to get rid of the curfew at Sydney airport. In spite of the commitments given by this government a cap has still not been legislated for at Sydney airport. It is a pity that the government can get its act together to move legislation such as this in this House, but cannot give residents certainty by ensuring that there is a legislative restriction of 80 movements per hour at Sydney airport.",35
22,Mr RONALDSON,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"Ballarat-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development) (11.33 a.m.)-It is extraordinarily generous of the government to let the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) address those issues. We do not want to gag debate on these important issues, hence we gave him 17Y2 minutes to talk about everything except the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2). But we were relatively happy to do that. I thank the shadow minister and his staff for facilitating the reasonably smooth passage--certainly up until the last speaker-of this legislation. In relation to the question cost recovery, both the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) wrote to all airport bidders before they framed their final bids, advising them that the government would introduce amendments to the Airports Act for cost recovery of environmental inspections. So they were all acutely aware of that. I am not going to harp on the comments from the shadow minister about the minister consulting only with sectoral interests on this matter. I can ""assure the House and the Australian community that this minister has a very strong reputation for consulting widely with a great variety of groups and, in my view, that has led to the great respect with which he is held within the industry. His door is always open and, as a result of that, this government's policy in a wide range of areas, including the aviation industry, is an open and very proactive one. The shadow minister also made some comments about Qantas and Ansett and their movement into international markets. It is fair to say that this government's liberalisation policies are working and will continue to work. The share of the international market for Qantas and Ansett has gone from 38 to 42 per cent due to the government's liberalisation policies. I am sure the shadow minister would be aware that the government negotiates in the wider national interest, which includes tourism and trade. We certainly do not have any focus to protect or look after the narrow interests of anyone airline. There were some matters raised by the shadow minister in relation to AirservicesMr Albanese interjecting",36
23,Mr RONALDSON,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"I am coming to that. I should not have taken your interjection out of your seat, but I will come to your question. Mr Stephen Smith-You shouldn't have responded at all.",36
24,Mr RONALDSON,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"He raised an important point and the government is aware of it. I will be addressing that and he has been fully briefed by the minister. For the purpose of the of House, I will talk about it later on. The additional function to Airservices does not, in any way, change the need for it to have regard to other matters such as environmental impacts in performing its operations or the fundamental safety functions performed by CAS A and Airservices. I am sure the shadow minister is aware that, unlike in the United States, for example, Australia, several years ago separated safety, regulatory and services provider roles to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Airservices Australia respectively. Given that CASA is the safety regulator, it will have no role in Airservices promotion and fostering function, which I think is very important. It is not envisaged in any way that Airservices will face any conflict of interest issues in performing that role. There is a clear delineation. Safety issues are very much with CAS A. There will not, in any way, be a conflict of interest arising from the promotion role that this government wants to foster with Airservices. Airservices Australia is well placed to provide safe and reliable communication links needed by the industry to operate safely and efficiently, and Airservices will continually review its provision of services to ensure that it is meeting the industry's genuine needs by the most cost-effective means. I think the most important point is that Airservices will not be required to ensure the financial viability or otherwise of any individual operator, nor will it require that the aspirations of any particular aviation sector be met. I think that is extremely important. While I appreciate the shadow minister raising that matter of potential conflict, I can assure him that the government is extremely confident that that will not occur, and I believe that he can be equally confident. In relation to the fifth freedom question, what this legislation does, if you like, is put all the allocation role into the one body. The government was of the view that allocation for fifth freedom remaining with the department was not appropriate. We have therefore rolled that allocation role into the commission, which will have sole responsibility. At the end of the day that will leave the department to pursue capacity negotiation, which of course should be its primary role, as opposed to the capacity allocation, which will now be rolled into the commission and they will deal with all those allocation questions. We think it will be far more effective. We think it will be far more efficient. The airlines are in agreement. Honourable members will see that there is a grandfathering clause in there, and the government believes that is the appropriate way to address that. The government is also mindful of the need to ensure that the additional responsibility for allocating fifth freedom capacity does not impact on the effectiveness and timeliness of the commission's allocation processes. The minister and I can advise the House that the minister will be writing to the IASC chairman urging the commission to discuss with the airlines the best way of streamlining those current procedures. The government is keen to ensure that this occurs so that our airlines are not unnecessarily inconvenienced by future capacity allocation processes while in no way compromising the respected-and I repeat: respected--objective and transparent approach of the commission. As has been noted in the debate, the other amendments to aviation security, to Airservices Australia's functions and to the Airports Act and Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act are necessary changes to existing legislation to continue the implementation of the government's very successful aviation policy. It is a proactive aviation policy driven by a minister who is widely respected throughout the industry as having the knowledge and the drive to take these matters further. The honourable member for Grayndler does not seem at all interested in the question he asked me before while he madly chats away, but can I assure him and the House that the issue of fuel release from aircraft is of great concern to both me and the minister and is an issue on which the minister has directed his department to actively pursue more effective remedies. Specifically, the minister has asked his department to develop regulations that will make it an offence to vent fuel in other than any emergency or to operate an aircraft with faulty mechanical parts that may lead to fuel venting. Airservices Australia and, more recently, the department have taken up with Evergreen Airlines at the highest level the alleged incidents that occurred in July last year. Evergreen has advised the department that it takes occurrences of this nature very seriously and the company has taken steps to tighten its maintenance program and refuelling procedures. The minister has also raised the matter with Qantas, which was the charterer of the aircraft involved. In addition, the department has expressed its concerns to the US Federal Aviation Administration in view of the fact that the Evergreen aircraft are registered, as the honourable member knows, in the United States. It is the minister's understanding that the FAA is now undertaking its own investigation of the matter. Now that I have the honourable member's attention, I will again read that the minister has asked the department to develop regulations that will make it an offence to vent fuel in other than an emergency or to operate an aircraft that has faulty mechanical parts that may lead to fuel venting. I thank the member for raising that matter and I am sure he will be very grateful that the matter has been addressed. I am sure we can see a press release coming from him indicating that he is very pleased that the government has addressed these concerns. Just in summary, I thank those members who contributed and I again thank the shadow minister for facilitating the speedy passage of this legislation. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Ronaldson) read a third time. NA (EFFECT OF INTERNATIONAL INSTRUMENTS) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 18 June, on motion by Mr Williams: That the bill be now read a second time.",36
25,Mr MEL HAM,ADMINISTRA TIVE DECISIONS,"On 7 April 1995 the High Court handed down its decision in Teoh v. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. In short, in the Teoh decision the High Court held 4-1 that a procedural right exists based on the legitimate expectation that a decision maker would act in compliance with an international obligation, such as a convention or treaty, which had not otherwise been enacted into Australian domestic law. The effect of a procedural right is that a decision maker is required to give a person affected by a decision the right to be heard if the decision maker does not intend to comply with that international obligation. Accordingly, the decision maker, having given the affected party the reasonable opportunity to be heard, need not comply with the international obligation. It is important to note that the Teoh decision did not give a person whose decision is affected by an international obligation a substantive right to have that international obligation respected. In this sense, the Teoh decision did not import international law into the domestic sphere; rather, it treated the executive's action in entering into an international obligation no differently from every other statement of policy made domestically by the government of the day and applied the common law-the Australian law, doctrine of legitimate expectation-to that announcement of policy. In this regard, the decision by the High Court was not a radical departure from previous High Court authority. However, at the time it was brought down, the Teoh decision did give rise to considerable concern. Initial advice provided to the then Labor government was that this decision would have significant ramifications for the administrative law system, throwing into jeopardy a large range of government decisions. It may be interesting for members opposite to note who provided this advice-one Mr Henry Burmester, Chief General Counsel of the Commonwealth of Australia. On 10 May 1995, in response to those widely held fears, and acting in good faith on the advice which they had received, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator the Hon. Gareth Evans, and the then Attorney-General, the Hon. Michael Lavarch MP, responsibly issued a joint statement stating the government's view of the decision in the Teoh case. The statement purported to be an 'executive indication to the contrary'. It did this by stating the then Labor government's view that such international obligations did not give rise to a legitimate expectation at administrative law and thus, in future, no procedural right would exist. The use of a contrary 'executive indication to the contrary' as a means to defeat a legitimate expectation was specifically contemplated by a majority of the High Court in Teoh, per Mason CJ, Deane J and Toohey J. Advice from the Attorney-General's Department at the time was of the view that the joint statement had the intended effect but also expressed the view that the conclusion was not beyond doubt. Academic writings have since cast further doubt on the correctness of this opinion. As a result. the Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill-the bill-was introduced into the parliament. The bill was subject to scrutiny by a Senate committee. However, it lapsed at the conclusion of the last parliament. It is fair to say that much has changed since the Teoh decision was handed down and the then Labor government's initial reaction. A growing body of academic writing has criticised both the previous government's and this government's stand on the Teoh decision. That criticism is based on the view that the then Labor government overreacted to the High Court's decision and that the present government has continued that overreaction. In short, this critique argues, as I have stated before, that the application of the doctrine of legitimate expectation to international obligations is a natural extension of the long standing application of that doctrine to domestic policy statements. In doing so, it draws upon the view expressed by Chief Justice Mason and Deane J in Teoh that the entry into an international obligation is not 'a merely platitudinous or ineffectual act' but is 'a positive statement by the executive government of this country to the world and to the Australian people that the executive government and its agencies will act in accordance with the convention or treaty'. We also wish to reconsider our response to this legislation in light of the more than two years practical experience with the Teoh decision. It is fair to say that, contrary to the advice received by the then Labor government, there has been no plethora of Teoh type litigation. Indeed, litigation of that nature has been rare. Indeed, it was precisely the lack of this Teoh type litigation which caused the former Labor Attorney-General, the Hon. Michael Lavarch, to state in a speech last year that he believed the decision to enact this legislation should be reconsidered. Further, the present government has introduced its reforms to the treaty making process. In this regard, I note the view of the current Attorney-General (Mr Williams), who, on 21 September 1995, in debate on the 1995 bill, stated: The coalition proposals for the reform of the treaty making processes would in fact do away with the need for this bill altogether. The Attorney-General might like to explain why in 1995 he thought that this bill would be unnecessary if his proposals for treaty reform were accepted but now believes that this bill is still necessary. I will come to that later. Doesn'the believe that his reforms to the treaty making process provide sufficient scrutiny of Australia's international obligations? I would appreciate it if he would respond to these matters when he speaks at the conclusion of the speeches in the second reading debate. The coalition government has also issued its own executive statement, seemingly unconcerned by the body of academic opinion which has now questioned the effectiveness of those statements. Given the body of this advice and the real concerns that have been raised about the acceptability of advice that has come from Mr Burmester, the Australian Labor Party wants an opportunity to visit the underpinnings of this legislation again. Accordingly, the Labor Party will not be opposing this bill in the House today. Rather, when the bill moves to the Senate, we will be referring it to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for reconsideration and review. We will determine our approach to the bill at that time. We believe that it is important that we take a considered approach to this bill and that we not impinge on the common law rights of Australians unless it is necessary to do so. These are matters that we will be considering in the light of the Senate committee's review, which I have foreshadowed. That is the position, and it is happening in the Senate because the shadow Attorney-General is in the Senate and because the Senate has previously considered the original Teoh bill. I have a copy of that report, and I want to quote from aspects of that report, some evidence that was given to that committee. As you know, Madam Deputy Speaker, I am a great defender of the House of Representatives committees looking at legislation. I can indicate at this stage that the Labor Party will be taking a more robust approach to the referral of bills to House of Representabefore tives committees. The only reason that we are deferring in this instance to the Senate reconsidering it is that the Senate considered the original bill that was introduced by the former Labor government. So there is a secretariat there and a wealth of corporate history that will aIlow them to give a proper consideration of that biIl. It is also appropriate to see whether they differ from their earlier opinion. I want to now preface my comments by saying that these are my private comments that I am about to make because, as the Attorney-General weIl knows, within the forums of the Labor Party under the former Labor government, I took a view, and that view was not the view that was adopted by the party at that time. I found the High Court decision in Teoh was a modest decision. It was my view that it was an overblown reaction that the then government took. I believe that the passage of time has confirmed that the view I held was the correct view; it strengthened my view. As a parliament, we basically should have respected the Teoh decision and we did not necessarily have to go the way the former Labor government wanted to go and the current government wants to go. I repeat: they were my views at the time. They were well known. The current Attorney General knows that. It is not as though I am expressing a personal view now that is different from a view that I expressed back then. That was always my view because I gave it a considered look. This is what Chris Sidoti, the Human Rights Commissioner, submitted to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee as evidence on 14 September 1995 at page 332: The High Court simply said that decision makers should take treaty obligations into consideration in making a decision and, where they decide to act contrary to these obligations, then procedural fairness dictates that those affected should be given notice of this and allowed a chance to comment. The report goes on to say: The Government claims that the Teoh decision places an excessive burden on the decision makers of the Commonwealth, States and Territories to consider the impact of treaty obligations. In that regard, Mr Sidoti, again in evidence the committee on 14 September 1995 at page 333, had this to say: Given the small number and importance of these treaties in the human rights area, it would seem in no way onerous to expect decision makers to be aware of them. We are talking about not 920 treaties that an individual decision maker must take account of nor, in most cases, even 20 treaties, but rather a handful of treaties, and those treaties are among the most significant that Australia has entered into. In terms of the current Attorney-General, one can have some sympathy for him because, as Attorney-General, he is now bound by his cabinet's view. I raised the question earlier in what I was saying about the consistency of the current Attorney-General. He is in the role that I was in in the last parliament in terms of that, in effect, solidarity. What does a press report in the Sydney Morning Herald on Wednesday, 11 September 1996 state? It is worth quoting because it shows that the current Attorney-General has recognised that there is no need to implement anti-Teoh legislation and that, unfortunately, again, this Attorney-General was rolled by his cabinet and his party. This is what the press report says at page 8: The Federal Government has shelved plans to overrule legislatively a High Court decision last year which required officials to take account of Australia's international human rights obligations when making decisions affecting individual rights. The move comes despite strong Coalition support for a Labor bill introduced into Parliament last year to override the Teoh case, where the court held for the first time that treaty obligations could have legal effect, even without their enactment into domestic law. Under the ruling, a deportation order against a Malaysian drug trafficker was overturned because immigration officials had not considered the interests of his children. This had defied Australia's promise under the Convention on the Rights of the Child that children's interests would be paramount in decision-making. The case was hailed as the first to require the Government to put its international promises into practice in making decisions. It had previously been thought that treaty obligations meant nothing without a domestic law backing them up. This is the relevant part: Despite rabid opposition among elements of the Coalition to human rights treaties, the Attorney General, Mr Williams, a proponent of due process, told yesterday's joint party room meeting that he would not reintroduce Labor's bill, which lapsed when the election was called. Mr Williams told the party room there was evidence that the problem with Teoh was not as large as it had appeared at the time and that he would monitor legal developments. What has basically happened is that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has come in and the Attorney-General has been rolled. What is happening here is that this is running to the coalition's agenda to create a perceived threat. The Teoh decision is not a threat to domestic law. I think it is worthwhile to quote from the High Court decision. I think that puts it into legitimate perspective. It is about time members opposite started going to the actual judgments of the High Court and read them for themselves. What is happening is that we are getting a lot of claptrap, particularly in relation to the Wik decision, from a lot of people who have not even bothered to read the High Court's judgments. I am a great defender and admirer of the High Court. In recent times I think the High Court has exceeded itself and, in effect, has shown leadership within its proper role as part of the constitutional separation of powers and has not been browbeaten by the executive or the parliament in exercising its proper constitutional authority. I note that Justice Toohey has announced his retirement. I take the opportunity now to place on the record that, in my view, he has been an outstanding judge on the High Court. His period in judicial office stands him well. His judgment in the High Court case on Wik was exemplary; it was powerful; it was principled; and it was based on correct legal principles. He served the court and the nation well in his period of office. That is the sort of leadership which is sadly lacking and that should be shown by the politicians. But he acted within the proper constitutional role of a High Court judge. I wish him well in his future retirement. There are other judges of the court who are currently serving with distinction. But what has happened is that they have been the subject of a political attack, an ignorant attack, an attack that is undermining the very fabric of our society for political purposes in a range of cases by people who have not even had the decency of reading the judgments. I place more faith in the High Court and the institutions of this country than I do in the cabinet and the executive of this country. That is where I look to for protection. We should be defending them and talking them up, not undermining them. That is not to say that I agree with every decision or every judgment of the High Court, but they are well-reasoned, well-argued judgments. Its judges are people who are doing a genuine public service and who are there as the real protectors of the community. They have no base political motive. We should be applauding them. Instead, there are efforts to undermine them. I believe this government is going to be in for a rude shock because, irrespective of who they appoint to replace Chief Justice Brennan, or the other justices of the High Court who are retiring, I believe that any future appointments will grow in that office and will perform their proper constitutional role, which is not to be the toadies of the executive or the parliament but to consider cases on their merit-as the Teoh case was decided. This is what Chief Justice Mason and Justice Deane said in their joint judgment in relation to the status of the convention in Australian law: It is well established that the provisions of an international treaty to which Australia is a party do not form part of Australian law unless those provisions have been validly incorporated into our municipal law by statute. This principle has its foundation in the proposition that in our constitutional system the making and ratification of treaties fall within the province of the Executive in the exercise of its prerogative power whereas the making and the alteration of the law fall within the province of Parliament, not the Executive. So, a treaty which has not been incorporated into our municipal law cannot operate as a direct source of individual rights and obligations under that law. In this case, it is common ground that the provisions of the Convention have not been incorporated in this way. Further on it states: But the fact that the Convention has not been incorporated into Australian law does not mean that its ratification holds no significance for Australian law. Where a statute or subordinate legislation is ambiguous, the courts should favour that construction which accords with Australia's obligations under a treaty or international convention to which Australia is a party, at least in those the legislation is enacted after, or in contemplation of, entry into, or ratification of, the relevant international instrument. That is because Parliament, prima facie, intends to give effect to Australia's obligations under international law. Further down it says: Apart from influencing the construction of a statute or subordinate legislation, an international convention may play a part in the development by the courts of the common law. But the courts should act in this fashion with due circumspection when the Parliament itself has not seen fit to incorporate the provisions of a convention into our domestic law. Judicial development of the common law must not be seen as a backdoor means of importing an unincorporated convention into Australian law. A cautious approach to the development of the common law by reference to international conventions would be consistent with the approach which the courts have hitherto adopted to the development of the common law by reference to statutory policy and statutory materials. Further on in that judgment, when referring to the Full Court, it says: The Full Court's use of the Convention as a foundation for a legitimate expectation and the creation of an obligation to initiate inquiries and reports in conjunction with procedural fairness. Further on-this is the cIincher-uoting from the court: Junior counsel for the appellant contended that a convention ratified by Australia but not incorporated into our law could never give rise to a legitimate expectation. No persuasive reason was offered to support this far-reaching proposition. The fact that the provisions of the Convention do not form part of our law are a less than compelling reasonlegitimate expectations are not equated to rules or principles of law. Moreover, ratification by Australia of an international convention is not to be dismissed as a merely platitudinous or ineffectual act, particularly when the instrument evidences internationally accepted standards to be applied by courts and administrative authorities in dealing with basic human rights affecting the family and children. Rather, ratification of a convention is a positive statement by the executive government of this country to the world and to the Australian people that the executive government and its agencies will act in accordance with the Convention. That positive statement is an adequate foundation for a legitimate expectation, absent statutory or executive indications to the contrary, that administrative decision-makers will act in concases in which formity with the Convention. A proper reading of Teoh shows that we have nothing to fear in relation to Teoh. I repeat that these are my personal views. They are views that I have always held. I held them when we were in government and I hold them now. The situation is that there are differing views. I think the passage of time has confirmed my views. The passage of time has confirmed the submission that the Human Rights Commissioner, Chris Sidoti, made to the parliament. Basically, that is that the following principles are there. In the absence of implementing legislation, the provisions of international conventions do not form part of Australian municipal law. This statement is based on the constitutional principle of the separation of legislative and executive action. However, international conventions are a legitimate guide in the judicial development of common law. In relation to statutory construction where a statute is ambiguous, the court should favour a construction that accords with Australia's international treaty obligations, at least where the statute was enacted after the treaty had been ratified. These three propositions are not really the subject of disagreement by the government. However, they do indicate that the High Court was carefully reflecting the accepted legal position of international domestic law in their judgment and suggest that criticisms of the judgment can be tempered by a recognition of such circumspection. I repeat: it has been my view that the former Labor government and the current government do not need to enact this sort of legislation. It is a gross overreaction to what the High Court said. In summary, the High Court said that if the international treaty is there-the decision maker who is a professional person in a senior position should be aware of those treaties-Teoh basically says that if you are going to give a decision that is in contravention of the treaty, procedural fairness requires that you give the person the opportunity to make a subiIlission to you before you come down with an adverse decision. It does not bind you to conforming. It just says that procedural fairness requires you to give them an opportunity to make a submission to you before you give your decision. That is it in a nutshell. There has been nothing in the intervening years to the contrary. There has not been the mass loads of litigation to substantiate the need for this sort of legislation. We will have this bill reviewed by the Senate committee because it is appropriate that the Senate committee revisits it, having considered it in the first instance. In relation to that, it is something I do not think we can be criticised for. What we are arguing here is the basic principles. It is the government that appears to want to play politics.

26,Mr SLIPPER,ADMINISTRA TIVE DECISIONS,"I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate on the Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill 1997. I regret most sincerely that the opposition in the other place will seek to refer this matter to yet another committee, because this matter has been around for a number of years. This government's legislation will resolve the problems once and for all, despite some of the remarks made by the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham). I think it would help to just cast our mind back to the particular facts of the case. Mr Teoh is a particularly odious individual. He is a Malaysian citizen who has been convicted and sentenced to a gaol term in Western Australia for drug trafficking. We ought to look at the nature of the person who is the genesis of this particular bill. In 1988 Mr Teoh came here. A couple of months after he arrived, he married an Australian citizen who had four children, and subsequently Mr and Mrs Teoh had three more. He was convicted of being knowingly concerned in the importation of heroin, a very serious offence, and of three counts of being in possession of heroin. He was sentenced to six years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years and eight months-a very undesirable migrant for a country which has some one million people every year knocking at its door, seeking entry. In January 1991, Mr Teoh found out his application for permanent resident status had been refused. I compliment the then Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs for that decision. The reason that the minister made this decision was that Mr Teoh did not satisfy the requirement of good character. Mr Teoh went through the usual review process, and the Immigration Review Tribunal recommended that the delegate's decision to refuse permanent status be confirmed. On reaching that decision, the panel did not ignore the interests of the children and the decision reflected the actual circumstancesthat Mrs Teoh and the family would be in dire straits if the breadwinner were deported was taken into account. However, on balance, as the applicant had committed a very serious crime, a crime which most Australians would regard as abhorrent, the decision was that this person ought not be allowed to remain in Australia. Mr Teoh exercised his right to appeal to the Federal Court of Australia, and at first instance his claim was dismissed but subsequently on appeal he was successful. The High Court ultimately decided in favour of Mr Teoh and, in doing so, the High Court made certain decisions. It is interesting to note that over the last few years an extraordinary amount of the time of this parliament has been spent on sweeping up after decisions of the High Court. We had the Mabo decision, in which the High Court discovered native title had in fact survived when everyone else had thought that it had not. More recently we had the Wik decision, where the High Court found that native title in some cases could survive pastoral leases. And of course we had this decision in the Teoh case which also changed what we understood to be the law. This bill will resolve any lingering doubt about the effectiveness of the joint statement made in 1997 by the current Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and the current Attorney-General (Mr Williams). I might add that this statement followed an earlier statement made by their predecessors. The idea was that executive statements would be made and those executive statements would be backed up by legislation. There was a debate in the parliament two years ago but, regrettably, the bill introduced by the former government lapsed before it could be enacted. The High Court reaffirmed in the Teoh case the well-established principle that treaties to which Australia is a party do not form part of Australian law unless their provisions have been incorporated into our municipal law by statute. However, the court made a distinction between the incorporation .of a treaty into Australian law and the fact that a treaty may giv.e rise to a legitimate expectation as to the conduct of the decision maker. A legitimate expectation, the court said, is not to be equated to a rule or principle of law. Nevertheless, the effect of a legitimate expectation is that, if the relevant treaty provisions are not conformed with or submissions on them are not heard, an applicant will have a ground for review of the decision. Chief Justice Sir Anthony Mason and Mr Justice Deane said: . .. ratification of a convention is a positive statement by the executive government of this country to the world and to the Australian people that the executive government and its agencies will act in accordance with the Convention. That positive statement is an adequate foundation for a legitimate expectation, absent statutory or executive indications to the contrary, that administrative decision-makers will act in conformity with the Convention and treat the best interests of children as 'a primary consideration'. So the purpose of the executive statement by the former government, the purpose of the now lapsed Teoh bill of the former government, the purpose of the executive statement by this government and the purpose of this bill is to remove that legitimate expectation so that the law of Australia only as enacted by the parliaments of Australia will apply to people in the situation of Mr Teoh. So it ought to be recognised, therefore, that this bill simply restores the status quo which existed prior to the implementation of the Teoh decision. It simply says that, until such time as the parliaments of Australia choose to change the law of Australia to implement a treaty, that treaty will have no force and effect in this country. It is interesting to listen to the contribution made by the honourable member for Banks. We have noticed since the change of government, that the Labor Party seems to be developing a practice of saying one thing in government and yet doing another in opposition. The start of the Teoh legislation we are now debating is similar to legislation which was introduced to the parliament by the previous government. One only has to look at the Hansard reports to see that the former government was concerned about the impact of Teoh and that the former government was sufficiently concerned for the then Attorney-General, Mr Lavarch, and the then foreign minister, then Senator Gareth Evans, to make an executive statement followed by the introduction of the Teoh legislation. This government is also concerned. We have made an executive statement, and we have brought in this legislation. But there is a consistency in our actions that is absent in the actions of those opposite. This Teoh reversal on the part of the Labor Party is not the first time this has happened. Labor said in government that Australia needed to continue with the process of economic reform. Now they are reversing reforms. Labor said in government that tariff cuts would help boost exports. Now they are saying the opposite. Labor said in government that privatisation was consistent with job creation. Now they say it is not. Labor said in government that cutting the budget deficit would lower interest rates. Now they deny there is even a connection. Labor said in government that reducing the deficit would boost job growth. Now Labor tells us the opposite. Labor said in government that industrial relations reform was important to create jobs. Now they are voting against change. Labor argued in government for tax reform. Now they rule out even considering it. Labor argued in government that higher education should not be exempt from budget scrutiny. Now they argue the opposite. Labor said in government that the Commonwealth government should fight compensation claims of separated indigenous children. Now they are demanding the opposite. Labor said in government that pastoralists' land was secure. Now they are refusing to grant that security. The only thing certain about the Labor Party is that they do not know what they stand for any more. In relation to the Teoh bill, they supported it last time, they introduced it last time and they voted for it last time. Now, when we listen to the honourable member for Banks, we hear that it is very clear that, as in all of those other matters I have just outlined, the Labor Party have had a change of mind concerning the legislation currently before the House. I think the people of Australia do respect consistency. I think they reject opportunism. It is pretty obvious that this opposition are indulging in what I think the Treasurer refers to during every question time as cheapjack opportunism. What do they stand for? The people of Australia simply no longer know. I think that is very sad, because it does not make for healthy government when one has an opposition which simply does not stand for anything at the moment. I was also quite curious to listen to comments made by the honourable member for Banks in relation to the High Court. He had a very spirited and genuinely held defence of those justices on the High Court who some would describe at times as unelected and unaccountable politicians. He actually said that they were the real protectors of the community. I find that an incredible statement. Obviously the courts have a valued and vital role to play, and everyone on our side of the House would support a continuation of that valued and vital role. But, to be honest, for a member of parliament, for a frontbencher in the opposition, to actually say that the real protectors of the community are the courts is denying the key role of the parliament. He effectively said that the courts ought to stand up to the executive government and to the parliament. We are the representatives of the people. We are the people who go to the polls every three years putting forward our various policies. We seek a mandate from the Australian people to implement those policies. This government, of course, intends to implement its policies, unlike our predecessors, who sought to break their promises. But the fact of the matter is that it is parliament that represents the people, not the courts. I was also interested to read about criticism of the federal government's approach by Sydney University associate law professor, Margaret Allars. Professor Allars suggests that our legislative response to Teoh might not be as successful as the government believes it is. The majority of the High Court found that ratification of a convention is an adequate foundation for a legitimate expectation, in the absence of statutory or executive indications to the contrary, that administrative decision makers will act in accordance with the convention. It also stated: If a decision-maker proposes to make a decision inconsistent with a legitimate expectation, procedural fairness requires that the persons affected should be given notice and an adequate opportunity of presenting a case against the taking of such a course. Clause 5 of the bill is squarely directed towards setting aside a legitimate expectation arising out of treaties which the High Court found in the Teoh case. The High Court, in Teoh's case, looked at the issue of legitimate expectation and the resulting procedural fairness in relation to treaties on a technical basis. It is simply not correct to say that, by reason of a general right of procedural fairness attaching to administrative decision making, this will bring in procedural fairness in relation to treaty obligations which de not form part of Australian law. Mr Justice Toohey noted: It is one thing to say that natural justice demanded that the respondent be given every opportunity to present his case; certainly natural justice demanded that much . . . It is another thing to say that the respondent had a legitimate expectation that the decision-maker would act in accordance with the Convention. In short, the procedural fairness and the right to be heard in relation to the convention rose specifically from the act of becoming a party to the treaty. If that legitimate expectation is set aside, then there will be no automatic right to be heard on the treaty. As I have said before, the bill will restore the status quo which existed prior to the Teoh case. So this bill will remove what would elsewhere be a legitimate expectation and, consequently, will remedy the decision of the Teoh case. It is quite incorrect for Professor Allars or indeed anyone else to suggest that the government's legislative response will be somewhat inadequate. Prior to resuming my seat, I would like to make a couple of brief statements concerning utterances by the honourable member for Banks relating to cabinet solidarity. I happen to know the honourable member for Banks quite well. He was chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, of which I was a member in the previous parliament. He was a very good chairman and a person who holds his views very sincerely and honestly. I do not for a moment suggest that the personal views he expressed relating to the Teoh case, the views which he claims to have held ever since the Teoh decision, are not genuinely held views. I do question his approach to the issue of cabinet solidarity. There he was standing in the place normally occupied by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and speaking on behalf of the Labor Party. He even had half an hour to address the House at a time when the rest of us only get 20 minutes. So he was the official representative of the Labor Party in this debate. I found it absolutely incredible that he embarked on such a voyage of selfindulgence as not to put forward just the Labor Party's point of view. A very significant segment of what he had to say related to his personally held views. As I said, I concede that they are genuine views, I concede that he holds them honestly and sincerely, but there he was speaking apart from the position of the Labor Party. One would have thought that the shadow minister in charge of handling this bill on behalf of the Labor Party would get up, put his own personal views aside and tell the parliament what the Labor Party stood for, what their views were. In fact, he also referred to allegations that the Attorney-General had been rolled in the party room and the cabinet. He also suggested that the Attorney General, in introducing this bill, was not putting forward his own personal views and that the Attorney-General had been, shall we say, overrun by his colleagues. The simple fact of the matter is that in the business of government one gets ministers bringing forward submissions. Some of them are accepted; some are rejected. I have no idea what the personal views of the Attorney General are in relation to this matter but one thing I can say is that the Attorney-General has acted absolutely impeccably. The government has made a decision and as the chief law officer of the Commonwealth he has brought forward that decision in the parliament. He has put forward a very strong argument in favour of the course of action of the government. He has debated this issue not only in the parliament but in the Australian community most vigorously and most convincingly. One ought to look at and contrast the behaviour of the Attorney-General and that of the honourable member for Banks. On the one hand, the Attorney-General, whatever his personal views are, is completely following the Westminster convention of cabinet solidarity. On the other hand, the honourable member for Banks has come into the parliament and is in fact bringing forward his own point of view at a time when one would have thought that he was representing the views of the opposition. The bill before the House is an appropriate response to the Teoh decision. The Teoh decision was not one that our predecessors in government expected or one that we wanted. We have an obligation to restore the law to what it was and the bill currently before the chamber will do that. I urge the opposition in the Senate not to seek to frustrate this process. This bill in effect has been around for a number of years. This problem has been before the Australian community for a number of years and this is an appropriate legislative response. I strongly urge the opposition to support this bill brought forward by the government.",43
27,Mr MCCLELLAND,ADMINISTRA TIVE DECISIONS,"The opposition supports the second reading of the Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill 1997. In addressing, firstly, some comments by the previous speaker, the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), can I put in a plug for our female member of the High Court, the Hon. Justice Gaudron. I was privileged enough to be lectured by Mary Gaudron at university. She is, indeed, a very fine person and jurist.",47
28,Mr SLIPPER,ADMINISTRA TIVE DECISIONS,Were you a good student?,47
29,Mr MCCLELLAND,ADMINISTRA TIVE DECISIONS,"Whether I was a good student, I am not so sure. Not only is Justice Gaudron a woman but she is a member of the High Court. So the expression 'those gentlemen of the High Court' should, of course, include Justice Gaudron. The member for Fisher commenced with an analysis of Teoh' s case which is frequently done by those who argue against the significance or appropriateness of treaties. Certainly Mr Teoh, as an individual, seems quite a reprehensible sort of fellow, but when you read Teoh' s case the view expressed by the High Court was that, in deciding whether to deport someone, if he has a family here in Australia it is appropriate to take into account the effect that decision is going to have on the members of that family, in particular on the children. The High Court were virtually confirming a policy that, before you take action to the detriment of someone, particularly children, it is appropriate and fair, and in accordance with rules of procedural fairness and due process, that their interests be taken into consideration. In my view, the High Court could well have come to that conclusion without saying that there was necessarily a legitimate expectation created by relying on the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which at that stage had not been and indeed still has not been brought into legislation, at least in a detailed sense. The High Court could equally have said that, the way common law has developed, the principles of procedural fairness are such that before you take any action to the detriment of an individual, be they a child or an adult, it is appropriate that the interests of those persons be represented. That could have been done just as easily without any reference at all to the rights of the child convention. When you see what the court was doing in that case, it really was a limited and entirely appropriate thing to do. However, as the minister in his second reading speech noted, and indeed as the former Attorney-General and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Gareth Evans, noted, Teoh's case has been relied upon for a broader proposition. Indeed, there is a passage in the judgment which says that where the federal government enters into a treaty it creates a legitimate expectation in administrative law and in the executive government that agencies will act in accordance with the provisions of that tre,aty. The honourable member for Banks expressed a personal view. He is entitled to do so, of course, and given his legal experience it is one worth considering. My own view is that it is appropriate to clarify the issue which arose in Teoh's case because having that issue floating around is itself something which is relied upon by those who oppose the legitimacy of the treaty making process. That reality has been confirmed in a number of cases. In Dietrich's case, for instance, the High Court made the distinction, and it is important to bear the distinction in mind, that treaties are entered into pursuant to section 61 of the constitution as part of the executive function of government but the laws of the parliament are made pursuant to the placita in section 51 of the constitution. In terms of treaties, the external affairs power is found in section 51 (xxix). Bearing that distinction in mind, the High Court in Dietrich said: ... an executive act has no direct legal effectthat is, an executive act made under section 61 of the constitutionupon domestic law. The rights and obligations ... are not incorporated into Australian law unless and until specific legislation is passed implementing the provision. So there is no suggestion, even with Teoh's case, that the ratification of a treaty gives it legal effect. That has been confirmed more recently, for instance, by a September 1996 decision of the High Court in Victoria and Others v. Commonwealth and others. That is a particularly interesting case, where the High Court analysed the history of Australia's treaty making powers right from our position when we were a colony up until the more recent stages. But even there the High Court said that in exercising constitutional power under section 51 of the constitution the government did not have open slather. They said: It is for the legislature to choose the means by which it carries into or gives effect to the treaty, provided that the means chosen are reasonably capable of being considered appropriate and adapted to that end. In other words, the High Court is saying that simply because a treaty is entered into it does not give the legislature open slather. It has to be related to the subject matter of the treaty. I said earlier that even if Teoh's case had not gone so far as to say that the ratification of a treaty created a legitimate expectation, there are already sufficient indications that the mere existence of international treaties, even if they have not been ratified by Australia, is something that Australian courts can take, and indeed well before Teoh's case have taken, into consideration in the development of the common law. For instance, in Mabo (No.2) Justice Brennan said: The common law does not necessarily conform with international law, but international law is a legitimate and important influence on the development of the common law, especially when international law declares the existence of universal human rights. The honourable Elizabeth Evatt, the former C.hief Justi.ce. of the Family COl}rt, expressed VIews to SImIlar effect. She SaId: Quite apart from conventions that Australia ratifies, some parts of that international law can, as a matter of common law, apply in Australia without any further action on the part of anyone. She noted that the Parliament of Australia had the power to override that common law, as it does. The point I am making is that the mere existence of international law, even if we have not ratified or signed it, can be looked upon by our courts in the development of common law principles. That is, in my view, not inappropriate. The previous speaker, the member for Fisher, seemed to indicate some regret that parliament, as he said, is 'spending time sweeping up after the High Court'. He referred to Mabo, he referred to the Wik case and he referred to Teoh' s case. However, when the common law dies, when it fails to progress, when it fails to develop, when it fails to have regard to what is going on both domestically and internationally, then it is my strongly held view that our legal system, which itself is based on the rule of law, dies. I say that for this reason: while it is all very well to refer to the predominant role of parliament, it is not omnipotent, it is not alIpowerful. The reason I say that is that the parliamentary system we know, did not simply exist. It does not go back to the time of Adam and Eve. Its genesis started, I suppose, with the Magna Carta, or even some meetings before that. It really did not start to solidify until the 17th century bills of rights. They were treaties between the monarchy and the people, or at least the aristocracy or landholders. They were treaties essentially between the populace and the monarchy. In other words, the parliament that we are now sitting in is a creature itself of the common law. It did not just happen. There was no statute enacting the parliamentary system. If there were a statute enacting the parliamentary system, what was the authority for that statute? There was none. It evolved itself from the common law process. When someone says that the common law should die and that the High Court should stop developing and evolving it in terms of modem commercial practices, modem political issues and modem international issues, then we are in big trouble. It is very important to realise and cherish the role of the High Court in scrutinising, monitoring and discussing this living common law, which thankfully is still alive. Also the parliament is not, thankfully, omnipotent or all powerful. The parliament of course has to act in accordance with not only constitutional restraints but also the entire history of common law freedoms which have been specifically included in the United States constitution and which we have by virtue of those important treaties such as the magna carta, bills of rights and other treaties that have formed the fundamental freedoms that we cherish and which have been inherited by us from the Westminster system. The High Court's role is to ensure that the actions of this parliament are not only consistent with the constitution, but also consistent with those fundamental rights and freedoms that all our citizens have. By way of example, if the member for Fisher thought through his proposition and said that parliament was all powerful, does parliament have the power for instance to incarcerate all opposition members of parliament? Does parliament have the power to incarcerate a particular section of society? If he is right, it does. But he is not right, fortunately; it does not. Parliament only has the authority to legislate for the peace, order and good government of Australia. It is impossible to see how those acts could be consistent with that requirement. The High Court would be charged with the responsibility of declaring legislation to that effect unconstitutional and ultra vires. Those examples were not fanciful, because going back to the 1930s they were events that happened in Nazi Germany. A constitutional parliament was overtaken by the Nazis and they did precisely that. They incarcerated and indeed executed both opponents and significant sections of society. So it is dangerous in the extreme-and I would echo the words of the member for Banks-to blindly attack the members of the High Court for doing what their job is, that being very much the guardians of our system. The member for Banks was criticised by the member for Fisher for saying they are the real protectors. They are not that in the sense of being a police or military force, but they are certainly the guardians of our constitutional system. I would implore those on the other side to have some constraint when they refer to decisions of the High Court that they oppose. They are entitled to disagree with them. They are entitled, indeed, to argue a case in the High Court. But once a decision is made, they have their legislative power to fall back on and to enact laws according to what their particular political philosophy is, as long as it is made within those constitutional constraints. Perhaps I have digressed a little more from the topic than was my intention, because of the stimulation that I received from the member for Fisher, but my point is that the treaty making process is a vital process to Australia. I support this bill because it takes away one aspect of a sense of illegitimacy. I did a quick search-as far as I was able-to try and demonstrate the relevance of treaties. The member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) is the most well-known proponent of the view that there is some sort of new age, globalist plot to take over the rights of Australians. Far from that; treaties are contracts made between sovereign nations. The mere fact that Australia enters into a treaty is itself a declaration of our existence as a body politic and an independent sovereign nation. I have pulled out a great number of treaties dealing with reciprocal rights in respect of criminal matters for instance between ourselves and a great number of countries. I have pulled out a number of treaties dealing with restricting the trafficking of narcotic drugs. I have pulled out-as one would expect-a great number of treaties dealing with the defence of our nation and I have pulled out countless treaties dealing with trade. In summary, treaties are an essential part of our daily lives. Far from being a means by which these new age globalists are going to invade and detract from our standard of living is, and our sovereignty, .in fact treaties are our tools and our weapons in promoting and protecting Australia's interests in the international environment. They are very much part of our armoury. I must say that I still find it extremely frustrating that even members in this House are under the misconception that the ratification of a treaty creates domestic law or necessarily leads to the creation of domestic law. Some treaties which are for instance dealing with mutual respect could not possibly manifest themselves into domestic law. But even those treaties which contemplate domestic law cannot become part of domestic ject. law unless and until parliament exercises its power under section 51 of the comtitution. is a matter for the parliament of the day, having the democratic mandate of the people who elected them, to legislate consistently with those treaty obligations-and not in terms of a ruse-to enact laws. Those laws are then enforceable and apply. But there no ability invested in the High Court-or court or person-to compel this parliament writ of mandamus or any other means to enact laws to implement treaties. It does not moment. happen. So what concerns me is that, when very legitimate propositions are put forward in treaties-that have both a national and an international benefit-we stand back from them and say, 'Oh no, if we enter into them, they are going to become part of our law.' That is not the case. If there is a concern some future government will enact a particuBanks lar law, it is not relieved by the fact of entering into the treaty, because any future government could simply enact that treaty and tion. then enact the law. It is an issue for the particular government to confront at the time and to go to the people about their decision. When you take away this fear, the reality is that we have two choices. We have a choice of living in a world where there is anarchy in a world where the rule of law prevails. The rule of law prevails through international treaties, and this bill, in so far as it takes away an avenue of fear, I fully support.",47
30,Mr TAYLOR,ADMINISTRA TIVE DECISIONS,"As intention always, I thank the honourable member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) for his very balanced contribution to this debate. He has an intuitive legal mind, and I thank him for supporting this legislation. Regrettably, I have to contrast the member for Barton's contribution with that of the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), which was, in the main, very ideologically driven. Perhaps it is in factional differences that it contrasts with the contribution by the honourable member for Barton. That is something that only the Labor Party can deal with. Nevertheless, it highlights the fact that there are differences of opinion on this subThis bill will achieve four objectives. First It of all, it will reinforce the proper role of parliament in giving effect to treaties. That is something the previous government completely neglected in the 13 years it was in power. Secondly, the bill will resolve any lingering doubt as to the effectiveness of the joint is statement of 25 February this year, made by any both the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr by Downer) and the Attorney-General (Mr Williams). I will come back to that in a Thirdly, the bill will take account of the view of the states that they should retain their ability to enact legislation to set aside the Teoh decision in relation to state administrative decisions. Finally, it will eliminate an element of uncertainty introduced into administrative decision making by the Teoh decithat sion. Yet, on that point, the member for wants to have this legislation referred not to a committee of the Senate, injecting a further element of uncertainty into the equaInternational law is characterised by its consensual nature and is quite different from domestic legislation. The enforcement of international law is difficult and is frequently achieved by political mechanisms rather than or strictly legal mechanisms. Generally, rules of international law are identified by two factors. One is actual state practice, which is where states are consistently following a particular practice in their relations. The other is the of states to be bound by the practice. If there is a practice that is so commonly followed by states that, when following it, the states demonstrate they consider themselves bound by the practice, then it will become a rule of customary international law. In other words, customary law is the set of general principles that are so widely accepted and adhered to by the majority of states that they have become binding. Once a practice of a states gains this widespread crystallise into a rule of international a customary international norm. However, our external affairs power-referred to by previabsence ous speakers--can be used to implement only bona fide treaties which create obligations define the method of their implementation with sufficient specificity to support legislareferred-that tion. The first question we should ask ourselves is: what was the Teoh case and why is there a need for this bill? I am not going to go detail. That has been covered, particularly the honourable member for Fisher (Mr SlipEvans per). I will summarise by saying that Mr Teoh The came to Australia in 1988 on a temporary on entry permit. Convicted of importation of heroin and related charges, he failed to fulfil the good character requirements for permanent entry and was to have been deported. He number appealed against the deportation on the grounds that he was the father and stepfather of children who were Australian submitted that, because of their mother's drug addiction, they would suffer great hardship if he were deported. He was recognised as the raising only possible focus for a family unit for these children. This matter went to the full Federal Court, which found that Australian ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in December 1990 created a legitimate expectadoes tion that an action by the Commonwealth This would be conducted in accordance with convention, in spite of the fact that the vention had not been the subject of any domestic legislation. As the Chair of the Standing Committee on Treaties, I have to that we are reviewing that convention at the moment, and there are still a lot of question marks about what it means or is perceived mean and about its ratification and implemennew tation. The then Minister for Foreign Affairs, the then Senator Evans, appealed against this finding, and the High Court made it clear that, in general, implementing domestic legislation is required. The majority held that: The provisions of an international treaty to which Australia is a party do not form part of Australian law unless those provisions have been incorporated into municipal law by statute and cannot operate as direct source of individual rights and obligations acceptance, it will under that law. law or However, the High Court did not say that international treaties have no effect in the of domestic legislation. The act of ratification, they held, was sufficient foundaand tion for individuals to have a legitimate expectation-to which previous speakers have the government decision makers would act in conformity with the treaty. It is now history that the Keating government responded with a joint statement by the into then Attorney-General Michael Lavarch and by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs Senator on 10 May 1995, asserting, in part: High Court decision gives little if any guidance how decision-makers are to determine which of [approximately 920] Treaty provisions will be relevant and to what decisions the provisions might be relevant and because of the wide range and large of decisions potentially affected by the decision. a great deal of uncertainty has been introduced into governmental activity. citizens. He They went on to say: We state on behalf of the Government, that entering into an international treaty is not reason for any expectation that government decisionmakers will act in accordance with the treaty if the relevant provisions of that treaty have not been enacted into domestic Australian law. It is not legitimate, for the purpose of applying Australian law, to expect that the provisions of a treaty not incorporated by legislation should be applied by decision-makers. Any expectation that may arise not provide a ground for review of a decision. is so, both for existing treaties and for further the treaties that Australia may join. conAs previous speakers have indicated, on 28 June 1995 the previous Labor government Joint introduced the Administrative Decisions say (Effect of International Instruments) Bill 1995, designed to override the Teoh decision. It is therefore fair to say that this legislation, to in many ways, is not new. There is nothing to this legislation. It is also fair to say that in recent years a number of options have been canvassed to reform the treaty making and consultative mechanisms in Australia. These range from parliamentary approval prior to signature, making parliamentary approval a prerequisite for ratification, a treaties council of experts in intergovernmental relations and international law reporting to the parliament, the tabling of treaties prior to ratification, and amending the constitution to redefine the external affairs power. Of course political and administrative judgments have been made by this government on all of these and other options and they were reflected in statements in May last year. I will come back to those in a moment. Historically, this goes back a lot further than some people would understand. In 1961, Prime Minister Menzies announced that although his government had been at pains to ensure that parliament had been given the opportunity to discuss any treaty of major significance for Australia before Australia had become a party to it, he intended to take further measures to keep the parliament more informed about treaty matters. He committed the government to a general rule that it would lay on the tables of both houses the text of treaties signed for Australia, whether or not ratification was required, as well as texts of treaties to which the government was contemplating accession. Sadly, this general rule has gradually been eroded. There have been a number of attempts by individual senators in particular to reform the treaty making process. In May 1994, Tasmanian Independent Senator Brian Harradine moved a motion for the establishment of a Senate standing committee on treaties, which was to be appointed to consider all treaties laid before the Senate, and any other treaties to which the committee may have access and to report on each treaty. Regrettably, that motion was never debated. Also in 1994, South Australian Liberal senator Grant Chapman introduced the International Obligations (Senate Approval) Bill 1994. This aimed to ensure that a cooperative national approach to external affairs was adopted by the Commonwealth and the states acting through the Senate, the role of the Commonwealth in external affairs was defined, the exercise of the powers of the executive government of the Commonwealth in external affairs was subject to principles and mechanisms of accountability and transparency and, finally, to the greatest practicable extent, ensure that disputes did not occur between the Commonwealth and the states over external affairs. Regrettably again, this bill was never debated. In October 1994, then Senator Evans and then Attorney-General Lavarch announced that the government would 'take further steps to strengthen the flow of information to Parliament' on treaties. They stated inter alia: At the moment, treaties on which negotiations have concluded or to which Australia has adhered are tabled twice yearly in Parliament, together with explanatory memoranda provided to help Menbers and Senators become familiar with their content and effect ... The statement was significant because it was the first time that the Labor government acknowledged that it no longer complied with the so-called Menzies rule of 1961 and now tabled treaties after Australia had adhered to them, rather than before their ratification. Another attempt at reform was made by Australian Democrats senator Vicki Bourne. In June 1994, and again in May 1995, she introduced private members' bills 'to make the Government more accountable in its conduct of our international relations'. The Parliament Approval of Treaties Bill 1995 was an improved version of the 1994 bill that she introduced. It dealt with both multilateral and bilateral treaties. Its major provisions included a number of issues, which I really do not have time to go into other than to, once again regrettably, point out that the bill was never debated. Irrespective of the unsuccessful nature of these proposals, they demonstrated the crossparty consistency of concerns about treaty making and a common theme that problems could be resolved with greater parliamentary involvement in the processes. Similar concerns were expressed at the special premiers meeting in November of that year. On 30 October 1994, then federal opposition leader Alexander Downer announced the coalition's proposals to establish a treaties council as part of the Council of Australian Governments and a joint house treaties committee when in government. At about the same time, the Senate had collectively recognised also that there were some matters worth exploring in treaty making. On 8 December 1994, it asked its Legal and Constitutional References Committee to inquire into the power of the Commonwealth and the external affairs power. On 29 November 1995, its report Trick or Treaty was tabled. This dealt with a range of general concerns, including the impact of treaties on the Australian federal system, the sovereignty of the nation, the degree of consultation undertaken prior to signature and ratification of treaties and, finally, the respective roles of the parliament, the government and the executive in Australian treaty making processes. It also set out specific concerns of individuals, groups-including business-and, most importantly, the states and the territories in making 11 unanimous recommendations. In its tabling speech, the committee chairman, Senator Chris Ellison, referred in particular to the external affairs power in the constitution. He also drew attention to the High Court's 1995 Teoh decision, the subject of the bill before us, which demonstrated the increasing importance of the impact of treaties on Australian law. He pointed out that the wide interpretation of the external affairs power to deal with matters not external to Australia may threaten the existence of the federation. The government, in tabling its response in both houses on 2 May last year, considered that the report provided 'a sound basis for the reform of aspects of the treaty making process as it affects Australia'. It announced an intention that treaty making 'should be accepted as playing a legitimate part in the development of Australia's place in the economic, political and social framework which is evolving in the modern post Cold War world'. It agreed to a number of initiatives. Again, I do not have time to go into them. At the same time, the now Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, tabled a statement in which he pointed out that the reforms were long overdue and were intended to implement the policy commitments made by him earlier and during the election campaign in 1996. The main features of these reforms were, firstly, the provision of proper and effective procedures for parliamentary scrutiny and setting up of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties; secondly, the overcoming of the democratic deficit in the way treaty making had been carried out; and, thirdly, effective involvement of the states and territories in the process through the establishment of a treaties council, and the opportunity for Australian individuals and groups with a concern about treaties to make that concern known. Consultation and accountability were to be the key words for the future. The government would not ratify a treaty unless it could be assured that the action proposed was supported by national interest considerations. An efficient, domestic methodology was therefore needed to assess the way proposed treaties met national concerns. Parliament needed to be in a position to examine the considerations weighed by government in determining the need for binding treaty action. I take the opportunity to thank now Attorney-General Daryl Williams for the role that he played in that and also the Minister for Foreign Affairs who, in his very first statement in this place, made those announcements of well overdue reforms. I just remind the member for Banks, when he talked about an about-face on the part of the opposition on this whole issue, what the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) said in September 1995: My lack of enthusiasm for Teoh is not especially a function of my lack of appreciation of how it has narrowed the gap between international and domestic law: rather it is a function of my belief that Teoh creates a decision-making environment that is unworkable in practice, and that it goes further than the court was compelled to go by any legal principle, or should have gone, in upsetting the present balance between Executive, Legislature and judiciary. The pre-Teoh balance was a delicate one, to be sure, but nonetheless one perfectly attractive in theory and workable in practice. For the opposition now to be arguing thatonce again they want to go around the buoy, in naval parlance-in the other place, I think really smacks of an opposition that does not quite know how to deal with something that it had clearly decided on in government. Ann Twomey, one of the researchers in the Parliamentary Research Service, said: While the Teoh case has added to the Australian jurisprudence on the relationship between international law and domestic law, it has not provided clear guidance on how this relationship will develop in the future. Questions will abound as to the extent to which unincorporated treaties can affect the domestic law of Australia ... She continued: The case is indicative of the uneasy relationship between globalisation and national sovereignty and the competing pressures these place on the development of law with Australia. This piece of legislation goes some way towards overcoming uncertainty. I commend the legislation to the House.",50
31,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,ADMINISTRA TIVE DECISIONS,"I hope not to detain the House too long on this matter. The source of this matter is of course the 1990 case, Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v. Teoh. The case dealt with the conviction for six heroin offences of Mr Ah Hin Teoh and the argument that a bureaucrat should have taken into consideration the possible plight of his children due to their mother, who would remain in Australia, having a drug addiction problem. The argument by the court was that, by signing the treaty, the government had made a positive action; thereby, it was an understandable expectation by Mr Teoh-and I guess anyone else in his situation-that, in the absence of statutory or executory indications, the decision makers would give him some right to argue the impact of that convention or treaty upon himself. I want to speak more about this case than the specifics of the legislation. The case drove home very strongly a concern in the electorate that this country-along with only, from recollection, the United Kingdom out of the 17 industrialised countries that were surveyed at that time-did not have any kind of reasonable mechanism for the parliament, the legislators or the people elected in the country to essentially review the treaties that were being entered into by the executive. Indisputably, our side of politics believes there is a need for strong Australian involvement-whether it is in regards to global warming, arms reductions, landmines, nuclear weapons, et cetera. Obviously, very pertinent at the moment is the question of environmental damage. There is no dispute that Australia should be in the forefront of involvement to try to take remedial action on these matters. But this case, and CROC of course, drove into the electorate's mind a concern that the people they were electing really did not have much say in the process. There had been a massive expansion of these treaties over a period of time and, if cases like Teoh were to be very persuasive, they would essentially lead to a situation where there could theoretically be legislation by proxy through these international agreements. In the aftermath of that, there were a few worthwhile editorials about the problem. The Age of 12 May 1995 stated: ... in the Teoh judgment, the High Court has effectively instructed the Commonwealth to be aware of the contents of the 920 international treaties to which Australia is a signatory, and to make decisions in accordance with them. While only a few of the conventions to which Australia is signatory have the potential for such an impact on Australian administrative practice, this case makes it clear that far more parliamentary and public scrutiny is necessary before Australia is committed to any international obligations. Furthermore, on 25 September 1995 the Australian noted: But consider what bureaucrats would first have to do-decide which treaties might apply, what their provisions might mean, and whether they should be taken into account. This new and unpredictable administrative burden would have to be carried in many areas of government, and under increased risk of court challenge. The wisdom of the Teoh judgment is open to doubt; Parliament should overturn it. But the Government cannot emerge from the Teoh controversy unscathed. It went on to cover the previous lack of parliamentary oversight in regards to treaties. As was noted by other speakers, on 10 May 1995 the foreign minister and the Attorney General of the day issued a statement on behalf of the government that said: . "" entering into an international treaty is not reason for raising any legitimate expectation that government decision-makers will act in accordance with the treaty if the relevant provisions of that treaty have not been enacted into domestic Australian law. It is not legitimate, for the purpose of applying Australian law, to expect that the provisions of a treaty not incorporated by legislation should be applied by decision-makers. Any expectation that may arise does not provide a ground of review of a decision. This is so, both for existing treaties and for future treaties that Australia may join. They noted: ... the Government intends to legislate to reinforce this statement and put beyond doubt the status of these unlegislated international obligations. We will be seeking approval for the necessary legislation to be introduced into ment later in these sittings. As was just noted, there was an indication from the then government that measures had to be taken to tackle the problem that had emerged. The Australian of 22 Septemberinstances speaking of the member for Denison, justice minister, Mr Kerr, said: Mr Kerr said the Teoh judgment ""provides means of usurping this legitimate role of Parliament"". This was an ""untenable situation"", he the House of Representatives. Similarly, an article on 11 September in the Australian said that the then foreign minister, the current member for Holt, Mr Gareth Evans, noted that the Teoh judgment was 'just a plain bad decision.' He was quoted as saying: The decision pays absolutely no regard to business of government, to the realities of administrative decision-making. From the beginning, it was clear from a number of government spokesmen that this decision had certainly undermined the undertralian standing held by naive non-lawyers like ourselves, so what we thought was the case until that point was not the case. Since then, there have been announcements by the current government in regards to an extension of parliamentary review of these treaties. I am pleased to have been a part that process with some of the earlier speakers. Whilst there have been a few problems at the fringes in regards to the tardiness of the government in its responses to some commitment tee statements, in general I would have to say that this has been a very worthwhile process. To a large degree, the government and its departments are on notice of the parliament's interest in what Australia enters into. However, one point that should be made is that many of those who have essentially been the major advocates of this change have argued from a point of view of concern about the legitimate rights of the states and territories. One of the more disturbing parts of the process to my mind up to now has been a lack of interest by these very institutions in any regards to the operations of the committee. One instance is desertification. From recollecParliation, the New South Wales government alone-and there are probably other states with an even deeper interest in the matterwas the one state that made an application. I am not just saying that because it is a Labor state. Quite frankly, there have been other where non-Labor states have been the then the only ones to respond. I think we have to be realistic about this. If a the states, the premiers and the ministers of told the various states start carrying on about how this process is basically undermining their rights to legislate and undermining the constitution, they have to play a very studied role in regards to the processes of this committee and the need to be a part of it. I have to say in supporting this legislation that, as a lay person, I think it does interrelate with a growing concern by many people in the this country and by the legislators elected here that, on occasion, an activist judiciarypeople who might know little about life for practical purposes, quite frankly, and might have minimal contact with the broader Auselectorate and its views-might seek to impose their attitudes in a variety of measures under the guise of basically enforcing international conventions. This is a concern, and I guess it is an underlying aspect of this legislation as well-there has to be a protection for the democratic processes of the of country. It cannot just be left to people who feel that is the outcome of treaties. So we have a situation where, on the one hand, a small group of people in the governand a small group of people in the bureaucracy are essentially deciding that this country should be part of this process internationally. Then we have another group of people-people who are unelected; unreviewed by parliament; not queried in regards to their bona fides to be in the judiciary, as is the case in the United States; and secure for life essentially-deciding that their particular slant on a matter could possibly determine the laws of this country. There is a legitimate concern out there. The other thing we have to be very careful of-and I am sorry to detect that I think this is where the current government is at-is that, if there is a political party that fears this of process and feels that the judiciary is taking a number of positions hostile to their ideology, hostile to their political stance and hostile towards their attitudes towards life, then they would have an increased reluctance to involve themselves in these international treaties. I think this is another part of the process. Unless the public and the parliamentary representatives feel that, when they enter a treaty, it is what the parliament of this country thinks is being negotiated-rather than what some elite, separate, unelected group of people thinks is going to happenthere is going to be an increased questioning of whether we should enter these treaties. That is the other thing that concerns me. Unless there is strong parliamentary review and unless there is a requirement that parliament essentially has, and is understood to have, a role in the way in which these laws are interpreted and the way in which they operate, then the downside which we will have is increased concern, increased suspicion and increased reluctance to enter treaties. As a person who feels strongly about many of these issues we have talked about-trade, disarmament, human rights and environmental matters-this is a thing that has to be guarded against. I wanted to make those points generally, rather than to go into the specifics of the legislation which, obviously, we are supporting.",54
32,Mr TUCKEY,ADMINISTRA TIVE DECISIONS,"O'Connor) (1.24 p.m.}-On 9 June 1994 I posed the following question to the then Speaker, and it is to be found on page 1,854 of Hansard. I asked: Mr Speaker, I wish to ask you a question about the role of parliament with regard to the signing and effect of international conventions and/or treaties. Is it a fact that this parliament has no power to prevent the signing of such conventions? Is it also a fact, as stated by a previous Attorney-General in this House, that no such convention has legal effect in Australia until enabling legislation has passed this parliament? If so, are you aware of a recent judgment in an Australian court which has quoted the international rights of the child convention as a reason for disallowing a government deportation order on a convicted drug importer because the deportation would disadvantage the dealer's Australian children? What legislation has passed this House to justify the judge's decision? kind The then Attorney-General, Mr Lavarch, interjected: It should be a question to me, not to Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker responded: Obviously there is an amount of detail in that question on which I will seek advice. I will probably discuss the issue with the Attorney-General over dinner this evening. I think he might have. Might I add that the Attorney-General further interjected-and this is not recorded in Hansard-to the effect, 'We are appealing,' to which I responded, 'When you do, what arguments will you make this time?' Whatever those arguments were, they failed. The High Court consequently upheld the decision of the lower court. The Australian constitutional power vesting the treaty process in the Crown was put together by the founding fathers at the tum of the century based on what their perception of external affairs meant in those days. I submit that it probably dealt almost exclusively with trade and defence. They vested the power of making those treaties in the Crown, not in the parliament, simply because they felt that things like defence treaties were things that could not have a long exposure in the parliament if the enemy were kicking your door in. These were the realities. The Australian parliament managed to live with this arrangement for probably 60 or 70 years, as treaties were perceived as being between Australia and other nations on matters of concern to each. The sudden emergence of UN type conventions and the subsequent treaties were never considered by the founding fathers. The system they devised could no longer respond to the level of public interest that arose particularly in terms of social issues, such as the rights of the child and racial discrimination and some of the more current ones-such as desertification and global warming. In response to this concern arising in the general public as we entered into this phase of dealing not with individual nations but with a conglomeration of nations called the United Nations, and the concern arising in the community as to what some of these treaties might mean or what they might cause, successive governments and attorneys-general of both political parties hid behind the argument that the process of signing and/or ratifying a treaty had no domestic effect until the parliament of the day chose to legislate to give that domestic effect. This particular argument allowed successive ministers of government-again, from both political sides-to travel the world, getting a warm inner glow from signing such treaties with great fanfare, believing that the particular act had no relevance at home. A somewhat contemporary example was a past environment minister, Ros Kelly. I can still see the images of that-they are burned into my memory-of her sitting up there at the table, signing the global warming convention with the flash lights going offpop, pop, pop, pop-with the beautiful backdrop of where she was in Brazil. That convention is now causing considerable pain and problems for us for the simple reason that those other nations that participated in that convention and signed that same document now require us to honour the contract, notwithstanding that it will require us to greatly lower our economic output. It also seems to be in total conflict with my visual observations when I travel to the Northern Hemisphere from time to time, where some of the environments are so polluted that I can barely see across the distance of this room; yet here I can walk outside these doors and see as far as my eyes will allow me. There seems to be a difference. But, of course, Brazil was a great deal of fun. Might I add an interesting point because there is now some criticism of Prime Minister Howard for not being at the current convention. With hindsight, it probably would have been a good idea if the Prime Minister of the day had been there instead of Ros Kelly. He just might have read the fine print. When Mrs Kelly signed this convention and when other people have signed these documents, it was on the understanding that it does not really matter because we do not really have an obligation until we legislate in our own country. But about 30 years ago, a variety of individuals with various and secondary agendas decided to focus their attention on the principle that signing or ratifying an international treaty had no effect in Australia until we bothered to legislate. Section 51 of the Australian constitution chose to define the powers of this parliament, and these powers included the power to make treaties, which was called the external affairs power. These powers under section 51 were ceded to the Commonwealth by the then existing sovereign states, and it was always considered that all other powers-in other words, those not listed in section 51----<:ontinued to reside with state governments. Commencing with the conservation lobby, arguments arose-and they are pretty logical-that, once the federal government had entered a treaty on, say, heritage values or conservation, it did have an obligation to legislate and, more importantly, it also then had the constitutional right by way of the external affairs power to legislate in areas previously considered the sovereign power of state governments. The first to succumb to these arguments was the Hawke government, in response to the Franklin Dam issue. The result was that the Commonwealth government found itself overriding a public works project in Tasmania. Mr Tanner-A good thing too.",56
33,Mr TUCKEY,ADMINISTRA TIVE DECISIONS,"He says a good one, yes. But that is not what we are arguing today because we are now saying it is a bad onenot the particular issue but the process. Naturally, the states contested this action in the High Court, which confirmed the power of the federal parliament to act in this fashion. There followed then a literal rash of federal legislation as the federal bureaucracy discovered this new-found power, which was almost unlimited; there followed a literal rash of federal legislation which was clearly unconstitutional if it were not for this device. One of the more classic examples was in the industrial relations area where, without much difficulty, you can get a body called the International Labour Organisation-which is apparently considered in international circles to have some status almost as a nation-to write a convention on anything. You might be the sole signatory around the world but arguably now-in fact, not arguably but by decision of the High Court-you can use the signing of that convention to impose a law on all Australians and it has constitutional certainty. It appeared that the federal powers were unlimited, provided a government could find a nation or a national institution prepared to enter a treaty to justify the But then, as history so often proves when people or governments choose to use devices to subvert proper practice, their actions tum around and bite them. Mr Teoh used the government's very own arguments in the High Court to defeat them in that same court. Basically, the argument used, going right back to the Franklin Dam, was: we have gone out and made a promise to the world and we have an obligation to legislate to put that promise into effect. Mr Tanner-That wasn't the argument.",57
34,Mr TUCKEY,ADMINISTRA TIVE DECISIONS,"That is what it was in the simplest of terms. The reality was that this same government that put those arguments went to the High Court and tried to put up a separate argument that said, 'Hang on a minute, we know we said all that, but the realities are that we are now in the position that somebody else has used that argument to prevent us taking what would appear to be a very proper action under the laws of Australia and we want you, the High Court, to reconsider all that. We want you to put that aside and listen to us again.' The High Court, of course, declined. As I said, I put that proposition to Mr Lavarch right back in 1994. That little bit of history brings us to the legislation we are dealing with today, which is the Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill 1997. I have to say that, notwithstanding that I will support this legislation in line with my party's decision, I find it highly hypocritical. It is highly hypocritical because what we are really saying to Australians is: 'Don't you trust us. Don't you trust our ministers. Don't you dare believe that the mere promise of a minister made in Brazil, Geneva or somewhere else should be believed. We know they had great fun over there and rubbed shoulders with the high and mighty and came away with a warm inner glow, but you should not take that as evidence that we are going to do anything about it. And just to make sure that you do not, we are going to pass a law to that effect.' That is what we are doing today. But there is a simpler solution, and that simple solution is not to sign the treaty in the first place if you have no intention of doing everything that new legislation. that treaty provides. I campaigned on this issue well before 1994 and I raised that matter with Mr Speaker because I had started to wonder what we were here for. As we have now discovered through the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, a huge amount of these treaties were never considered seriously by anybody in government. They were not even signed off by cabinet. The Crown is not cabinet; the Crown is not this parliament; the Crown is the Executive Council. It is pretty clear that, when the Governor General of the day, the Prime Minister of the day and a couple of his political colleagues sat down at the Executive Council to put the final authorisation on certain legislation, a series of public servants would say, 'While you are here, gentlemen, will you sign off on these treaties?' These treaties had been negotiated by public servants and, with the exception of some of the more controversial ones like the Convention on the Rights of the Child, there had been very limited consideration of them by government or by parliament at all. This government, by taking the decision will put the treaties committee in place, has reversed that entire proposition. What is more, that is starting to have an effect not only on the treaties which we thought were of concern, such as the desertification treaty and others yet to be ratified, but also on other minor matters where some bureaucratic decisions are not really in Australia's interest. The other day, when the committee was looking at a double taxation agreement with Vietnam, we discovered on the evidence of the chartered accountants that all of a sudden that basically standard treaty, which applies with many other countries, had had a fundamental change because it now excluded certain rights applicable to the financial sector. We asked why, and the bureaucratic answer was, 'There has been a bit of tax avoidance associated with the special tax arrangements within the financial sector, so we knocked them out.' I said, 'In other words, in this case if Vietnam were to offer a tax-free status to a leading bank in Australia to encourage them to go there and commence business-and of course that could result in profits to Australian enterprise over time-we exclude them because there have been some cheats; when, in fact, the proper response was to let them go and make sure that Australian law prevented that cheating.' So there is an example of where, hopefully, the bureaucracy has gone away to make sure that Australian business is fully exposed to the opportunities of these particular countries and that we have law that discourages or prevents the process of cheating. Furthermore, in the early evidence given to this committee, a passing remark that is burnt on my memory related to how the Thai government dealt with a particular international treaty that was before them. Their response to this particular treaty was to tell the other nations, 'I am sorry, we are not signing. We are quite prepared, nevertheless, to follow the rules laid down in this convention; we are quite prepared to bring our laws to that status; but we are not promising the rest of the world how we will behave by way of this contract.' Why not? For instance, when it comes to the rights of the child convention, can anyone tell me why-by way of a scale of one to 500 or however many nations there are in the world-Australia had to promise the rest of the world that we would look after our kids? There are times when we are possibly not perfect but, by comparison with many nations where infant labour is still practised in a substantial way, one would wonder why Australia needed to be a signatory, why Australia had to promise the rest of the world and why Australia now has to bring down a piece of legislation to prevent people using our promise in what seems to be a practical way. The great irony of Mr Teoh is that he was a drug importer, and one might wonder how many other kids were going to suffer from his actions. Mr Tanner-I will tell you a bit about the case in a minute, Wilson.",58
35,Mr TUCKEY,ADMINISTRA TIVE DECISIONS,"When I want legal advice, I would pay someone a lot better than you, but the reality is that you can stand up here and tell us.",59
36,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADMINISTRA TIVE DECISIONS,Hon. G.H. Adams}-Order!,59
37,Mr TUCKEY,ADMINISTRA TIVE DECISIONS,"I deal with these things in a practical sense, Mr Deputy Speaker. The realities are that Teoh stood up and said, 'The rights of the child convention protects me, you can't deport me'-and we did not. But his offence was to bring drugs into the country that could have destroyed the lives of many other children. Mr Tanner-Do you know whom he brought them in for?",59
38,Mr TUCKEY,ADMINISTRA TIVE DECISIONS,"I think you might be going to tell me that he brought them in for his wife. Whether that was his story and whether that was a fact, I do not know, but the fact is he was a drug importer. You see, I followed the case. The realities are that we are making promises to the world but we are now passing a piece of legislation to say, 'Please do not believe we really meant it if we choose not to do any more about it.' That is a very funny arrangement when, in fact, the alternative is not to sign in the first place because I do not think we need to. Considering our clean air, as anybody can see, I do not think we need to go and sign off as one of the lead signatories in Brazil on global warming when we can go to the Northern Hemisphere and see the emissions there. One of my great disappointments many years ago was to go to the Mediterranean in the hope of seeing some blue sky and sparkling seas, and I saw neither. These are the countries that are now going to dictate to us as to how much emissions might come out of this country. I am not sure that the formula properly provides for the great areas of Australia and also for the great surrounding mass of sea. Maybe in an international sense we are exactly the right place for some additional emissions compared with the highly concentrated areas. I am still trying to learn whether all these emissions on a per capita basis because, if that is so, a country like China has the right over about 1V2 times the land mass of Australia to emit 60 or 70 times the amount of emissions. I am not saying that is the case but, in reading the media, I find it rather confusing to know how these things are measured. There are so many factors. It is far too simplistic to say, 'You draw a line in 1994 or thereabouts and then go backwards by 15 per cent.' I find it ridiculous. I close on this point: we do not have to sign treaties and we are generally a highly democratic country. (Time expired)",59
39,Mr TANNER,ADMINISTRA TIVE DECISIONS,"Melbourne) (1.44 p.m.)This legislation has its origins in views that became particularly prominent within coalition ranks in the early 1990s. Largely in response to some of the issues that the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) has raised in his contribution, I wish to comment on the origins of this position and also on some of the statements that the honourable member for O'Connor has made during the course of that contribution. The real origin of the coalition's views on these issues is in, essentially, the paranoid obsession of the lunar right with things like the one world government, the conspiracies of the Fabian Society, the black helicopters of the United Nations, the new world order and those sorts of things, which are particularly virulent in the United States but which also have a significant reflection here and appear to have had some influence on the thinking of the coalition, particularly in certain parts of the country. It is unfortunate that these views have actually reached a level of influence that has ultimately impacted on legislation being brought into this House. I would just like to make some observations with respect to some of the issues that are being dealt with, including the matters that were raised by the honourable member for O'Connor. He focused early in his contribution on the Franklin Dam case. In 1983 a decision was made by the High Court to allow the national heritage act-I think that is the title of the legislation-based on section 51 (xxix) of the constitution, the external affairs power. What he failed to mention was that the critical feature of this decision reaffirmed an earlier decision of the High Court which was probably equally significant-the Koowarta decision-which determined that the Racial Discrimination Act was constitutionally valid on similar grounds. So, although the Franklin Dam case was indeed a landmark decision, the member for O'Connor neglected to mention that there was an earlier decision which was of equal significance in this development of the external affairs power. He is also somewhat off the mark in his contribution with respect to the Teoh case and the implications that that case has had for the law in Australia and also for the powers of this parliament-the role of the parliament relative to government, the executive and its relationship with international institutions. In fact, in the Teoh case-and I will get to the facts of the case in a minute to just illustrate how off beam the honourable member for O'Connor was in terms of the scary attributes that he was floating-the legal position was that a very common principle of British common law was applied by the High Court, and that relates to obligations that apply to decision makers in administrative circumstances with respect to matters that they are required to take into consideration. What the High Court found was that the decision makers in the Teoh case in the immigration department had failed to take into consideration Australia's signing of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child-they had failed to examine those issues. So the impact of the convention was not, as the honourable member for O'Connor suggested, to override Australian law or, indeed, to impose any direct obligation on Australian decision makers. All that the High Court found was that the decision makers had erred by failing to give consideration. In other words, it was still open to the decision makers, in Mr Teoh's case, to decide to deport him validly, having considered the implications of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and then deciding ultimately that those factors were not sufficient to outweigh the other factors in the case which led them to a decision to deport Mr Teoh. It is worth noting the circumstances of this case. I think, from memory, there were a considerable number of children of Mr Teoh and his wife involved. It may have even been seven, but it was certainly a considerable number of children. My understanding of the facts is that Mr Teoh was found guilty of importing heroin, but that this was solely for the purposes of supplying the addiction of his wife. In a sense, the decision makers had a real paradox-a real conundrum-to deal with here because they had a situation where one of the children's parents was obviously in some difficulties because of heroin addiction. What was being proposed was that the other parent, who had been convicted of supplying her addiction-of importing drugs in order to supply that addiction-should be deported. Clearly, there were obvious considerations on both sides of this argument. The obviously substantial negative impact on the future of the various children involved of having one parent in considerable difficulties as a result of heroin addiction and the other parent deported as a result of criminal convictions associated with supplying that addiction clearly weighed heavily in the minds of the decision makers. But, on the other hand, the principle of deporting people convicted of serious crimes was also a significant factor. We did not simply have a straight cowboys and indians, good guys sort of configuration, as many in the coalition have sought to make out since the Teoh case was determined by the High Court. In fact, it was quite a complex situation where, ultimately, the question of the future of the children weighed very heavily in the overall decision. Mr Tony Smith-The mother was in gaol.",60
40,Mr TANNER,ADMINISTRA TIVE DECISIONS,"I thank the honourable member for Dickson for pointing that out. I was not aware of what the outcome was with respect to her proceedings. That made the situation even more difficult and complex. Whatever view we take on the question of the external affairs power and international conventions, it is important that we understand the facts of this case and how difficult they were to deal with for any decision makers in government. Clearly, there were competing imperatives there. People were concerned to look after the children but, at the same time, to see that crimes were appropriately punished and that wrongdoers who were not Australian citizens but who had committed serious crimes were deported. When you look at the law associated with the Teoh case, the facts of the case and the scaremongering that eventuated as a result of that-and I had a bit of an exchange of letters in the Age with the Deputy Leader of the National Party on the issue-the whole issue was inflated out of all proportion by the coalition and, in my view, given fuel by some of the paranoid conspiracy theories of the lunar right, who have a degree of influence in Australian politics that, frankly, I find quite frightening. The general issue which the honourable member for O'Connor did allude to was the question of how Australian governments should handle international conventions. I would agree with him that, if a government is not serious about a commitment to an international convention, it should not sign it. Whether we have live examples of previous governments signing conventions that they were absolutely uncommitted to or were not serious about living up to in the forms that are required, I am unable to say, but I doubt whether the honourable member for O'Connor could cite too many examples. I am happy to accept the proposition that when governments sign international conventions they should be committed to them. It is also worth remembering that we are not the only government in the world that has a parliament. We are not the only administration in the world that is subject to the decisions of a legislative body. This government must make pronouncements based on its expectations with respect to any legislative requirements that may flow from decisions that it makes. Many, if not most, governments are in a similar position and, indeed, there are coalition governments even more fragile than the current one that we have in this countrycoalitions sometimes with four or five parties in them, particularly in Europe-that have to make those decisions on a daily basis, estimating precisely what the likely outcome will be in their parliamentary arrangements. That is nothing unusual. It is always going to be the case that there will be a relationship between executive and legislature on these issues. The final comment I would make-in order to ensure that I can wind up by question time-relates to what the real issue is beneath the coalition's viewpoint on these things. The real issue is that the former government was using international conventions and obligations that it had signed up to as a basis for legislating. The real complaint of the coalition on these issues is not that the former government was signing conventions and not legislating; the real complaint of this government-the then opposition-was that the Hawke and Keating governments were signing international conventions and acting upon them. And why do they complain? They complain because they did not like the substance of the actions, because they did not want the Franklin Dam legislation. What the coalition is on about, ultimately, are the core issues. They do not want a situation where issues are dealt with by this national parliament-issues of national and international significance based on international conventions which allow legislation to be put through this parliament-when they do not like the substance of the legislation. That is the real issue in this debate. It is an arcane, technical debate about constitutionality and the like. It is that the coalition does not like the substance of legislation based on international conventions that former governments have put through this parliament. What they have failed to acknowledge, of course, is that all an international convention does in reality, in spite of their attempts to blur the issue on the Teoh case, is provide a basis upon which this elected national parliament can legislate on certain matters. It is interesting to have a look at some of the recent statements by various quite senior figures in the coalition parties. Their real level of commitment to notions such as the rule of law is very thin indeed. These are the people who gave us the Barwick High Court in the 1970s which produced such extraordinary gymnastics of intellect as the notion that you could not have an industrial dispute based around an unfair dismissal because there was no longer a relationship between an employer and an employee involved: it was an exemployer and an ex-employee, therefore that could not be the subject of an industrial dispute. They did not have any problems with that sort of stuff. Yet when we have a High Court which decides that previous decisions-the terra nullius decision and the Blackburn decision-are in fact no longer applicable, and they are overturned by the Mabo and Wik decisions, it is not correct; and, in the second instance, that the High Court was making law and this was inappropriate. Of course, when they made the original decisions there was not a squeak, not a sound. Once again, this is all about the core politics of the coalition position on issues. They are attacking the High Court now because they do not like the decisions. They do not like the umpire's decision so, all of a sudden, the High Court is being attacked as somehow making law, as somehow being illegitimate, and as somehow doing the wrong thingwhich shows just how fragile, flimsy and shallow their commitment to the rule of law is. These people who say they are conservatives, who say that they stand for the rule of law, who say that they are committed to not Australia's institutions, the independence of the judiciary and the supremacy of the High Court-are all the time prepared to attack those institutions when they come forward with decisions that they do not like. That is what that issue is about. The issue in this House today is about legislation that relates to the same sort of attitude. What it really is all about is that the coalition does not like the decisions which are put forward by governments based on international conventions that Australia has signed. That is the real issue which has given rise to this legislation. I think their stance in terms of the constitutional niceties is pure hypocrisy, as is their stance with respect to the High Court. All they are on about is seeking every possible avenue to attack governments that do progressive things in the interests of the Australian people.",61
41,Mr TONY SMITH,ADMINISTRA TIVE DECISIONS,"I wonder what the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) would have said about a person who had predicted the outcome of the Teoh case in 1989, when the convention was signed. Would that person have been a member of the lunar right? The fact of the matter is that if anyone had predicted what would happen in the Teoh case back in 1989 as a result of the signing of the convention, they would have been despatched from his side of politics as being a part of the lunar right that the member for Melbourne speaks of. In fact, the extraordinary did happen. A person who was convicted of six counts of importation of heroin and three counts of possession of heroin managed to avoid deportation on the basis that he had a legitimate expectation. It did not matter that, in relation to the six counts-the member for Melbourne said that the heroin was for Mr Teoh's wife; that does not appear in the report that I have read; I did not see that in the Commonwealth Law Report; if the member for Melbourne says that it is there, I did not see it",63

43,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. I ask the Minister whether he recalls telling this House on Monday: Over the next four years, government schools will be gaining an extra $2.3 billion above what they would have received had we maintained the Labor Party's level of funding ... Why, then, has your department told the Senate education committee in this submission that the real level of direct Commonwealth funding for government schools will fall by $41 million in the four years after 1995-96? Minister, will you now apologise for misleading the government schools sector and the House?",63
44,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is always a pleasure to get a question from the spokesman for the New South Wales teacher education unions. The point that I have made consistently to this House about government school spending is that total funds through the Commonwealth budget from specific purpose payments and general purpose payments or financial assistance grants over the next four years will be some $2.3 billion above what they would have received had funding been maintained at the level of the last year of the Labor government. The fact is that this government is putting in additional resources. The member for Werriwa has consistently claimed that, as a result of decisions made at the Premiers Conference last year, there would be flow-on reductions in funding for government schools.",63
45,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And he is right!,63
46,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And he is referring, of course, to funds that flow through the financial assistance grants. He has claimed that, but he happens to be 100 per cent wrong. In each of the state budgets that has been brought down since that decision, funding for government schools has increased. There has not been a shred of evidence to support the proposition of the member for Werriwa. The member for Werriwa is deliberately trying to confuse two different statistics about government funding. The statistic that I am using to support the government's proposition of increased funding for government schools is precisely the statistic that the member for Werriwa's own close friends, the Australian Education Union, have said it is absolutely necessary to look at if one wants to get a true and accurate picture of Commonwealth funding for government schools. And no amount of distortion and no amount of mealy-mouthed putting out of the views of the education unions are going to change the fundamental fact that this government is supporting government schools and you are doing your best to undermine confidence in government schools. Mr Latham-I seek leave to table the DEETYA submission showing where the minister has misled the House. Leave not granted. Mr Latham-What a disgrace! It is your submission!",63
47,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Resume your seat. Mr Latham-It is your own submission, showing you are a liar.",64
48,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Werriwa. Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs,64
49,Mr MCARTHUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister. Does the government have a system for approving ministerial staff appointments? Was this system applied in the case of the Chief of Staff to Minister Prosser?,64
50,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Corangamite for his question and advise the House that all staff are appointed on merit and in accordance with the criteria as set out in the Prime Minister's Key elements of ministerial responsibility and related guide Johnson is the Chief of Staff for the minister for small business. I understand that he is also a cousin of the minister for small business and I would add that the appointment is consistent with the requirements in the code of conduct. The government has a due process for analysing these matters. A committee examined this particular aspect and determined that he was not a close relative in accordance with the use of that term and then proceeded to make the appointment on merit. If the opposition believes otherwise, let them clearly say so. Department of Administrative Services",64
51,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Administrative Services. Minister, will you confirm that your department, and at least nine other federal government departments, are using Atlantis Removals for removal work, particularly for work outside ordinary working hours and on weekends and public holidays? Are you aware that Atlantis is presently paying its existing employees in accordance with a proposed Australian workplace agreement that has not yet been approved and that, as a result, these employees are being paid considerably less than their legal award rate-as much as $10 per hour below that rate? Doesn't this give Atlantis an unfair advantage over its law-abiding competitors, who are losing work and jobs as a result? Will you guarantee to terminate any further dealings with Atlantis until they agree to meet their legal obligations to their workers, and to ensure that the ethical dealing requirements of your department are complied with?",64
52,Mr JULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I do not have those details on me. I will get an answer to the honourable member as soon as I possibly can. Greenhouse Gas Emissions",64
53,Mr MAREK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Acting Prime Minister. What are the implications for jobs growth and economic development from Australia's strong and consistent stand on greenhouse gas emission targets? Does Australia's strong advocacy of differentiated targets reflect the need to ensure that limitation and reduction objectives will be both realistic and achievable?,64
54,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Capricornia for his question. I recognise that the member for Capricornia, before entering parliament, was a union shop steward in the coalfields of Queensland and knows what is at stake with regard to coal industry jobs in relation to the greenhouse debate. The government stands by its policy of differentiation, as this is the fairest and most practical way forward. The government is also fully supportive of Australia shouldering a fair burden in dealing with this complex and important issue. If Australia were to pursue the flat rate target of returning emissions to 1990 levels by 2010, with reduction beyond that, Australian production would fall by 1.5 per cent. The welfare for each Australian would fall by around $US6,500, compared to about $800 for each European. There would be significant dislocation in areas such as the Hunter Valley, the Bowen Basin and the Latrobe Valley in Victoria. Sectors which would be hit hardest would be non-ferrous metals, with output 50 per cent lower in 2010 than it otherwise would be; the iron and steel industry, whose output would be lowered by some 20 per cent; and the coal industry, the output of which would be lowered by 20 per cent as well. We are consistent and clear-cut on this matter, with the Prime Minister pursuing this issue at every opportunity on his tour overseas, likewise the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Alexander Downer, and I during the recent energy ministers' meeting at the OECD in Paris. I want to make it very clear that the government's position is sensible, practical and clear-cut and is turning the tide. The opposition's position is one of backflip, flipflop with regard to this issue. I know Mr Beazley had a very bad week with his caucus meeting yesterday and his magnificent backflip and pike on work for the dole. We gave him 10 out of 10 for that; 8.9, 10 out of 10. But his backflip and pike with regard to greenhouse are deserving of barely 5. Why? Because at the end of the day-and this is an extraordinary feat for the Leader of the Opposition-he is narrowcasting on this issue. He goes to the Hunter Valley and gives one message to the steel industry and the coal miners, and then he goes to meet the Greens elsewhere in Australia and comes to the doorstops out the front here and he gives a blurred message with regard to this issue. The opposition are entitled to a clear-cut message from their leader on this issue. You, the member for Hunter, and you, the member for Dobell, are particularly entitled to cut answer. Mr Fitzgibbon-I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. I ask you to remind the Deputy Prime Minister of the need to direct his remarks through the chair. I might remind him that it is the Workplace Relations Act which is causing the real problems in the coal mining industry.",64
55,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Hunter will resume his seat. The Acting Prime Minister is aware of the conventions of the House.,65
56,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In concluding m) answer, I draw the attention of the Leader of the Opposition to this quote from him: We have opposed the idea of mandatory targets but we have also tried to recognise a bit of reality. Here comes the flip-flop: There is a bit of concern out there around the globe on this issue, and we have had in place a set of activities designed to bring ourselves as close as possible to the sorts of targets that people around the globe expect of global citizens. Are you on the side of the Europeans or are you on the side of the Australian job seekers and the Australian coal industry? It is about time you faced up on this issue and gave a clear-cut answer on where you stand on greenhouse. We know where we stand: we stand for Australian jobs in the Australian coal industry and related industries, and we will continue this battle. Mr Fitzgibbon- Mr SPEAKER ",65

58,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of the New Zealand House of Representatives Primary Production Committee that looked after our delegation in New a clearZealand so well recently. A very warm welcome to you, and may you enjoy your stay with us. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Goods and Services Tax",65
59,Mr HATTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer's preferred model for a GST one involving a single across-the-board rate? If so, how could he support a change to the taxation system which would reduce the price of all currently taxed luxury goods-such as imported luxury cars, taxed at 45 per cent, and jewellery, taxed at 32 per cent-while increasing the price of many basic necessities, including food, clothing and personal pharmaceutical items?",66
60,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I believe that was the honourable member for Blaxland; is that right? I remember another honourable member for Blaxland in 1985 standing at a summit on behalf of the Australian Labor Party-ably supported by the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Oppositionsaying that having a taxation system that had varying rates according to classifications was one of the most complex, cumbersome and untransparent ways of indirect taxation. Mr Tanner-So, what is your view?",66
61,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Melbourne!,66
62,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is what he said. Before the Labor Party got into cheapjack opportunism, that is the kind of argument that the Labor Party used to engage in. Obviously, if you wanted taxation which was simple and transparent rather than going through multiplicities of classifications, you would be looking for some kind of simplicity. That is, whenever you are looking at a taxation system, what do you look for? Transparency, one; simplicity, two. Mr Gareth Evans-Equity. Mr Latham-Fairness.",66
63,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You look for equity and you look for fairness. Opposition members-Hooray!,66
64,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You do. Of course you look for equity. That is why we do not support R&D syndicates and why the Labor Party does. The old member for Hotham here sitting down in Oakleigh seeing his constituents who are coming in with problems saying, 'Why don't we back you into an R&D syndicate?' Going around in the back of the Roller saying, 'Why don't we back you into an infrastructure borrowing? What about a superannuation surcharge?' The friend of the tax avoiders, the old member for Hotham. He learnt very early in life. Which is why this government does believe in equity in the taxation system. My big regret is the Labor Party for Cheap Jack opportunistic reasonsMr Crean-What are the problems that are associated with",66
65,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member ought to think about this when he is in the vineyards of Bordeaux next month. He is known well in the vineyards of Bordeaux; they call him 'Jacques Economique'. While he is over in Europe, he perhaps could look at the European modelMr Crean-The dog trying to wag the prime ministerial tail.",66
66,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, you have found your voice, haven't you. Perhaps he could speak to the New Zealand delegation up there in the gallery about the advantages of simplicity in taxation. Perhaps he could ask the Labor members of the New Zealand delegation up there. Actually, now that he has reminded me, perhaps he could ask Mr David Lange. Mr Lange was recently on radio in Australia giving some advice to the Australian Labor Party-and they need advice. Do they need advice! Here we have a Leader of the Opposition haunted by Keating; he is hunted by Goss; he is harassed by Anthony Albanese; he is hijacked by the member for Hotham; and he is horrified by his own deputy leader. For the advantages of indirect taxation, we should be looking at simplicity; we should be looking at less complexity. Those are objectives we will always look at. Youth Allowance",66
67,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. I ask: in the light that parents in my electorate of O'Connor have welcomed the government's message to young Australians that life on the dole is not an acceptable alternative to investing in your future in education and training, can the minister advise the House of the negative impact on young Australians if this measure did not proceed?",66
68,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for O'Connor for his question. I well understand his concern because, as honourable members know, the Leader of the Opposition has already made it quite clear that the Labor Party opposes the common youth allowance lock, stock and barrel. In fact, he said that the Labor Party will reject it outright. If the youth allowance were to be rejected outright-lock, stock and barrel-significant benefits for many, many young people in this country would not be delivered. The youth allowance gives some 137,000 young Australians improved benefits. Some 70,000 will benefit from an extension of rent assistance to students; 41,200 students will benefit from the abolition of the Austudy minimum entitlement requirement; 16,000 needy young people will benefit from changes to independent status. The Leader of the Opposition is quite prepared to deny needy young Australians these benefits. If the Labor Party rejects the youth allowance, young people will continue to have to negotiate their way through the complexity of five different income support programs as their situation changes; 18to 20year-old unemployed young people will continue to get more money for being on the dole than if they had started a course at TAFE or university; and 16and 17-year-olds will continue to get the message from the opposition that life on the dole is an acceptable alternative to pursuing their education and training. The Leader of the Opposition is saying to his colleagues, sitting ever more anxiously behind him, that he believes he can sell the message to Australian parents that the future of their children is better guaranteed by a life on the dole than by being in education or training and getting qualifications that will get them a job when they leave school. The Leader of the Opposition has already led the Labor Party firmly down the track into a policy dead-end. They have had to follow him out again in one of the most humiliating backdowns that we have ever seen. I want to say to Labor Party members sitting behind the Leader of the Opposition that it is not a question of whether the Leader of the Opposition could do that again to you, because he has already done it. He has locked you into complete and total opposition to the common youth allowance. We know that even now the member for Jagajaga down there is taking a different position. A spokesman for the member for Jagajaga was quoted in the press on 19 June as saying that there are good parts to the common youth allowance. The Leader of the Opposition says that they are going to reject it lock, stock and barrel, that they are going to reject it outright. But the member for Jagajaga knows that there are good parts. The member for Jagajaga's strategy is quite different: she is going to look at the detail and seek to amend it. So the question amongst those who are struggling for the steering wheel of this rickety old Labor bus-whether it is the Leader of the Opposition, trying to keep his hands on the wheel; the young and the restless, who are struggling for control; the member for Hotham, trying to yank it into reverse; or the deputy leader, snoozing away in the passenger seat (there are real troubles with that Labor bus)-is where is it going and where is it taking us. The answer is that it is taking you nowhere. The map has gone out the window. The Leader of the Opposition has locked you into another untenable position and, unless you change it, you are going to go right over the cliff with him. Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs",67
69,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Since you have been the minister responsible for retail tenancy issues, did you ring any councillor in late March or April 1997 canvassing support for a large shopping centre development on a vacant lot, owned by you, adjacent to the Bunbury Homemaker site, which you also own?  clear yesterday. The shopping centre development that the member is referring to on the Eaton lot near Bunbury, as they keep talking aboutMr Crean- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I specifically referred to Bunbury, not the Eaton lot. Mr Gareth Evans-Next to the Homemaker site.",67

71,Mr GEORGIOU,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is dressed to the Treasurer. The Treasurer will be aware of a recent survey showing an increase in the number of Australians owning shares. Can the Treasurer advise the House how the government has encouraged this increase in the number of share market investors?,68
72,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. The Australian Stock Exchange survey on share ownership released last week confirmed rapid increase in share ownership in Australia. It examined both direct and indirect share ownership. In 1991, total share ownership confined to 14.7 per cent of the adult populataxation. tion. By 1994, it had increased to 19.9 per cent. This year it reached 34 per cent-a 130 per cent increase on the proportion six years earlier. Mr Kelvin Thomson-That was because of ministerial divestments.",68
73,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would not interrupt I were you. One of the reasons why share ownership increased so rapidly in Australia was Labor's policy of privati sing the Commonwealth Bank, which we supported. You used to be in favour of privatisation before the affliction of the CJO disease the front-bench of the Labor Party. The number of women investing in the investments. share market has increased from 17.1 per cent in 1994 to 28.3 per cent in 1997. Of course, one of the developments which have populartake ised share ownership in this country was the float and privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia-a Labor Party initiative which we in the coalition supported. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia has 430,000 shareholders. The government's biggest ever privatisation program, which is set to go ahead this year with the float of one-third of the equity in Telstra, will give the opportunity for even more Australians to come into the share market and to invest in that great Australian company. Of course, the Labor Party is opposed to any privatisation in relation to Telstra-at least opposed at this stage and will probably remain opposed unless it should ever get back into government, in which case adwe know it will change its policy. It is important to protect the interests of Australian shareholders. The government is determined to see that the Australian Securities Commission keeps the share markets clean and ensures that any breaches of the law are brought quickly to justice. The government has also sought to encourage share owning by the Australian public by increasing in last year's budget the attractivea ness of employee share ownership plans, where there was a lift from $500 to $1,000 a year per employee for exempt shares distributwas ed under such plans which are exempt from That fits in with the government's view that share ownership should be encouraged to employees who take an interest in the companies for which they work, who, where they make great contributions to those companies, can derive some of the profitability as a result and where they have the option to improve the cooperative industrial relations if between the employer and the employee. Employee share ownership plans are things to be welcomed and things our government wants to encourage. The number of Australians who have direct share ownership in the Australian share market, according to the down Stock Exchange, is 2004 per cent-20A per cent of the adult population has direct share As far as the government is concerned, we want to encourage ordinary Australians to a stake in corporate Australia, to have an investment in the companies that grow the economy and to have a stake in the income generation and wealth creation part of the Australian economy. This is a welcomed development and a development which the government wants to encourage and see continue into the future. Minster for Small Business and Consumer Affairs",68
74,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again directed to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Now that he has had time to reflect on what he does actually own, I again ask him a question which relates to his ministerial responsibility for retail tenancy. Further to your earlier answer, I have been informed that you rang a councillor by the name of John MCCourt in late March or April of this year canvassing support for a large development involving a bulk goods style supermarket on your vacant lot adjacent to your Bunbury Homemaker lot.

85,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Could the Treasurer inform the House of recent initiatives introduced by this government to promote competition in the banking industry? What benefits will these measures have for home buyers and small business borrowers throughout Australia, but particularly in my electorate of Longman?",69
86,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Longman for his question. I know that in the electorate of Longman there are many young families who are vitally interested in interest rates, particularly home mortgage rates. One of the major pressures in bringing down home mortgage rates in Aushas been new competition in the area from mortgage originators. Last Thursday, the Senate passed government legislation to extend an exemption from interest withholding tax under section 128F of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The section l28F exemption was a relic of a tax act from some 20 years ago, legislated in another era in relation to other financial market practices. That exemption from interest withholding tax could only be accessed where overseas borrowings were used in Australian business. There was an end use test. By removing the end use test, the exemption became available generally and enabled the practice of borrowing overseas and being exempt from the withholding tax regime to bring money in at cheaper rates for on-lending to home buyers in Australia. Puma Management Ltd, which raises funds in the wholesale capital markets for onlending to non-bank mortgage managers, has a strategic partnership, for example, with Aussie Home Loans. In a press release issued on 14 February this year, Puma said: 'The amendments would result in significant benefits to borrowers' and 'meant the maintenance of a competitive environment for Australian borrowers.' It is an example of where heightening competition, where getting an international focus, actually can bring benefits to Australian consumers and Australian borrowers. Other changes that the government has recently enacted are directed towards the same objective. We are introducing a public offer test in relation to borrowings on wholesale capital markets to ensure that, when Australian borrowers enter financial markets, this is known to other lenders who can bid to Australian borrowers at competitive rates. It will allow the listing of loan raising on electronic media, such as Reuters, which can qualify for the public offer test. The public offer test require the borrower to approach at least 10 overseas lenders to make use of it. These measures will ensure that the Australian financial and capital markets are much more efficient, that they are outwardly oriented and that they have the capacity to bring the best benefits for Australian borrowers and to pass them onto consumers. I reiterate, as I have so many other times in the House before, the government's policy to reduce interest rates is done for the benefit of consumers, home buyers and small business. They are the objects of this policy so that small business can get on with the business of business and create jobs so that home buyers are relieved from the pressure of the mortgage interest rates from which they were unduly suffering before they realised the full benefits of those lower interest rates. Bringing Them Home: Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission",69
87,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Did the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission have copies of the Wilson report Bringing Them Home for a considerable time before its release? Did the government have difficulty getting sufficient copies of the Wilson report from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission? Was the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission selectively leaking documents to sympathetic journalists to get their spin on it? Did you, as Attorney-General, have to threaten the commission to secure enough copies for distribution?",70
88,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am only speaking from memory now because I cannot give the precise dates. My recollection is that I received one copy of the report from Sir Ronald Wilson on about 5 April. At that stage, there were not copies available for tabling. It was envisaged that the report would be tabled-in fact, he and I talked about it around that time-and we contemplated it would be tabled when the report had been printed and when the commission had also printed a summary version. Initially, it was contemwill plated that would be 32 pages; it ended up being 50 pages. We started to hear media reports of what was in the report and, at that stage, still had only one copy. We requested the commission to provide the copies that were required for tabling. From memory, again, it is something like 146 copies that are required for tabling purposes. They were provided promptly on request and the document was tabled on the Monday, which was the first day of the reconciliation conference. I can confirm those dates, if required, but that is roughly the background. Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency",70
89,Mrs BAILEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security. Given that people living in country areas often have difficulty accessing government services, particularly when they are located in towns with no public transport, can the minister please advise the House how the new Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency will benefit people living in rural and regional areas like Seymour in my electorate of MCEwen?",71
90,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can relate very much to what the honourable member for MCEwen has had to say in relation to this particular issue. One of the reasons why the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency is being formed-it will commence its operations on 1 July-is to enable us to deliver an effective range of services in a variety of Commonwealth areas through a single agency. The agency will bring together a range of like Commonwealth programs and services for which people require access. This includes social security payments, employment assistance, student assistance and child-care subsidies. Over time, the agency will have a capacity to provide more services in addition. Under the current arrangements, people in regional and rural Australia often have to travel substantial distances to access one program and then go to another centre to access another form of Commonwealth program. It is quite clear that when you have one agency that is able to deliver these, you have a better opportunity to deal with all of your issues in the one centre. It also gives us an opportunity to expand the range of programs and services that are available. That will be done by full-time officers as well as by using visitor programs. Already DEETYA has provided that five of its regional offices will be transferred to the agency. They are in Ayr, Bowral, Mt Barker, Warragul and Collie. In addition, offices will be opened or upgraded substantially in 11 other sites. Those sites are Benalla, Cooma, Cowra, Dalby, Deniliquin, Gunnedah, Leeton, Narrabri, Seymour, Singleton and Young. Visiting services will provide greater access. We have the additional visiting teams using Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander liaison officers. This is a demonstration of a strong commitment to rural and regional Australia. But the commitment is particularly demonstrated for residents of Seymour. That includes people from Kilmore and Broadford. In each of the areas at the moment all that they have had available has been a visiting service from Wangaratta, which I understand is 145 kilometres away. At the moment this involves an average of three staff, who visit one day a week. The agency has moved to employ four permanent staff, providing services to the unemployed, and specialists are to conduct home visits and interview is by appointment. We will be expanding the range of services. The Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency will shortly lease premises in Seymour, which will allow it to provide a full range of services, with approximately nine staff in one location. They have also initiated a public tender for a purpose built regional office to open in 1998. That office will have 16 staff and provide a full range of agency and service payments.

91,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Minister, we know that since you have been responsible for retail tenancy issues, you spoke to Nick Greiner about the Target store in your Eaton site. Did you also in that short conversation, which your brother followed up in writing, mention the Coles Myer extension in the CBD of Bunbury? Will you end the cover-up and table your brother's letter?  sive statement on this matter. I have answered questions to the detail of this. There is nothing more to add. Defence: Nulka Decoy",71
92,Mrs DRAPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. Can the minister inform the House about the accuracy of a Canberra Times report today about the Project Nulka export contract? Is this an example of the benefits to Australia from the alliance with the United States?,71
93,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question and her interest in defence, not the least because the prime contractor for British Aerospace has a major facility in Adelaide and not least because she is an ex-member of the Australian Defence Force. It is true that today a contract will be signed with British Aerospace to produce antimissile decoys under a collaborative arrangement with the United States and Canada. Nulka is a hovering rocket decoy used to protect ships from incoming missiles and has beenMr Beazley interjecting",72
94,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well done. I congratulate you. It took a long time. Now the money is coming home while we happen to be in power. This project began as a Defence Science and Technology Organisation concept in the 1980s. British Aerospace developed the decoy based on DSTO's concept. In August last year the defence organisation signed a contract with British Aerospace for $58 million. This latest contract is for $114 million, the bulk of which will go to the Australian Navy. It is worth saying that Canada has also chosen Nulka and is buying the Australian design launchers as well as the decoy itself. It is a major export and it is a major defence industry success for Australia. The contract a collaborative program but it will be worth about $58 million for Australian industry. Mr Bevis interjecting",72
95,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It will provide 170 million jobs, which you ought to be interested in. Mr Bevis-How many jobs?",72
96,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It will provide about 170 jobs with British Aerospace, AD! and Australian subcontractors. It does show the important example of close collaborative development with the US and it shows the value of the US alliance, with major benefits to both countries. Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs",72
97,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Cunningham. You are slow out of the blocks.,72
98,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, no. I have to give him time to get his thoughts together. My question is addressed to the 'Target' Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. I refer the minister to his earlier answer",72

101,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Minister, I refer to your earlier answer regarding your phone call to Nick Greiner. Specifically, did you discuss Coles Myer requiring additional car parking at the Bunbury expansion, and did your brother's follow-up letter refer to this matter?  did not discuss any detail at all. Landmines",72
102,Mrs STONE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Acting Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. What has been Australia's contribution to resolving the international issues of landmine clearing and the rehabilitation of areas is laid with landmines during times of war?,72
103,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Murray for her question. We are supporting the initiatives, which are gathering a great deal of momentum at this time with the special meeting in Brussels. The overriding priority of this government is to make a practical contribution to helping achieve a permanent solution to the landmines crisis. This is exactly what our position is, and it has gone a lot further than that which was ever contemplated by the previous government. We realise that people around the world are suffering now from the past misuse of antipersonnel landmines, with an estimated I 10 million mines still, sadly, currently in the ground. The government continues, therefore, to give priority to those measures which will make the greatest practical difference to the victims of the misuse of landmines. Most recently, on 23 February, the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced a contribution of half a million dollars to a United Nations mine awareness program in Afghanistan. I might add that there are some very brave Australians, some of whom were posted by the then Leader of the Opposition as a minefield clearance unit to Peshawar in Pakistan, who are working in Afghanistan. Some of those have now stayed on on individual contracts with the United Nations. They pass through the Khyber Pass regularly to go back into Afghanistan and help train people in the location and removal of mines and increasing safety in the reduction of huge damage to life and limb which is condeveloper tinuing to occur in Afghanistan. I was pleased to meet recently with some of those Australning ians and others involved in that very profesBunbury? sional and skilled work. The allocation of half a million dollars brings Australia's total contribution to the de- day mining process announced since May 1996 to over $18 million. It makes Australia a world City Council. leader in de-mining efforts. In fact, on a per capita basis, Australia ranks third in the world in providing assistance for the removal landmines. Australia places particular priority on mine-affected countries in our own region, especially Cambodia and Laos, and on Afformal ghanistan, as was previously mentioned. The any council. government announced a major $12 million de-mining initiative in Indochina in May 1996. AusAID is supporting the participation of delegates to a regional seminar on landdirected mines organised by the Australian network the international campaign to ban landmines to be held in Sydney on 14 to 17 July. This is a very serious problem. It is where the Australian government supports range of initiatives on the practical side helping with de-mining and on the policy framework side in supporting the end of the production, distribution and installation of this horrific ordnance-Iandmines. You only have to see first-hand to know the huge and horrifvery ic damage which can be done in an instance of a second by landmines-too often to innocent civilians in the most extraordinary circumstances. I thank the member for Murray for her question. I assure her and the House-and I would have thought this issue would enjoy a degree of support from both sides of the House-that Australia is being very active in its support of the elimination of landmines worldwide.

Minister, I understand a sixmonth feasibility study into an Australian world-first commercial satellite has just been one completed. What is the significance of the a new technology, and what benefits will it with deliver to the resources industries?",73
107,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and for his continuing interest in science and technology. It gives me great pleasure to advise the House on a exciting and significant scientific and commercial venture: the development of the Aries-l satellite. This 400-kilogram satellite, planned to be launched in 1999 and fully operational by the year 2000, is going to be the world's first commercially sustainable resource information satellite using the latest in hyperspectral sensing technology. A $1.2 billion feasibility study which was commissioned some six months ago has come back very positive and confirmed the commercial and technical feasibility of the satellite. The study was commissioned by a highly influential consortium of government and industry players from both here and around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Austria, Holland, Norway, Spain and Finland. For its part, the Australian government has invested $300,000 in the project so far. It is the most ambitious and potentially most commercially rewarding space project ever undertaken in Australia. It is going to be a powerful prospecting tool, primarily targeting the mining industry. It wi\l dramatically improve geological mapping and the detection of mineral rich regions around the world. It is also going to be a vital environmental monitoring tool. It is going to have applications land use assessments for agriculture, forestry and defence applications. Aries-l builds on 20 years of remote sensing work between CSIRO and the mining industry. It is a unique commercial venture that promises lucrative economic and scientific returns. Construction of Aries-l is expected to commence before the end of the year. I congratulate all of those who have worked so diligently and for such a long period to bring the research to this point. I wish them well in their future endeavours. Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs",73

Wi\l you now do your job and properly investigate the minister's interests in relation to the Eaton and related developments and other developments that the minister is involved in in Bunbury? Wi\l you seek the correspondence which followed his call to Greiner? Will you seek the details of his continuing communications with councillers on these matters, communications entered into whilst he was a minister in clear breach of the requirements upon him?",74

110,Mr FORREST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. The minister would be aware of concerns being expressed about the possibility of commercial development of the Gallipoli Peninsula. As someone who represents a large number of soldier settlements, I am aware that it is important to my constituents, as it is to every Australian. Minister, could you advise the House, members present and all Australians what representations have been made on this matter to the Turkish authorities and what response has been received so that we could all be assured that this precious site sacred to for our folklore and memories can be preserved?",74
111,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Mallee for his question and his ongoing interest in veterans affairs issues. Members of the House may not be aware that the early settlement of the seat of Mallee was, indeed, by many soldiers who returned from the First World War and the Second World War. That demonstrates his ongoing commitment to our veteran community. Mr Speaker, let me advise the House that there is currently an international design competition under way to attract ideas and proposals for the restoration of the Gallipoli Peninsula. Let me further assure the House that the government strongly favours the protection of the savage dignity and the natural beauty of the Gallipoli Peninsula, the war memorials and, in particular, of course, ANZAC Cove and Lone Pine. I am sure our parliamentary delegation from New Zealand would also be interested in this restoration of the Gallipoli Peninsula, because New Zealanders joined Australians in that first, very historic landing at Gallipoli in 1915. We would prefer to avoid any introduction of artificiality to this very sacred landscape. These views have been expressed to the Turkish government through our ambassador in Turkey, His Excellency David Evans. There is currently an international jury of nine eminent architects who will look at the submissions and will be announcing the successful entry on ANZAC Day 1998. The accomplished Australian architect Mr Glenn Murkett has been accepted as a member of that jury. Further, a representative of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission has been appointed to the technical panel that will evaluate the entries and report to the international jury of nine. This will also ensure that the sensitivities of the area will be appropriately respected. The Turkish government has indicated that the status and the integrity of the war cemeteries and the memorials on the Gallipoli Peninsula will remain intact. Our ambassador in Ankara, in Turkey, is maintaining a very close interest in the development of the Gallipoli Peninsula and will be continuing to represent the Australian position, specifically the views and concerns of our veteran community. I believe that the actions of the Turkish government so far indicate that it is very much aware of the very special place that the Gallipoli Peninsula has in the history of our nation. I have also written to the RSL to ensure that it is kept fully informed of the progress of this redevelopment and this design competition. I will ensure its their views are represented.",74
112,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,75
113,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I note some very cheap comments from the front-bench on the other side which do not add anything to the respect of the Gallipoli Peninsula. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, whilst I am sorry to short-change our Kiwi friends, I ask at the 58-minute mark and after 20 questions that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Sound and Vision Office",75
114,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I ask whether you would be willing to check with the Sound and Vision Office to ascertain whether or not the Treasurer has acquired tapes of the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating. If so, could you look at recent tapes to see whether there has been any breach of copyright?",75
115,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I have heard many questions and points of order that border on the frivolous in the time. I have been here. That is the first question to me that borders on the same problem. I shall treat it with the contempt that it deserves. Parliamentary Transport Offices,75
116,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, following the bizarre decision by the Department of Administrative Services to close down the transport office and give the business to Jetset, can you advise the House whether it is intended to keep the shuttle open? If so, will the shuttle be staffed by parliamentary staff or by staff from Administrative Services?",75
117,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I am not aware that any tender has been let to Jetset or any other potential provider of the services. I know members very much have an interest in the outcome of some of the very sensitive negotiations that have been going on. The President and I, and our departmental officers, have been contributing to the discussions. As soon as more information comes to hand, I will advise members. The Minister for Administrative Services might like to add to my response. Mr Crean-Doesn'the talk to you directly?",75
118,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"He is going to talk to us all directly. Mr Jull-On indulgence, Mr Speaker, I would like to add to your answer. The situation of the transport office is not the province of the Department of Administrative Services. It is the province of the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate and any negotiations going on with any travel provider do not include the operation of Comcar or any other transport car services that are provided to members and senators. No contract has been signed.",75
119,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"However, of course the provision of services generally are part of the focus of these discussions and the Comcar services which are very important to us all are the subject of some of those discussions. '>arliamentary Citizenship Program",75
120,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, you will recall that I raised with you on 5 June, as did the member for Moore, the number of Western Australian schools participating in the parliament citizenship visits program. In your recent reply to me, for which I am very grateful, you indicated that together with Madam President you were considering the program's allocation of funding and the subsidy levels. You also indicated that you were hopeful of making an announcement in that respect. To enable Western Australian schools to make some forward planning, I am inquiring whether that announcement might be this week, during the winter recess or when we return after the winter recess.",76
121,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"With the absence of the President overseas, final conclusions are unlikely this week. However, we do expect to make a final decision very early in the new financial year and, as soon as the decisions have been made, then the information will be directed to all concerned members by letter as soon as it is possible to do so. Parliamentary Transport Offices  question raised by the member for Kalgoorlie and the response by the Minister for Administrative Services, when you are looking at that matter, would you please establish whether it is a fact that Jetset Travel Services, were they to gain the right to operate travel services and the travel office of the Department of House of Representatives, are in fact a foreign owned operation?",76
122,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I think it is generally known that up until a week ago Jetset Travel was 50 per cent owned by Australian interests. These interests have been sold within the last week, as I understand it, to Air New Zealand. But that is speculation around a potential suppler of a service which, at the moment, has not been resolved. I say that out of due deference to our visiting colleagues from New Zealand.

125,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The continuing failure of the government to protect the 70 per cent of elderly Australians who own their own homes and who will now need to sell their homes to enter a nursing home. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",77
126,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If it comes to pass either today or tomorrow that the Aged Care Bill 1997 goes through this parliament without the Labor amendments, it will be a very sad day for older Australians and their families. As everybody in this House knows, people who need a nursing home bed are frail and ill. It is already hard enough for the family and the older person who has to go into a nursing home to come to terms with that fact, but forcing the elderly person to sell their home to get a bed will add great trauma both to the older person themselves and to their families. Mr Deputy Speaker, do not think for a minute and neither should anybody out in the community think that the deal done by the Democrats with the government will protect the family home. It will not. The government will claim, I am sure, in the debate today that the legislation is based on a system of aged care put in place by Labor. Nothing could be further from the truth. This legislation does not in any positive way represent reform of aged care. Nor - s .it positive restructuring of the sector and It IS certainly not anything that would have been put in place by a Labor government. In fact, it is a fundamental attack on Australian values: every Australian's right to expect equal access to reasonable health and aged care. The legislation is an attack on fundamental Australian values and the government is attempting to sell it to the Australian public by the oldest of political tactics-to create a sense of crisis. The legislation is a consequence not of any made-up crisis, not of a desire to reform care for older Australians; rather, it is the consequence of having to find alternative sources of funding to cover up for the fact that this government ripped $500 million out of aged care in its 1996 budget. This government does not see aged care or the building of nursing homes as a priority. Of course, it could find $1.7 billion for health insurance incentives, which have already proved to be completely useless and a complete waste of money. They have proved completely useless already in improving the overall levels of access to health care. What does the government do as far as aged care goes? It reduces funding by half a billion dollars. The way the government proposes to find that alternative source of funding is to make Australians sell their homes in order to get aged care. To make up for the half a billion dollars that the government took out of the aged care budget last year, Australians are going to have to sell their homes to get a nursing home bed. The government knowsthey might not have told the back bench-that 72 per cent of people in nursing homes own their own home at the time of entry. This is built into the financing model undertaken by the minister's department. The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) says-and I am sure she will say it today again, because it is her only responsethat it applies to hostels, so why not apply it to nursing homes? She has consistently and stubbornly refused to acknowledge that there is any difference between hostels and nursing homes. Let us state it one more time for the benefit of the minister and for the benefit of the government's back bench-although I am sure the minister does understand. I know she has been to many hostels and nursing homes. I am sure she does know that hostels are about supported accommodation. Nursing homes are for the ill and the frail. It is all about care. Nursing homes care for people who are incapable of looking after themselves. They are not the same thing as hostels. The government's changes to aged care have provoked thousands of letters and phone calls. I am going to read some of those into the Hansard to emphasise particular points and to demonstrate just how out of touch the government is with the way people are thinking. On the issue of the government's attempts to equate hostels with nursing homes, let us consider the words of a writer from the area of Sydney where the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) grew up. The writer says: I think it is ridiculous to compare hostels and nursing homes as one and the same . . . 'Hostel care is for people who can still care for themselves but rely on certain amenities to be provided for them ... 'Nursing' homes are for people who can no longer care for themselves or their partner can no longer care for them. However, even in her press conference yesterday the minister was still attempting to deceive people on this issue. In answer to a question about nursing home entry she said: If a person is lucky enough to be assigned to a hostel, then they would have better living conditions than those in a nursing home. This is patent dishonesty. As the writer from Earlwood and as anyone else who has ever had to deal with the aged care sector knows, people in hostels have made a considered choice, often after months and months of careful deliberation and examination of numerous different hostel options. They are moving somewhere else to live. People go into nursing homes because they have no choice. They are simply too old or too frail to care for themselves. It is depressing to have to keep reiterating this point, particularly depressing for the older people in this country, but, unfortunately, it is necessary because of the minister's continued contempt for the facts. The second major piece of deception that this government and this minister are trying to pull off in selling this legislation relates to the sale of the family home as a condition for gaining entry to nursing home care. The minister continues to insist---she is now a lone voice in this insistence-that people will not have to sell their homes. She says they will not have to sell their homes to pay her new up-front entry fee. This insistence is so ridiculously at odds with the facts that the mmlster is becoming an embarrassment, certainly to the back bench of the government. Let us look at the facts. Under the government's new aged care legislation if you have assets in excess of $22,500 and need to go to a nursing home you will have to pay an upfront fee. There are many iniquitous problems, but let us remember a couple of things. It is uncapped, so they can charge what they like. It must be negotiated with the nursing home at an extremely vulnerable stage of a person's life. Let us not forget that 60 per cent of people who go into nursing homes come straight out of hospital after a serious illness such as a stroke. Mr Adams-This isn't true?",77
127,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It certainly is true. You might know about it; the minister seems not to. Nothing in the legislation prevents the nursing home proprietor from simply taking the money as windfall profit. The government knows that more than 70 per cent of people entering nursing homes own their own homes and, while exemptions exist for a spouse or family member who is a carer, the government also knows one very important fact that 90 per cent of people who have to go into a nursing home have been living alone before they go to that home. So the exemptions will apply to very few people. The key point is that the vast majority of people who need to go into nursing homes are age pensioners. They have one asset. Their only income is the pension and their only asset is their home. In the words of the Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association, which represents a large number of private enterprise, church, charity and community providers of aged care which will be charging these entry fees, these people are, in their terms, 'asset rich and cash poor'. Let us spell it out again for the minister. They have one asset and one asset alone-their home. If these assets must be sold to get into a nursing home, if it is the only asset they have, of course they will have to sell their homes. ANECHA have always been totally clear on this point. The legislation is designed to allow nursing homes to tap into the value of people's homes as a substitute for the government doing what it should do. Of course, they should provide the necessary funding out of government revenue. The minister's reluctance to come clean on this issue is quite understandable, because it is not a popular move to make people sell their homes to get nursing home care-not a popular move at all. Like the Labor Party, the wider community has already seen this legislation as a fundamental attack on Australian values. The value of our community is that every Australian should have equal access to health and aged care when they need it, regardless of how much money they have. The Howard government was unelectable until it promised to preserve Medicare-the central part of our universal health care system. Care for frail, older Australians in nursing homes, care provided on the basis of need regardless of wealth or assets, is a part of this, or it was until the minister and this legislation came to pass. Let us have a look at another organisation that represents the owners of nursing homes, who are of course telling the truth about what will happen when this legislation actually becomes law. The National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals said in the Daily Telegraph a while ago: ... people who could afford to pay an accommodation bond of around $88,000 when they entered a home would get their own room, possibly with an en suite. Those who paid a lesser fee may share a room with one other person. That is not the story that the minister has been telling. She has been saying, 'If you sell your home, at least you will get a room of your own.' That will not happen if you can only pay a small entry fee. What will happen is that those who pay a small entry fee will be down the back of the queue waiting to get in and, when they do get in, they will get second-rate accommodation and second-rate care. That is what will happen and that is what all the organisations know will happen. Mr Lee-That is why the self-funded retirees are upset with you, Jim.",78
128,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is exactly right. Arthur Brotherhood, the CEO of this national association that I have just referred to, also put it very succinctly in his evidence to the Senate Community Affairs References Committee into the funding of aged care when he described in detail the preferential treatment that would be offered to those who pay a higher fee. Everybody else knows the workings of the market. It is naive in the extreme to say that those who pay more will not get more. They will not only get the single room and the en suite, but of course it will be true-as Arthur Brotherhood says-that they will get preferential treatment. It is a very sad and sorry day when we see older Australians being attacked in this way. We can actually see the cat coming out of the bag. Mr Lee-And a smelly one, too.",79
129,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"A very smelly, old cat indeed. What will happen is that these will be smelly, old nursing homes that people without any money will be relegated to. Older Australians and their families realise that they will have to sell their homes and that this legislation will lead to two tiers of health and aged care. It is an inevitable outcome when a provider has the option to choose between a person who can pay a large entry fee, because the value of their home is so much greater, and one who pays a lower fee. Let us not be naive. We all know how the system works; the more you pay, the more you get. We do not believe that that is the sort of system that we should have when it comes to health and aged care. This legislation is a disgrace. Older Australians will suffer from this fundamental undermining of a Labor policy, which is access on the basis of your health needs. The government should be condemned for introducing this legislation and for creating great trauma in the lives of older Australians and their families. They stand condemned.",79
130,Mrs MOYLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If anyone should be condemned for the treatment of older Australians, it is these people on the benches over here who for 13 years presided over a system which is a disgrace to this country. This shadow minister has the cheek to come in here and talk about Australian values. What kinds of values are they which put the most frail and vulnerable citizens in the worse possible accommodation options? I welcome this opportunity to respond to the litany of misinformation, untruths and lies from the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin). The shadow minister for scare just cannot help herself. She has been badly sidelined in this debate. The member for Jagajaga has been rendered irrelevant and left high and dry. She has nowhere left to go other than come to the refuge of this place, throw around a bit more dirt just for good measure and spread more untruths, a few more distortions and a lot more scaremongering. Look at the title of this MPI; we know that scaremongering is alive and well today in this debate. The opposition is particularly irrelevant, as is the shadow minister and member for Jagajaga. Here she is going around spreading this absolute nonsense about pensioners being forced to sell the family home. This is classic scaremongering stuff. It is totally irresponsible and the shadow minister knows it. Scaring the elderly and using them as a political football is about as low as you can get in this place in debate. It is about as low as you can get to use the aged in this country, the most frail and most vulnerable, as political footballs-and she knows it. But that is their stock in trade. They have no shame and no responsibility. They have certainly got no policies. We have seen the extent of their aged care policy-a pathetic eight paragraphs was all they could put together in such an important area of public and social policy. From the very first day of this debate all the opposition has done is play a totally divisive and negative game. They sought to play the lowest card in the deck, that is, the scaremongering tactic. 'To hell,' she says, 'with the consequences. Let's go out there and scare the frail and the aged just for the sake of a few votes.' The sum total of the opposition's contribution to the aged care debate is to scare. They should be condemned for their totally irresponsible and reckless approach. The bottom line is that the Labor opposition has been caught out on this issue. They never had any intention of being a constructive player in the debate. They now find themselves alone. They are a voice in the wilderness. They have nothing to contribute, and they never have had. They have nothing to say, and they have no policy to put on this table. The Labor opposition and the member for Jagajaga have gone around the country telling everyone who would listen that they were going to guarantee the defeat of this bill. The $2 billion man-the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), who is not in the House today-was arrogantly claiming during the debate in this House a few weeks ago that the bill would not make it through the Senate. He and the member for Jagajaga were going to claim it as a great win for the opposition. The member for Jagajaga has not had too many wins of late. She was desperate for this one, and I have to report that the member for Jagajaga will have to walk away from this debate empty-handed once again. By their very tactics, the opposition played themselves out of this debate at a very early stage. Constructive debate was required from all parties to get the best outcome for the most frail, most vulnerable people in our community. The last thing that was needed was the destructive and totally negative approach adopted by the Labor Party. They are totally irrelevant. The government's Aged Care Bill gives renewed hope to a sector of the community. It gives the very best chance to produce better outcomes for the most frail citizens in our community. They were ignored for too long by the Labor Party, who were in government for 13 years and did absolutely nothing to improve the standard of nursing homes. Let me remind the House why these reforms are necessary. Labor left a legacy of nursing home buildings in crisis. That was identified by their own report, by Professor Gregory. Their response to that report was a complete failure. There was no response. They cut capital funding expenditure while not allowing nursing home providers to charge a bond, as hostel proprietors had done for 10 years. In 1992-93, $45 million was available for nursing home capital purposes but, by 1995-96, this had dropped to $10.7 million, a 75 per cent reduction in capital funding-that is a disgrace, in the light of a ieport that lays all the evidence on the table. But let us talk about what these statistics really mean for people out there, particularly when it comes to the residents' quality of It means that too many buildings have serious structural deficiencies which mean hazards which jeopardise residents' safety and security. It means unsafe working environments. There are too many institutional type buildings with narrow, dark corridors and inadequate lighting. That restricts residents' mobility, further hampering their capacity to enjoy a quality of life. There are also small, narrow toilets, perhaps shared between many residents. There is no privacy or comfort. Some buildings are multi storey and have no lifts, which further restricts mobility. Some buildings have sterile, hospital-like environments which, despite the best efforts of staff and providers, are far from homelike-despite one of Labor's better measures which they put into place in nursing homes when they were in government. Too many nursing home buildings are serious fire traps. There may be fire walls and the fire exits can be blocked or even locked. The windows might not open. Perhaps the fire exits open to enclosed courtyards, not allowing residents to move away from fires. In many nursing homes, there are too many people in a room-four, six or even eight or more people may be living in a room. That means rows of beds-bed after bed, sometimes a metre apart-no privacy, no comfort and no room for personal belongings. Where is the social justice and equity here? As I said, this shadow minister dares to come into this place and talk about 'the Australian value'. What kind of value is that? What kind of value have we seen in 13 years of Labor's administration--or should I say maladministration--of the nursing home sector? People out there want reforms. They do not want more reports or reviews-I have got them lining the shelves of this place-without any action. We want action in this country. We got inaction from Labor in their 13 years of administration. Let us remember that we have an aging population. In 1991, there were less than two million Australians aged over 65. In 30 years there will be over five million. So, with no action, today's problems will get worse. It is absolutely imperative that this government put life. in place a policy that deals with today's problems but which also provides for the future of the aged in this country. There is no way to fix these problems easily. We inherited a legacy. In stark contrast to the nursing home buildings, hostels generally offer a much better standard of accommodation, very often providing privacy by way of a private room, sometimes with an en suite bathroom attached. This is no accident, because Labor's hostel policy, introduced in 1988, with our support, provided an income stream for hostels which provided significant finance for the rebuilding and refurbishment of that sector. This income stream was called 'entry contributions'. Labor introduced and adopted them. It is estimated that accommodation bonds will provide an income stream of some $130 million a year. It seems reasonable to allow that policy to be extended to nursing homes as well. Although there are some differences between the residents housed in hostels and nursing homes, we know that at least 40 per cent of hostel residents today ought to be classified as nursing home residents. The Aged Care Bill contains the opportunity to fix the urgent problems facing nursing home buildings. The answer is quite clear: the passage of this bill means we can ensure the dignity, comfort, safety and security of all older people. Let me also set the record straight on a number of the specific scares spread by the shadow minister. She says that people will be forced to sell their homes. This government is absolutely committed to ensuring strong protections for other older people, particularly for those who have limited financial means. We have set in place a system that ensures that care for people is provided on the basis of their clinical needs for care and not on the basis of their financial means. In fact, this legislation has more protections, safety nets, guarantees and assurances of a continuation of high quality care than any legislation that has come before this parliament. Let me repeat: no-one will be forced to sell the family home. We have put the protections in place. Accommodation bonds will not be payable by concessional residents. 'The family home will be protected where a spouse, a dependent child-or children-or a carer will be resident in the family home. Under our new arrangements, individuals will also have a wide choice of optionssomething Labor never offered people entering hostels. They had to find the lump sum up-front straight away. We have allowed time and flexibility of payment, we have allowed people a choice and we have allowed for emergency admissions. People can get inforcare mation on the government's new hotline. Another scare tactic is that this will a two-tier system; that poorer people will only get into poorer standard homes. Again, this clearly false. This is another lot of misinformto ation and disgraceful scare tactics that this shadow minister and her crew have been quality entering into. All facilities will take their share concessional residents. Under our system, all residents, regardless of their means, will benefit from better quality accommodation, more equitable funding arrangements and is better quality care. What older Australians want most is a comfortable, secure and but dignified existence in their vulnerable later years with care of the highest standard that we can give them. The aged care structural reform package delivers just that. To suggest that the many caring and dedicated staff nursing homes and hostels will differentiate the kind of care that is given based on the ability to pay is a slur on their professionalhave ism and their dedication. I have met many of them around this country as I have travelled from one end of the country to the other. Ms Macklin interjecting",80
131,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I would just like to say to the member for Jagajaga that, if she wishes to be present for the remainder of the debate, I suggest she heeds the admonitions of the chair to observe standing orders.",82
132,Mrs MOYLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In hostels now we have an accommodation bond scheme which was introduced by Labor in 1988. It has worked very well. We have modem, appropriate facilities that we can be proud to put our frail aged in. People can get the care they need regardless of what they paid and this will continue under the new arrangements. Care will not be based on people's means. It will be based on their need for appropriate care. The government's aged care reform package will bring significant and lasting reform to the nursing home sector in a way that will make them viable and sustainable today and into the future. It will ensure that frail older people have equitable access to high standards of and accommodation and that, as their care needs increase over time, they will not have to face the trauma of moving to another lead to facility to get appropriate care. It will introduce strong protections for is consumers and create incentives for providers invest in maintenance and improvements to building stock. It will ensure that access to care is based on care needs and not on the means to pay. These are some of the of pillars upon which this government's aged care reform package has been built. These are very solid plans that will meet the pressing needs that are evident in a situation that today in crisis not just because of the poor administration of Labor in their years of government because, frankly, they totally ignored the problem. They ignored their own reports and the best advice. They lined the shelves with reviews and reports, one after another, and never took the advice that they were given. in These are solid plans, borne of extensive consultation and responsible economic and social policy. It is a far cry from what we had from the opposition-a series of lies and distortions day after day out there in the community. It is an absolute and utter distortion. Despite the attempts of the opposition to derail the government's plan, we will move forth with confidence in the knowledge that what the government is about is delivering good quality aged care to older Australianssomething the opposition clearly had no interest in whatsoever. Yesterday was a victory for common sense and for sensible consultation between ourselves and others in this place. (Time expired)",82
133,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Before I call the next speaker, I say to those members on my right who are not in their seats that intervention in the debate is totally out of order.",83
134,Mr MCCLELLAND,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Barton) (3.35 p.m.)I was taking notes of the address of the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan). I was looking for some reasoning which I could consider as to why ill and frail senior citizens who need nursing home care would not have to sell their homes, but no such reasoning came forth. In the course of my contribution, I will invite the next speaker to indicate to me where I am wrong and how they can say that, in reality, those who need nursing home care will not have to sell their homes. The minister said in her closing comments that the government's system was economically responsible. It may be in the sense that it introduces a concept of user pays. The corollary of that is those who can pay get to use good quality care; those who cannot pay do not get to use good quality care. The frail, incapacitated and demented are being hit with the bill. It is effectively a death tax only those senior citizens. The ones who are fortunate enough to spend their concluding years in their own home will not have their assets eroded for the profits of the nursing homes. The size of the bond is nowhere to be found in the bill. In the course of earlier debates, some on the other side have indicated that size will be determined by market forces-a market which is distorted totally in favour of the nursing home owners. Demand far outstrips supply of nursing home beds. To cast frail, aged and incapacitated senior citizens into that distorted market and say that they have to cop market prices is harsh in the extreme and absolutely outrageous. Mrs Draper-Tell us what you did in your 13 years.",83
135,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I will tell the member for Makin what I am going to do unless she is orderly.,83
136,Mr MCCLELLAND,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In terms of the necessity to sell homes, one simply has to look at the facts. The service providers can charge $2,600 a year from the bond. In addition, they get to retain the totality of the profits that they earn from the deposit of the bond. That is in clause 57(18) of the bill. There is no obligation to account for it for nursing home care; it is simply profiteering. Whom are they going to let in their doors? Are they going to let in those people for whom they do not get the $2,600 draw-down, for whom they do not get to earn the profit on their interest? No, they will not. So the less privileged simply will not get in the door. There is a complete difference between hostels and nursing homes. If anyone wants to look at the difference, all they have got to do is look at clause 5 of the Approval of Care Recipients Principles 1997. Eligibility is defined here as being for those people having a condition of frailty or disability requiring at least a low level of continued personal care and who are incapable of living in the community without support. So, on the government's own information, that is the difference between nursing homes and hostels. These on people are forced into nursing homes. They do not have a choice, as they do with hostels. The undisputed evidence, as I have said, is that demand far exceeds the supply of beds. Walking into that distorted market, the patient goes and sits down in front of the nursing home provider-assuming they are capable of entering the office; otherwise they are literally assisted in or, indeed, could be lying incapacitated in a bed. Members on the other side laugh and smile and say we are being dramatic, but 60 per cent of people go into nursing homes after illnesses such as a stroke and so forth. It is not being overly dramatic at all. They go and sit down and ask, 'What do I have to pay?' Under this bill, the nursing home provider says, 'You have got to pay everything except $22,000.' There is no limit prescribed in this bill. If the government were fair dinkum, they would say, 'All right, we are giving nursing homes the ability to charge $2,600 a year; over five years it comes to $13,000. We are imposing a bond of up to $13,000 to let the nursing homes draw down.' But in fact they are not prescribing any ceiling. The nursing homes can go to town and they can profiteer on the bond. There is a theoretical option that this minister has given those who need care not to pay the bond up-front. They have got to pay $2,600 a year and they have got to pay interest on the bond money, and that interest is going to be at the Treasury yield, which is defined in the Income Tax Assessment Act and is currently 9.8 per cent. So, if the bond is $50,000, that is roughly $5,000 in addition to the $2,600. And, of course, they have to meet their daily nursing home fees. It is simply going to be an impossibility. That person is going to have, in reality, one of two options: they sell their home, or, alternatively, they try to rent out their home. If they want to rent out their home, they have to make not only the $2,600, not only the $5,000; they also have to fund their minimum $147 weekly fee. So you are looking at something like $293 per week that they would have to rent their home for to get the funds to pay for a nursing home bed. They would either have to own a lavish home or be independently wealthy. Very few Australians are going to be in that category. In addition, any rental income that they earned would come off their pension, reducing the funds that they had available for that weekly fee. So the practical reality, whether or not the minister likes to say there is a theoretical position, is that, either way, they will sell their home. I would like to hear speakers on the other side tell us where we are wrong, but that is the practical reality. If there is any other evidence required, one simply has to look at the bill. The assets for the purpose of assessing the means to pay the entry bond include the home. Of course it is meant to be included. The reality is that, once it is included, it has got to be sold unless they are independently wealthy, and that is generally not the case. The shadow minister indicated the statistics for that situation. A pensioner couple is better off, yes, in the sense that the home is not taken into account for the purpose of calculating their assets. However, they still have to find, independent of their home, sufficient funds to pay the nursing home entry fee. The best that is going to be is about $26,000, but the reality, in evidence given to a recent Senate inquiry, is that the market fee is going to be in the vicinity of $80,000-odd. But, assuming it is somewhere in between and they have not got it, what are they going to do? They have either got to shop around for one of the 27 per cent of beds left open for people who cannot afford the nursing home fee, or they have to sell their home. In terms of the practical options available, people will have to sell their homes. That is the reality. I would welcome anyone on the other side telling me convincingly that the practical reality, as opposed to the theory, is different, but that is the reality. The tragedy of all this is that we are returning to the days of those who can afford to pay, those who can afford to buy the best are going to get the best, those who are disadvantaged in terms of aged care are going to suffer. That is the unfortunate reality. The government has distorted what has been a tradition where our senior citizens have been entitled to care on the basis of their needs, not on the basis of their means. That is really a tragedy. It is something for which the government will be held to account for a long while to come. (Time expired)",83
137,Mrs VALE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This must be one of the most difficult days for the opposition. It seems to me that the previous have to member, the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland), has not been in any nursing homes and come face to face with the problem. The government has introduced legislation putting in place its vision for aged care. It is a vision that includes a practical response to address current shortcomings and an ambitious and far-reaching restructuring to provide a sustainable response to the future demands and expectations of an ever increasing proportion of older Australians. The parameters are based on what providers and consumers told us were needed. AlI facets of the detailed operational arrangements have been developed in consultation with consumer and industry bodies. How do the opposition respond? They can bleat and carp about particular operational details in isolation in the hope that something they say will scare somebody-an elderly person contemplating entry into a residential care facility, or their family. And we have had plenty of that today. Alternatively, the tion can parade their own record of achievement in contrast. Do not forget: their record goes back over 13 years. Let us look at that record. There have been some achievements. A decade ago, in 1986, the opposition introduced legislative reforms to address a number of problems that were manifest at that time, and they tinkered away industriously at the edges until March 1996. In the face of an ageing population, increasing demand and rapidly rising costs, they introduced planning controls with benchmark service provision targets to constrain nursing home growth and to expand the provision of hostel places. They restructured the funding system in hostels and nursing homes. The CAM-SAM funding system and resident classification were introduced to nursing homes to provide more flexibility and a better targeting of funds to higher care needs. The three-level personal care funding system was introduced in hostels to fund high level personal care for an increasingly dependent hostel client group. They introduced outcome standards and user rights arrangements for residential care. Of course, they also introduced accommodation bonds in hostels to provide capital funds and an incentive for providers to invest in upgrading facilities in that sector. These were alI good initiatives that were acknowledged at the time by consumers and providers. But why did they stop there? Did they think that that was good enough for 13 years, or did they simply run out of steam? I want to say that they did not go far enough in meeting the reasonable expectations of vulnerable older Australians to be treated with dignity and respect and to enjoy a standard of accommodation not too different from the level they had lived throughout their lives. I want to say something about the things that older people in my electorate of Hughes are saying are unfair about the present system and which need to be fixed, and fixed now. I want to say some of the things that service providers are saying are inefficient and divert them from providing care for no sensible reason. This will not be news to the opposition. opposiThey commissioned a number of reports and surveys that speIled out these problems in considerable detail and which even offered solutions. Professor Gregory's review of the structure of nursing home funding arrangements, stages 1 and 2; the mid-term review of the aged care reform strategy; the national action plan for dementia care; and Professor Braithwaite's work on outcome standards and monitoring arrangements-these are just a few that should have been ringing beIls. Their messages were loud and clear: there is not enough funding for dementia, there are not enough places for the elderly where they will get a decent standard of care and accommodation, and care providers are doing the best they can but they are going broke doing it. The opposition's problem is that they did not listen; if they did listen, they chose not to act. They sat on their hands while these reports gathered dust. Professor Gregory, in his 1994 report, documented major deficiencies in nursing home capital works and criticised the nursing home funding system for providing neither the funding nor the incentive for providers to maintain their buildings. He reported that 11 per cent of nursing homes did not meet fire standards and that 15 per cent did not meet health regulations. Forty per cent of residents have to share a room of more than four beds. Do the opposition know what it means for the privacy and the dignity of vulnerable elderly people to have bed next to bed, sometimes with less than one metre between them, sometimes with ambulant dementia sufferers wandering through the wards at all hours of the night? It is something out of Dickens, and it is something that they chose to ignore. No, it was worse than that: their response was to actually reduce capital funding for nursing homes in the face of such revelations. Unfortunately, the system's deficiencies are not limited to the parlous state of its buildings. There is an increasing overlap between the higher level dependence hostel residents and the lower level nursing homes residents. Data shows that the care needs of 22 per cent of high personal care residents in hostels are now equivalent to those nursing home residents in the mid range nursing home category. Yet nursing home residents get an average Commonwealth subsidy of around $29,000 a year, while hostel residents, with equivalent or even higher personal care needs, get a subsidy of around $10,000 a year. Just ask any hostel provider how far hostel funding goes in enabling them to meet the care needs of people with dementia. But then, they are the people who believe in social justice, in giving people a fair go. What has gone wrong in aged care? Under Labor's charging system, a millionaire nursing home resident and any other nursing home resident pays a fixed flat fee of $26.40. Yet a hostel resident, who may get less care, can be asked to pay very high fees. Again I ask: where is the social justice? Labor rail in horror at the prospect of people, often with substantial assets, being asked to contribute to the cost of their nursing home accommodation. Yet this has been the arrangement for 10 years now in hostels. It is the arrangement that they introduced. It is the mechanism that has enabled hostel residents to enjoy a much higher standard of accommodation with single rooms generally the norm, while nursing home residents must make do with the squalid conditions documented by Professor Gregory. The human consequence of the rigid and quite artificial funding boundaries between nursing homes and hostels is that hostel residents have to move only because their aged care needs change. Having already moved once from the security of their home, they must leave their new friends and the hostel which has become their new home and find a nursing home to get the care they need. The disruption is all the worse when the people affected have dementia. The change undermines the stability, which is an important consideration in their care plan. Providers do not understand the logic behind this structurally flawed system, and it is incomprehensible for the aged care residents. This is a major piece of legislation which will bring significant structural reform to aged care in a way which makes it viable and sustainable well into the future. It will ensure that frail older folk have equitable access to high quality standards of care and accommodation and that, as their care needs increase over time, they will not have to face the trauma of moving to another facility to get appropriate care. The legislation introduces strong protections for consumers and it means that people who can afford to pay towards the cost of their care and accommodation will do so while at the same time securing equal rights of entry to residential aged care for those who cannot afford to pay. The legislation, therefore, introduces a unified residential aged care system. Having a single residential aged care system creates flexibility for providers to meet the full range of care needs if they choose to do so. This means that couples in residential care will not have to be parted when the care needs of one partner change. This is very important to the level of security in our aged population. There is a further category of residents to be known as assisted residents who have assets to pay a small bond but who cannot afford the full amount. They too will be assisted by a small additional subsidy. Assisted residents will count as part of the concessional resident ratio. For residents who leave a spouse, close family member or a long-term carer in the family home, that home will be exempt from consideration as an asset for an accommodation bond payment. There are very real protections in this legislation for people on low incomes. Access to aged care will be placed on need not ability to pay. This is a fundamental premise and it is protected in a number of ways. Aged care assessment teams will continue to permit entry to care only on the basis of need. Those who cannot afford to contribute more than the base fee will not. This means that full pensioners will pay only the base fee and no income tested charge. The people who cannot afford accommodation bond will not be asked to pay one. This legislation is about protection. It is about the protection of our respected and valued elder citizens. It is essential that our elder citizens and their families have confidence in our aged care system. This is important for their peace of mind and the security that they deserve to enjoy. Our government is fully mindful of this and protections are interspersed throughout the whole document. Our older folk can be confident that this legislation delivers to them the security, the dignity and the peace of mind that they so rightly deserve in the twilight of their years. They have waited long enough and they have looked to this Liberal government to offer them the care, the comfort and the respect that they have earned. This Liberal government has delivered.

I can advise the House that Removals Australia, a division of my department, contracts with a large number of removalists across Australia, including Atlantis. Removals Australia has contracted Atlantis to perform various removal functions on behalf of other government agencies in recent times. Following various recent complaints, I am advised that Atlantis has been asked by Removals Australia to confirm that they are abiding by their legal award obligations in accordance with the requirements of their contracts.

Ordered that the report be printed. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.4) 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Ruddock, and read a first time. Second Reading",87
140,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRA TION LEGIS LA TION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill implements a number of the government's important policy initiatives within the immigration and multicultural affairs portfolio, particularly in relation to merits and judicial review. The measures contained within the bill are consistent both with the government's commitments to improve the immigration decision-making system and the government's commitment to restrict access to the courts in migration matters to all but exceptional circumstances. On entering government in March 1996, the coalition inherited a migration program that was seriously out of balance. The family stream had grown by 27 per cent in 1995-96 and had come to represent almost 70 per cent of the migration program. The spouse category had grown by 32 per cent and the number of parents had increased by 74 per cent in that year alone. This imbalance also extended to the number of people accessing our merits review system and engaging in subsequent litigation. For example, in 1995-96 there were 599 applications to the Federal and High courts-an increase of over 200 applications from the previous financial year. I understand that this year's numbers are over the 700 mark. Such a situation carries with it an increased burden on the Australian taxpayer and also raises the issue of credibility with the Australian public. This situation required a determined approach to restore the credibility of our migration program. Over the past year, the government has begun this process and we have already pursued a series of measures to regain control of the system and to ensure greater integrity within it. The government has taken steps to ensure that there is a real reduction in the abuse of migration based on fabricated or non-bona fide relationships, especially in relation to spouse and fiancee applicants. These measures include the extension of the two-year probationary period for onshore spouse applicants to offshore spouse applicants, limiting serial sponsorships, more rigorous assessment procedures and requiring a one-year cohabitation period for de facto and interdependency relationships. Other measures introduced to restore the balance to the program include: the ability to cap the number of aged parents able to enter Australia in anyone year and an increased emphasis placed on English language for concessional family members wishing to enter Australia from I July this year. The proposals in the bill currently before the House continue the process of restoring community credibility in the management of immigration matters. On 20 March this year, I announced a range of significant changes the government would make to refugee and immigration decision making and review systems. These changes will improve efficiency, credibility and accountability of immigration decision making. The major change is the streamlining of the current two-tier review process of non-refugee visa decisions into a single review by an independent review agency. The bill gives effect to this by merging the existing internal review undertaken by the Migration Internal Review Office of my department with the external merits review carried out by the Immigration Review Tribunal. Under the changes introduced by this bill, the single-tier review will be conducted by a new external review body, the Migration Review Tribunal. Review of non-refugee decisions by the Migration Review Tribunal will commence on 1 July 1998. The Migration Review Tribunal will be required to conduct fair, impartial and expeditious review of migration decisions at lower cost to the Australian taxpayer. This will be achieved through the introduction of more streamlined and flexible review decision-making processes. The tribunal's principal member will have clear authority to apply efficient processing practices. This may include the introduction of a case management system where much of the preliminary research and investigative work would be undertaken by administrative staff of the tribunal. Tribunal members would be responsible for directing that any further investigation be undertaken and for the final decision. Migration Review Tribunal members will be independent decision makers, able to reach their own conclusions on a decision under review, in accordance with the law. However, this independence does not amount to nonaccountability. Members will be accountable, on matters of procedure, to the parliament through the principal member for ensuring that they conduct reviews fairly and expeditiously. The bill will give the Migration Review Tribunal's principal member power to make directions on the efficient conduct of reviews. These changes will set the framework for significant reductions in both the time and the costs of review of general migration visa decisions. However, I should stress that the bill will not alter the entitlements of persons to seek review of decisions by my department refusing or cancelling visas. Those persons who are currently able to seek review of particular decisions by the Migration Internal Review Office or the Immigration Review Tribunal will be able to seek review of those decisions by the Migration Review Tribunal. The principal member of the Refugee Review Tribunal will be provided with the same authority to apply efficient processing practices as those of the principal member of the Migration Review Tribunal. This includes clear authority to give directions on the operation of the Refugee Review Tribunal and the efficient conduct of reviews. The bill also includes certain safeguards for applicants by introducing a code of procedure for both the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal which is similar to that already applying to decisions made by the department. This code includes such matters as the giving of a prescribed notice of the timing for a hearing and a requirement that applicants be given access to, and time to comment on, adverse material relevant to them. In addition, the bill contains a number of measures to allow for more flexible processes in both tribunals. These include providing a discretion for tribunals to decide whether or not a personal hearing will be of assistance to the decision-making process; enabling the tribunals to use telephone or other media to conduct personal hearings or to require other witnesses to appear before them; and, allowing tribunals to proceed to a decision without delay, if an applicant does not respond to a notice to attend a hearing or provide comment. Taken together, these changes mean that people with bona fide review applications will be given a decision more quickly and a better decision if the initial decision is wrong. Those persons intent on fraud, deception or delay will not have the benefits of a delayed decision. These changes are consistent with foreshadowed government moves to introduce further reform of merits review tribunals across all portfolios by consolidating all tribunals into one new tribunal. The bill also gives legislative effect to the government's pre-election policy commitment that we would restrict access to judicial review in all but exceptional circumstances. That commitment was given in light of the extensive merits review rights in the migration area and arose from concerns about the growing cost, incidence and delays of migration litigation. To give effect to the government's commitment, this bill introduces a new judicial review scheme to cover decisions under the Migration Act relating to the ability of noncitizens to enter and remain in Australia. The key mechanism in the new scheme is the privative clause provision at new section 474. The privative clause, and the related provisions, will replace the existing judicial review scheme at part 8 of the Migration Act. Unlike the existing scheme, the new judicial review scheme will also apply to the High Court and not just the Federal Court. The need for the new judicial review scheme is clearly demonstrated by looking at the history of the existing scheme, how it is operating today and what would happen in the future if it were left untouched. The current judicial review scheme for visa decisions was introduced by the previous government on 1 September 1994. It was part of a package of changes, including expanded access to merits review, a requirement that any review rights must be exhausted prior to seeking judicial review, statutory codes of procedure for visa decision making and some restriction of the grounds of judicial review in light of the access to merits review and statutory codes for visa decision making. The former government intended those changes to reduce Federal Court litigation and to provide greater certainty as to what was required from both decision makers, visa applicants and visa holders. Unfortunately, that scheme has not reduced the volume of cases before the courts. As I have previously stated, recourse to the Federal Court and the High Court is trending upwards, with nearly 400 applications in 1994-95, nearly 600 in 1995-96 and over 700 so far in 1996-97. It is anticipated that applications made to the courts could rise to around 850 in 1997-98. This is based upon current litigation trends and the estimated output of the Immigration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal. In 1995-96, migration legislation matters formed approximately 65 per cent of the Federal Court's entire administrative law caseload. This is a caseload out of all proportion to the number of decisions being made and as compared to other important areas of administrati ve decision making such as veterans entitlements and social security entitlements. This trend is despite full and open access by applicants to heavily subsidised independent merits review by the Immigration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal. From experience we know that a substantial proportion of these cases will be withdrawn by the applicants prior to hearing. In fact, at present this figure is around 47 per cent. Of the cases that go on to substantive court hearings, the government currently wins around 90 per cent. The government is concerned about the financial burden that such levels of litigation place on the public purse. In this financial year to date, all litigation cost my department $6.7 million, and this figure does not include the cost of legal aid nor the cost of running the courts. This high level of litigation, particularly by twice refused asylum claimants, cannot remain unchecked. Increased litigation leads to increased costs and delays and, for those in detention, to a significantly longer period of detention. It is hard not to conclude that there is a substantial number who are using the legal process primarily in order to extend their stay in Australia, especially given that just less than half of all applicants withdraw from legal proceedings before hearing. In the migration area litigation can be an end in itself. Given the importance attached to permanent residence in Australia, there is a high incentive for refused applicants to delay removal from Australia for as long as possible. This may be done to give time for them to establish ties within the community which they may hope will yield entitlement to a visa through another pathway. The incentive to delay removal from Australia is increased if the refused applicants are enjoying privileges such as work rights and access to Medicare. Faced with the problem I have outlined, I asked my department to explore options for best achieving the government's policy objective of restricting access to judicial review. This was done in conjunction with the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and eminent legal counsel. The advice I received from legal counsel was that the only workable option was a privative clause. As members are aware, section 75 of the Commonwealth constitution gives the High Court original jurisdiction to consider challenges to the actions and decisions of Commonwealth officers. As a result, access to the High Court cannot be legislatively restricted without a constitutional amendment. However, access to the Federal Court, and the scope of judicial review it can exercise, can be changed by legislation. To simply restrict access to the Federal Court in migration legislation matters would, in practice, deflect many cases to the High Court under section 75 of the constitution. This has the potential to erode the proper role and purpose of the High Court. Legal counsels' advice was that a privative clause would have the effect of narrowing the scope of judicial review by the High Court and, of course, the Federal Court. That advice was largely based on the High Court's own interpretation of such clauses in cases such as Hickman's case as long ago as 1945, and more recently in the Richard Walter case in 1995. Some members of the High Court confirmed the interpretation of what is often called the Hickman principle in the Darling Casino case in April this year. Members may be aware that the effect of a privative clause such as that used in Hickman's case is to expand the legal validity of the acts done and the decisions made by decision-makers. The result is to give decision-makers wider lawful operation for their decisions. This means that the grounds on which those decisions can be challenged in the Federal and High Courts are narrower than currently. In practice, the decision is lawful provided the decision-maker is acting in good faith, had been given the authority to make the decision concerned-for example, had the authority delegated to him or her by me or had been properly appointed as a tribunal member-and did not exceed constitutional limits. The options available to the government were very much shaped by the constitution. While I accept that the precise limits of privative clauses may need examination by the High Court, there is no other practical option open to the government to achieve its policy objective. To complement the introduction of the privative clause, this bill introduces a number of important technical measures such as time limits in which to apply and who can apply for review, as well as the type of decision affected by the new scheme. These measures are designed to ensure certainty and efficiency in resolving outstanding issues. Although the measures in this bill will limit judicial review, applicants who consider that they have received a decision from the department which is wrong will, of course, still have access to independent merits review by the Immigration Review Tribunal, its successor, the Migration Review Tribunal, and the Refugee Review Tribunal. The fairness of these bodies' determinations will be enhanced by the codes of procedure set out in this bill. The bill includes a number of other changes. These relate to measures to enhance the visa cancellation powers, including the power to ensure that there is more effective cancellation of visas which were granted on the basis of incorrect information-for example, where a previous visa was granted on the basis of incorrect information, and the tightening of certain notice provisions which are integral to the visa cancellation process. One further measure which is consistent with other proposals in this bill to improve flexibility in migration processes is the introduction of a waiver of the condition which is placed on certain visas to prevent the visa holder from being granted a further visa. In relation to citizenship, legislative changes to implement strengthened deprivation provisions came into effect earlier this year. However, these changes meant that the penalty provisions in the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 were not in line with general Commonwealth policy. The proposed amendments rectify this anomaly. Finally, I would like to emphasise the fact that this bill is part of a continuing process adopted by this government to ensure that the integrity of the migration program is not undermined as well as the strengthening of those controls over who can be granted, or continue to hold, Australian visas. This government will be introducing further legislation in this area later this year. I commend the bill to the House and I table an explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Bevis) adjourned. SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' NA AMENDMENT (FAMILY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Ruddock, and read a first time. Second Reading",87
141,Mr RUDDOCK,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Mr Deputy Speaker, this bill gives effect to a number of measures announced in the government's 1997-98 budget, a measure announced in the 1996-97 budget, the introduction of a maternity immunisation allowance that forms part of the government's strategy to improve the rate of child immunisation in Australia and to a number of nonbudget measures that will assist in more effective and efficient social security administration. Under current arrangements, family payment above the minimum rate can be paid for up to 13 weeks when one or both parents go overseas temporarily, providing the child stays in Australia. However, if the child goes overseas, family payment above the minimum rate is not paid and families currently receive only the minimum rate of family payment. This can cause the family financial stress. One of the measures announced in the 1997-98 budget provided for the Social Security Act 1991 to be amended to allow above the minimum rate family payment to be paid for up to eight weeks when either the parent or child, or both, go overseas temporarily. The bill provides for this, effective from 1 January 1998. Mr Deputy Speaker, another 1997-98 budget measure included in this bill will allow the better targeting of family payment and maternity allowance to those in need. The bill provides that, from 1 January 1998, the hardship provisions that apply for family related payments will be amended so that families with an assets value between $406,000 and $602,500 will qualify for minimum family payment only if their family income is at or below the point at which income reduces family payment to the minimum rate, currently $27,125 plus $4,399 for each child after the first child. As qualification for maternity allowance is based on qualification for family payment, those families who do not receive family payment because of this initiative will also not qualify for maternity allowance. The third 1997-98 budget measure to be implemented by this bill provides for amendments to be made to social security and veterans' affairs legislation so as to remove the entitlement to rent assistance, from 1 January 1998, of persons who live in public housing but do not pay rent directly to the public housing authority (other than those who live in public housing where market rent is being charged). The bill also provides for the implementation, from 1 January 1998, of a 1996-97 budget measure that will extend the range of employer provided benefits currently taken into account in the income test for family payment, maternity allowance and child-care assistance. This extension will cover employer provided benefits received by an employee in the form of financial investments, including units in cash management trusts, as well as reimbursements to an employee for expenses incurred for his or her private use. Mr Deputy Speaker, Australia currently has an immunisation rate of 53 per cent according to the recommended schedule for children of nought to six years. This is not good enough. We need to implement a strategy that will lift immunisation rates to an acceptable level. As part of that strategy, this bill provides for the introduction of a maternity immunisation allowance. The maternity immunisation allowance will be payable in respect of children born on or after 1 January 1998 and who, having reached 18 months of age, have received age-appropriate immunisation up to that stage, unless the child is otherwise exempted from the requirement. The maternity immunisation allowance of $200 will be payable in addition to a maternity allowance of $750 that will be payable following the birth of such a child. The maternity immunisation allowance will also be paid in addition to the maternity allowance in respect of stillborn children or children who die before reaching 18 months of age. A maternity allowance, currently $870.30, will continue to be payable following the birth of a child who is born on or after 1 February 1996 but before 1 January 1998. A number of non-budget measures included in the bill will impact on family related payments. These are aimed at ensuring more equitable and efficient delivery of services to families. Mr Deputy Speaker, a number of other non-budget measures included in the bill deal with disability related payments. Two such measures provide for the introduction of revised impairment tables for disability support pension and the subsuming of disability wage supplement into disability support pension. The assessment processes for disability support pension will be tightened to ensure that those people whose impairments have only a relatively small impact on their overall inability to work will not qualify for that pension. Rather, they will receive a more appropriate income support payment. To assist in this process, revised impairment tables, which are used to assess whether a person's impairment is 20 points or more, are being introduced. These revised impairment tables are a refinement of amendments that were previously proposed in the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996 and take account of submissions received from 38 peak disability and welfare groups. The major changes between the revised tables as proposed in 1996 and those included in the bill are the reintroduction of some minor impairment scores and the clarification of issues such as 'enforced' treatment, 'double assessing', assessing fatigue and investigations to be undertaken by medical officers. Mr Deputy Speaker, disability wage supplement was established in June 1994 as a separate payment for people with disabilities participating in the supported wage system, a productivity wage based system administered by the Department of Health and Family Services. Currently, people in receipt of disability support pension who commence employment through the supported wage system are required to transfer to disability wage supplement, even though the qualification criteria for the two payments are very similar. Many customers have expressed a reluctance to make this transfer and a preference to continue to receive disability support pension. The take-up of disability wage supplement has been very slow, with less than 300 customers in receipt of this payment two years after its inception. The bilI provides for disability wage ment to be subsumed into disability support pension from 1 January 1998. All existing disability wage supplement customers will be transferred to disability support pension and the disability support pension provisions amended so that participation in the supported wage system will be an alternative qualification criterion to a person having a continuing inability to work because of an impairment. Mr Deputy Speaker, another non-budget measure included in the bill provides for amendments to be made to the Social Security Act so as to provide for a new method of determining the value of a payment received by a customer in a foreign currency. The existing method set out in the Social Security Act for the conversion of foreign currency for income test purposes has not been used because of system limitations. The new method proposed in the bill extends the conversion of foreign currency to all social security payments, not just social security pensions, and to all foreign currencies. There will also be a requirement to apply an appropriate exchange rate from the first social security pension payday each month. Mr Deputy Speaker, two recent Federal Court decisions have considered legal questions concerning entitlement to rent assistance where entry contributions are paid to retirement villages. In the unreported decision of Department of Social Security v. Knight, it was held that regular instalments paid by Mrs Knight as part of her entry contribution to a retirement vilIage were rent. Accordingly, Mrs Knight was entitled to rent assistance in respect of those payments. It was never intended that any amount that could be regarded as all or part of an entry contribution, however payable, was rent. Accordingly, it is proposed to amend the Social Security Act to clarify the original intention. In another unreported decision, Secretary, Department of Social Security v. Montgomery, it was held that notional annual deductions from the refundable portion of an entry contribution were not rent. Although this decision accords with the intention of the legislation, the bilI amends the Social Security Act so as to establish beyond doubt that such supple- notional deductions are not rent. Mr Deputy Speaker, the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Act 1996 implemented amendments to the Social Security Act and the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973, from 20 March 1997, that allow the backdating, through the deemed earlier lodgement of a claim, in circumstances where the person makes a telephone inquiry about claiming payment and then formally lodges a claim and qualifies for disability support pension, sickness allowance, newstart allowance or youth training aIlowance. This bilI builds on those measures so as to extend the telephone lodgement provisions to carer payment, partner allowance and parenting allowance. The bill also extends the ambit of these provisions to include contact by facsimile and computer. This 'extension' will apply not only for carer payment, partner allowance and parenting allowance but also to the payment types to which the telephone lodgement provisions originally applied. Lastly, Mr Deputy Speaker, the bilI amends the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990 so as to include the family tax initiative in the data-matching program. Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Stephen Smith) adjourned. NA BILL (No.2) 1997 First Reading  first time. Second Reading  Small Business and Consumer Affairs) (4.27 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997, which is now before the House, contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. Most of the amendments have already been introduced in this House as customs tariff proposals. I will briefly the changes of substance. The amendments contained in schedule 2 of this bill abolish the Canadian margin of preference on certain petrochemical products of chapter 39 of the customs tariff. These changes took effect from I January 1997. Concerns have been expressed for some time regarding the overall balance of benefits under the Canada-Australia Trade Agreement, CANATA. CANATA provides for the exchange of tariff preferences on a range of products traded between the two countries. Most significantly, in 1995 Canada proposed the extension to several of its developing country trading partners preferential tariff treatment for raw sugar which would have been equivalent to that enjoyed by Australia under CANAT A. Because of the significance of sugar in our overall exports to Canada, accounting for 20 per cent in 1995, such a decision would have had the impact of substantially eroding the overall value of CANATA preferences to Australia and shifting the balance of benefits under the agreement decisively in favour of Canada. In addition, elements of the Australian manufacturing community have also registered some concern at the benefits accruing to Canadian exporters under CANAT A. Following consideration of these and other related issues, the Minister for Trade (Mr Fischer) advised the Canadian Minister for International Trade in 1995 of Australia's intention to remove CANAT A preferential rates of duty from Canadian imports of certain petrochemical products, specifically polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride and polyvinyl esters. Following a review of the situation by the incoming government and action by Canada to extend preferences on raw sugar, the Minister for Trade and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) decided to implement the withdrawal of the preferences on these petrochemical products. Trade in these products is currently at relatively low levels, amounting to only $1.6 million in 1995-96. Moreover, the phase-in general rate of duty on 1 July 1996 to five per cent has meant that the possible impact on outline downstream users will be minimised. Schedule 3 of this bill accords developing country preferences, under the Australian system of tariff preferences (ASTP), to imports from the territories administered by the Palestinian authority. This action was operative from IO March 1997. Honourable members will be aware of the Middle East peace process started in Madrid in October 1991 and the Oslo declaration of principles whereby Israel is transferring to the Palestinian council powers and responsibilities for certain areas formerly administered by the Israeli military government. The Australian government fully supports the peace process and the implementation of these agreements. The extension of ASTP concessions to the Palestinian territories will assist their economy to transform itself to an exporter of products made in newly established industrial enterprises. It will also enhance bilateral trade with Australia. Schedule 4 of this bill will operate from 1 July 1997. It contains amendments which will abolish customs duty on imported sugar and certain sugar by-products and implements Australia's tariff obligations under the Information Technology Agreement (ITA). In respect of the changes of duty on sugar, on 4 March this year my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Hon. John Anderson MP, announced that the recommendations of the joint industry and government sugar industry review working party had been accepted by the Com-onÂ­ wealth government. These recommendatIOns provide an integral package of reforms designed to promote a sustainable and internationally competitive sugar industry and provide for the removal of the customs rate of duty of $55 per tonne from sugar and certain sugar by-products. The recommendations have also been endorsed by the Queensland government and have the unanimous support of industry leaders on the working party. The recommendations in regard to customs tariff rates of duty are implemented in this schedule. In respect of the ITA, in Singapore, on 13 December 1996, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. Tim Fischer MP, signed on behalf of Australia the Ministerial Declaration on Trade in Information Technology Productsthe Information Technology Agreement. ITA represents a package of sectoral liberalisation which, in combination with the agreement on basic telecommunications, establishes the trading framework which will underpin the continuing rapid growth of global information and communications infrastructure. The agreement seeks the elimination of tariffs on technology and telecommunications products by the year 2000. When negotiations were completed on 26 March this year, the ITA had 41 member countries including our major APEC trading partners, the European Union, other European countries and India. The signatories account for 92 per cent of the $750 billion in. - orld trade in these products. Each partiCIpant agreed to undertake the necessary domestic procedures to meet their commitments for the ITA to come into force on I July 1997. During the negotiations, Australia made clear its requirements for an acceptable and balanced package of liberalisation being achieved and for the participation by a core of our regional trading partners. We ensured that the emerging Asian markets participated in the agreement and that their participation was on a similar basis to that of Australia. Australia stands to gain substantially from the ITA. The agreement will provide Australian industry with increased export opportunities to help redress the $6.9 billion trade deficit in this sector. Australia could not have secured the market liberalisation achieved under the ITA through direct bilateral negotiations. Working through APEC and the WTO allowed Australia, in coalition with other major economies, to bring our key regional trading partners to the ITA negotiating table. Schedule 4 of this bill also contains amendments to reinstate the intended tariff assistance on surgical drapes and clarify our international tariff obligations in regard to certain types of lamps and power supply units for computers. The remainder of the amendments in schedules I and 5 are of an administrative nature. In the main they close up national sevenand eight-digit tariff splits which were created in the 1980s to apply different rates of duty to certain textile goods. As the tariff phase in regime means the rates of duty will be the same from 1 July 1998, this opportunity has been taken to close up the tariff subheadings, where possible. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Stephen Smith) adjourned. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders",91
142,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,SUGAR TARIFF,"I move: That, in light of: (I) the government's election commitment not to reduce the sugar tariff, it having promised it would not reduce the sugar tariff beyond the present level of $55 per tonne as Australia had already met its obligations under the World Trade Organisation agreement; (2) the fact that Australia's Uruguay Round obligation for sugar is a tariff of $70 per tonne by the year 2000, and Australia's current tariff at $55 per tonne is comfortably within that obligation; (3) the fact that many of our export destinations have sugar tariffs massively higher than us, which suggests that there is no reason for Australia to go it alone on the sugar tariff; and (4) despite the above, the government's decision to abolish the sugar tariff effective from 1 July 1997so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997 being called on forthwith so that members will have an opportunity to debate and vote on the proposals contained in the bill to abolish customs duty from sugar and sugar by-products effective from 1 July 1997.

147,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Mr Jenkins)Order! To make the honourable member for Paterson very happy, while the tellers are counting this division I would indicate to honourable members that there is an expectation about dress standards. Honourable members should take all reasonable steps to ensure that when coming into divisions they are not caught short. I am sure that honourable members who have come into the chamber not dressed to the proper standards will leave the chamber immediately after the division and ensure that they take appropriate measures in the future so that this does not occur again. Mr Bob Baldwin-I rise on a point of order. I am not sure that the honourable member for Hunter heard you, dressed as he IS.",98
148,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I am sure that all members heard the ruling. Question resolved in the negative. Mr Stephen Smith-I rise on a point of order. We have just had a series of divisions. In the first division, the honourable member for Dawson was clearly disorderly in her conduct. She was in breach of a combination of standing orders Nos 201 and 202. She Nugent, P. E. failed and refused to comply with your request to take her seat, and I am asking, by way of a point of order, what action, if any, you are proposing to take against the honourable member for Dawson for her disorderly conduct.",98
149,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I thank the honourable member for Perth for his point of order. He is correct in the way he has described the events but, on this occasion, I decided to show a degree of tolerance from the chair to the actions of the honourable member of Dawson. I would hope that this was not seen as a precedent. Honourable members should understand that, at the locking of the doors, they are to take their places to indicate which way they are voting and, once they take those places, they should, under no circumstances, move from those places until the division is counted. Mr Stephen Smith-Further to the point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am cognisant of your comment that you viewed this matter with some tolerance but, where disorderly conduct is concerned, it seems to me that the least that should occur is that this matter be drawn to the attention of the Speaker. On other occasions, when there has been disorderly conduct, in the Main Committee, for example, that has been referred to the Speaker. On this occasion, the clearly disorderly conduct has occurred on the floor of this chamber. The very least that ought to occur, with respect, is to refer the matter to the Speaker.",99
150,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"If it will satisfy the honourable member for Perth, I am quite happy to refer the incident to the Speaker. I expect that he will report back to the honourable member for Perth about the incident as he chooses. Mr Lee-I rise on a point of order. Naturally, I accept your previous ruling on er or not there was a shortened count during that previous division. When this matter was raised when the honourable member for Lyne was in the chair, he did agree to refer this matter to the Speaker for report back to the House. Given the fact that there does seem to be some confusion about what the rules will be in circumstances such as those which occurred in the House recently, I would be grateful if you would agree to have this matter also referred to the Speaker and the standing order clarified.",99
151,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I am not sure what the honourable member for Lyne said, but I accept that, if he said he was going to refer it to the Speaker, it seems that I have a long agenda for the Speaker today. But I believe that the actions that were taken during the division suit the purposes of the House. I believe that they are fair to both sides of the chamber, that there is no advantage to either side, that it has suited the convenience of the House through a number of parliaments for the chairs to rule, frequently, but not always-as I think the Speaker has said-that the bells be rung for one minute. Having ruled that way, I think that, given the spirit of the sessional orders recently instituted, it would then be counted under the new system. Mr Lee- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the only reason I have raised this on several occasions is that, on the one occasion when the Speaker was in the chair, he called for the normal count for the division rather than the shortened version. So on the one occasion when the Speaker has been in the chair, he has ruled in my favour rather than in the way you have. I think we would all be grateful if the Speaker could clarify the matter.",99
152,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I understand the honourable member for Dobell' s interest in this matter. I also acknowledge that the Speaker, after conducting the divisions in that manner-as the honourable member for Dobell has suggested that he would like them to be conducted-came back into the chamber and made the statement that I have referred to. Mr Nehl- Mr Deputy Speaker, relating to wheth- the point of order from the member for Dobell, I understand his concern and agitation but I put to you that your ruling was absolutely right and it was consistent with what the Speaker has done. I know the honourable member for Dobell is very keen to have the right thing done, but I assure you and him that you did do the right thing. There was absolutely no need to refer it to the Speaker. It was a subsequent motion and no debate intervened. The convention is, even if the mover of the motion started to speak before he actually said 'I second the motion', that would have been out of order because the motion had not been seconded. Therefore, there would have been no intervening debate. Even though the convention is that there can be a very short statement after the motion has been seconded, on this occasion there was no intervening debate because the minister moved to the dispatch box and moved immediately after the member had seconded the motion that he be not further heard",99
153,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I am not sure that there was a point of order there. I thank the honourable member for his endorsement. EXCISE TARIFF (FUEL RATES AMENDMENTS) BILL 1997 First Reading  first time. Second Reading  Small Business and Consumer Affairs) (5.02 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is the first of seven in the legislation package designed to give effect to the government's announcement in the 1997-98 budget that it would be cracking down on fuel substitution. It has been a long standing and well accepted policy of successive governments that where excise is imposed on petroleum products, differential rates of duty are applied on the basis of the intended end use of the product. The highest rate of customs and excise duty is imposed on fuels such as gasoline and automotive diesel oil for on-road transport use. For example, unleaded gasoline and automotive diesel oil are subject to duty at the current rate of 34.697 cents per litre. Burner fuels such as fuel oils, heating oils and kerosene, attract a concessional excise duty rate which is currently 7.200 cents per litre. Petroleum products for non-fuel use purposes, such as solvents, do not attract excise duty. The specifications for some concessional and zero-rated petroleum products, such as solvents, may be very similar to those for onroad fuels, particularly automotive diesel oil. Accordingly, substitution of lower duty products for on-road uses is attractive to unscrupulous operators. For example, if product declared as a solvent at the terminal gate of a major oil company is subsequently blended with automotive diesel oil by a party in the retail distribution system, the windfall gain from this fraud is 34.697 cents per litre. Excise revenue from petroleum products is not insignificant in terms of its contribution to revenue and it is important that it be protected. The 1997-98 budget estimate for collection of excise on petroleum products is $10,840 million, which includes a small amount of excise on crude oil. This is expected to form about 8.1 per cent of total Commonwealth revenue in this financial year. The 1997-98 budget estimated that the measures underpinned by this legislative package will lead to increased revenue of $25 million in a full year. As well as a fraud on the government and the honest taxpayer, these practices designed to avoid paying the correct excise are also a fraud on consumers and on those honest participants who form the vast majority of the petroleum products distribution and retail system who wish to compete on level terms. In many cases, use of these fuels can greatly harm engine performance and expose consumers to great danger as the blends containing substituted fuel may have a much lower flashpoint than proper diesel. The government considers these fraudulent and potentially dangerous practices designed to avoid excise revenue legislated by the parliament as simply not acceptable. The government has decided the best way to minimise these practices is to require the introduction of chemical tracers to concessional fuels before they enter home consumption. The tracer, described as a marker in the legislation, will allow Customs to monitor products in the marketplace to ensure inappropriate usage of concessional fuels does not occur. The presence of the marker will make illegal substitution simple to detect, both by Customs and by participants in the market who wish to do so. This first bill in the package, the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill, restructures the excise tariff and defines those concessional products which must have the prescribed marker added to them prior to the entry into home consumption. In the case of products produced in the refineries operated by the major oil companies, this process will occur prior to the relevant product leaving the terminal gate and entering the distribution system. An Industry-Customs Technical Implementation Group with representation from the four major oil companies and the Australian Institute of Petroleum (AlP) will make recommendations to the government on practical implementation of the new requirements, including the identity of the preferred marker or markers which will then be subject to regulation. The identity of the marker will be made known with sufficient lead time to allow ready compliance. The industry accepts that it will bear the cost of the marker and its administration to concessional products. In this context, the Technical Implementation Group will provide advice to the government on a regime which will be simple to administer and minimise compliance costs on all parties involved in fuel manufacture and distribution. Certain products which are excisable at rates below the rate for on-road fuels will not be required to be marked. These include aviation turbine fuel and aviation gasoline and all concessional fuels in packages not exceeding 210 litres, that is, drum and retail stock. The government will closely monitor the consumption of fuels with an exemption from the marking requirement to verify that abuse does not occur. The Customs Tariff (Fuel Rates Amendments) Bill in the legislative package imposes customs duty on imported product according to the intended end use at the time the product is entered into home consumption (in a parallel manner to excise). Three further bills impose a penalty surcharge on subsequent users who misuse, blend or sell the products other than in accordance with the originally intended end use as indicated by the marker. The administration bill provides for recordkeeping obligations, audit and investigation powers for Customs officers, and offences for non-compliance. As part of the implementation of the measures, Customs has engaged in extensive consultation with parties with an interest. As well as the major oil companies and the AlP, other parties involved in the consultation program include the Australian Petroleum Agents and Distributors Association, the Service Station Association, the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, the Road Transport Forum, the National Farmers Federation, state motoring organisations such as the NRMA and the RACV, numerous individual fuel recycling companies, and offices of state revenue and state consumer affairs bodies. While there has also been strong support in broad terms for the initiative amongst those consulted, the government recognises that there is significant detail in the legislative package. If substantiated and genuine concerns about the operation of the measures are apparent, the government will take these into account. In conclusion, I reiterate that the government is introducing these measures to increase compliance with long established excise taxation policy and to address loopholes in existing excise legislation where it does not deliver this policy. They will be of benefit to government in terms of collecting the proper excise revenue legislated by the parliament, to consumers in terms of safer petroleum products and to those honest participants who form the vast majority of the petroleum products distribution and retail system who wish to compete on level terms. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Latham) adjourned. CUSTOMS TARIFF (FUEL RATES AMENDMENTS) BILL 1997 First Reading  first time. Second Reading  Small Busi.ness and Consumer Affairs) (5.11 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is the second of seven in the legislation package designed to give effect to the government's announcement in the 1997-98 budget that it would be cracking down on fuel substitution. It parallels for customs duty those changes to excise duty implemented by the provisions of the Excise Tariff (Fuel Rates Amendments) Bill 1997. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Latham) adjourned. FUEL MISUSE (PENALTY SURCHARGE) BILL 1997 First Reading  first time. Second Reading  Small Business and Consumer Affairs) (5.13 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is the third of seven in the legislation package designed to give effect to the government's announcement in the 1997-98 budget that it would be cracking down on fuel substitution. It provides for a penalty surcharge payable where fuel that has been entered for home consumption on a concessional basis, and accordingly marked with a chemical tracer, is subsequently used in an internal combustion engine. The penalty surcharge is payable by the owner of the fuel at the time of its use and is payable before the fuel is used. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Latham) adjourned. FUEL SALE (PENALTY SURCHARGE) BILL 1997 First Reading  first time. Second Reading  Small Business and Consumer Affairs) (5.14 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is the fourth of seven in the legislation package designed to give effect to the government's announcement in the 1997-98 budget that it would be cracking down on fuel substitution. It provides for a penalty surcharge payable where fuel that has been entered for home consumption on a concessi anal basis, and accordingly marked with a chemical tracer, is subsequently sold for use in an internal combustion engine. The penalty surcharge is payable by the person owning the fuel immediately before its sale. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Latham) adjourned. FUEL BLENDING (PENALTY SURCHARGE) BILL 1997 First Reading  first time. Second Reading  Small Business and Consumer Affairs) (5.15 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is the fifth of seven in the legislation package designed to give effect to the government's announcement in the 1997-98 budget that it would be cracking down on fuel substitution. It provides for. a penalty surcharge payable where fuel that has been entered for home consumption on a concessiona1 basis, and accordingly marked with a chemical tracer, is subsequently blended with unmarked fuel. Unmarked fuel is fuel that has been entered for home consumption at a fully duty paid rate. The penalty surcharge is payable by the owner of the fuel immediately after that blending. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Latham) adjourned. FUEL (PENALTY SURCHARGES) ADMINISTRA TION BILL 1997 First Reading  first time. Second Reading  Small Business and Consumer Affairs) (5.17 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is the sixth of seven in the legislation package designed to give effect to the government's announcement in the 1997-98 budget that it would be cracking down on fuel substitution. It sets out the administration provisions for the three penalty surcharge bills in the legislation package. The first set of administration provisions relates to the times at which the penalty surcharges will become payable. The penalty surcharges are payable before the use, sale or blending takes place. It is highly unlikely that those who are carrying out these practices designed to defraud the revenue will volunteer to pay such surcharges, and accordingly an offence will be committed. In such cases, the severe penalties are designed to act as a deterrent to these practices, particularly where they are carried out on a commercial scale. The penalties are high and reflect the serious nature of the frauds currently being perpetrated. It will be relatively easy for bona fide operators, who form the vast majority of participants in the industry, not to become involved. They will achieve that by not buying fuel without due attention to the required documentation and the commercial context in which the fuel is offered. In addition, a key factor in the selection of the marker, or markers, will be that the presence of the marker can be tested by those who wish to do so with a test that is safe, cheap and easy to conduct. There will be an intensive publicity campaign directed at industry participants before the legislation commences. The second set of administration provisions relates to record creation and the record keeping obligations which apply to all persons dealing in petroleum products. These requirements will apply to persons who enter products for home consumption as well as to subsequent dealers in such products after they have entered into home consumption. There should be no situation-whether it be in a road tanker or other fuel transport vehicle of any type, a transport vehicle with a fuel capacity above the threshold limit, a depot, a service station or other fuel distribution or storage place-where fuel is not covered by some form of readily accessible and accurate documentary record. Customs has consulted with industry representative bodies in the petroleum product manufacturing, distribution and retail sector. The record keeping requirements set out in the bill, while codified into certain classes of records, are no more in quantity than is currently required by normal business practice. It should be noted also that volumes of fuel below certain levels will be exempted from the record keeping requirements and, accordingly, private motorists and other low volume users of fuel will not be affected in any way by these requirements. Further administration provisions set out the notification requirements in relation to the sale or disposal of marked fuel. This bill also sets out the audit powers of Customs officers and officers of other agencies authorised by the chief executive officer of Customs to ensure compliance with the requirements in this act and to obtain evidential material concerning any breaches of the provisions of this act, including the authority to obtain monitoring and search warrants. The powers will cover a range of activities, including fuel sampling, auditing uf documents and access to various premises-including road tankers and fuel transport vehicles, port vehicles with a fuel capacity above the threshold limit and depots, service stations and fuel distribution or storage places. Unfortunately, the experience to date shows that, once fuel has passed out of Customs' control into home consumption, the ability of Customs, under existing legislation, to obtain sufficient evidence to substantiate evasion of the revenue through fuel substitution practices is limited. It should be noted that the bill allows information or things such as fuel samples to be made available to other agencies, whether Commonwealth or state, with relevant interests. Among other things, this power recognises that fuel substitution practices are designed to avoid state and territory petroleum franchise fee revenue, as well as excise. There are also strong provisions against people who may attempt to remove or neutralise markers. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Latham) adjourned. NA NA (No.2) 1997 First Reading  first time. Second Reading  Small Business and Consumer Affairs) (5.23 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) is the final of seven in the legislation package designed to give effect to the government's announcement in the 199798 budget that it would be cracking down on fuel substitution. This bill introduces offences and appropriate penalties that will apply to a person who enters fuel in a manner which does not correspond to its nature in the context of the requirement of whether it is marked or unmarked fuel. Identical offences will apply to the entry for home consumption trans- under both the Customs Act and the Excise Act. I present the explanatory memorandum to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Latham) adjourned. CUSTOMS LEGISLATION (ANTIDUMPING) AMENDMENT BILL 1997 First Reading  first time. Second Reading  Small Business and Consumer Affairs) (5.24 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill is to amend the Customs Act 190 I : (i) to provide a special approach for determining normal values of allegedly dumped goods from countries that are in the process of transition to a market economy as announced by the government on 12 March 1997; and (ii) to clarify provisions of these acts which relate to the manner in which interim dumping and countervailing duties are collected. The amendments to the normal value provisions in section 269TAC of the Customs Act 1901 provide for a case by case approach to be taken by customs and the Anti-Dumping Authority in inquiries into the alleged dumping of products from countries that are in the process of transition to a market economy. Under the proposed amendments, if customs and the authority are satisfied that the exporter's domestic selling prices of the product under investigation are subject to government control or substantial government control, normal values may be ascertained by reference to other relevant information, which may include the selling prices of like goods in a 'surrogate' country. Section 269TAC of the Customs Act provides for the assessment of the 'normal value' of imported goods for the purpose of determining whether the goods have been exported to Australia at less than that value, thereby dumped. The structure of the section has been described as establishing a hierarchy of methodologies by which normal values are determined. Investigating authorities must progressively work through each of the prescribed methodologies until a point is reached at which a normal value can be determined. Until the latter part of last year, subsection 269T AC(4) was utilised by investigating authorities to ascertain normal values for goods exported from command economies by reference to information obtained in a 'surrogate' country. In November of last year, customs obtained legal advice as to the scope of subsection 269TAC(4). That advice confirmed that the section was severely limited in its application. Its stringent tests require that the government of the country of export has at least a substantial monopoly of all of the trade of the country-not just in terms of the goods under investigation-and must also substantially influence the domestic price of all goods in that country. Although the governments of economies which are in a state of transition from a command economy to a market economy may still maintain controls over the domestic selling prices of a significant number of sensitive products, it cannot be said that the extent of the control falls within the ambit of subsection 269TAC(4). Clearly, in such economies, the government has moved from a position in which it maintains a substantial monopoly over all of the trade of the country. As subsection 269TAC(4) can have no further application to economies which are considered to be in transition from a command economy to a market economy, the determination of the normal values for exports from such economies, as a matter of law, must be made in accordance with the remaining provisions of section 269TAC. These provisions do not distinguish between 'market economies' and those which are considered to be 'in transition. Therefore, normal values for exports from economies which are considered to be in transition from a command economy to a market economy must be ascertained by the application of the same methodologies that are required to be applied in the ascertainment of normal values for exports from countries such as the United States of America and Germany-that is, there is presently no flexibility available for investigating authorities to treat exports from economies which are in transition differently from exports from other countries. Investigating authorities require the flexibility to proceed to a methodology similar to that provided in section 269TAC(6)-that is, to have regard to all relevant information-as soon as they are satisfied that the domestic selling prices of the goods under consideration are subject to government control. The proposed amendment therefore aims to confer such flexibility upon customs and the authority. To ensure that Australia is not in breach of its obligations as a member of the World Trade Organisation, the WTO, the amendment provides for regulations to be made to dis apply the new methodology for calculating normal values in respect of specified countries. The bill also contains amendments which, in combination with those in the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bi111997, clarify the operation of the provisions of the Customs Act and the Customs Tariff (AntiDumping) Amendment Act 1975 which relate to the manner in which interim dumping and countervailing duties are collected. The amendments make it clear that such interim duties can be imposed, pending final assessment of any dumping or countervailing duties, notwithstanding that the actual export price and normal value or the fact that a countervailable subsidy has been received have not yet been ascertained. Although these amendments are to be taken to have commenced on 1 January 1993, the date on which the interim dumping and countervailing duties were introduced, they will not require importers to pay an amount of dumping duty beyond that which has previously been demanded. The amendments merely seek to ensure that approximately $12 million in interim duties collected since 1 January 1993 is not subject to legal challenge. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Latham) adjourned. CUSTOMS TARIFF (ANTI-DUMPING) AMENDMENT BILL 1997 First Reading  first time. Second Reading  Small Business and Consumer Affairs) (5.31 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the Customs Tariff (AntiDumping) Act 1975 to clarify, in combination with the amendments to the Customs Act 1901 proposed in the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1996, provisions of these acts which relate to the manner in which interim dumping and countervailing duties are collected. The amendments make it clear that such interim duties can be imposed pending final assessment of any dumping or countervailing duties, notwithstanding that the actual export price and normal value, or the fact that a countervail able subsidy has been received, have not yet been ascertained. These amendments have a retrospective commencement of 1 January 1993, the date on which interim dumping and countervailing duties were introduced, to ensure that approximents mately $12 million collected in interim duties since 1 January 1993 is not subject to legal challenge. I commend the bill and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Latham) adjourned. VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (BUDGET AND COMPENSA TION MEASURES) BILL First Reading Bill presented by Mr Bruce Scott, and read a first time. Second Reading",100
154,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,LEGISLA TION AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The 1997-98 budget demonstrates the federal government's continuing commitment to caring for Australia's veterans and their families. As well as initiatives to assist them live the independent lives of their choice, the opportunity has been taken to streamline administration and remove anomalies in entitlements. The 1997-98 budget continued the government's four-year commemorative program, 'Their Service-Our Heritage', which will encourage all Australians to remember the sacrifice and service of our veterans across the years. Commemorating the service rendered by men and women in uniform has become an integral part of Australia's way of life. Of course, remembering the fallen is not enough; we must also continue to look after the living. This bill will give legislative effect to a budget initiative to extend eligibility for disability pension and access to repatriation health care arrangements to an additional 10,500 veterans. Some veterans will also benefit by gaining eligibility for the service pension and defence service homes loans. This initiative arises out of a recent review of perceived anomalies in eligibility for veterans entitlements for overseas deploysince World War II. This review was foreshadowed in the government's election policy statement, 'Lest We Forget'. The review sought fairness and consistency in applying the long standing principles underlying access to repatriation benefits. Eligibility for disability pension and benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 will now be available to veterans who had seagoing naval service with the Far East Strategic Reserve between 1955 and 1963, to veterans who served in north-east Thailand 1997 between 1962 and 1968 and to veterans who served in Japan with the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces between 1949 and 1951. Eligibility for disability pensions will also be extended to veterans who served in various other overseas deployments in the postwar years. Qualifying service for service pension will be extended to embassy guards and RAAF personnel who served in Vietnam between 1973 and 1975. An important change in this bill is the automatic extension of eligibility for repatriation benefits to veterans for any overseas operational service determined to be warlike or non-warlike by the Minister for Defence. These are classifications now used by the Department of Defence to cover operations of higher risk than normal peacetime service. The inclusion of these classifications of service will give veterans greater certainty about their eligibility under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 before they commence future overseas deployments. In addition, these classifications should minimise the potential for anomalies to occur in the future. Another 1997-98 budget initiative in this bill will allow all disability pensioners and war widow and war widower pensioners access to a lump sum advance of their pension, up to a maximum of $500 a year. Previously, this advance has been available to income support pensioners only. These changes recognise the benefit of allowing people with continuing Commonwealth pensions greater flexibility and choice as to how they access their pension payments. This bill also introduces a reform to the repatriation system that reflects a greater public awareness of the medical consequences of tobacco use and the current initiatives to discourage smoking within the general community and also within the defence forces. If, in the past, veterans did not know the dangers of smoking, or if they were encouraged to use tobacco, this is certainly not true for veterans today. The Commonwealth will no longer be liable for compensation for the medical consequences of smoking tobacco if the person takes up the habit after 31 December 1997 or if the consequences are due to an increase in smoking after 31 December 1997. This measure will not affect veterans who acquired a service related smoking habit before 1 January 1998, unless the medical consequences are due only to a later increase in tobacco use. However, let me stress that if smoking is only one of the causal factors in the development of a condition, there will still be eligibility for compensation for the incapacity or death if other service-related factors exist. Before concluding, I want to say that the government is making significant improvements to the way the functions of the Public Service are managed and delivered. This includes the selective outsourcing of functions where the private sector can deliver quality service at a price that the public sector cannot match. The Department of Veterans' Affairs has been very innovative in this area, as evidenced by its extensive health and hospital service purchasing and, more recently, by the outsourcing of its computer infrastructure. This was a first for the Commonwealth Public Service. It will mean better service for the veteran community and better value for the taxpayer's dollar. Taken as a whole, the 1997-98 Veterans' Affairs budget initiatives will result in better policy, more efficient administration and, most importantly, a better quality of life for the veteran community. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Laurie Ferguson) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (SEARCH AND RESCUE SERVICE) BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Ronaldson, and read a first time. Second Reading",106
155,Mr RONALDSON,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,"BallaratParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development) (5.41 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act 1990, the AMSA Act, the Air Services Act 1995, the Air Services Act, and the Civil Aviation Act 1988, the Civil Aviation Act, to facilitate the amalgamation of the Commonwealth's civil maritime and aviation search and rescue coordination functions into one national centre. The bill also amends the At-. Â·SA Act to increase the number of ordinary members on the board of AMSA and make the appointment of a departmental officer to the board discretionary. Australia's civil search and rescue coordination functions are presently divided between state and territory police services, industry and volunteer groups and, at the Commonwealth level, between two agenciesAirservices Australia, AA, and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, AMSA. The effectiveness of search and rescue coordination activities relies on successful communication between these agencies. One of the first acts of this government last year was to initiate an independent review into the costs and benefits that could arise from a rationalisation of the Commonwealth's civil search and rescue functions. The review was to also recommend on the best administrative organisational model and location of a search and rescue coordination centre. The review concluded that the present dual Commonwealth civil search and rescue coordination system lacks a clear and unified strategic and operational focus, with no clear accountability for systems failures. The report recommended the establishment of a single civil search and rescue coordination centre to be managed by AMSA. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development announced on 15 January this year the establishment of a new national centre for the coordination of civil maritime and aviation search and rescue. This centre will bring together the search and rescue coordination functions of AA and AMSA. The national centre, to be called AusSAR, the Australian Search and Rescue Organisation, will be located in Canberra and managed on behalf of the federal government by AMSA. Search and rescue functions will be better coordinated and more effective through improved communications and responsiveness under the new centralised structure. This initiative will strengthen Australia's already formidable international reputation in search and rescue. Both AMSA and AA support this amalgamation. Amendments The amendments to the AMSA Act make clear that in addition to its present maritime search and rescue service, AMSA will also provide an aviation search and rescue service. The provision of the amalgamated service will be performed in a manner consistent with Australia's obligations under applicable international conventions. The Air Services Act will be amended to reflect the transfer of responsibility for aviation search and rescue to AMSA. AA will continue to manage any liabilities that arise out of its present provision of search and rescue services. The Civil Aviation Act will be amended to enable the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to continue to have a role in setting safety standards and making regulations relating to the performance of search and rescue services by aircraft. AMSA board The bill also increases the number of ordinary members on the AMSA board from three to four given the increased responsibilities of AMSA and to enable the appointment of a member with aviation experience. This is consistent with the government's aim that members of boards have relevant experience. The AMSA Act will also be amended to make the appointment of a departmental officer to the board discretionary. This will provide the minister with the flexibility to appoint a departmental officer for specific periods where particular expertise is required. Transitional arrangements The bill makes arrangements for the transfer to AMSA of assets associated with AA's search and rescue function. The value of these assets is to be determined by the minister following independent valuation. The assets transfer will not be subject to capital gains tax. The transitional arrangements also enable the minister or his delegate to transfer rights under contracts from AA to AMSA. A regulation making power will provide for regulations to be made in relation to transitional matters arising from the transfer of the search and rescue function from AA to AMSA. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin Ferguson) adjourned.

156,Mr TONY SMITH,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"Clause 5 of the Administrative Decithat sions (Effect of International Instruments) status. Bill, which is the key to the bill, states inter alia that the fact that Australia is bound party to an international instrument or an enactment reproduces or refers to a particular international instrument does not give rise a legitimate expectation of a kind that might provide a basis at law for invalidating or any way changing the effect of an administrative decision. It is worthwhile, generally, to consider carefully the facts of Teoh but worthwhile also given some of the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). In May 1988, Teoh was a temporary visitor to this country from Malaysia. In June 1988, he married his deceased brother's wife. She had three children from that relationship and a child from a previous marriage. Prior to lodging an application for permanent residency on 5 June 1989, a child was born. Since that time two more children were born to the union of Teoh and his wife; namely, on 7 June 1990 and 7 March 1992. On 16 November 1989, whilst Teoh's application for permanent residency was pending, he was charged with importing heroin from Malaysia over a period of four months from August 1989. There were six counts of being knowingly concerned in the importation of heroin and three counts of possession of heroin. He was sentenced to six years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years and eight months. The sentencing judge took into account his wife's addicand the part it had played in Teoh's actions, but saying that is different from saying, as the member for Melbourne did, that the importation was to support his wife's heroin habit. That does not appear in the report. Mrs Teoh, as I indicated, was a heroin and she was also charged in relation to heroin offences, pleaded guilty and got an 18month suspended sentence in July 1990. In November 1990 Mrs Teoh was charged with further drug offences. In December 1991 she was sentenced to imprisonment, not to be released until October 1992. Meanwhile, the children were in the care of the state. In 1991, Mr Teoh was notified by letter he was refused application for resident It is worth reviewing some of the judgeby or ments. The member for Banks (Mr Melham) looked at a number of passages from the joint judgment of Chief Justice Mason and Justice to Deane. I intend to refer to the judgements as well but, first of all, I will mention the in headnote. In that case the High Court held by a majority, with Mr Justice MCHugh dissentIng: ... That ratification of the Convention gave ri;c to a legitimate expectation that the Minister would act in conformity with it and treat the best interests of the applicant's children as a primary consideration. (2) That the Minister had not treated the best interests of the children as a primary consideration, and the applicant had been denied procedural fairness in that he had not been afforded the opportunity to present a case against a decision inconsistent with the legitimate expectation. Per Mason CJ, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron 11. Although a Convention ratified by Australia does not become part of Australian law unless its provisions have been validly incorporated into municipal law by statute, the ratification was an adequate foundation for a legitimate expectation, absent statutory or executive indications to the contrary, that administrative decision-makers would act conformably with the Convention. It is not necessary that a person seeking to set up such a legitimate expectation be aware of the Convention or personally entertain the expectation. It is enough that the expectation is reasonable in the sense that there are adequate materials to support it. As I said, the judgment refers to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was ratified by the previous government executive on 17 December 1990 and entered into force for Australia on 16 January 1991. The status of the convention, as far as Australian law is concerned, can be gleaned from the judgments of certain members of the High Court, in particular Chief Justice Mason and Justice Deane, in the following passages. On page 287 of the Commonwealth Law Reports, they said: But the fact that the convention has not yet incorporated into Australian law does not mean that its ratification holds no significance for Australian law. Where a statute or subordinate legislation is ambiguous, the court should favour that construction which accords with Australia's obligation under a treaty or international convention to which Australia is a party. That is a reasonably well established principle of international law. The passage goes on to sayan page 288: In the present case, however, we are not concerned with the resolution of an ambiguity in a statute, nor are we concerned with the development of some existing principle of the common law. The questions to be resolved are whether the provisions of the convention are relevant to the exercise of the statutory discretion and, if so, whether Australia's ratification of the convention can give rise to a legitimate expcctation that the decision maker will exercise the discretion in conformity with the terms of the convention. The foregoing discussion of the status of the convention in Australian law reveals no intrinsic reason for excluding its provisions from consideration by the decision maker simply because it has not been incorporated into our municipal law. At page 291 of the same judgment, the court goes on to say: Ratification of a convention is a positive statement by the executive government of this country to the world and to the Australian people that the executive governmcnt and its agencies will act in accordance with the convention. That positive statement is an adequate foundation for a legitimate expectation, absent statutory or executive indications to the contrary, that administrative decision makers will act in conformity with the convention. I highlight the words 'absent statutory or executive indications to the contrary'. It is that hint, if you like, in the judgment that led to the statement that was made by the previous Attorney-General and Foreign Minister and ultimately to the executive statement that was made by the current Attorney-General (Mr Williams) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer). The judgment goes on from there, but I do not have time to quote it at any great length, other than to refer generally to that page and to page 292. It is interesting to contrast that with what the dissenting judge, Mr Justice MCHugh, said. It is worthwhile sometimes to go back to first principles, as His Honour did in his judgment, and in particular to consider what the doctrine of legitimate expectation was. He indicates that it is a doctrine that was developed by Lord Denning initially in the case Schmidt and the Secretary of State for Home Affairs. He said: In its original form, it was a device that permitted the courts to invalidate decisions made without hearing a person who had a reasonable expectation, but no legal right, to the continuation of a benefit, privilege or state of affairs. But then His Honour went on in his judgment to refer to an article by Tait, 'The coherence of legitimate expectations and the foundation of natural justice', from Monash University Law Review, where the following appears: [F]or an expectation to be 'legitimate' in the required sense there must be positive grounds which are sufficient to render it objectively justifiable ... Our analysis of the cases suggests that there are four principal sources which the courts recognise as capable of rendering expectations legitimate or reasonable; (I) a regular course of conduct which has not been altered by the adoption of a new policy; (2) express or implied assurances made clearly on behalf of the decision-making authority within the limits of the power exercised; (3) the possible consequences or effects of the expectation being defeated especially where those consequences include economic loss and damage to reputation, providing that the severity of the consequences are a function of justified reliance generated from substantial continuity in the possession of the benefit or a failure to be told that renewal cannot be expected; and (4) the satisfaction of statutory criteria. Mr Justice MCHugh goes on to say: Prior to the present case, that summary seemed an accurate statement of the circumstances that could give rise to a legitimate expectation sufficient to enliven the rules of procedural fairness. None of them is present in this case. If Mr Teoh is to succeed, the doctrine of legitimate expectations will have to be extended. With respect, I agree with His Honour. It is important to bear that in mind in the context of the judicial activism that took place in that case and has been rather prevalent in the High Court in recent years. Mr Justice MCHugh's statement, and this is an important passage in his judgment, continues: Even if a legitimate expectation did arise in a case such as the present, all that procedural fairness would require would be for the decision-maker to inform the person affected that the decision-maker would not be acting in the manner expected. As I have indicated, a legitimate expectation gives rise to a requirement of procedural fairness but it does not give substantive protection to any right, benefit or privilege that is the subject of the expectation. Once the person was notified, the decision-maker would seem to have discharged his or her duty of procedural fairness. It may be that procedural fairness would also require the decision-maker to consider any subsequent submission that the rule should be applied. If it does, it merely shows how artificial is the doctrine of legitimate expectations in cases such as the present. Since the decisionmaker is under no obligation to apply the rule, he or she would be at liberty to act in disregard of any subsequent submission that the rules should be applied. That is an important point, contrasting with the majority judgment. He continued: It seems a strange, almost comic, consequence if procedural fairness requires a decision-maker to inform the person affected that he or she does not intend to apply a rule that the decision-maker cannot be required to apply, has not been asked or given an undertaking to apply, and of which the person affected by the decision has no knowledge. I think that is a very important contrast to the judgment of the majority. Again, with respect, it is hard to overcome that observation by His Honour. There are other passages that I would like to refer to, but I do not really have the time. I do concur with the reasoning of His Honour in that particular case. Judicial activism is a very unruly horse because it really depends what side of the coin you are on. One of the very notable judicial activists was the great judge, Lord Denning, Master of the Rolls. I refer very quickly to the Gouriet case, where His Honour heard a private citizen corning to the court to try to stop a powerful trade union from breaking the law. The Attorney-General was not prepared to do anything about it, so a private citizen carne to the court, and His Honour said: We made the order. We made it in the very words of the statute of the realm. Our order was effective. The trade union, to its credit, obeyed it. So there has been no trouble. The breach of the law has been averted. Yet the Attorney-General came before us on the next Tuesday ... and speaking with all the great authority of his office, he rebuked us. He told us that we had no jurisdiction to make that order. We had no right to do it without his consent; and he had refused his consent. It was for him, and for him alone, to decide whether this trade union should be restrained from breaking the law. And that so far as he was concerned, he was going to do nothing to stop it. He was not going to make any application to the court. And that no member of the public could come either. Lord Denning continued: This submission is, to my mind, contrary to the whole spirit of the law of England. So it really depends which side of the coin you are on in relation to judicial activism. In that case, a great judge-a judge that, as a law student, I had enormous admiration foron one side of the political fence said to the Attorney-General of England, 'Look, I'm not going to cop it.' Ultimately, Lord Denning was overruled in the House of Lords and Lord Hailsham, in his judgment in the House of Lords, was absolutely scathing in his attack on Denning's approach. A good deal of heat and emotion was brought into that particular debate. It is a timely reminder in relation to the debate in respect of judicial activism. The member for Banks also referred to the article by my predecessor, the former Attorney-General, Mr Lavarch, saying that this legislation was unnecessary. I have a lot of respect for Mr Lavarch at a personal level, but his legal experience is extremely limited. In fact, he used to actually get advice from me when he was an articled clerk-not too long before he was made Attorney-General. His on-the-ground practical experience is no basis, in my view, for saying that his view on this issue is one that should be determinative. It is important, in the short time that I have left, to make some reference to this notion that is gaining currency of judicial activism and to the dangers that can exist in relation to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the CROC convention-dangers that were not foreseen in 1989. No-one would have foreseen the Teoh result, and if anyone had said that it could produce that result, as the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) would have said, 'They would have been regarded as part of the loony right.' On the other side of the coin, it has occurred and we must ask what the answer to it is now. In 1982 the Canadian Judicial Council said: The history of the long struggle for separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary not only establishes that the judges must be free from political interference, but that politicians must be free from judicial intermeddling in political ties. This extract is part of an article by Professor Lee, the Sir John Latham Professor of Law at Monash University. He said, in his concluding remarks: Judicial independence is an invaluable asset but it is also recognised to be a highly fragile bastion. Judges can also contribute to shoring it up by learning to desist from being embroiled in political controversies. I think that is a timely warning, having regard to the remarks of the Chief Justice of the Family Court in San Francisco and to the reported remarks of Mr Justice Sackville of the Federal Court. They ought to read that article and ought to remind themselves of their position. Lastly, I say briefly that the Convention on the Rights of the Child has some dangerous elements to it which we are considering in the treaties committee. The effects of it are yet to be worked out. An article by Mr Neville Turner, 'Betrayal of children', exposes some of the problems in relation to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. We should take account of what is being called for in some of those views in considering the extent of it. I support this bill and I urge the House to accept it. (Time expired)",109
157,Mr WILLIAMS,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"in reply-I propose to wind up this debate fairly briefly. The debate concludes without the opposition having a position in relation to the bill at all, except that the member for Banks (Mr Melham) has indicated, speaking for the opposition, that it will not be opposed in this House. He indicated that the opposition intended to refer it to, I presume, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for what I understand he referred to as 'reconsideration'. This reveals yet again the inability of the opposition to adopt a position for the purpose of debates in the House of Representatives on legislation in the Attorney-General's portfolio. I have previously commented on this and speculated on whether it is indolence on the part of the shadow minister, Senator Bolkus. We might go a bit further and invite the activiquestion whether it is incompetence or even negligence on the part of that shadow minister. It puts the member for Banks in the invidious position of time after time having to come into this House and say: 'We will not oppose it here but we do not know what is going to happen in the Senate.' It is really pathetic. It may even raise a question as to the ability of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) to control his shadow ministers in the Senate. When the member for Banks indicated that he was not opposing the bill in this House, he nevertheless went on to lay the groundwork for not supporting the bill in the other House with a number of his arguments. It is interesting that he was followed by the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) and the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson), who effectively supported the bill. It puts back bench members of the opposition in a difficult position. They do not know what the opposition's position is. The member for Reid, who is a shadow minister, is in the position of saying that he supports the bill, although his fellow shadow minister responsible for the bill does not have a position on it. The bill is in a form which is substantially similar to that introduced by the previous government in 1995. One can suggest, without the appearance of any countervailing argument, that what the opposition is now doing is just plain political opportunism. The opposition would like to be politically obstructive but it is not really sure how to do it. It does not really have any arguments as to how it might be done at this stage but it hopes that the Senate committee will find some and construct some bullets for the shadow minister in the Senate to fire. It is consistent with a long line of actions by the opposition of saying one thing in government and another in opposition. It is saying one thing in this House and then possibly, probably, another thing in the other chamber. The memberMr Martin Ferguson-The others were non-core promises, were they?",112
158,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,Order! The honourable member for Batman.,113
159,Mr WILLIAMS,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,The member for Banks asserted that things have changed. Mr Martin Ferguson-Don't laugh. Even he can't look at me.,113
160,Mr WILLIAMS,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"With an expression like that on the face of the member for Batman, it is very hard to hold a straight face. The member for Banks asserts that things have changed since the previous government considered the other issue. He weakly asserted that the Chief General Counsel's legal advice to the previous government was faulty. The legal advice mayor may not have been influential with some members of the government, but one thing I am quite convinced of-it would have had no effect whatever on the opinion of the former Minister for Foreign Affairs. He would have formed his own view. He did form his own view, and he has expressed his own view on a number of occasions. He gave a speech to an international treaties conference which, from memory, was at the ANU on 4 September 1995. Mr Martin Ferguson-He was actually in Australia at the time?",113
161,Mr WILLIAMS,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"He was in Australia. He said: The court's decision raised a fundamental question about our system of parliamentary law making in Australia. Should the parliament be bypassed to allow treaties to have a direct effect in Australian law, the government is firmly of the view that this is not an appropriate development and that the role of changing Australian law to conform with treaty obligations should remain with the democratically elected parliaments of this country. He continued: The joint statement which the Attorney-General and I published on 10 May 1999 and the Administrative Decisions (Effective International Instruments) Bill 1995 were designed to make that 'contrary intention' clear in the way that the High Court itself allowed for. Our concern in making the statement and in introducing the bill was simply to preserve the role of parliament in changing Australian law. That view was not an ephemeral one. The then Minister for Foreign Affairs, the now member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) and Deputy Leader of the Opposition, spoke again on the same subject at a conference in Melbourne on 'Mason and Beyond'. The then Senator Evans said: My lack of enthusiasm for Teoh is not especially a function of my lack of appreciation of how it has narrowed the gap between international and domestic law. Rather, it is a function of my belief that Teoh creates a decision making environment that is unworkable in practice and that it goes further than the court was compelled to go by any legal principle, or should have gone, in upsetting the present balance between the executive, legislature and judiciary. The pre-Teoh balance was a delicate one, to be sure, but nonetheless one perfectly attractive in theory and workable in practice. No doubt the member for Banks regards the then Minister for Foreign Affairs as a criminal for adopting that point of view, but his partner in crime was the then Attorney-General. The then Attorney-General's view was reflected in what he said at the time. But he has spoken about it since as well. The former Attorney-General, the former member for Dickson, said in a speech in October 1996: The decision was taken ... principally because of a fear that by blurring the distinction between parliamentary and executive functions in altering domestic law based on intemational standards would ultimately result in introduction of parliamentary approval prior to ratification by the executive rather than parliamentary action after ratification. That was his view after he left parliament. What has changed since the Labor government brought in a bill? Very little has been changed. There was an argument put by the previous government that there would be a flood of cases and administrative decision making would be brought to ruin because of the High Court decision. In opposition, I said that not right, and I have been proven to have been right. What has happened? I am told that a legal database search AustLII in September last year revealed there were approximately 120 references to the Teoh case in decided cases of courts and tribunals. At that time, very few of those cases actually involved an issue about the Teoh principle. The cases revolved, in the main, around other issues and the Teoh case was simply cited. A search of the AustLII database in June this year revealed there were approximately 250 references to the Teoh case in decided cases of courts and tribunals. I am not able suggest how many of those cases actually involved an issue relating to the Teoh princitreaty ple, but I think that indicates there is cient attention being focused on the Teoh case that it cannot be ignored. Let us leave that issue aside. That of two reasons given by the previous government for their action. The real reason given by both the previous government and this government for their positions in relation the legislation is the preservation of the of parliament in relation to the effect treaties within Australia. Reference was made by the member for Banks to academic criticism, and I understand that the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) has effectively answered the recent criticism of Professor Margaret Allars of the University of Sydney. In the views reportedly attributed to her in a recent article in the Sydney Morning Herald, I think it was, there is no reason to justify believing that the act will not have effect according to its terms. The further point made by the member for Banks as a basis for the possibility that the opposition in the Senate would not support the bill-not just that he would not support the bill-was that the recent treaty making reforms by the current government make the bill unnecessary.",113
162,Mr MELHAM,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,They were your words. That is what you said in the last parliament.,114
163,Mr WILLIAMS,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"The member for Banks would do well to have detailed regard to the was effect of those treaty making reforms. The treaty making processes were badly in need of reform. They were neglected under the previous government, and the executive of government in effect rode roughshod over the that parliament. That is no longer the case. However, the principal likely effect of the Teoh decision as it stands is with respect to human rights treaties which have been entered into. Those treaties were entered into in some cases many years ago and were not entered into under the processes that now pertain. In many cases, those treaties have not been incorporated in their terms into domestic law. Some have been scheduled to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to Act, but that does not make them part of domestic law. So despite the commendable making process reforms that have been suffiput in place by the previous government, there is still a significant potential effect of the Teoh decision, if left unchanged, on was one existing human rights treaties. The member for Banks has put personal views. I take it also that the members for Reid, Barton and Melbourne (Mr Tanner) to were expressing personal views-some of role which were consistent with the views of the of member for Banks, but largely they were inconsistent. The real fact is that the opposition just does not know what to do. It really has not got any position at all, and it is reflected in the all-over-the-place views expressed in the debate. The member for Fisher expressed amazement that the member for Banks, as a shadow minister, expressed personal views and not the views of his party.",114
164,Mr MELHAM,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,The party hasn't locked in on this yet.,115
165,Mr WILLIAMS,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"You have just confirmed the point I was going to make-the party does not have a view. It does not have a cohesive view. It would like help in the formation of views on the subject of legislation that was introduced by the previous government, when it was in government. The member for Barton made a balanced contribution which was commended by the member for Groom (Mr Taylor), and I commend him for that. In relation to legislation in the Attorney-General's portfolio, the member for Barton has made balanced contributions on a number of occasions. The member for Groom, who is the chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, has a great interest in the subject. He correctly noted the objectives of the bill as well as pointing to the about-face by the opposition on this matter in not giving unequivocal support for the bill. He, too, referred to the vehement comments by the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition in favour of the action to set aside the Teoh doctrine. He also noted the history and importance of the government's treaty making reforms-something which he has, in effect, benefited and contributed to in his role as chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. The member for Reid supported the bill, and it is noteworthy that he shares the government's concern to restore the proper role of parliament in relation to treaty making. It is not necessarily a view shared by all members of his family. He obviously takes seriously the government's concern about maintaining the proper role of parliament in enacting legislation to give effect to treaties. The member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) made a robust contribution to the debate, which is not unusual for him. The unacceptr' able treaty processes of the previous government underlay his comments. This bill complements those new treaty processes by highlighting the role of parliament in relation to the domestic effect of treaties entered into by the executive. It is noteworthy that the member for O'Connor is an active member of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. The member for Melbourne speculated about what he regards as the true motivation for introducing the legislation. In this regard, his contribution was out of line and way off the mark. As I have indicated, the primary motivation for the legislation is one that is shared by this government and the previous government. 'Our concern in making the statement and introducing the bill was simply to preserve the role of parliament in changing Australian law.' That is a quotation; those are the words of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I also thank the member for Dickson for his contribution to the debate, which was in support of the bill. I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Williams) read a third time. NA 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 18 June, on motion by Mr Williams: That the bill be now read a second time.",115
166,Mr MELHAM,COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT BILL,"The Copyright Amendment Bill 1997 provides some major reforms of Australia's copyright law and intellectual property regimes. The bill introduces comprehensive moral rights provisions for authors of copyright works and directors and producers of films. It amends the law in relation to ownership of copyright in the works of employed journalists, to ensure that newspaper and magazine publishers have all electronic and residual rights in the journalists' works and the right to restrain large scale photocopying, to protect circulation. The bill amends the law to prevent the owners of copyright in the packaging and labelling of goods not protected by copyright from using that copyright to stop anyone from importing the goods. It will give the courts discretion in awarding the remedy of conversion damages for copyright infringement, and it introduces a sampling scheme for copying done by governments, to determine the amount of equitable remuneration which will be payable to a relevant collecting society instead of the present individual notification and payment to copyright owners. The bill also makes minor machinery, streamlining and tidying up amendments to the provisions concerning the Copyright Tribunal, allows for broader interception of infringing imports and provides for statutory licences for copying by educational institutions and institutions assisting people with disabilities. It also includes consequential amendments, including adding references to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. May I state from the outset that the Labor Party supports the broad thrust of these reforms. In particular, we support the broad thrust of the legislation to the extent that it introduces moral rights for certain work authors; indeed, the move to establish a moral rights regime was a Labor government initiative. However, this is not to say that we do not have concerns about the operation of this bill. We have concerns about the definition of the term 'author' as it applies to film and television programs. In particular, we are concerned that the definition only includes producers and directors and does not include script writers. Anyone would agree that script writers playa considerable role in the authorship of such works. This point was succinctly made by Mr Geoffrey Atherden, the President of the Australian Writers Guild, in a letter he wrote to the Sydney Morning Herald on 7 March, 1997. The letter was under the heading 'Moral rights' and Mr Atherden stated: David Williamson writes a play-choose one, Emerald City will do. The play is successful and everyone knows that it is a David Williamson play. The play is made into a film and David writes the screenplay. But according to the Moral Rights Legislation announced by the Federal Government, David is not entitled to any ownership of the moral rights in the film of his play. He is not an ""author"" of the film. The legislation defines ""author"" of a film or television program as the producer and director, not the writer. In other words, the definition of ""author"" is absurd. All other countries which have enacted moral rights legislation have defined ""author"" in film and television to include the writer as well as the director. Those are the words of Geoffrey Atherden, the President of the Australian Writers Guild, Kings Cross. I also refer to an interview which was held between Jan Sardi and Rebecca Goreman on the PM program on 20 June 1997. I think it is worthwhile reading into the record the whole of that transcript, which is what I now propose to do, because it sets out the scene. It reads: INTRO: Australian screenwriters are pushing to get new copyright legislation to include them. The legislation which was introduced yesterday, protects moral copyright but it specifically excludes screenwriters. Well Jan Sardi wrote the screenplay for the movie Shine. This afternoon he spoke with Rebecca Goreman about his industry's problems with the legislation. JS: I believe the real issue has to do with the legislation not recognising the writer as a creator or author of the film. It is absurd. RG: Is it not the common perception however, that the director and the producer are actually the creators of the overall product; that they have the creative and therefore moral rights to the overall product, and that the screenwriter is just a part of that? JS: Well take the screenwriter out of the equation and the producer and the director have nothing to protect! RG: But if you took away the Director of Photography, the animators in Babe, for example, you wouldn't have much of a product either. JS: No I disagree with that. Everyone who works on a film brings their interpretive skills to get what is on the page up on to the screen. If one cinematographer is not available to do the job, you get someone else and they'll apply their interpretive skills. The process is such that everyone works from the script, and it's what is on the page that everyone attempts to realise. It's to get the intentions of the screenplay l!J-' there on the screen in order to be able to share It with the audience. RG: For the sake of not being too complex though, wouldn't you have to stop somewhere in terms of who has the final say on creativity? You say that the cinematographer can be replaced, but presumably the screenwriter and the director and the producer can all be ultimately replaced, so where does it stop? JS: Well it's a question of saying, who creates the work? What is everyone there for? Generally what brings everyone together is a screenplay. It's the first thing that involves the director. It's the thing that a producer will pick up. Generally it will come from a writer. Sometimes a producer will initiate a work, and sometimes a director will initiate a work, but I'd say eight times out of ten the writer is the initiator and the original creator a work, which this legislation is saying the writer has no claim to authorship of, in the form in which it was originally intended, which is as a film. RG: The other problem the industry seems to be having with the legislation is the provision for waiving of one's moral rights. What's your problem with that? JS: Well it just seems absurd that here we are with this legislation being introduced in order to protect artistic integrity, and then we have a waiver provision to take it away. If they're allowing people to waive their rights to artistic integrity, why have the legislation? It's a Clayton's law otherwise, it's nonsense. It's the law you have when you don't want to have a law. RG: So presumably it's to simplify the processonce you sign a contract in a film, you sign over all your rights, rather than just your copyright. JS: Well that's basically it, and it's not right. Moral right is about respect, it's about our work being viewed in the form in which we originally intended it, and it's about respect for our names and our reputations. You can't take a screenplay, where everyone sits down and works on that screenplay, and then do what you like with it in the finished result, in the final process. Having said that, filmmaking is about collaboration, and I will have collaborated with many people. That doesn't mean words don't change. It's about getting the film up on to the screen. I think filmmaking is a process of attrition basically, and generally you do have to adapt. At the same time you're always trying to protect your original vision, your original intention and to get it up there in a way you intended. RG: Do you think the directors and producers will agree with you on these issues? JS: AU the directors and producers I've worked with see me as an integral part of that triumvirate, if you like. There are three people, the producer, director and writer, and you're always protecting that and trying to get the vision through in the end. It seems absurd that whoever Daryl Williams has taken his advice from, has got it wrong. They don't understand the process. That is there in that interview on PM, Radio National, on Friday, 20 June 1997. That says it all. We have also received a considerable number of representations from visual artists, including photographers, expressing concern about the proposed waiver clauses which, it first is claimed, unduly weaken artists' negotiating powers. Finally, I note that we have received lengthy representations from media monitoring of services. These service providers, which provide a service invaluable to all members in this place, are concerned that the proposed amendments will have the effect of preventing media monitoring companies from offering their current express clipping services unless the new licences from over 200 publishers and wire services can be obtained. The media monitoring companies are concerned that the new rules will extend publishers' control over media information services: the legal right to deny access to published news; unregulated rights on pricing with no access to the Copyright Tribunal; the right to limit services provided by press clippings companies; control over the simple faxing of press clippings; and control over the use of all new technologies, including scanning and electronic mail services. Inevitably, the establishment of any copyright law or intellectual property regime involves the balancing of rights, and it is perhaps inevitable in these circumstances that some people will complain about the balance struck by the government of the day. However, the parliament can and does have a responsibility to review that balance and to satisfy itself that the government has got the balance right. That is why the Labor Party will refer this bill to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for consideration. This will enable all senators, and indeed the parliament as a whole, to evaluate the correctness or otherwise of the judgments made by the government in this area. We welcome the opportunity that the Senate committee will afford to examine this legislation in detail, just as we welcome the government's implementation of the broad thrust of Labor's initiatives in the moral rights area. Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (6.38 p.m.)-I rise to speak on the Copyright Amendment Bill 1997. The Australian copyright law tries to ensure that artists receive appropriate remuneration for their work. Often it is difficult for artists to monitor the use of their work on an individual basis, or for individual businesses to find the artists to remunerate them for their work. So collecting societies have formed to be a central contact point and clearing house. That reduces the burden of complying with copyright legislation for owners of small business. Two of the copyright collecting societies that are alive and well in my electorate are APRA, the Australasian Performing Rights Association, and the Phonographic Performance Company of Australia, PPCA. These deal largely with music. This has relevance to a number of hairdressing businesses and a number of panel workshops in my area. A number of our small businesses do play music, and they have to pay $50 a year to APRA or PPCA. An issue running around our chamber of commerce recently has been the collection of these royalties. I think it is an important point to make that these societies need to be aware, when they are operating under this legislation, of the cost-effectiveness of their operations. If they are collecting money from small businesses, small businesses want to be sure that that money is going back to the artist. Often it seems that the administrative work is just keeping these societies in business. I use the instance of the Man about Town hairdressing salon in my area, which has received a number of threatening letters, to such an extent that the proprietor has just turned the radio off. That is not the intent of the legislation. It is not to be used as a whipping stick for people who are going about ordinary business. Certainly where music is a part of your business, as in the dance industry or in a coffee shop, where you are actually attracting clientele, you should be paying for the use of the artists' work, and some part of that should be going back to the artists. I think a more appropriate place for the collection of this revenue would probably be at the radio stations. They are quite aware when they put things to air that people will tum on their radios and that people will be listening to them. If those radios happen to be listened to by two or more people, that would be in the ordinary course of business. Quite frequently in my electorate we have a number of cars going down the main street of Penrith with extremely loud music playing, and I am sure that is not in the definition of reproduction in public. So I think some sort of leew.lY needs to be exercised by those societies in their application of the strict sense of the law. Given that, the Copyright Act is in fact intended to protect the interests of composers and songwriters, a much marginalised group. They are highly dependent on radio stations and big business to get air play and really are put under enormous pressure to get their music out and about in the arena and hopefully picked up as a major player and put on the air in that fashion, in order for them to make some money. It is interesting for small businesses in my area-restaurants, cafes, coffee lounges, roadhouses, reception houses, bistros, guest houses, bed and breakfasts and similar establishments-to note that PPCA will give you a licence for $45.62 up to 60 people, $61.37 from 61 to 100 people, $91.95 from 100 to 200 people, and $105 for over 200 people. That is a reasonable fee, payable in advance, but there does seem to be a problem where there are maybe one or two transitory people or, as in a complaint I have had in my electorate, a backyard workshop in the panel beating area, where no-one else should be going, and certainly no members of the public. Young guys are just playing the music for themselves, probably much to the employer's disgust, and he has to pay a fee and he gets very irate. It gets to the stage now where everybody is individually bringing their radios to work. I think APRA or PPCA will probably have to start looking at an alternative point of contact in terms of collecting these fees, otherwise we are going to end up with the ridiculous situation of everyone having to license their radio. That did not work in the past and I cannot see it working in the future. With this bill we are not out to increase the burden on small business. It certainly is not intended to do that. It was one of the commitments we made going into the election. It is intended to give fair and legitimate coverage to performing artists and their work. Often these days you have to be dead before you make any money out of art. We are trying to make it so you can make a living, quite literally, out of the arts. This bill goes some way to giving further protection in this much needed area. I commend the bill to the House.",115
167,Mr MCMULLAN,COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT BILL,"Canberra) (6.45 p.m.)I rise to support the remarks made by my colleague the member for Banks (Mr Melham), who led for the opposition in outlining the principle across the range of issues dealt with by this copyright legislation. In the light of his remarks, I want to make some preliminary comments on the implications of these changes for the arts. Overall, the copyright regime is a very important element in the remuneration of artists and the way in which they win a living from their activity. It is more than that. In particular, relationship of the legislation to moral rights is very important for the human rights of Australians working in creative endeavournot just in the arts, but I am speaking particularly about those people. I particularly welcome the initiative to introduce moral rights into the Australian legislative regime. It was a promise made by the Keating government in the 1993 election that we would initiate an examination of moral rights if we were returned. I had the privilege, on behalf of that government, of initiating the review. I and my colleague the then Minister for Justice, the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), made a commitment in 1993 that Australia should have a regime of moral rights, joining with the majority of Western countries in so doing. A discussion paper was issued in 1994 and, after its consideration and response, I regret to say that certain intervening events have meant that a different government has had the opportunity to introduce this legislation. But I am pleased that it has done so. The principle of moral rights is very straightforward and well recognised. The rights of individuals to protect the integrity of their work and the right to have your work attributed to you are at the core of moral rights. There is also the more contentious element of the right to protect your work against derogatory treatment. In particular, those core questions of the right of attribution to, and the right to protect the integrity of, a work are at the heart of moral rights and the heart of the rights of creators in our society. I understand that Australia is the 63rd country to legislate for moral rights. You can easily say that it is overdue but, while the core principle is straightforward, it has very complex aspects, many of which were addressed by the member for Banks. Most obviously, the moral rights complexity arises in areas of collaborative creative effort-that is, to whom does the moral right belong; to whom does the right flow? It reaches its most difficult circumstance when dealing with the film and television industry. I have to say that Australians always seem to have a way of making what others have the done seem particularly unique and difficult for us-reinventing every wheel. This is an issue that has been dealt with by many countries. I am not saying that other countries have found it easy, nor am I saying that we can merely adopt the approach and strategy of other countries. We have a different legislative framework and a different history and culture with regard to contractual and other arrangements, and our moral rights legislation needs to be relevant to our circumstances. I am saying that I find it unusual that we have come down to finally say that all the moral rights in film and television production should be with the producers and directors rather than with the writers and, in some circumstances, the cinematographers. The member for Banks quoted from a letter from Geoffrey Atherden, the President of the Australian Writers Guild, about David Williamson's undoubted authorship of the core elements of films based on his plays. think Emerald City was the one which was referred to in the letter, but many other examples could have been chosen. It is hard to imagine Emerald City without David Williamson. It is hard to imagine Dances With Wolves without Dean Semmler as the cinematographer. Yet the moral rights legislation that we are putting forward gives the rights in that regard to producers and directors. It is a very difficult issue, a difficult balance to strike. The previous government found it difficult also-I do not wish to pretend otherwise. It needs very careful study. That is why I very much welcome the initiastances, tive from the shadow Attorney-General, writer Senator Bolkus, which was reflected in the comments by the member for Banks, to refer this matter to a Senate committee for further examination. It has been studied a lot. Some people say, 'Oh, no, not another study!' But this is a different examination. This is an examination of a specific legislative proposal from the government-an important next stage in the process. The implications can be seen and more clearly assessed than would be the case if there were simply the general review of moral rights that was initiated on previous occasions. I accept that it is difficult. I certainly do not you want to dismiss the rights of directors, who obviously play a significant creative role in the film and television industry. I do not want to prejudge the outcome of the Senate inquiry, either personally or on behalf of my party, which has not had the opportunity collectively to study this matter. But I want to make clear that I start from a position of sympathy with the claims by the writers and interest in the circumstance of cinematographers. It has not been profiled; I have not been lobbied them. It just seems obvious to me that there is a significant element of creativity in their activity that needs to be considered. But we cannot take any steps that will bring our thriving and very important film and television industry to a grinding halt. A lot people are melodramatic about what moral rights for writers or others will do; nevertheI less, we have to recognise that film and television is not just an important cultural asset in Australia but also a great industry employing many people. We need it to continue to thrive and prosper. Other countries seem to have managed to have moral rights for screen writers and a successful film industry. Nevertheless, we need to examine the balance in an Australian legal cultural context. This legislation, which I welcome, gives us the chance to do that. The Senate inquiry, which the shadow Attorney-General has foreshadowed, will give us the opportunity to do that in more detail. It is hard to see how, at least in some circumthe inquiry will not conclude that a does not have the right to protect the integrity of their work after the final cut of the movie is completed. But let us await the outcome of the review before we go to a final decision. There is time. I know a lot of people are frustrated and say that they have waited a long time. But let us proceed in a balanced, measured way, look at the review, allow it to run its course and then deal with its consequences. Similar concerns have been expressed about the waiver provision. I will not waste the time of the House by duplicating the comments of my colleague the member for Banks, but it appears to be a very strange concept-that give people the right to opt out of their rights. If this is a human right, it is hard to see that you can just say, 'I now opt out of this. It is no longer my right.' But I understand the circumstances in which, for example, the film industry people feel that this is a necessary part of the legislait tive package. I am not at this stage saying that I have a problem in principle with it. I think the trend of events are such that if such a bill were introduced by a Labor government by it would probably include a waiver provision also. But it is an important issue to address. What I am concerned about is the imbalance of power in the relationship between the people seeking the waiver provision and the people required to give it. I think that is of something that needs to be examined. It is not really an option to say, 'Yes, I waive my rights,' if waiving your rights is a condition of getting the job in the first place. We need to examine the circumstances and protections that might need to be built around the waiver. I do not want to prejudge the matter. I welcome the fact that the legislation is before us and that we have this concrete element available to be reviewed. But that is an aspect in which I will be taking an interest as events unfold. Obviously, there are some who are disappointed that the copyright legislation does not cover some areas of their particular concern. On the face of it, the Viscopy people are concerned that this legislation does not take any action on the repeal of section 135ZM about photocopying. I am not quite sure why the government have not done that. It may be that there is a problem of principle of which I am not aware; it may be that they have a plan to do it in some subsequent legislation. I would be very interested to hear that either on this occasion or some other. There are many other important issues to be addressed in copyright. I would be unduly trespassing on the House's time to try to deal with them all in this speech when there will be subsequent opportunities and inquiries to be conducted. My colleague the member for Banks has covered many of them, and I will not duplicate them. There are those who are concerned about media monitors; others have serious concerns about the nature of this legislation. We want to look after their interests. Principal responsibility for this legislation lies with my colleague the shadow Attorney General. Many of my colleagues, particularly the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), who initiated a study on behalf of the opposition into many of the issues on which I am speaking, will be pursuing the progress of this legislation through the parliament and through the review process in the Senate with great interest. I welcome this next step along the road to establishing moral rights for the creative community in Australia-the arts community and others. I therefore support the legislation, but register those queries and qaestions which we will be seeking to examine and pursue further as the legislation passes through this House and the Senate.",119
168,Dr LAWRENCE,COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT BILL,"Fremantle) (6.59 p.m.)I want to add a few observations, particularly about the moral rights elements of this legislation, the Copyright Amendment Bill 1997, and to remind the House that the primary international treaty which deals with copyright is the Berne convention. Australia, as a sovereign nation, has been a signatory to the Berne convention since 1928 and, in more recent years, is a signatory to the international TRAIPS agreement-trade related aspects of intellectual property rights-for the uninitiated, which form part of the Uruguay Round on the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade. So we have been at this for some time. The Berne convention has for many years included an article 6, which requires member countries to protect moral rights, and we have not acted sufficiently on this. Simply statedand I think it is important to recognise the difference from economic rights-moral rights are those rights which an author or artist has in protecting the integrity of their creation from distortion or a failure to attribute authorship. They are based on the principle that the created work is a reflection of the personality and the characteristics of the author or artist and that the work should be so respected. These rights are clearly additional to the conventional understanding here and elsewhere that copyright is basically about economic interests and the need to prevent the pirating of published works. So moral rights cover a different aspect of the author's work. We have had in this country a very good international reputation, as many have pointed out, for compliance with international agreements dealing with intellectual property rights, but there are some gaps and this legislation seeks to remedy some of them. One of those is that, in the past, Australia has not fully addressed the question of moral rights in terms of its copyright legislation. We have only had limited protection in this field. That was one of the reasons why the former government actually instituted an inquiry on our international obligations, and there was a discussion paper released on proposed moral rights for copyright creators in October 1994 and subsequent legislation released by the former government in the last weeks of its term. I must say, however, that it is clear that both with this legislation and with the draft there are some reservations held particularly by writers but by others as well. They are reservations that I share now and that I shared then. As the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) has said, it would be timely to have the Senate examine some of these questions. The problems are twofold: firstly, the failure to recognise, particularly in film, the role of a writer and, secondly, the waiver. I will deal with those in a little bit of detail. The legislation now and in draft form ignored the reality of filmmaking in particular. The connection of a writer to a film is, in most people's minds, a very obvious one and an undeniable one. Without the script, there is no film. In the same way, without the input of the director or the actors, there would be no film, yet that is not properly recognised in this legislation. Indeed, writers appear to have been left specifically out of the definition of 'author' the legislation. That may be as a result of lobbying. I was not responsible for this area in a former life, so I am not certain what lobbying has been undertaken, but I am certainly well aware of the fact that writers now feel excluded. Whether the leaving out of writers from the definition of author was done out of convenience or as a result of successful lobbying by, for instance, the screen producers, I am not sure. But, whatever the reason the writers are being excluded from the definition of author of film, it does not make a lot of sense, you would have to say, when you examine it carefully. Along with many others, including the Australian Writers Guild, I believe that the definition of author needs to be specifically amended, and this would be my preference, to include writers. The maker of a film in the draft legislation curiously means not only the director, which I think everybody accepts, but also the producer of a film. I cannot see why the person who is simply responsible for pulling together the resources, particularly the financial resources, should be given moral rights ahead of people like writers, cinematographers and composers. It is a very curious omission, and I share the concerns of many writers in Australia about that omission. There clearly is a chain of authorship, and a complex one in film making, but it is cooperative and you cannot merely point to one person, whether it is the director or the producer, and say that the moral rights stop there. It starts with the writer writing the script. It needs to be understood that that, in most cases, is where a film starts. Writers do not then hand the script over to someone else and retreat. They are involved right through to the final product. Under the Berne convention, article 14 acknowledges the collaborative nature of film particularly and it defines the maker of a film as being the writer, the director, the cinematographer and the composer, yet in this legislation omitted are the writer, the cinematographer and the composer and inserted instead is the producer. It is important for the House to realise that there is a very considerable international in precedent to include writers, particularly, as being the authors under moral rights in a number of European countries and closer to home in New Zealand. As I have said before, the inclusion of the producer as an author appears to be unprecedented. I have not done the necessary research, I have to confess, but those who have tell me that they have not been able to find precedents of this kind. It is fair to say that those who are lobbying on behalf of writers, myself included, are not seeking necessarily to exclude producers, although we think an argument needs to be made for their inclusion, but are simply seeking to ensure that the other genuine creators, people who have an interest in the integrity of the work, are included. An example was given to me recently about a miniseries on ABC television-BBC produced as, sadly, much of it is these days. It was originally created, written, produced and directed as a four-part series with a climax, as you would expect, at the end of each episode. In its wisdom, the BBC, I think-and then the ABC, certainly-split it into five pieces. For those who were watching it, it was clear that the integrity of the work had been destroyed. That is what this sort of legislation is about. The writer was clearly offended, as was the director of the film, and made comment about it in the UK. So it is not one person who will feel offended by this sort of destruction, but those who are genuinely involved in the creation. Some people have said, 'Writers already have copyright over the script, which they usually assign to the producer.' That argument needs to be set aside because moral rights in the script is a meaningless concept, as the Writers Guild points out, because the script evolves with the project and cannot be separated from the final product. In other words, it is not simply the original script but many revisions later that you see the film emerge. It needs to be said that both the Australian Writers Guild and the Australian Society of Screen Directors have the view that moral rights do not come into existence until the final cut is made. So the concerns of some of the producers should be set aside. This is a matter of great importance because we need to encourage our writers and we need to make sure that their work is protected both by copyright for economic reasons and by moral rights for their creative purposes. The waiver is particularly worrying because it means that these moral rights can be set aside, presumably under some pressure, before the writer's work is incorporated, for example, in a film. It is not just the writers in this case who are concerned but the screen directors as well who want to ensure that this element of the legislation is reconsidered and, preferably, removed. They say it means that effective moral rights cannot be exercised. The imbalance of power is very considerable between a producer and a writer, a producer and a director even, in this country as elsewhere. Waiving those rights would make a nonsense of this legislation. I only wanted to speak very briefly. I wanted to draw attention to the fact that Australian writers are protesting about this legislation, and I think very articulately and sensibly. They are not asking for unreasonable amendments but ones that I hope the Senate will consider. I heard most of the interview by Rebecca Goreman of Jan Sardi on Radio National last Friday. Jan Sardi, for those who have been following our recent movie history, wrote the screenplay for the movie Shine. He spoke to Rebecca Goreman about his concerns. He said that he believed the real issue in the legislation was its failure to recognise the writer as a creator or author of the film. He said very succinctly in that interview, simply, 'It's absurd.' Rebecca Goreman questioned Jan Sardi further, asking: Is it not the common perception however, that the director and the producer are actually the creators of the overall product; that they have the creative and therefore moral rights to the overall product, and that the screenwriter is just a part of that? He answered her: Well take the screenwriter out of the equation and the producer and the director have nothing to protect! I think that is where the case rests. The writers are an essential part of this process. They have been considered in the Berne Convention and in other legislation. In my view, we should seriously consider inserting them. I am well aware of the fact that the previous government failed to do so too. That does not mean that we should compound the error by failing to take the opportunity to reconsider that matter and the question of a waiver.",121
169,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT BILL,"Mr Nehl)Before I call the next speaker, I must say to the honourable member for Canberra that I commend standing order 57 for his observance.",123
170,Mr WILLIAMS,COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT BILL,"in reply-I rise to conclude the debate on the Copyright Amendment Bill 1997. I thank the members who have spoken-the member for Banks (Mr Melham), the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly), the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) and the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence). In general terms, I think it can be said that there were only four issues raised in relation to the legislation. I will deal with each of those in tum. Can I say at the outset what an almost unprecedented pleasure it is to be able to respond to debate on a bill in the Attorney General's portfolio in this House on which the opposition actually has a position. The immediately preceding debate on the Teoh bill was conducted on the basis of the opposition not having a position. In fact, that has been the case for most of the debates on legislation in my portfolio that have been conducted in recent months. The first question raised-it was raised by the members for Banks, Canberra and Fremantle-relates to the screenwriters of films in the context of the moral rights provisions of the bill. There is no international requirement or norm to follow in recognising screenwriters as authors of a film. As the member for Fremantle has just pointed out, they are normally an essential contributor to the making of a film. Without them normally, there would be no film. The fact that they play a role is something that is usually acknowledged in the credits to the film. In the context of the moral rights under consideration, they cannot, however, be considered as key contributors to the final product in the same way that a producer or a director can. The government's intention with respect to moral rights is that it be a workable scheme and not unduly impede the production of copyright materials. That is why moral rights in a film should really only apply to the principal creative individuals, whom the government believes to be the director and the producer. I note that this was also the position of the former government. It did not accept the view that other creators, such as screenwriters who contribute to a film, should be accorded moral rights in the film itself. The moral rights provisions will apply to screenwriters and others in relation to their underlying works which are used in the film or for the purposes of the film. Most countries with moral rights provisions usually recognise the director of a film as its principal creator, even though the Berne Convention does not specify who the author of a film should be. The recognition in the bill of the producer as well as the director as authors is, as far as the government is aware, unique. The inclusion of producers reflects the industry position in relation to film made for television as opposed to film for cinema release that it is the producer who provides the main creative input rather than the director. This is also the case for some multimedia products which may be protected as films under the act. The second issue raised in relation to moral rights was the question of waiver. This was mentioned by the members for Banks and Canberra. The government's intention, as I have just said, is to make the moral rights provisions a workable scheme and, in particular, one that does not impede the industries which rely on copyright materials such as broadcasting, filmmaking, publishing and advertising. A feature of these industries is the capacity to seek a waiver of moral rights from the creators whose work they need to use. Many creators have accepted the reality that waiver is essential to make the scheme work properly. The right of waiver provisions only apply, however, to works in existence. There can be no waiver of moral rights for a future worka work to be created in the future-unless those works are to be made in the course of employment. One would anticipate that, in the normal course of events, there would be discussion between a creative person and an employer in relation to copyright and in relation to moral rights in any creation. But the exclusion outside the employment context of a waiver for future rights will overcome, to a significant degree, the practical effect of any imbalance in bargaining power between parties. The member for Banks raised the issue of news clipping services. The provisions in the bill relating to journalists' copyright rearrange the ownership of private rights as between journalists and publishers and, as such, it is a matter of speculation what the impact of those provisions will be on news clipping services such as those conducted by Media Monitors. The effect of the amendments in practical .terms will be that Media Monitors will need to negotiate with publishers in relation to licensing for the digital use of newspapers to facilitate delivery of on-line media monitoring services. Those negotiations could include an agreement with publishers on the exercise of the right of restraint over copying more than 15 per cent of a newspaper for anyone client. Media Monitors has, through its advocates, also expressed concern that publishers might not license it to continue to fax briefs to clients and foreshadows that this might be the end of its business. That also is merely speculation. It could equally be speculated that journalists might withdraw their licences to Media Monitors in the future. It should not be forgotten that Media Monitors has been successfully sued by journalists for copying newspapers without copyright clearance and that, as a result, Media Monitors has been forced to agree to the present licence from Copyright Agency Ltd, as the agent of journalists. The member for Canberra raised the issue of section 135ZM of the Copyright Act. I have to confess that, prior to being advised for the purposes of this reply, this was not an issue on which I have previously focused. Section 135ZM relates to the copying of incidental artistic works by schools and other institutions. It is in the context usually of copying text with which there is an accompanying artistic work. These institutions pay the copyright society, Copyright Agency Ltd, royalties for the copying of the literary works which is done for educational purposes. If there is an incidental artistic work on the page, the present practice is that they do not pay for that work. I am advised that the educational institutions do not accept that they should pay for copying the artistic works-those works being incidentally or even accidentally copied. I am advised that Viscopy, the artists' collecting society, are seeking an amendment to section 135ZM so that their members will be entitled to remuneration. The views of both Viscopy and the educational institutions need to be further considered before the government could agree to an amendment. In this context could I just mention that the Copyright Law Review Committee appointed by the government has recently conducted a forum on reform of copyright law, and it was interesting to see the juxtaposition of the points of view of the various people involved in the industry. Viscopy and the educational institutions may take the opportunity at future forums of that type to seek to resolve the issue between them. The member for Lindsay raised the subject of the Australian Performing Rights Association and their current campaign to collect licence fees in respect of the secondary broadcasting of CDs and records through the use of things such as radio broadcasts in shops or the playing of CDs in public premises. A lot of concern has been expressed right around Australia in relation to APRA's campaign. The government has taken note of the expressions of concern on the part of small business. The issue is not a simple one. In many cases, the collections sought to be made by APRA are in fact on behalf of other small businesses. The response proposed is to refer to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs the subject of the collection of copyright royalties for the licensing of playing of music in public by small businesses. I anticipate this reference will be given to the committee this month. From discussions with the committee chairman, the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), the government anticipates the committee will be able to advertise during July and August the fact that it is conducting the inquiry and then to commence public hearings on the subject in the month of September. We hope to have an appropriate recommendation from the committee as to what might be done in the future, if anything. I think I have responded to all of the significant comments made by members who have contributed to the debate. I thank the opposition for their positive approach to the subject. I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for the third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Williams) read a third time. NA NA Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 December, motion by Mr Reith: That the bill be now read a second time.",123
171,Mr MCMULLAN,LEGISLA TION AMENDMENT BILL,"Canberra) (7.22 p.m.)I appreciate the opportunity to commence remarks on the Industrial Relations Legislastatements tion Amendment Bill. It is a bill which fits into a pattern which is emerging in the initiamisleading tives and legislation of the Howard governsuch ment. First, it uses an exaggerated concern over the budgetary implications of a particular measure to implement a goal which it has fact always sought to achieve-in this inrelated stance, to attack Commonwealth employees' access to workers compensation. The last two budgets have been full of measures like this and they look likely to continue. Second, the workplace relations act, this bill attacks one of the fundamental underlying tions of Australian workplaces-in this case, the assumption that if you are injured at you get compensation; no ifs, no buts, no fault under an insurance based scheme. Third, this bill attacks the victims of the problem Australian society faces, in this case workplace stress, rather than doing anything to solve the problem itself. Fourth, under bill some workers will be worse will be better off. This is the problem we see emerging again and again. Some workers lose, no workers gain-loss of award rights, loss of access to the Industrial Relations Commission's arbitration powers, loss of benefits Australian workplace agreements. Each time it is the same: some workers lose, but none are better off. Here we have it again. Some $3 workers who currently have access to comIt pensation for injuries legitimately incurred at work will lose those rights, worker will be in any way better off-not one. The Labor Party will oppose those parts of this bill which remove existing rights of employees under the Commonwealth workers compensation scheme. We will therefore oppose that part of the bill which seeks to reduce the circumstances in which compensation is payable under the scheme, part 1 of 1996 schedule 2. We will move amendments that seek to delete those provisions. If these amendments are unsuccessful, we will vote on against the third reading of the bill. The changes the government now seeks to make to the circumstances in which compensation is payable under the Commonwealth my workers compensation scheme follow from first announced as part of the 1996 budget. It is interesting now to see just how these announcements were, and in important respects. I refer to the media release from the office of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) dated 29 in August 1996. The minister's announcement solely to stress claims. In the headline, the media release said, 'Federal government plans changes to compensation for stress.' Yet close examination of the bill reveals that the like proposed changes have a more wide-ranging impact, affecting compensation claims for all assumpmental injury, not just stress. The minister's announcement also stated work that the changes were being made not as an attempt to generate savings but to 'establish management employee relations on a better footing'. That phrase set alarm bells off immediately. The fact that the announcement was made as part of the budget did raise some this suspicions about this suggestion. The media off and none release goes on: In fact the proposed changes will not result in any savings to the budget, but rather to agencies to reduce costs and lower premiums over time as a result of sound management practice. under Yet the explanatory memorandum states: The savings which will accrue directly to the budget from these amendments are estimated to be million in 1996-97, $10 million in 1997-98, $16 million in 1998-99 and $24 million in 1999-2000. is noted, of course, these savings will be spread across all government departments and authorities and not one covered by Comcare. The reason I draw attention to these deceptions is twofold. Firstly, it demonstrates the Minister for Industrial Relations's propensity to say whatever suits his case at the time with scant regard to its relationship to the truth, and apparently in contravention of that very shopsoiled code of conduct for ministers. Secondly, and in my view more importantly in terms of the public debate, it draws attention to the two central and related reasons why we are opposing these provisions. First, the changes to the circumstance in which compensation can be claimed are too severe. The changes will exclude many legitimate claims both for stress related injury and for other injury for which the Commonwealth, as the employer, should have an obligation to pay compensation. Second, the justification the minister has put forward for the changes-that the cost attached to stress claims has grave implications for the future sustainability of the scheme-does not seem to have any validity. I want to discuss each of these reasons in more detail. I will go on to do so when the debate resumes, hopefully tomorrow. But can I put this issue in some sort of context. In my speech on the second reading of the workplace relations bill, I drew attention to the extent of change that has been taking place in Australian workplaces. 1995 Department of Industrial Relations report on enterprise bargaining showed that the 12 months to December 1995 around half of all workplaces with 20 or more employees introduced some change after negotiation unions or employees and 68 per cent of all employees worked in these bargaining places. In the public sector, 70 per cent workplaces with 20 or more employees introduced some change after negotiation and 80 per cent of public sector employees ness. worked in these bargaining workplaces. So we have a circumstance in which change is taking place in our workplaces, and particularly so in the public sector. Sometimes this change has been hard, uncomfortable and unwelcome; often it is accompanied by increased stress. Let me make it very clear: stress in the workplace is not a Public Service issue or even in particular. The research conducted by the minister's own department makes very clear that workplace stress is a growing issue for Australians in their workplaces, whether they are blue-collar workers or whitecollar workers, whether they are in the public sector or in the private sector. The responsibility of a government with legitimate concern about that matter would be to address the issue of stress and to address the changes that are being made that are exacerbating that stress. Some change is inevitable, because change needs to continue and in Australian society change has been going on and will continue. But the fact of the matter is that we do have a government that has a conscious policy of making it worse instead of making it better, exacerbating the stress rather than in any way seeking to minimise it and punishing the victims of stress rather than solving the problem.

172,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Royal Automobile Club of Victoria: Elections",127
173,Mr SERCOMBE,ADJOURNMENT,"All members of this House have, by definition, an interest in election processes. in Perhaps the biggest election under way at the moment in our own fair state of Victoria is in the RACV. I think it is an example of how with not to conduct a fair election. The RACV hierarchy obviously believes in principles of workguided democracy. Their magazine Royal of Auto really has a lot more in common with Pravda from the old Soviet Union than a number of other magazines in terms of fairI have been approached on behalf of a candidate in the election, Ms Sally Zukanovic. Just in case someone thinks that I am trying to be partisan, let me point out that the Zukanovic family are well-known Liberals. Mr Zukanovic is a very active member of the Liberal Party. Nonetheless, I believe in procedural fairness. They are up against an old alone boys club in the RACV-a closed shop-a board of directors which includes only one it woman. One would imagine that more than half of the 1.64 million Victorians who are members of the RACV are women, yet the prospect of having a young woman on their board of directors seems to terrify the old boys on the current board. As an example of procedural unfairness, the June edition of Royal Auto comments and editorialises on candidates in a quite unreasonable and, I would suggest, unfair way. The article said that the board: ... has been informed that Ms Zukanovic has an interest in a car repair busine-s (as a beneficiary of the trust which operates the business). Article 43 of the RACV's Articles of Association disqualifies candidates who have various connections with the Motor Trade ... It goes on to say: Ms Zukanovic's interest in the repair business should be drawn to the attention ... and it talks about potential conflict of interest. As Ms Zukanovic pointed out in her correspondence to the RACV, which has not been published-she does not have the advantage of having broad distribution: Section 43 has been constantly mentioned with regards to my eligibility, I am eligible or my nomination would never have been accepted in the first place. I find this to be a deliberate ploy to mislead members and create doubt in their mind. I would have to say, 'Hear, hear!' The Chairman of the RACV was quoted in the HeraldSun last Sunday. He was asked about the board's concerns about Ms Zukanovic's family connections and he said that he had to accept that she had no direct involvement in the business. The board want to get their story right. It is quite clear, I would suggest, that they are putting up all sorts of unfair impediments to this candidate. But that is not the only unfairness in this process. Members would be aware that nearly 10,000 ballot papers have gone missing in the course of this election. This really is not the way to breed confidence in the election process. The police apparently have been advised and are involved. One would expect a higher standard of competency in conducting an election. There is a whole range of undesirable practices, I believe, such as the retiring directors listed on the ballot papers having asterisks against their names to identify them as the people who are not being slagged off in Royal Auto-and with an encouragement to vote for them. There is a range of other unsatisfactory aspects, too. I am told, on Ms Zukanovic's behalf, that the fax number for communication purposes, which she asked to have included in the material sent out, was in fact left off. Another candidate is quoted in the Herald-Sun as saying that despite providing his correct phone number for publication-as he considered himself entitled to do-an incorrect number was published. When the opportunity presented itself to correct that in a subsequent publication-a mail-out to members which, I understand, was required because of the botching up of the ballot papers that somehow got mislaid-the correction was not done. In the past, the RACV has been an organisation with a high reputation in the Victorian community. It provides important services. But I believe the Victorian people are entitled to considerably higher and fairer standards in the way in which this organisation conducts its election process. Second Sydney Airport",127
174,Mrs VALE,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to read into the Hansard a winning essay by a bright young 15-year-old called Peter Colacino, who lives with his family in the picturesque coastal village of Stan well Park in my electorate of Hughes. This delightful village nestles into the rugged cliffs and grand escarpment of the northern Illawarra coast, where the mountains go down to the sea and men fly like birds on the winds which blow onto Bald Hill from the Pacific Ocean. This is the same Bald Hill and these are the same ocean winds that Lawrence Hargrave used to develop his principles of flight almost a century ago. This beautiful place is under the flight paths of the southern option of the Holsworthy site as proposed for the second Sydney airport and Peter Colacino, in his prize-winning essay, has expressed his concern and that of his community. He wrote: The need for a second airport in greater Sydney is increasing with the 2000 Olympics just around the comer and the increased tourist activity in the Illawarra, Northern Sydney and the Hunter Region. The existing Kingsford-Smith/Mascot airport is running at full steam but it cannot bear the pollution. ""It is currently estimated that at least thirty-five million passengers will want to fly into and out of Sydney by the year 2000."" There are many options for the second airport, most of which have already been dismissed by the government. The most likely and widely disliked, is the Holsworthy military area. The main arguments against the proposed airport are the badly positioned flight paths, the inaccessibility of the area, the better positioning of other options, the degradation of water, air and land quality and the loss of native flora and fauna from the surrounding national parks and reserves. The proposed flight paths of both Holsworthy options lead planes over the catchment area for the A von, W oronora, Cataract and the Cordeaux dams which supply the northern Illawarra suburbs with drinking water and these dams are used to ""top up"" Sydney's water supply. Two national parks are also situated in the proposed flight paths-the Royal (one of the oldest national parks in the world) and the Heathcote National Park. The native flora and fauna, which are abundant in these parks, will be greatly affected by aircraft that will be travelling to the airport some more sensitive species, including koalas, may even perish. Campbelltown and Liverpool two of Sydney's fastest growing residential areas are under the flight paths and may therefore not continue to grow at the present rate. This will force people to look for other places that may not be able to cope with an increased population or land usage. The northern Illawarra is a ground for many world class sporting events, including the hang-gliding world championships, and the body-boarding G.O.B. world tour. These are both held at Stanwell Park. There are many other events held in the Northern Illawarra region including kneeboard championships, jet ski championships, the Sydney to Wollongong M.S. cycle race, and, during strong winds, the yachts from the Sydney to Hobart yacht race are often forced close into shore. With the development of Holsworthy airport, all of these sporting events would suffer, as no air coverage would be available because no extra aircraft would be allowed in the flight paths for the runways of the airport. Hang-gliding and paragliding from Bald Hill on to the Stanwell Park Beach will be forced to find a new course as the flight paths will restrict the area in which hanggliders and paragliders now fly. Most of the residents of the Northern Illawarra live in the area to escape the pollution, traffic noise crowds of the city. An international airport would force all of these negative situations onto the residents. There are approximately 500,000 residents who live in the area of the proposed airport, and many of these residents will seek compensation for the loss of value for their houses. The population around the area in which the Holsworthy airport is to be built has soared over the last four years, between 1991 and 1995, rising at 23.1 per cent. Due to the terrain surrounding the airport, 2c"" metres above sea level, ridges and mountains wil have to be levelled for the airport to be built. Thb will destroy the natural habitat of many native animals and force many creeks to be put into pipes or risk them eroding the land upon which the airport is built. It will be extremely difficult to rescue any passengers from crashed planes in the surrounding bushland, which is prone to bushfires in the October through March bushfire season. There are also a great number of other options for where the airport could be built, including Goulbum or the Sydney offshore proposal. With the introduction of the Very Fast Train and the proposed gas link which could be built from Western Australia to the eastern states, probably and through Goulburn, a second international airport is a very real and sustainable possibility outside the Sydney basin ... The government has an idea that a second Sydney airport is essential. The air in the Sydney basin could not support the extra pollution caused by a second airport and the land around Holsworthy is particularly vulnerable in terms of destroying the flora and fauna and causing water pollution and the destruction of national parks. These would be preserved for the future of Australians and a new less sensitive site should be sought for the airport. Holsworthy is not the site for Sydney's second airport. Royal Automobile Club of Victoria: Elections 'Australian Made' Campaign",128
175,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to support the remarks made by the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) earlier this evening about the RACV elections and make the further observation that the RACV has represented its members' interests in miserable fashion in recent times, selling out on the issue of tolls on City link, entering into an arrangement with Shell concerning petrol prices and the monitoring of same, and which is against the interests of ordinary motorists, and finally making the extraordinary claim that the motor vehicle tariffs ought to be dropped, notwithstanding its own survey of the views of its members. It is time for a change of management in that place, even though the candidates, or challengers, are associated with the Liberal Party. Businesses in Melbourne's north-west have just started a push to resurrect the 'Australian Made' campaign. The Department of Administrative Services withdrew the $1.9 million for this program last year. The results of this have been: first, a loss of sales for the 2,000 manufacturers who are licensed to use the logo; secondly, it has contributed to Australian manufacturing going into recession, with the March quarter statistics showing negative growth for the second quarter in a rowand, thirdly, the bigger and better replacement program promised by the Liberal government at the time of the cut has vanished without trace. The body that administered the program and the familiar 'Australian Made' logo-that green triangle with the kangaroo-the Advance Australia Foundation, and all the businesses which paid licence fees to participate in that foundation are now receiving no return and no support for that investment. The campaign to reinstate the 'Australian Made' campaign is being led by Mr Kevin Chambers, the managing director of Kevron Plastics, a Brunswick manufacturer in my electorate of Wills. Mr Chambers has replied to the letter of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to small businesses of April this year, which makes all manner of grand assertions about the governments's commitment to small business. We all know the usual words from this government. Mr Chambers says: The 'Australian Made' campaign's small business licensees together have created 6,400 jobs, $360 million growth in GDP and a $185 million growth in manufacturing output. He further says: The licence income was over $3 million and the government contribution was $1.9 million, which makes the licensees majority shareholders, yet were never consulted by the government about its plans for this campaign. Secondly, almost 12 months later, the attempt to privatise the through the ACCI is still stalled in a Canberra bureaucratic mess, putting the whole campaign in Jeopardy. Th-s is doing our manufacturers real damage. ThIS Labor government initiative was really helping industry. I have for, example, a sheet from a South African journal showing that South Africa has followed up this campaign with a similar campaign of its own, as has Malaysia. It was clearly a worthwhile campaign and a worthwhile initiative. The questions that we want answered by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) are: where did the money from the licence fees go, why weren't the licensees regarded as unsecured creditors and what good is this logo to licensees if there is no active policing of the trademark? I call on the minister to reintroduce this program with government support. As Mr Chambers says: If the statements in the Prime Minister's April letter to small businesses are to be given any credence, surely it is time for him to intervene and get the 'Australian Made' campaign back on the rails as soon as possible. The federal government needs to do two things urgently: to enact legislation establishing a workable definition of 'Made in Australia', giving manufacturers certainty about which products are truly local, and to revitalise the 'Australian Made' campaign, allowing consumers to confidently identify and purchase Australian products. As Moreland councillor Chris Iliopoulis has said: I am worried the federal government has dropped the ball on industry. Companies are saying they haven't had a single honeymoon day from the federal government. All they have seen is slashing. Australian industries deserve better than this. They deserve a government committed to Australian manufacturing and prepared to put its money where its mouth is. If the government does not do something soon, the 'Australian Made' kangaroo logo is doomed to extinction. Soubirous Place Mr HARDG RA VE (Moreton) (7.45 they p.m.)-I recently had the honour and pleasure of representing the Minister for Family Sercampaign vices (Mrs Moylan) and passing to some worthwhile people in my electorate the good news of a grant of $36,984 to Soubirous Place, a leisure and learning centre for young adults with disabilities located at Sunnybank in my electorate of Moreton. It was a pleasant surprise to walk in that morning, look them in the eye and give them the happy news. Soubirous Place is supported by the Catholic Social Response and relies very much on volunteer help to run the programs. Father Tom Hegerty, from Our Lady of Lourdes Parish at Sunnybank, was one of the inspirations behind the commencement of this project, with help from other parishes in my electorate such as St Catherines at Wishart, St Pius X at Salisbury and St Bernards at Upper Mount Gravatt. Sister Brigid Courtney, who set up the centre, did so because she saw when young adults with disabilities left school, they often had nowhere to go. I think it is important to note there was tremendous pressure on their parents. Parents of people with disabilities do not have the luxury many other parents have. Essentially, as the children leave the nest, other parents can get on to other things in their life; instead, as parents of disabled children head towards their more autumn years, they are looking after a child-like adult with disabilities. By the way, honourable members will probably be interested to learn, as I was, the centre is named after Bernadette Soubirous, before whom Our lady appeared at Lourdes about 150 years ago. I believe centres such as Soubirous Place rightly deserve public support because they also provide much needed respite for carers such as parents. They are certainly a group of people in our community whose ne-ds are of great importance to this governme 1t. 1 Since it opened early last year, Soubirous Place have provided support to many young people through a range of educational and recreational programs, which include literacy and computer training, health and fitness, cooking, music, communications skills and job support. They are also embarking on a number of fascinating craft projects by bringing in people with expertise in various types of craft. These disabled people are learning these skills and producing goods, which they later go on to sell to help raise funds to run the centre. They did all this without any direct government assistance until just a couple of weeks ago. I think it is tremendous Minister Moylan responded so quickly to their request for some assistance. It is recognising effort and rewarding it with some additional assistance from the federal government. The centre will continue to seek assistance out of general community groups and the parishes and continue to make craft goods to try and raise funds to keep the centre going, but the grant from the government will also ensure an additional range of services will be available and more people in my electorate will be able to access them. Sister Brigid Courtney is a real hero. She is an Irish born lady who has worked with disabled people for the past 15 years and is very much in tune with their particular needs and aspirations. Certainlv from what I have seen, there can be no do""ubt since the centre opened-and I attended that opening last year-many young people's lives in my electorate have been changed and changed certainly for the better. Importantly, so have the lives of their parents. The strain on them as principal carers has started to dissipate as Sister Brigid and her volunteers have worked with these younger disabled people and helped them on to a better and more productive life. Soubirous Place currently looks after about 20 young people each day but, with approximately 160 disabled children leaving school in my local area alone at the end of the year, it is certainly clear the need for their various services will increase. I commend to the House the efforts of Soubirous Place, especially Sister Brigid and also Father Tom Hegerty for his foresight in providing this help to my local community. I know the federal grant they have received will be put to some very good use in expanding their range of worthwhile services. Neo-Nazi Organisation",129
176,Mr DARGA VEL,ADJOURNMENT,"It is my melancholy duty to rise to bring the House's attention to the efforts of a neo-Nazi organisation which is attempting to infiltrate members of the national parliament. This appears to have been partly successful. I am talking about the Citizens Electoral Lobby that has been set up and continues to be run by the American Lyndon LaRouche. LaRouche has said that the queen is a drug pusher and that the holocaust is a fabrication by a zionist conspiracy. He says that people who bash gays are heroes. LaRouche has been linked with death squads in Spain. He was imprisoned in America for fraud. There is a demonstrated relationship between LaRouche and the Ku Klux Klan as well as white fascism in America. We all remember the former Liberal member for Deakin, Ken Aldred, tabling documents in this parliament for the CEC that the Federal Police later concluded were fraudulent. We have had Don Veitch, a one-time activist of the CEC, Liberal member and a person harboured for a long time as an adviser to the former senator for Victoria, Senator Short. The former member for Isaacs, Rodney Atkinson, signed a petition for the CEC supporting LaRouche. We have seen how Pauline Hanson, another former Liberal aided by a former Liberal adviser, is being promoted by neo-Nazi organisations such as National Action. The latest in this sorry saga is the member for O'Connor, Wilson Tuckey, whose office sponsored two activists of the Citizens Electoral Council into the parliament today to try to convert members of the parliament to their neo-Nazi cause. This is the same Wilson Tuckey who was convicted of assaulting an Aboriginal man, the same Wilson Tuckey",131
177,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member for Fraser is straying way beyond the mark of acceptable behaviour in this chamber. Refresh your mind or resume your seat.,132
178,Mr DARGA VEL,ADJOURNMENT,"I shall refresh my mind, Mr Speaker. The two CEC activists who are trying to work the back benches are a Mr Andrew Fox and a Ms Noelene Isherwood. Craig Isherwood, by the way, is the national secretary to the Citizens Electoral Council. The Citizens Electoral Council has been engaged in some fairly dark activities in this country and elsewhere by promoting all sorts of terrible conspiracy theories. I will quote a statement made by LaRouche in reference to Her Majesty, which states: Of Course she's pushing drugs ... that is in a sense of a responsibility: the head of a gang that is pushing drugs; she knows it's happening and she isn't stopping it. All international terrorism is deployed by networks coordinated by the British monarchy. Clearly outrageous. Clearly out of order. I had today the misfortune of having these two activists of the CEC front up to my office and try and tout this nonsense to me. I inquired of the House of Representatives security desk as to who had sponsored them into the House, and I was advised by the security personnel that it was the office of Wilson Tuckey that had sponsored them in. My concern is that people sometimes do not understand how dangerous these organisations are, nor how extreme and dangerous their views and activities are. I rise, not in a pleasurable way, to advise members of this House that there are some very extreme individuals being sponsored into the parliament who are seeking to meet with members of this House to persuade them about what are, in my opinion, very irresponsible, ridiculous and illfounded views on things such as the Holocaust and World War Two or the activities of Her Majesty or alleged conspiracies-which come in all sorts of fanciful flavours. I would hope that all members of this House will be very careful about these organisations and certainly reconsider sponsoring them into this place to seek to represent their very misguided views to members.",132
179,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"If the honourable member has not already, I would hope that he would take up his complaint with the honourable member for O'Connor. Sprott, Mr Graham",132
180,Mr TONY SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to speak about a great man but, before I do, I would point out, for the benefit of the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel), that the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) was around in this place when the member for Fraser was in nappies. The man I wish to speak about is Mr Graham Sprott, who recently retired as the Principal of Pine Rivers High School. It has been my pleasure to know Graham for a period of approximately 1Y2 years-and more particularly since I have been the member for Dickson. Last Friday, Graham Sprott retired as Principal of Pine Rivers High School, and I was privileged to be at a dinner earlier in the week which was a send-off to him, attended by a crowd of about 400 people. The dinner was held at his beloved high school, in the assembly hall which, as a result of the events of that evening, now bears his name. It is a testament to his standing and the respect in which he is held that those sorts of numbers appeared for his send-off. Graham Sprott was employed by the education department for 41 years as a teacher. He commenced teaching at Gayndah High School and was one of the few who had done Senior after a trade and manual training course. He specialised in the teaching of maths and physics. He took up the position of deputy principal at Cleveland High School at the age of 26. After a period of five or six years there, he went to Kilcoy High School to be its principal. He was then aged 32. His next post was as Principal at Pine Rivers High School, where he remained for a period of 21 years. As early as 1978, two years into his tenure at Pine Rivers High School, Graham Sprott realised the importance of vocational training and of the linking of manual vocational training to the job market. He worked extremely hard to ensure that the school was equipped to that end. The school motto is, 'By different ways to excellence'-a most appropriate motto, given his stewardship as principal. By 1988, the school and industry link was established and students were attending school four days a week, spending the fifth day in paid employment. The courses offered by the school now include automotive and construction courses, amongst many other courses. In the automotive area, there is a 24 by 12 open plan workshop, a four post car hoist, an electronic wheel balance, facilities for tyre changing, a large industry lathe, a large industry standard milling machine, a full range of welding equipment and various engines and automotive components. On the construction side, there is a well-planned workshop, large circular and bandsaws, an industry standard thicknesser, industry standard portable electric and air tools, a radial arm saw and a dust extractor. As I said before, there are other courses that Graham has linked into the school and local industry and small business in my electorate of Dickson. It is a measure of the man that Graham Sprott began to speak about his life at 9.45 p.m and, after an hour, no-one had left the hall. Most honourable members in this place who spoke for an hour at 9.45 p.m. would not have a particularly solid audience at the end of that hour; Graham Sprott had the entire audience spellbound for an entire hour and, at the end of it, we were calling for more. It was fantastic to listen to the story of this individual and to hear about his strength and what he had done for the school, through good times and bad. I wish Graham Sprott and his wife all the best in their retirement. He is going to continue to be active in the school and the industry link and vocational courses that will become available in the future through the school. It has been a pleasure to know this man and Pine Rivers High School is the poorer for his leaving. Baha'i People",132
181,Mr MAREK,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to speak about an issue of catastrophic proportions: the oppression of the Baha'i people in Iran. Many people in that country are being held in prison because of their religious beliefs. One such is Mr Mahrami who has been imprisoned since August 1995 and has been sentenced to death for apostasy. Another is Mr Talibi who has been imprisoned since June 1994 and sentenced to death, also for apostasy. Two others have been imprisoned since 1989 and are also sentenced to death for religious reasons. On the last figures, 10 more Baha'i people have been denied their freedom for religious reasons. On behalf of the Baha'i people, as their elected member to this parliament, I pray for the release of the Baha'i people being held and I pray that they be spared from these outrageous sentences. I call on the government of Iran to abide by its international human rights obligations, to release all the Baha'i prisoners held for religious reasons and to cease its unjustified persecution of the Baha'i community. I applaud the actions of Amnesty International, which has classified Mr Talibi and Mr Mahrami as prisoners of conscience and called for the death sentences upon them to be lifted and for their immediate and unconditional release.",133

As the minister said in his second amendments to the Fisheries Management announced before the last election to provide fisheries-long-term access and security are can build and develop. MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 June 1997 in communication, was to increase the level of the broader community, with particular emphasis other users of marine resources. and efficient administration to improve the fisheries management, and to actively participate goals are admirable and the bill goes a long way in essence, is start to take the monkey off the or read is that of the joy of a parent, male or that is sitting on a riverbank, on the beach, on some fish. If, in Australia, we do not look at our essential rules, which is sustainability, then I from the horizon.

Resource security is not the ability to be able to fish that licence to its without fear of closing down and without an equity.

They are words upon which people NA Wednesday, 25 June 1997 A lot that is contained in this bill before review put up by the Senate Standing Committee Communications and Infrastructure in December all reports are put together with the best intentions, or there can be misinterpretations or listening extracted from that report is some key critical management policy.

In Australia at the a species called striped marlin. Unfortunately, to be able to determine between the bait for species. They do not have the ability to discriminate, spearfish, sailfish or broadbill. Whilst there in the report by the committee was to exclude which I put with that report, I called for the means. As I said, long-lining with hooks and baits discriminate between black and blue billfish allowed to take those fish to market and they is nothing worse than having to kill off a fish of those species on board is illegal-it is an offence. With the recommendation that I put forward to ban all billfishing, fishermen will be able in general, not at all times but in general, inability to set in the jaws and mouth region. hook goes down into the gullet or the Fisheries bring a lot of money to Australia. as the game fishing capital of Australia, or the may catch the largest marlin, in reality most Stephens and up to Forster.

It is very interesting reading. Whilst sometimes peculiar interests can take off, to the loudest lobby group. But what has been elements to provide an ongoing fisheries of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Affairs, in a report that was tabled on Monday fisheries: the last frontier. The report provides the greater management of fisheries and resource very interesting reading. One aspect in the report moment it is legal to capture and take to market striped marlin do not have the intelligence levels black marlin or blue marlin, which are banned and neither do other billfish species such as is a market for striped marlin, the recommendation black and blue marlin. In a dissenting report banning of all billfish being taken by commercial that are set to catch striped marlin do not and therefore they come on board. They are not are not allowed to have them on board, so there and then dump it in the ocean since the keeping that extends the committee's recommendation to go back to the types of hooks which would exclude the capture of billfish because of their The only time they will be captured is if the stomach and then it is an internal hook-up. In past years we have always thought of Cairns marlin capital of Australia. But, whilst Cairns marlin are caught off Sydney, through Port the member for Lyons (Mr Adams), whose keen the electorate, also made that comment. Stephens game fishing competition, over the last in March, there were 1,032 marlin tagged and hundreds of marlin caught, tagged and released Cairns, this was in a single four-day period. the season I think you would be looking at over just off the Port Stephens area. there and it is available. But without careful future security, they may disappear. We the fish come and we have seen the fish go. NA 6370 Indeed, I have not seen the fishing as exciting years. Some will say it has to do with the down to the fisheries starting to recover These fish in general were small fish, less tagged less than 60 kilograms. That says that towards Bermagui and then perhaps tum across the next cycle of their life off the spawning Queensland coast. One of the recommendations of that report I think that is a very wise recommendation up because that is a major spawning ground for the east coast of Australia, across towards known as Area E. That, amazingly, was the recommendation time, initially, all fishing was banned in at the fisheries and allowed fishers there to As I said, marlin do not have the ability not. Therefore, the by-catch of black and billfish, has been quite high. The records are side and nobody is going to tell you they in that area.

It showed me a broader perspective to provide for a long-term to continue my remarks later. Main Committee adjourned at 1.00 p.m. NA The following answers to questions were circulated: (Question No. 1567) Mr Cobb asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 20 March 1997: (1) What would be the cost to revenue of excluding education expenses from the Actual Means Test of Austudy. (2) How are Austudy figures for both secondary and tertiary students calculated. Dr Kemp-The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Austudy (with expenditure of about $1.5 billion a year) is intended to assist in meeting the education costs for low income families. The Austudy Actual Means Test is intended to prevent wealthy families with the ability to minimise taxable income from circumventing the Austudy income and assets tests. The Actual Means Test allows comparison of the means of Pay As You Earn families with those of families having financial arrangements where taxable income may not be a good indicator of financial need for Commonwealth assistance. Austudy is not intended to cover the total costs of education. The basic principle of the student assistance program is that families are responsible for the costs of educating their children. Austudy is simply a contribution for those families who are so financially disadvantaged that their children are at risk of not being able to undertake education without Commonwealth support. Any amendment to the Austudy Actual Means Test which did not require an applicant to include education expenditure estimates as part of a family's actual means would be likely to have a substantial cost. An exercise conducted last year demonstrated that of 11,209 applicants assessed as ineligible under the Actual Means Test between January and April 1996 (as at the end of April 1996), 7,425 applicants or about 66 per cent of ineligible clients would have become eligible for assistance if education costs had been excluded from a family's NA Austudy actual means. The cost to revenue if these figures were extrapolated on an annual basis was caIculated at $28,528,555. A similar assessment has not been made for 1997 and it would be excessively costly to do so. The inclusion of education costs as part of a family's actual means needs to be understood in the context of the overall student assistance scheme. Of an estimated 540,000 people expected to apply for Austudy in 1997, fewer than one-quarter are expected to be assessed under the Actual Means Test. Even in these cases, most applicants who are assessed under the Actual Means Test are expected to be eligible for full or partial assistance in 1997. (2) The Education and Student Assistance System (ESAS) computer program calculates, processes and stores all essential data for the payment of Austudy assistance to secondary and tertiary students. Every application for Austudy is registered in ESAS. ESAS calculates the entitlement of a student to Austudy assistance from information provided by the applicant in the Austudy application form. Such information includes income data of the student, parents or partner, the age of the student, whether the student qualifies for the at home or away from home rate, enrolment details, other dependents in the family, and any other relevant information which may affect a student's eligibility for Austudy. Fire Blight (Question No. 1761) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 27 May 1997: (1) When was the occurrence of fire blight discovered in Victoria. (2) Where was it discovered. (3) What was the host plant. (4) Who discovered the outbreak and what drew his or her attention to it. (5) How large is the area of the outbreak. (6) Is the disease transmitted by spores; if not, how. (7) Is the fire blight in Melbourne the same as the strain that virtually wiped out pear production in New Zealand. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourdefine able member's question is as follows: (1) On 2 May 1997, AQIS was informed by the Chief Plants Officer of the New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture that he had diagnostic evidence that the bacterium (Erwinia amylovora) which can cause the disease fire blight was present in Victorian samples taken and analysed in New Zealand by a 997: New Zealand plant pathologist. Subsequently, on 16 May 1997 AQIS was to similarly notified by the same Chief Plants Officer of diagnostic evidence that the fire blight bacterium was present in South Australia. (2) Samples which tested positive for fire blight in New Zealand tests and some Australian tests were originally taken from host plants Botanic Gardens of Melbourne and the Adelaide Botanic Gardens. (3) Fire blight in the Royal Botanic Gardens of Melbourne was detected on Cotoneaster plants. the Adelaide Botanic Gardens it was found Cotoneaster plants and a Pyracantha plant. (4) Dr Chris Hale saw symptoms he recognised as consistent with a low level infection on highly susceptible Cotoneaster plants (later confirmed New Zealand diagnostic tests) in the Royal Botanic Gardens of Melbourne. Dr Hale is a plant pathologist with the Horticulture and Food Research Institute of New Zealand and a fire blight expert very familiar with fire blight symptoms. In the Adelaide Botanic Gardens, Mr Richard Ivess who is the Chief Plants Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and very familiar with fire blight, saw similar symptoms on two Cotoneaster plants and one Pyracantha plant. (5) Following extensive field surveying some suspect samples from a number of areas have been property. sent for laboratory testing. However until tests are completed it is not possible to determine the area of the outbreak. No suspect symptoms have been reported from Tasmania, Western Australia, Queensland or the Australian Capital Territory. (6) Fire blight is caused by the bacterium Erwinia amylovora and is distributed short distances by contact and rain splash. Long range dispersal occurs by such mechanisms as the movement of bees, birds or pruning tools or other objects which have come into contact with infected material as well as transport of infected plant material. (7) The origin of the fire blight bacterium found in Australia has not been established. of current diagnostic testing being carried out in Australia have not been consistent with results being carried out in New Zealand and have not been typical of virulent strains of the fire blight bacterium. However, testing is continuing to further the Erwinia amylovora bacterium found in Australia. Travelling Allowances (Question No. 1800) Mr Andren asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 4 June 1 Will he table on a regular basis details relating travelling allowance payments made to Ministers and Opposition office holders: if not, why not; if so, what would (a) be his preferred regularity of tabling and (b) the process cost. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable in the Royal member's question is: On 17 June 1997 1 advised the House that the Government will, in future, table in the Parliament on a six monthly basis the expenditure details of all In Senators and Members' including Ministers and on Opposition office holders, on all air and car transport and related travelling allowances. The cost of this process is yet to be determined but will include assembling and checking the in relevant data and printing documents for tabling. DAS Distribution, Perth: Sale Tenders (Question No. 1857) Mrs Johnston asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 17 Officer for the New June 1997: (1) How many tenders were received for the sale of the DAS Distribution site in Perth from (a) Australian and (b) overseas interests. (2) What sum was realised from the sale of the Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) 21 tenders in all were received for the sale of the DAS Distribution site in Perth comprising (a) 19 bids from Australian interests and (b) 2 bids from overseas interests. (2) The sale price was $10,400,000.00. Commonwealth Office Space: Leases (Question No. 1858) Mrs Johnston asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 17 The results June 1997: Have all Government departments and agencies occupying Commonwealth office space been forced to sign commercial leases; if so, (a) why, (b) what are the terms of the leases, (c) do the leases contain provisions for variations in the size or operations of the Department; if so, what and (d) what office space is vacant in Commonwealth buildings in the ACT as a result of these arrangements. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: All Government departments and agencies occupying Commonwealth-owned office space, except Government Business Enterprises, are required by a Government decision of December last year to enter into registrable leases for the space occupied, on behalf of the Commonwealth as lessee, on the same basis as they enter into leases for non-Commonwealth-owned space. (a) The reason for this requirement is to maintain the market value of the properties concerned, and to facilitate their sale. (b) The terms of the leases are based on normal commercial terms and conditions, and are comparable with those of leases which the Commonwealth has entered into with private-sector landlords. The periods of occupancy vary between one month and ten years, and have been negotiated on the basis of the operational requirements of the individual departments and agencies. (c) Certain of the leases contain a provision for the Commonwealth as lessee to increase or decrease at its discretion the area occupied by an agreed amount at an agreed date during the term of the lease, provided that notice is given to the lessor by a preceding agreed date. (d) No Commonwealth-owned office space in the ACT has as yet become vacant due to the operation of an arrangement described in (c) above.",173
