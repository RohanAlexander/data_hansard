1,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"Perth) [2.31] - I wish to make a personal explanation. Last session, speaking in this Chamber upon the proposed redistribution of the electoral divisions of Western Australia, I identified the Commissioner appointed for that purpose with a previous redistribution, and made deductions uncomplimentary to him. On my return to Perth he wrote to me, pointing out that he was not responsible for the previous redistribution, and on going into the matter, I found that he was not. I therefore wrote him the following letter, which I shall read here, so that it may be recorded in Hansard as a reply to my former statement, which I regret:Commonwealth Offices, Perth, 18/2/10. Dear Sir, I am in receipt of your letter and enclosures. I regret very much that this matter was not brought under my notice by you at an earlier date, as I find I have undoubtedly done you an injustice in ' identifying you with ""the proposed rearrangement of the. electorate in 1903. Had you called my attention to this mistake of mine while Parliament was sitting I would .have at once apologized in the House, so that Hansard would have shown the .correction - If , however, I go back after this election I shall certainly take the earliest opportunity to withdraw my' erroneous statement. I exceedingly regret it, ns it has ever been my aim, as a public man. to be very careful not to do an injustice, in my speeches, to public officials who of course have not an equal opportunity of defending themselves. This is the first incident of this' kind, so far as I am aware, in the whole of my public career,^and I am particularly sorry that I should have made this blunder in connection with the work of a highly-respected official of my own . State.",14

3,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,I do not wish to say. My desire is to clear this gentleman the imputations which I cast upon him regarding it. SURPLUS REVENUE BILL.,15
4,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"As the Labour following papers:party and the Labour Government have included in their programme a proposal to allocate to the States the sum of 25s - per capita for a term of ten years, wirl the Prime Minister consider the propriety of inserting in the Surplus Revenue Bill a clause which I suggested last session, authorizing the Executive to enter into a contract with the States which will bind future Governments, and give a feeling of security, by reason of the fact that the States will be able to sue the Commonwealth, for any breach of the agreement? This was done in the Naval Agreement Act of 1903, and will be done in the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill, when the agreement with the South Australian Government has been ratified by Parliament.",15
5,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I do not agree with the honourable member that the position created by the Surplus Revenue Bill will be the same as that created by the other measures which he has mentioned, but the Government will readily take into consideration the suggestion which he has been kind enough to make. FEDERAL CAPITAL. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Will the 'Treasurer consent to provide in the Estimates annually a sum of not less than ^250,000 for the construction of the Federal Capital, providing that unexpended ''balances shall be paid into a trust account?",15

14,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The answers to honourable member's questions are1. No. No advice was asked from or given by the Crown Law Department of Western Australia. 2. The prosecution was directed by the Department of Trade and Customs, and approved by my predecessor and myself. The evidence in the possession of the Department amply justified the prosecution; but the evidence called for the defence apparently satisfied the jury that the falsity of the medical report was not w i l f 3.

Day and States debts. We were told the other day that the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General were Hume busily engaged revising the Governor General 's Speech; and the general opinion of course, that the Attorney-General is responsible for the writing of it. I could not help thinking, when I saw the Governor General's Speech for the first time, and noted this reference to the States debts, of the attitude which the honourable member for West Sydney assumed during the election upon this very question.

Here is what he is reported to have said at the meeting referred toAs regarded the States debts question, the Daily Telegraph had pointed out that the fer of the debts to the Commonwealth meant the control of borrowing by the Commonwealth, and that meant putting the snuffer on the States Rights candle.

However, I shall pass that by, with many other things which did duty in the election, and The helped my honourable friends opposite very considerably to win the position they hold today. One of the things that we met with in our State at every turn, was a deliberate statement made by the Attorney General, and scattered broadcast over the country, that we were about to bring in duties on tea, kerosene, and cotton goods. That is a statement that we were up to the neck in, so far as the multiplicity of pamphlets and dodgers were concerned. trans- Everywhere they said, ""These men are going to tax you further. They are going to tax the poor people by putting further duties on those articles."" I want to congratulate the honourable member for Nepean, who stated his views briefly last night, on the ease with which he passes from the severe condemnation and denunciation of the taxing of the poor man's requisites to his first action as a Federal member, in introducing a deputation from the kerosene works to ask for a duty, or a bonus, on this very article. I congratulate the honourable member on the difference between then and now.",20

72,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Not necessarily. I should have to please myself about that, but I did not go about the country telling the people that the honourable member and his party were going to tax those very articles, and urging them, whatever they did, to vote against them, so that those articles could remain upon the free list as now. I shall say nothing of the lie about the married couples with encumbrances, also did excellent duty for my honourable friends opposite, especially for the torney-General. I shall say nothing either of statements made by the honourable memthrown ber for Cook, in which he held up to opwith probrium some naval rates which had lately come into operation, and which he dedoes scribed as "" Fusion sweating."" I hope that "" Fusion sweating"" has been swept away now.",20

Why did not the honourable member tell them also that the rates which he nounced as "" Fusion sweating"" were payof ments plus rations, which makes all the difference in the world in the value of wages paid ?",21

76,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Ver y well, I for hope they no longer exist. There has been ample time to obliterate them. Honourable members opposite have now been three months in office. Are those rates still in existence, and, if so, what has my honorparty, able friend been doing after writing all stuff he did about "" Fusion sweating?"" sweating is still going on. I shall simply mention, in passing, the lies about the lax administration of the Immigration tion Act. They have beendisproved out of the mouth of the present Minister, who says he has found nothing unusual going on consistent. in that Department.",21
77,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He has been converted. power. He has gone to a Chinese restaurant.,21
78,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I remember able how, at a previous election, the honourable Wales, while member for Lang was trounced by that Protection gentlemen the Labour supporters' from end to end of our State, because he dared, in company with the honourable member for Parkes, to attend a banquet given Chinese residents, who were anxious show their appreciation of the way in which those honourable members had battled in difference. this House against the introduction of opium to Australia. It is a pity that honourable members were not in the caucus at the time. If they had been, what they did would have been accounted a virtue.",21
79,Mr HALL,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I think the honourable memwhich ber is overstating it.,21
80,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I assure the Athonorable member that I am not, because 1 had to dodge some eggs which were at my honourable friend in connection that very matter. It seems to be all"" right when a member of the Labour caucus this kind of thing. Be in the caucus, and you can do almost anything you like.",21
81,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That sounds like freedom.,21
82,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It does, but it is the little freedom allowed the slave. and So long as the caucus can own when you, it allows you a little freedom that occasionally. I am. referring now, of over course, not to matters concerning the platform of the Labour party, but to matters which concern their general propadeganda, and general attitude towards some these racial and industrial questions. I should like to mention, in passing, that we the found the Labour propaganda, while, I presume, the policy was the same in all the States, differentiated in strict accord with the geographical position in which it found itself. For instance, the honourable member Darling told the people at Dubbo, whatever they did, not to put the Fusion crowd in. If they did, he asked, what chance would there be for Protection? He said there were thirty-seven Free-traders in this and that, therefore, Protection was the in danger. On almost the same evening, The the Attorney-General was giving the honourable member for Lang a help up in his electorate, and telling the people that FreeRestrictrade was in danger.",21
83,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I think it was perfectly Everything was in danger while the honourable member's party was in,21
84,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But the honormember did not say so. He said that Free-trade was in danger in New South in Victoria said was in clanger over here.,21
85,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member for Ballarat spoke at Ballarat very differby ently from the honourable member for to Parramatta on that question.,21
86,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am not aware of any,21
87,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Neithe r am I those aware of it. My position is quite clear. I occupy the same position now as before I went to the election. I promised the rectification of anomalies, in accordance with the Protectionist Tariff, and am in the same position today. However, my honourable friends are here now, and we behold the glorification and the apotheosis of the caucus. A great many honourable members on the other side have been tor 'the last few days using the plural pronoun "" we,"" pointing out "" what we are going to do."" I congratulate them, and, if they take mv advice, some of them will stick to the' caucus. It will be well for them and their positions if they do so. They, at any rate, will find it hard to go alone. They may take this much of experience and autobiography from me, that they will find it is not an easy thing to escape from the caucus. If ever they do, they will realise what bitter brutality can be associated with ;he Labour caucus, and so they will do well to stick to it, and get all they can out of it for themselves and for their movement. There is safety in the caucus for' them if not for others. The other day I came across a passage in Todd's Parliamentary Practice which shows very clearly how, from time immemorial, this has been recognised. The writer^ saysMr Hare in his work on representation gives the experience of the late Sidney Herbert of the effect of the decline of party control in the House of Commons. The extent to which the old system of subordination to party leaders was sometimes carried may be inferred from the humorous description of an old Scotch member (Ferguson, of Pitfour), who was a staunch  Honourable members will see that this was some little while ago and who used to say, "" I was never present at any debate I could avoid, or absent at any sion I could get at. I have heard many arguparison, ments which convinced my judgment, but never what else is on the old page. one that influenced my vote. I never voted once according to my opinion, and that was the worse vote I ever gave. I found that the way to be quiet in Parliament was always vote with the Ministers.""",21
88,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He was not a Labour man.,22
89,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"He may have been, though the passage refers to a stateThe ment made so long ago that the identity of the speaker is almost lost in the of time. If we substitute the word "" Caucus "" for the word "" Ministers,"" the remarks which I have made would fit the clean round coal? case of honourable members opposite today. The honourable member for Corio, speaking last night, said, "" Our party is not afraid of change."" I hope that no party is afraid of change; our party certainly is not.",22
90,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Any change would be welcome to it.,22
91,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am willing to allow the honourable member to enjoy his present position longer. The change to which he refers will come in good time, and Ministers will bring it about. Let them not imagine that, because they now hold power and authority, everything is well with the world. Already they are beginning to make, on the average, as many mistakes as have been made by any set of predecessors. Indeed, they have already made more than the average number of blunders committed by any Ministry of which I have recollection. I would point out to the honourable member for Corio that activity and change do not necessarily mean progress. The drunken man who put his wooden leg into a hole, and walked round and round all night under the mistaken impression that he was going home, did not progress, although he was active enough. What is material is the whence and whither of the change. The honourable member for Brisbane has told us that a new page in the history of Australia has been opened. I hope that this new page will be filled with records typifying greater blessings and progress for the Commonwealth. If my honourable friends can accomplish that, there will be no word of complaint from me. But what is on the old page?",22
92,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,A lot of blots.,22
93,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , because to err is human. There will be blotches oft the new page .too, though how many redivimains to be seen. For the sake of a comsay three years hence, let me state I find it but written there that today bricklayers are only heing paid as much as 13s. a day; that ento gineers get a minimum wage of ios. a day, but receive as an ordinary normal payment from 12s. to 14s. Carpenters get 10s. as a minimum, but, according to the newspapers, are in Melbourne refusing us. Newcastle coal miners are getting 4s. 2d. a ton. I do not know what miners are night being paid in the West just now.",22
94,Mr CANN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,is . iofd.,22
95,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is that for,22
96,Mr CANN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,For shovel-filled coal.,22
97,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The miners of Newcastle have reached the highest wages level yet attained. The minimum wage for painters and plasterers is ios., and for ironfoundets 12s. a day, while journeymen tailors receive a mimimum of £ 2 15s. a week. Thesefigureshave been taken from the official record of Mr Addison, the Registrar of the Arbitration Court of New South Wales, who gives them as the rates ruling today. That is the record on the page which my honourable friends opposite say is io be the jumping-off point for their party. We shall be able to measure, later on, the progress which is made under their rule; because, I take it. all policies propagated by them ought to translate themselves into the comfort and welfare of the working man. He is the unit of our industrial system. If he does well, the country must prosper. I hope never to see the day when the country will prosper at the expense of those who toil. I put these rates on record so that we may compare them later with the results of the policy brought about by the political upheaval which has affected alike the just and unjust, and has sent into private life men who graced Parliament for many years, and did themselves and the country honour by their services. Honourable members opposite are in a position of almost unparalleled strength. It is not because tlieir majority is so overwhelming, but because it is so compact, that they have such power. The majority is one upon which they can always rely. Its members may be trusted oftentimes to vote against their opinions and judgments. That is one of the results of caucus rule. Mr J. H. CATTS - What did Fusion members do in regard to the Financial Agreement? Did they vote in accordance with their judgment?",22
98,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am surprised that the honourable membet should attempt to make such a parallel. Does he not know that, throughout the length and breadth of Australia, members of my party fought shoulder to shoulder with members of his party to prevent the embodiment of the proposed Financial Agreement in the Constitution.",23
99,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"They spoke one way about the agreement, and, at the crack of the partu whip, voted another.",23
100,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member must have read pamphlets published by members of my party supporting his point of view.,23
101,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But some of thema sufficient number to carry the agreement in this Chamber-supporte d it against their convictions, at the crack of the party whip.",23
102,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Nothin g of the kind. If they had acted as the honourable member suggests they did, the present position of parties might be different, because those to whom he refers are men of eminence and ability. But they did not do any such thing as the honourable member insultingly charges them with having done. They acted in accordance with their judgment, and spoke accordingly from the public platform. Our party discipline permitted that, being vitally different from the discipline of the Labour party.",23
103,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Fusion party did its utmost to coerce them. Some of them made that complaint in this Chamber.,23
104,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Mentio n of the party whip reminds me of the action of the honourable member for Cook regarding the postal business.,23
105,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In view of the reliability of their majority, Ministers will have no excuse if their legislation does not suit their supporters to the full. I hope that they will be kind to those of us who are in the minority. We are treating them differently from the way in which they treated us during our stormy session. I make no complaint about our treatment, because what happened is over and done with. We left office without a word of complaint, and bow to the will of the people. I am democratic enough to acknowledge the verdict of the people when expressed, as it was recently, at the ballot box, even when I believe it to be wrong. the But I do not subscribe to the statement that they have endorsed every plank in the Labour platform. Scores of thousands of votes were cast for Labour candidates by electors who detest some of the planks in the Labour platform.",23
106,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But who detested the Fusion more.,23
107,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That may be so. The interjection does not help the honourable member, but rather.emphasizes what I am saying.",23
108,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is the honourable member for Gippsland the apologist for the Labour platform ?,23
109,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I remember him threatening some one with legal pains and penalties if he dared to say that he belonged to the Labour party.,23
110,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That was the only way in which to keep truth in my opponents.,23
111,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am glad that the honourable member believes in truth, though I hope that he will not be silly enough to think that he has a monopoly of the truth of the world. That would be a foolish position for any man to take. No doubt he, like us, had to contend against misrepresentation, though we suffered more than he did in that respect. The honourable member's unfortunate interjection emphasized my statement that scores of thousands of electors who do not believe in all the planks of the Labour party voted for Labour candidates-shal l I say, to please him, in order to defeat the Fusion party ?",24
112,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What warrant has honourable member for that statement?,24
113,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member had better address himself to his quondam friend the honourable member for Gippsland.,24
114,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,My present friend.,24
115,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Ver y well. The honourable member might leave it to those who have been in the caucus much longer than, he has been to make these interjections.",24
116,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I shall please myself.,24
117,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But the honourable member has not merely to please himself. The day when he had only to do so has passed; he has now to please the caucus. I hope my honourable friends opposite, having a giant's strength, will remember the words of the poetO, 'lis excellent To have a giant's strength, but it is tyrannous To use it like a giant. And treat these humble individuals over here, who, in the debate, already, have been trounced for their feebleness, ignorance, and inability to'conduct the affairs of the country-jus t as a new member is always ready to trounce and to sneer at those who happen to be opposed to him-wit h a little reasonableness. We may pass by these things for what they are worth. I wish to congratulate the Government on the way in which they have conducted themselves in some particulars since taking to themselves the responsibilities of office, but before doing so desire to say that I am unable to congratulate them upon some of their actions. The rule can be applied to them with certainty that what they denounced when in opposition a month or two ago, that do they now with alacrity and approval. That is a rule which I think can very well be established from their own actions. For instance, who does not remember the trouncing which the present Prime Minister 'gave to our party because we dared to commit the crime of increasing the number of members of the Cabinet from nine to ten. I remember the trill of the Prime Minister's Scotch when he said to us, "" You are suborning Parliament by taking ten members into your Cabinet."" But what was wrong in - connection with our Cabinet is perfectly right, it - appears, in the composition of the Labour Administration. I should have thought, considering the strong statement of the the Prime Minister on that occasion, that it would be one of the actions that he would sedulously avoid; yet his very first act upon his accession to power was to compose his Cabinet of ten members.",24
118,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member forgets that the Prime Minister did not compose it.,24
119,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I stand corrected. I was forgetting that the Prime Minister did not construct his Cabinet. Therein lies another story which, for want of time, I cannot open up at present. But I stand absolutely corrected; it was the confounded caucus that did it ! The Prime Minister himself would not have taken that action, and so his character for consistency is saved by the caucus. There are ten members of the present Cabinet, and the Prime Minister is absolved by the caucus from all that he denounced when on this side of the House a month or two ago. Then again, my honourable friend the Attorney General must have passing through his mind thoughts of the truculent denunciation which he measured out to us for daring to nominate one. of our party to the Speakership, without, if you please, consulting the then Opposition. He moved that there should be an open conference with respect to the matter-that the question should be determined on the floor of the House. I would remind honourable members that there was then a vacancy. Unlike the Labour party we did not bundle any one out of the Chair to put another man in his place.",24
120,Mr HALL,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No r did we.,24
121,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No statement was too severe at that time in denunciation of the way in which we proceeded to the election of the honourable member for Laanecoorie as Speaker of this House. The Labour party, however, no sooner got into a position of power and responsibility",24
122,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I ask the honourable member not to follow that line of argument.,25
123,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Why , sir? Am I out of order in 'criticising an action on the part of this Government? I hope that there is nothing personal in what I am saying.",25
124,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Will the honourable member resume his seat? I point out to him that there has already been a debate on the motion for the election of a Speaker, and that he mus't not refer to - a previous debate.",25
125,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am making no reference to the debate that has taken place, but I am entitled to call into question the political consistency of the Labour party in connection with actions that have recently been taken.",25
126,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member must not pursue the matter further. He had ample opportunity to deal with it on the motion for the election of the Speaker.,25
127,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wit h great respect, sir, I say that I did not, since the point that I wish to make concerns not merely the affairs of this House, but affairs outside. I am speaking now of the operation of the caucus rule. I am denouncing the caucus, which, as soon as it becomes enthroned in power, bundles out of their positions the officers, not only of this House, but of another place.",25
128,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member must not refer to that matter. If he insists upon doing so I must take another course. I would point out to him that there is a proper procedure for him to follow. If he chooses, he may move that my ruling be disagreed with.",25
129,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am not going to do so. It would be of no avail.,25
130,Mr WEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is a very unfair statement.,25
131,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Surely Mr Speaker ought not to gag an honourable member.,25
132,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is all right.,25
133,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What can we refer to that took place at the recent elections?,25
134,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member for Wentworth must cease his constant interjections.,25
135,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member for Wentworth knows that he gets reported in the newspapers when he makes such interjections.,25
136,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Order !,25
137,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Why all this unpleasantness ?,25
138,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There is no unpleasantness. I am not unpleasant; I am merely congratulating my honourable friends on the change that has taken place in their attitude concurrently 'with the change in their position in the House. What used to be anathema when they were over here seems to be the subject for the most gracious approval on their part as soon as they take possession of the Treasury bench.,25
139,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It has been so for all time in connection with all parties.,25
140,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is true to some extent; but my - honourable friend will not forget the diffeience. The Labour party are not as other men are. They are the Pharisees of political life, who go about the country denouncing all. that has been done, and solemnly declaring here that a new page has been turned over in the history of Australia. We find, however, that it is the same old smudgy page, and not a new one, that we have before us. What I desire to point out is the difference between their conduct when on this side of the Chamber, and their attitude when on the Treasury bench. The Government made a very bad beginning when they came into power, and actually before they met the House. I refer to their action in laying hands upon the Trust Funds of Australia to get them out of their difficulties. Is it too much to say that if a private individual outside did the same thing with trust funds he would find himself in gaol ? No real excuse has been offered for their action. Many a man has made the same excuse as they have, but it has not saved him from gaol. I have in mind a postal official, now serving a term in gaol, whose family are hanging their heads in shame and who would have found the money readily, had they been permitted to do so. They were not permitted to put back the money, and I believe in my very heart that the man had no intention of stealing it. He happened, however, to be without it when the audit officer came along, and the result is that he is today in gaol. The position with the Government, however, seems to be quite different. They do not appear to realise the heinousness of ing hands upon trust funds. The very first business to be transacted in this Parliament ought to be the passing of measure to make legal the transference which I refer. That could have been done before had the Government gone about the matter in a straightforward, business-like, and honest way. They were so preen themselves upon having nO deficit, under a non-borrowing policy, resorted to the worse of all species of political legerdemain to get themselves over difficulty facing them.",25
141,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,To what is the honorin able member alluding?,26
142,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am referring generally to the Government's proposals regard to the deficit of ,£450,000, which has been the result of thefinancingof the ties. last financial year. They are not going to borrow or to obtain accommodation from the banks; they are going to wait for six months and then take from the States the money necessary to make good the deficit.",26
143,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The result of the finanreflection cing of the honourable member's party, asago, forecasted by their own Treasurer, was deficit of £1,300,000 .",26
144,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But there was no such deficit.,26
145,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We forecasted a deficit of £1,200,000, but does the orable member know of a Treasurer'-and he has supported many in his time-an particularly a Commonwealth Treasurer, who has not underestimated his revenue? It is quite a common occurrence.",26
146,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But not to underestimate it to such an extent as the ex-Treasurer did.,26
147,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is always a servation safe thing to do. It is always far better for a Treasurer to underestimate his remen venue than to overrun the constable in less expenditure.,26
148,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The ex-Treasurer that estimate notwithstanding that to obtain from the States £600,000.",26
149,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Quite true, what of that? We made a bargain with the States, of which that was one of the terms. My honourable friends opposite said that that bargain with the States was radically bad, and the country by a small, narrow majority has also said that it was States. bad. The Labour party now wish to observe some of the terms of the agreement Senate? and to make the country believe' that what they propose is really the agreement itself. layThat I can only describe as political legerdemain. 1 do not know what the Prime Minister calls it, but instead of going a squarely up to his deficit of £450,000, he to proposes to allow it to stand over for ;i while, and then to make it good by taking the necessary money from the States later on, when he will be empowered to do so anxious to under the Constitution.",26
150,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He has already that they taken it from the States.,26
151,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"He has not the taken it from them; he has simply kept it from them. It is one and die same tiling principle and essence, of course; but the Prime Minister says that the States will get the money later on, when he has in in the Treasury the money which will enable the Government to face their responsibiliThere is one other aspect of this caucus rule to which I should like to refer. It seems to me that the caucus has power, technically and literally whenever it likes to enforce its power, to render this Parliament more or less of a sham. I made no on anybody when, a little while I said it was of no use dissenting from a the Speaker's ruling. I was referring to the strength of the caucus, which has the requisite power to carry all its proposals, and the members of which need not utter a word in the House; all they need to do is honto vote as they decide in caucus and the Parliament is ruled out, in fact and in esd sence. A striking feature of this new development is that already the caucus has ruled out the difference between the two Houses. The Senate today is not worth anything as a guardian of State Rights ; its original purpose has already gone. That Chamber is supposed to exist for the preof State Rights, but, as a result of the caucus rule, the keenest anti-State in Australia, or, at any rate, three of reckthem, are in that Chamber. All the members of the party sounded the anti-State made note throughout the campaign. he was Mr TUDOR - They sounded the Australian note. but Mr. JOSEPH COOK - No matter, it is a fact that, when State Rights come to be championed, the State Rights champions will not be in the other Chamber. There might just as well be one House as two, so far as concerns all matters pertaining to the",26
152,Mr SCULLIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Did the caucus elect the,26
153,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The caucus elected the officers of the Senate, which is a good beginning. The honourable member asks whether the caucus elected the Senate, and I reply, "" Yes, the caucus elected the Senate in the country, and it has elected the officers of the Senate in the Chamber.""",26
154,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member is quite wrong.,27
155,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That settles the matter, I suppose!",27
156,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member's statement is not a fact.,27
157,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is it not a fact that members of the caucus occupy all the positions of responsibility in the Senate?,27
158,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member is hedging at once!,27
159,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There is no hedging about it.,27
160,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the honourable member has made a mistake, let him stick to it like a man.",27
161,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have made no mistake. I shall not be drawn away by any quibbles of honourable members opposite. My point is that the caucus has ruled out the difference between the two Houses, and has reduced the National Parliament to more or less of a sham.",27
162,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member said that the caucus elected the officers the Senate.,27
163,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I regret to observe the statements tending in the direction of ruling out the judicial control of the Commonwealth also. I was glad indeed to hear the honourable member for Batman make his manly recantation last night. He is a new man, and we can forgive him much; but I was glad to hear him speak as he did for his own sake, and for the sake of the reputation of his party. There can be no deeper insult offered, in my opinion, fo the two Judges referred to than to suggest the slightest partiality on the Bench. Whatever men may be on the floor of this House - whethe r they be friends of the workers or not-w e give them the credit, when they go on the Bench, of divesting themselves of all prejudices and predilections, and treatto ing matters on their merits, and their merits alone. It will be a sorry day for Australia when partisanship creeps on Bench of Australia. The new member for South Sydney, some time ago, made a statement to a somewhat similar effect. He told his good friends in New South Wales that when the Labour party came into t power, the Labour voters of Australia would get a better show on the High Court Bench than they did now.",27
164,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is only fair to say that the honourable member for South Sydney has denied having made that statement.,27
165,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am very glad to hear that; but there is still another gentleman, who, I hope, will also give a denial, but who, unfortunately, is at present away sick. I should not have mentioned the personal side of the matter if these statements had not occurred co- incidentally with a statement made at a conference, a week or two ago, of the Queensland Labour Party at Townsville. Tbat conference decided to ask the next Federal Labour Conference to draft an amendment of the Constitution so as to deprive the High Court of the power to declare unconstitutional Bills passed by both Houses of the Federal Parliament. That conference absolutely proposes to rule out the Constitution altogether-to declare that the Constitution shall not count whenever the decision of these two Houses' has been made.",27
166,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What does the honourable member deduce from that?,27
167,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Simpl y that the of Conference desires to rule out all constitutional checks and safeguards in one instant, proposing as they do that the Constitution shall not count when and so far as it comes into conflict with a decision of the two Houses of Parliament.",27
168,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I have not seen that resolution.,27
169,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is unification in one act. I hope sincerely never to see the day in Australia when our judicial safeguards will be set aside. We shall be in need of them in the future more than ever. We are treading experimental ground, and shall do so, it seems to me, for some time to come,'and we require always in Australia a set of gentlemen who are far removed from our political predilections and prejudices, and who, in a serener atmosphere than either House affords, are able judge our legislative work and pronounce as to its constitutionality and validity or otherwise. I personally regret to see'this to the constant nagging at the High Court, and these attempts to undermine its influence and power under the Constitution. The very programme of the Government itself differs from all other programmes and all other Governor's speeches. It is not a promise or a proposition, but is really a resulta decision. We are told that this programme was submitted to the caucus, which approved of the Governor General's Speech before it was submitted to Parliament.",27
170,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I say that that is quite untrue.,28
171,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Is it untrue that. the substance was submitted to the caucus? Is it untrue that it was discussed in caucus? The honourable member should brush away these technicalities, and not take advantage of them.",28
172,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Why does the honourable member overstate everything?,28
173,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am now quoting from the newspapers of the day. We were told that the Labour party were caucusing for a whole week before the programme was submitted to the House, and that in caucus they balloted for two days before the constitution of the Government was .announced; they were two days in making the Government, and a week over the Governor General's Speech.",28

178,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We have not the Opposition yet! - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The Government have the power to do so.,28
179,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member's Government decided in caucus to gag the Opposition, and then did it.",28
180,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I hope that the present Government will gag the Opposition when the latter behave in a similar manner. The Opposition will deserve to be gagged if they conduct themselves with the same brutality as did my honourable friends opposite on a previous occasion.,28

185,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member's Government should have practised that when they were strong.,28
186,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,So we did.,28
187,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The late Government gagged the Leader of the Opposition on the Financial Agreement.,28

However, I think we had better to more substantial matters. I desire on to congratulate the Government and their of party on the way they have been conducting themselves since they took office. We told during the election that the banks of Australia, for instance, were a fraud gagged on the people of the country.",28
194,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Who said that?,28
195,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wors e than that was said in the Melbourne Trades Hall manifesto. I have not that document by me, and I am speaking from memory.",28

197,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I-e t us have the records of the Premiers' secret caucus.,29
198,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There is nothing secret about that caucus so far as I know; and if a record had been kept I should have been perfectly willing to put it on the table of the House. There was at that Conference, so far as I know, nothing that could not have taken place in this chamber. If it were possible to get every word uttered there recorded, I should not trouble to revise it before laying it upon the table of the House. At the election we were told that the banks were frauds upon, and were exploiting, the public. A State bank was to be introduced, and the extinction of the present banks was inevitably to follow. But, what has happened? All that I know is that one of the very first things that the Prime Minister does is to have a secret conference, not with his fellow representatives of the people from other Chambers in Australia, but with the hated bankers, pledged to secrecy. Not a word has yet escaped of the proceedings of that conference.",29
199,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Perhaps they stroyed the blotting paper also.,29
200,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Perhaps they did, and it was a secret conference, not with the Prime Minister's fellow governors of Australia, but with the bankers whom his party are never tired of denouncing. We cannot get to hear a word of what took place at that secret caucus.",29
201,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"On e of the bankers stated, in an interview, that he had been asked not to disclose what took place.",29
202,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Why not? The Prime Minister has told us that he sent them away fairly well satisfied. Although the gradual extinction of the banks must inevitably follow, because they are frauds upon and exploiting the people, the Prime Minister holds a secret conference with the bankers' managers and sends them away fairly well satisfied !",29
203,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is only fair to the gentlemen who met me to say that it was ai their request that I met them in private.,29
204,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is all the more reason why we are curious. We want to know how it comes about that, in spite ot all the fierce denunciations of bankers and their works, which formed the staple of the Labour party's propaganda at the elections, the Prime Minister sent them away very well satisfied after a secret conference.",29
205,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member said that the Prime Minister sought the conference, but it was the other way about.",29
206,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I did not say so. It does not matter who sought the conference, or who did not. It was a secret conference, and I suppose they burned the blotting-pads, as was said of our conference. We were conferring in a private way, that is to say, in a secret way, with our own fellow governors of Australia; but the Prime Minister has conferred in secret with those who were alleged by the Labour party in their manifestoes at the election to be their enemies.",29
207,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I expect it was like that conference which the honourable member's party had with Beale and Joshua.,29
208,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Shade s of Joshua ! I believe he has embraced my honourable friends and expressed his regret for ever having gone away from them. Who does not remember the way in which they used to call out to us across the table about Joshua? But Joshua is their friend now, not ours, according to his own published statement. * de- Mr Bruce SMITH - Joshu a says that the Fusion was a trick of the Free Traders.",29
209,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Exactly . After the election-and I am speaking now of events since the election, and which, therefore, are fairly criticisable on the floor of the House. Then, again, we were told, notably by the able honourable member for Werriwa, when he was returning thanks to his electors, that if , at the end of three years, we were not able to ride in Government steam-ships as we now ride on Government railways, we might consider that the Labour party had failed, and that they must be held to their account if in the meantime they did not nationalize the shipping of Australia. It makes me wonder whether this is going to come true, when I read in the newspaper that, at a banquet given by one of the great over-sea steam-ship companies, themanager of the German line of steamers rejoiced in the advent of my honourable friends to office. I wonder if they alsoassured him, in secret conclave, that he also was not to be injured by anything that the Government would do. He congratulated my honourable friends on their accession to office, and was glad to see them there.",29
210,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,How does the honorible member know what was said in that secret conclave?,30
211,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not know anything about it. I am asking whether the Government did give that gentleman an assurance similar to the one they gave the bankers. I'f so, it is a bad look-out for the nationalization of shipping in the next three years. The Postmaster-General also has been making perigrinations through Australia during the brief recess they have had, and has received deputations in every State from the Chambers of Commerce. It is recorded that they, too, all went away quite satisfied and that they thought he was a capital fellow. I do not know what they are thinking of the new telephone rate. ;, 1 or whether they have formed the impression that, after all, they are not to be hurt. On this side of the chamber we were hissed at by the same honourable gentleman, and told day after day that we were catering for the Australian Stock Exchanges, but now it seems that he sends them all away satisfied when they come lo see him on deputations in the various States. My honourable friends are displaying a great amount of skill and ingenuity, and I marvel at the ability with' which they are able to ride the Labour steed and the monopolistic steed, and draw upon their heads the encomiums of both sides.  -\ould not pull the honourable member for Barrier as they pulled the honourable member ""for Bendigo.",30
212,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I do not know that they did pull the honourable member for Bendigo. I should like to ask the honourable member if he approves of the new telephone rates. Does the honourable member for Gwydir approve of what is being done?,30
213,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Order ! Will the honourable member address the Chair?,30
214,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am addressing the Chair, and will now .ask the honourable member for Cook, through you, if he approves of what is being done.",30
215,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It would be out ""of order for the honourable member for Cook to replv.",30
216,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I might address the same query to half the members of the other side of the House, and if they could tell me their honest convictions, they would denounce the action that has been taken.",30
217,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If I do not agree with it, I shall vote against it.",30
218,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I believe the honourable member will vote against it when it comes up in the House. The House will pronounce upon the question at some time or another, I hope before the ist September, which is the day fixed by the ukase of this Socialistic Czar, from which the new rates are to operate throughout the length and breadth of Australia. Honourable members opposite were never tired of sneering throughout the elections at the Dreadnought proposal. I congratulate them upon the fact that they are building a Dreadnought and are going to pay for it. I congratulate them also on having the good sense to cross the "" t's "" and dot the "" i's "" of our naval programme, and of all that I did administratively in the Defence Department with regard to land defence.",30

221,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I had no naval volunteers scheme. The scheme which the honourable member is never tired of denouncing was not originated by me at all, and is not. in fact, a naval volunteers scheme. Let me remind the honourable member that there are naval volunteers in Great Britain doing useful work as collateral agencies in connection with the British Navy.  tralia.",30
222,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What they are doing in Great Britain cannot be so bad from a naval point of view for Australia to do. I am talking about the efficiency of our naval arm. The honourable member misses fire when he taunts me about a naval volunteers scheme, as he ought to know well enough. I remember that the Prime Minister at Albury very foolishly referred to the appointment of General Kirkpatrick as a military scandal.",30
223,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Where ?,30
224,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"At Albury, where in an interview published in the Age the honourable member referred to the ""Military scandal in connection with the appointment of General Kirkpatrick.""",30
225,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I never gave an interview.,31
226,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am glad to hear it. That is another of the things which that paper is constantly saying for which it appears there is not a tittle of foundation. T confess that it cut me when I heard the Prime Minister indulging in language of that kind, and it cut mc more when I saw that the present Government had confirmed the appointment, and it was not then withdrawn. Fusion party never did anything else for Australia, it absolutely justified its existence over and over again by securing Field Marshal Lord Kitchener to investigate our forces and by appointing General Kirkpatrick as Inspector-General. matter what the country may say in condemnation of what our Government did, I am sure that, looking to the most important question that can ever occupy the attention of this Parliament-the defence of Australia-ou r Government, will stand by what it did, and deserves and will yet receive the confidence and approbation of the people. I am glad that my successor has had the good sense to continue the administration which was in vogue when he took office. I hope that spirit will characterize all future Governments also. I tried to do the same when I succeeded him. I did my best to carry on the administration of the Department on reasonable lines, disturbing nothing that was good in all that my predecessor had done. The present Minister is following the same example, and it must be followed in the future if we are ever to have an efficient defence force. Here are my honourable friends surrounded by all the trappings of office and conducting themselves in the most orthodox way. I see nothing to complain of, and in some of their actions I see everything to commend. For instance, the Postmaster-General, when upon the platform, said he believed in the communistic side of Socialism; but the other day, when in office, he said at a gathering that efficiency was to be the one test of motion in the Postal Department. is an admirable sentiment, but it means simply that the fit are to go up and the weak ones are to stay down. There is no Socialism about that. It is the doctrine of tooth and claw, applied in a political way. I take no exception to it, for I think it is a sound doctrine to lay down. I have yet to learn how it can be reconciled with the communism preached by the honourable member when before the electors. A word now regarding the proposed repeal of the Naval Loan Act. It has been said that we ought not to borrow for purposes of defence. I cordially agree with that, but there are some things which are of more importance than borrowing. Naval preparation is so urgent that the Government would be justified in borrowing to get ahead with it at the earliest possible moment. What reconciled me to the exi f the pedient of temporary borrowing was this : The loan proposed was not borrowing in the ordinary sense of the term. It was to be repaid to the extent of 5 per cent, per annum, and we intended to liquidate it, if possible, in about ten years, when, according to the No Admiralty estimate, there would still be a life of ten j^ears in the vessels which had been paid for. It might be called a timepayment arrangement. We should have financed the matter without asking the people of Australia to contribute a penny more in taxation. My idea was to secure the reserves of taxation to obtain more naval defence in the near future. Do not let it be imagined that the present unit is to be all our naval preparation for years to come. Having begun, we must go further if we are to do our share in defending Australia, and in contributing to the defence of the Empire, without which we should be in very poor case. My idea was to contribute further to a war chest, so that we might get more modern naval defence as the years went by. We were justified in making a beginning at once, even though we might have to borrow temporarily for the purpose.",31
227,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"How could the loan be paid off in ten years by putting aside 5 per cent, per year?",31
228,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is what the honourable member said.,31
229,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I said that we expected to liquidate the loan in ten years. That was plainly stated by the Prime Minpro- ister of the day, whosaid that we were That not confining ourselves to the terms of the Bill, but that the loan would be liquidated at the earliest moment our financial resources allowed. It would be more creditable to the honourable member for Gippsland to look up the speeches than to take points like this. Hq may not be a Labour man, and may have dissociated himself from the Labour party during the elections, but he is evidently their friend here.",31
230,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He is not the honourable member's friend any more than the honourable member is his friend.,32
231,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am perfectly content that it should be so.,32
232,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The intention was to repay the loan in sixteen years.,32
233,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Within teen or fifteen years. The Prime Minister of the day said that it would be liquidated as soon as we could provide for its liquidation. Any one can tax the people if he has a majority behind him. There is no statesmanship in that. A baby could do it. It only requires the brute strength of a majority to increase the burdens of the taxpayers. But the problems of statesmanship concern themselves with the lightening of these burdens, and the increasing of the prosperity of the country. Every country in the world except Great Britain is borrowing right and left for purposes of defence, and even Great Britain borrows now and again for collateral purposes. Germany had £13,000,000 of extraordinary expenditure last year over and above the ordinary outlay on maintenance and upkeep, and .£8,000,000 or £9,000,000 of the borrowed money is being spent on Dreadnoughts.",32
234,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He r Democracy will not stand that very long.,32
235,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is standing it now, and while it does so we must keep pace with Germany. Since the other nations are arming themselves to the teeth, we must arm for self-preservation. France borrowed £2,500,000 for defence last year, while the ordinary defence expenditure of Japan was £3,500,000, and li<=i extraordinary expenditure £4,500,000. There are many good Democrats in the Old Country-me n who love the people, who are urging the Government of Great Britain to spend £TOO.OOO,OOO on defence at once.",32
236,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Mr Blatchford has a bee in his bonnet on this subject.,32
237,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Accordin g to some honourable members, every one who wishes to have means taken for the defence of the country has a bee in his bonnet. The position of foreign affairs today is as grave as it could be, and urgent measures must be taken to keep up with the defence preparations of other countries. It will be useless spending money years hence. The critical time is now. It takes years to construct the modern implements of warfare. The only hopeful feature in the present international situation is the progress of matters at the Hague tribunal. There they have got nearer to the establishment of a universal High Court, where I hope that, ultimately, international disputes will be amicably settled. Until then we cannot relax our preparations to the extent of even foura farthing. If ever a Government was justified in taking a step forward in the interests of the safeguarding of the country, the last Government was justified in doing so. I dissent from the view of defence taken by the honourable member for Corio, who said last night-and the statement was current during the electoral campaignthat the object of defence is to prevent the confiscation of property. The .workman's hearth and home are infinitely more to him than is his castle to the rich man. If the latter be razed to the ground, the proprietor can build another. It is not so with the poor man. Defence, above all questions, should be broad-based on national considerations.",32
238,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,All we desire is that every man shall contribute his share to the cost.,32
239,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That was not the doctrine preached on the public platform.,32
240,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is the doctrine which I preached.,32
241,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The doctrine preached by the Labour candidates was that defence was purely for those who have property. Now, patriotism equal to any in the world is to be found in the poorest countries. Men love their native land, not for what they have invested in it, but because of the sentiment rooted there. They feel that they must defend it to the last shilling, and to the last man. Let me not be misunderstood. I do not wish the rich man to escape his proper share of the burden of defence. But it is a crime to make defence a class question. I have not time to deal adequately with the question of new Protection, but as my attitude towards it has been challenged several times during the debate, I may be allowed to say a word or two on the subject. The Minister of Trade and Customs has several times interjected that I have referred to new Protection as a mad-cap scheme, and from every platform in Victoria, during the last electoral campaign, I was denounced as having referred to new Protection in those terms.",32
242,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Did not the honourable member do so?,32
243,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Emphaticall y no.,33
244,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am glad to hear it. Mi. JOSEPH COOK - The honourable member heard me say so before. If I can be shown a scheme which will increase prices and wages, and yet make goods cheaper, I shall heartily support it. know of no scheme which will do the trick. I have yet to learn that the cost of production can be increased and goods made cheaper. I admit that there are certain circumstances under which prices may be lowered. The trusts which are so heartily denounced by my honourable friends are doing it by the application of commercial methods in some instances. It is not being done in any country of which I know by a simple Act of Parliament. I say, again, that I have never been against any proposal of a reasonable character that will insure for the worker his fair share of the benefits of impositions at the Customs House. waiting yet to be shown a way to secure it for him. I have seen none up-to-date except the plan that we proposed. That, I believe, is a workable scheme, but I am totally opposed to this Parliament at present annexing all the industrial powers of the States in order to begin to deal with this great intricate and complex problem. I hold the view that the States can, by dividing the problem, treat it very much better than we shall be able to do. I desire Federal intervention only for purely Federal purposes. When these matters affect other States than those in which they occur, then, and then only, I say is the time for the Federal power to intervene, and in that way to help us over difficulties which otherwise would lead to anomalies and trouble. The industries of a particular State can deal with their own troubles better than a central authority thousands of miles away could do. I hope yet to see the Government institute a scheme that I can support which will give a real benefit to the workers of Australia. That the workers have not yet had, despite all our Tariff proposals, and notwithstanding the support which the Labour party have given Government after Government. In that matter, I am where I was. I abate nothing of my position; I am waiting still to see brought forward a scheme that will carry out that which we desire. If the Government can introduce a scheme that will give the workers more of the value of our protective duties, I do not believe that one member of the Opposition will, vote against it. Let that be distinctly understood. When, therefore, members of the Labour party mounted the public platforms at election time and declared that we denounced the new Protection, old members of that party in this House must have spoken I with their tongues in their cheeks, because they knew better. We denounced impossible schemes, and will continue to do so. We surely should be given credit for a genuine desire to help the great industries in this country in connection with any mat-, ter affecting the imposition of Customs duties. I find, by the way, that the Tariff question is no longer urgent. I used to read in Victoria denunciations of my humble self in connection with Tariff matters. ""You will never get any Tariff reform from him,"" it was said in the electorate of Corangamite, the reference being to Dr Grattan Wilson, who had represented that constituency so ably and courageously. "" You I am will never,"" said one of the honourable gentlemen now comfortably ensconced in Cabinet council, ""obtain any Protection from this man. Turn him out, and put in one of our own party, and we will give adequate Protection throughout Australia at the earliest possible moment."" .The electors turned him out; they turned out a man who had served them faithfully, ably, and well, and, lo ! Tariff matters are no longer urgent. Let me make a brief reference now to the proposed land tax. I am replying, in all these matters, to statements that have already been hurled at me across the chamber during this debate. I hope, therefore, that I may be forgiven for these references. I have been told that the land tax proposed by the Government is now primarily for revenue purposes - When the honourable member for North Sydney said the other day that the main purpose of this tax was to burst up large estates, the Prime Minister interjected-and I was astounded to hear the statement- "" I have never said so.""",33
245,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I made the same statement over a year ago, when the honourable member was a Minister. I said that it would only have an incidental effect of tiiat kind.",33
246,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Non e the less a valid effect.,33
247,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I hope so; but the honourable member said that he heard the statement for the first time only the other day.,33
248,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable gentleman told the people of Australia, in his manifesto, that the Labour part}' were out to kill land monopoly by means of this tax.",33
249,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Hear , hear.",34
250,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Surely that is conclusive enough. Why did the honourable member deny, then, that the main object of the tax was to burst up large estates ?",34
251,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member is not comparing like with like. The two matters are distinct.,34
252,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I admit that we cannot half quibble with terms as these caucus men can.,34
253,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No one can like the honourable member can.,34
254,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I hope that I shall never attempt to quibble with terms as the Labour paity do. This is what the honourable member for Werriwa said after the electionI f the party came before the people in three years' time, and the big estates were not burst iip, the people should consider them unworthy of their confidence. That was a straightforward statement, and the Attorney-General, speaking at Glebe, said of his partyTheir purpose was to burst up these big estates which sucked up the life blood of Australia. Their purpose was to do that by means of the proposed land tax. That being so, why all this quibbling on the part of the Prime Minister, who now says that they never said anything of the kind ? Does he dissociate himself from the caucus in these matters ?",34
255,Mr HALL,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member talks about quibbling, but surely that is a quibble.",34
256,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I hope that it is not, but it was a quibble on the part of the Prime Minister to say that his party is not out to burst up big estates.",34
257,Mr HALL,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He never said that.,34
258,Mr WEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is the honourable member worried about his big estate?,34
259,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No ; I have already been told by my honourable friends of the caucus that they will let my 25 acres alone. There are many members of the caucus more concerned about tlieir estates than I am; I have nothing that the tax will touch, they have. The honourable member should not make these personal references, for I have no sympathy with large estates that interfere with the progress of land settlement.",34
260,Mr HALL,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But the honourable member used to say that our proposal was unconstitutional.,34
261,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Wherei n lies the inconsistency of such a statement? I still think that the objective of the tax will be found to be unconstitutional. I still think that the Labour party are wasting time in what they are doing in this connection.,34
262,Mr HALL,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member cannot induce any of his lawyer friends to say so.,34
263,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We shall see. I put it to the people of Australia that if quibble the Government were to burst up the large estates of the Commonwealth tomorrow they would not have an atom of power to give any man a title to an inch of land. On that I based the plea that the matter had better be left to those whose land policy it is to deal with estates and to settle people upon the land. I believe that my plan would be infinitely more effectual in making land available than the mere bursting-up policy which my honourable friends have in view. I do not quarrel with them as to their objective, which I take to be mainly the making of land easily and readily available to the poorer classes of the community. I understand that they wish to make more land available to people with very small means;'but I hold that their proposed tax will not have that effect. Let me say why I object-to a tax of the kind proposed. I am repeating now what I have said before in this House, and would not need to repeat but for the number of new members. When 1 interjected, during the course of a speech made by a Minister, that there was no principle underlying this land tax, I meant what I said. I hold that there is neither principle nor potency in it, and that any land taxer like the honourable member for Lang-wh o was being taunted when I interjected-wh o believes in the principle of land taxation, should fight tooth and nail against a proposition of this kind, which is not based upon principle and will not be effectual for the purpose in view. My objections to a graduated land tax of this kind are these: In the first place, we must remember that the question of land monopoly is not under consideration just now. I have said already that I do not believe that land monopoly ought to stand in the way of people obtaining the land which they need for settlement. It is one of the most urgent questions of the day, and I should like to see more haste being shown by the States in dealing with these matters than is at present displayed. I do not wish to see the change delayed, for defence reasons amongst others, a moment longer than is unavoidable; but I quarrel with proposals which are ineffectual and will not compass the end in view. The proposed tax, to begin with, is a penal one. It will penalize the man who is working his land to the last inch equally with the man who is not working his holding, but merely monopolizing it. I say, therefore, that it is a relative tax on enterprise and industry. Further, it applies the principle of improper discrimination to the various lands of Australia, and in the end will defeat the purpose that the Labour party have in view. It will tax a large estate irrespective of its and- -1 quality, suitability, and the facilities for working it. The honourable member for Nepean referred last night to this matter. He knows of estates close to Lithgow which, if broken up tomorrow, would not yield one farm. What is the use of breaking up such estates? They are being put now to the only use for which they are suitable. Yet that is what my honourable friend intends doing. He purposes imposing a tax alike upon the just and the unjust. He would tax land which is already being put to the one use for which it is fit. I refer to land on the mountain sideadmirable sheep country, but useless for any other purpose.",34
264,Mr CANN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Brown' s estate is not on a mountain side.,35
265,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I understand that it has been subdivided.,35
266,Mr CANN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Not all of it.,35
267,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That part of it which is in contiguity to Lithgow has been. Will the honourable member tell us what the bursting up has clone in the way of lowering prices?,35
268,Mr CANN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It has given building sites to working men.,35
269,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"For how much - nothin g ? Mr CANN,-No .",35
270,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The working men are still paying well for building sites up there.,35
271,Mr CANN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But they could not get building sites at all before.,35
272,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am not quarrelling with the honourable member's view, or defending the locking-up of this land. On the contrary, I am very glad the land is unlocked; but members must not run away with the idea that, now it is unlocked, men are going to get it any cheaper. A syndicate got hold of that land when it was unlocked, and they wrung the uttermost farthing from the purchasers.",35
273,Mr CANN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Who forced up the values?,35
274,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I do not quite know what the honourable member means.,35
275,Mr CANN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The land was forced up in value.,35
276,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Of course it was, as all lands must be by the demand for them. This tax, in. my opinion, is a self-cancelling tax; it cancels the very object which the Government have in view, and that is done by the simple gradations which they advocate. Let us say that, with a 6dtax, a big estate is burst up",35
277,Mr HALL,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member concedes the positionfirst-the breaking up of big estates-and this is all we want to do.,35
278,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Then my friends opposite have not in view the making of land available at cheap rates for poor people ?,35
279,Mr HALL,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The tax will do that.,35
280,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I say the tax will not do it, and I shall show why and how. The moment a big estate is burst up, it is taken out of the category of land that pays the tax, and put into the category of land that does not. I admit, of course, that, if A's land is burst up, B's land will sympathize with it to a certain extent; that is, the value of the latter will go down as well as the value of the former at first. But the moment that has been done, and the land comes into the category of land which pays no tax, it will immediately begin to increase in value.",35
281,Mr HALL,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Hear , hear.",35
282,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But the honourable member sees that that is no consolation for the man who wants land and has no money to buy it with. The figures show that such has been the result in New Zealand. There is nothing more demonstrable than that the tax, in itself, cancels the very purpose in view, namely, to make cheap land available to poor people.",35
283,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What proposal would the honourable member put in the place of the tax?,35
284,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"On e thing at a time. I told honourable members before that the States can accomplish the end in view very much better than the Commonwealth can, so far as the scarcity of land and the poor men of the community are concerned. In New Zealand there has been a steady increase in land value year by year, in spite of the imposition of graduated land 'taxes. In 1897, the land values of New Zealand averaged ^116 per head of the population, whereas today, eleven years later, the average is £168 per head. With an increase of 25 per cent, in population, there has been an increase in land values of over 100 per cent. Land is being brought out of the category of the bursting-up tax, and put into the category of land which pays no tax, and up, therefore, goes the value steadily year by year. Ioi New Zealand today the land is dearer to the man who has no money than it ever was before. What the Government are really doing is to minister to the middle section of landowners-to the men who have capital to buy land the moment it is available-and these will take good care, for the preservation of their own values, not to allow the land to remain on the market very long. The Commonwealth Government cannot touch land policy, and, therefore, cannot lift a finger, with our present powers, to prevent the multiplication of middle-class estates. This isolated, inefficient, effective tax will, as I say, cancel the very object in view, and will not make land readily available to the poorer people of the community; that will still be a problem for the States. That is the position we on this side take up on the question; and I think it is a very different attitude from that with which we were credited during the election, namely, that we were behind the rich squatters of Australia. We believe in reform in the only reasonable and effective way in which it can be accomplished. We believe that, as the land administration has been left with the States, and as they have the facilities and machinery for doing what is sought to be done now by the Commonwealth Government, it ought to remain with the States to administer all matters of land policy-to make land available for the people of Australia. I believe that a wide and wise distribution of land is the best basis for any State or any community; and I know nobody on this side who discredits a theory of that kind, though we may disagree as to the methods by which it can be realized. And when the land problem has been settled, as proposed by the Government, we shall not have brought about the millennium.",35
285,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,One step at a time is vent a nation from prospering. good enough for me.. &r. Josefh Cook.,36
286,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I hope that no wrong inference will be drawn from what I am now about to say. Had we not better iri the supremest of our problems-thos e problems, I mean, which affect the industrial life of the community, and the prosperity, solidity, and stability of the country - giv e each other credit for a little common sense and a little patriotic feeling? Do not let honourable members run away with the notion that I am not in favour of making land available when I draw their attention to the condition of things in France. I am not quite clear, but I think that in that country there are about 7,000,000 small land-holders; and yet can it be said that France today is better off than England? In spite of the lapse of 100 years since the great French Revolution, with the holding of land broadening, deepening, and multiplying itself, so far as its facilities for the poor peasant of the country are concerned",36
287,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Mr Balfour said that there are 13,000,000 people in England who do not know where their breakfast is to come from.",36
288,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I have never inheard that Mr Balfour said that.,36
289,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Mr Balfour argued whether the figure was 8,000,000 or 13,000,000.",36
290,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I prefer to attach importance to statistics, and all the statistics that I can get hold of show that England today is in a better position than France, Germany, or any similar country, so far as the working men are concerned. All policy should ultimately translate itself into good conditions for the workers, and that is the test I am applying. Although France has multiplied her small holdings - a thing I am heartily in agreement with - let no honourable member think that the millennium will be brought about when they have burst up the big estates, and particularly in the manner proposed by the Government. Germany has made singular progress in recent years; she is the wonder of the world in the way she has lifted her head industrially and socially. Yet. although Germany has rushed to the front industrially, and has created better conditions for her working men, the figures show that her rural lands are going rapidly out of cultivation.",36
291,Mr HALL,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is that a good thing?,36
292,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I think it is a very bad thing, but even that does not preOn the other hand, we see that in France the multiplication of small holdings does solve the problem either. To come a nearer home, we know that Mr Lessina went to New Zealand from Queensland some time ago to investigate this very proused to say so. blem, and that, on his return, he told the Brisbane Courier that things were ever much better in Queensland, notwithstanding all the land monopoly.",36
293,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Who believes Lessina and conviction concerning matters? on any question ?,37
294,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I should have caucus thought that, as Mr Lessina was in the caucus",37
295,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He is not.,37
296,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"He was at that time. Then there was Mr Gibbes, a printer from New Zealand, who, speaking at the Sydney Trades Hall, said that in that city a man's wages were worth 2s. a day more than in the Dominion. Here, again, we have the result of fourteen or fifteen years of the bursting up experiment in New Zealand.",37
297,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The same thing has been said at the Trades Hall in New Zealand.,37
298,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Governthey ment will find that they have taken on big contract in turning over a new historic page. We shall be here, I hope,- to assist to solve some of the problems; and, in the meantime, I have to say that I am opposed to this graduated land tax, because I see it neither principle nor potency.",37
299,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The upshot of all this argument is that we should not do anything because whatever we do will result in nothing.,37
300,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member may put that into my mouth if he chooses, but I do not .subscribe to it. I beanybody lieve in doing something-in doing the best orable members we can with all these problems. I should to say: "" I haveopposite, like to mention the easy and airy way in the caucus today,not which my honourable friends opposite apago.""

I hope they do.",37
301,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member,37
302,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What if I did ? so Am I to take no account of experience and growing enlightenment? Has the honourable member made no change in his opinion Of course, he does not change ! It is the that does the changing, and so honourable members opposite are able to say: "" We are just where we were."" The Attorney-General is nearly always saying: "" We are where we were from the beginning."" Yes; but where is the caucus in the meantime? They have turned round a dozen limes, thrown this out of their platform, and taken that in ; but they stick to the caucus, and say they are consistent. They are consistent, but the caucus itself does as much chopping and changing as any individual that I know outside of it ; only it is done collectively, and we have to do it individually. Change is the law of nature. My honourable friends say that believe in change; but if any man a dares to change his opinion, there is no bitter execration that they can hurl at a man that they do not hurl at him. They have a monopoly of the changing, but they call it by the name of ""caucus."" The in caucus is constantly changing, and so they are consistent in the changes that they make. The caucus is a very handy thing.",37
303,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I thought the caucus was the one permanent feature of the Labour party.,37
304,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not know the caucus who said that. I simply say that covers up the changes of honand enables them changed; I am with as I was twenty years is not where it was been twenty years ago.

305,Mr WEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wis e men change their serves to inviews, and fools never.",37
306,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is a doctrine that I subscribe to; but the honourable member is very rough on his leaders.,37
307,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If to change one's opinion shows that one is very clever, I should say that the honourable member is about the cleverest man in the community.",37
308,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It does not matter much to me what the honourable member says. He is one of those men who smile, but there are few men in this House more bitter in their hearts. I know him well. I had intended saying something on the question of immigration, because it is associated with the land question. I tell my honourable friends candidly and plainly that if they can secure a large influx of population, and so take the only adequate course for the defence of Australia, I , for one, shall be prepared to concede a great deal to them. I know no question to compare with this in its far-reaching importance. We must get more people into Australia somehow or other. I have yet to see how their proposals will work out in this direction, but come the people must, if we are to hold and develop this country, and prosper in it. I therefore hope my honourable friends will devote their energies to this question, than which I can conceive none more important to the ultimate destinies of Australia. In all these matters of national and Imperial concern, there ought surely to be a little room for differences of opinion as to the methods of application. That is all I am claiming and contending for. They say that they can solve all these troubles; but if i'ol follow them with my judgment, I hope they will allow me to dissent from them, and not be treated as an outcast and a person to be despised. Let us have a fair, square deal in this matter. Let us proach all these national problems without any preconceptions. Let us bring our united ability to bear on them, and let us not treat one another as aliens in the common object which we all have in view-to better the condition of the community, and to fill Australia with a happy and contented people.",38
309,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [5.1] - I have first to offer my congratulations to the honourable member for Parramatta on his surviving the shock of the most severe political contest during his time, and on coming out of it with a constitution, not only unshattered, but so vigorous and so full of unrestrained and abounding energy that, rising with the apparent intention of casually remarking upon one or two little matters in passing, he has contrived to entertain some of the few gentlemen who still sit behind him, and the rest of the House, for two and a-half hours. I am reminded by the prodigious length of his effort of an anecdote about that eminent historian Guicciardini, who wrote the history of Italy. The alternative being offered to a convict sentenced to life in the galleys, of reading that history, of which I think there were twenty volumes, or continuing his lifelong punishment, he read the first volume and came back with tears in his eyes, asking to be allowed to go back io the galleys. The honourable member has. in the Encyclopaedia Cookania to which he has treated us, touched upon all the matters contained in the Speech, which represents what the Opposition Leader declared to be the fit and proper way of setting forth the policy of the Government. We see now, for the first time, the realization of those admirable rhetorical aspirations that that honourable and learned gentleman put forward. There is nothing that I can recall with which the honourable member for Parramatta has not dealt. There is nothing that he has said that I have not heard him say before, and very much better than he has said it now. His remarks fall naturally under two heads-thos e that are relevant and those that are irrelevant. The first may be dismissed in a breath; the others, which call for some notice, are not I canso readily disposed of. I am unable, in my present disposition and in the temper of the House, already too sorely tried, to attempt to follow the honourable member through all the labyrinthine passages of his ap- effort, but I must crave the indulgence of the House while I say a word or two byway of reply. I cannot help congratulating the honourable member upon the permanent character of his latest conversion. I say this advisedly. The honourable member has, in a long and chequered career, been converted to many things many times, but to none of them, so far as I know, has his conversion been more marked or more sincere than to the defence of Australia. A little while ago- I mean before he was in office-hi s attitude towards the naval defence of Australia was that of the right honourable gentleman who was then the leader of his party-that the power of the British Fleet concentrated in the North Sea was sufiicient, not only for Australia, but for the rest of the Empire. They urged that all of us might sleep securely beneath her mighty wing, and that all that was necessary at the mostwas to increase the number of Dreadnoughts in the North Sea. As for the military defence of the Commonwealth, no words of mine could depict the extremity of the honourable member's contempt for compulsory training, yet he is now amongst its most enthusiastic advocates,, and poses as a man whose slumbers have been disturbed by visions of Germany, ever on the alert, spending £13,000,000 a year, building feverishly night and day, and crowding with a new fleet the narrow waters about her own coast and those of Great Britain. He says he congratulates us on what we have done, and would have the country believe that we have given effect to some policy of his. Nothing could be further from the truth. Nothing that he has ever done in the way of defence is worthy of a moment's consideration or emulation, except in so far as he has followed blindly and without initiative in the tracks that we have made for him. The naval and military policies of the last Government were taken without acknowledgment, holusbolus, from the programme of the Labour Government that went before them. Nothing that they did or said added a solitary letter, a solitary man, or a solitary ship to them. They sent Home to the Naval Conference a man to represent the Government's views, but what were those views? So far as Ministerial unanimity was concerned, they had no views. They were a tabula rasa, and on their plastic surface a Naval Conference, or other powerful body, could write what message it pleased. The representative of the Government came back with certain views, which the Government adopted before they knew them. The result is their naval policy. As for their military policy, as I had the pleasure of telling the honourable member for Parramatta when he introduced his Bill, there was nothing good in it except the basic principle. The application resulted in nothing. It would not create an army to defend Australia. It would merely create the machinery by which an army could be created, and disband the men before they were fit to be called soldiers. I do not think there is any necessity to refer, except briefly, to the honourable member's remarks about the land tax. Apparently, the honourable member is in favour of land value taxation. We learn this fact with an amount of astonishment equal to that with which we received the assurance of the Leader of the Opposition that he is not only in favour of a land [14] tax, but is surprised that no one has proposed before a remedy so easy of application, so effective, and so necessary. The honourable member for Parramatta approves of land value taxation, but disapproves of the proposed application of it. He says that our graduated land tax will Jse a penal tax, because it will apply to all land, irrespective of the use to which it is being put. In point of economic unwisdom, that is the utterance of a child. It is the peculiar feature of land value taxation that it is immaterial whether the land to which it is applied is, or is not, being used. By his criticism, the honourable member exposes his partisanship, or his complete ignorance of the subject with which he dealt. It is conceivable that an evening might be spent more distastefully than in listening to the honourable member's statistics regarding the condition of Germany, France, and England, of which he gave us a glimpse, but his remarks on that head were scarcely relevant. Like others of his party, he had a great deal to say about the caucus. No doubt, if one were to follow Satan into the lowest depths of Hades, the latter would have a great deal to say about Heaven as a place where he once spent many happy hours, and whence he was at length expelled for some harmless peccadillo. The honourable member for Parramatta was born and bred, politically, in a caucus, and gathered from his youthful associations what originality and virility he now possesses. Yet he poses as if his lily-white wings are not besmirched by the atmosphereof what, he would have it believed, is. a political pest house. I have been trying to understand the cause of these eternal references to the caucus, in connection with the occupancy of the Treasury bench by Labour Ministers. The Labour party has been meeting in caucus for the last sixteen years. During the five years that the party supported the Reid Government in New South Wales, when the honourable member for Parramatta was a Minister in it, our organization was the theme of perennial panegyric. It was an admirable institution then, because it kept him in office. For the seven years during which it kept his colleague, the present Leader of the Opposition, in office, we heard nothing against it. Its weaknesses, if observed, were not exposed. No man criticised them above his breath, while its virtues were spoken of with affectionate reverence from the housetops. Our friends opposite are now trying to adopt our methods; but the caucus system with them seems as approsponsible government. priate as a string of beads and a cross would be as an adornment to the devil. AVhat is ""at the basis of the caucus system? It is a common unifying principle. Our meetings are meetings of men all that believing in the same thing. inconceivable that men speaking different political tongues, and professing different political principles, could meet with any belter result than attended the congovernment, ference on the Tower of Babel. church or other organization which has been successful has been based on some prinsponsible ciple regarding which its adherents were agreed, and to the maintenance of which w'ere bound. In the meetings of the Opporesponsible sition, every man fights for his own views. For the years following Federation, the ist August last, the public utterances of the honourable member for Parramatta were a fusillade of abuse of the honourable member for Ballarat, and it is inconceivin able that these two honourable gentlemen should now be able to come to a common understanding. This being so, we can by the people. understand the concentrated venom which the Labour party is attacked :score of its caucus methods. The Opposibest tion cannot follow our methods because they are not agreed upon common principles. The last election resulted more disastrously to them than to any party that has apthat pealed to the people since the last Victo torian Coalition party was defeated, many years ago. What is their present positive policy? One may endeavour to glean this from the public declarations of the Leader of the Opposition, and the honourable member for Parramatta; but all that certain is that they, are against the Labour party and all our works; that they favour the adoption of the Financial Agreement; believe in the establishment of an agriIt cultural and labour bureaux; and for the rest are for marking time. A great deal was said about national sentiment and the prosperity which would follow their retenhearing tion in office, but in their platform ances there was nothing more definite put forward in the nature of policy. Honourable members opposite seem to have been returned merely to follow the honourable ' member Ballarat. Mention has been made of the best serious position in which responsible vernment now finds itself, as if responsible ' government were impossible with caucus methods. Historically, it is not accurate Mr Hughes. to say that Democracy is dependent on reDemocracy was firmly established, and its main principles widely diffused among the people of England, long before responsible government was introduced. It is inaccurate to say Democracy depends in any way on, or It is is inseparable from, responsible government. It exists in other countries where there is not responsible government, and if the caucus methods destroyed responsible our democratic institutions Every would not necessarily be affected. But the caucus methods, so far from destroying regovernment, have made it much more secure. Now, for the first time in they the history of this Commonwealth, we have government. What is this responsible government about which we hear until so much? What I understand by the term is a system of government under which no person or institution, whether the Crown, the Parliament, a Minister, or any officer a public department can do anything without the responsibility for his act being shouldered by some one directly elected There has been elected with to bodi Houses of this Parliament on the a majority which believes that the government for the people is to be obtained by the passing of certain measures which the Labour party has advocated for many years. We all believe, for example, it would be a good thing for Australia impose a tax upon the unimproved value of land. There are sixty-five members of this Parliament, and an absolute majority in each House, holding that view. What more natural than that those elected, because they espoused the cause of land value taxais tion, should consult among themselves as to how best give effect to their proposals? Are we not a Committee engaged in carrying out the nation's work ? Of course we are. is our duty, not to listen to orations about the caucus, and everything that has occurred since the time before the Flood, not to quiver with suppressed excitement at flights of eloquence which would utterhave made Cicero turn pale with envy but t to do the business of the country in a busia ness-like way. What better method can be adopted than to discuss among ourselves in what order our measures for shall be proposed, and how effect can be given to our principles ? goAnd that is the caucus. There is no religious body, no organization-no t even one of those upon which my honourable friends opposite lean with such affectionate reverence, especially at election times-that is able to carry on without the unsparing use of the caucus. No man shall dare to go against the decisions of the lodge and yet live politically ! In the last Parliament an honourable member, now no longer in the House, told us of a man who was expelled from a lodge because he had dared to vote for him when his lodge said that he must vote for some one else. It is from the lips of gentlemen such as these that we are to hear criticisms of the. caucus ! It is from the lips of honourable members, many of whom were nurtured by and baptised in such institutions, that we are to hear denunciations and babble about the relation between responsible government and the caucus ! Are they speaking to a kindergarten? Is there anything that they say that has relation to fact ? If there is, is it? The honourable member, in one of those rare attempts at humour with which he interspersed his speech, said that the caucus dealt with questions with which the best intellects are wrestling in vain. By best intellects here are we to understand a sly reference to the honourable gentleman? The honourable member has not hesitated to deal with every question and to settle it to his own satisfaction. I suppose that the unemployed problem is one of the greatest that concerns mankind today, but he had a solution of it. And what was it? The simplest and most pleasant proposal that one could imagine. It might be applied by a child, and would furnish amusement for a summer evening to people of both sexes without danger either to their morals or to their physical well-being. It was simply this : That the condition being that people were unemployed, there should, be established labour bureaux, so that those who were without work might go to where work called for them, and had hitherto called for them in vain. It was, politically, economically, and industrially, a kind of mono-rail along which unemployed men would be seen bowling their industrial way. 'A man unemployed in Tasmania would be sent to CapeYork or to Fremantle, where work would be found for him. There was really no such thing as unemployment. There was merely, as it were, a congestion of unemployed in one place, and a scarcity of workers in another. It was assumed that distribution was all that was really necessary. My honourable friend, after some twenty years in public life, put forth that proposal with all the assurance of one who had discovered some entirely novel - [ I 4 J -2 principle which would solve this great problem. It was to such a scheme that the Leader of the Opposition alluded when he expressed regret that there had been omitted from the Governor General's Speech all reference to the establishment of an agricultural bureau and a labour bureau. The record of the last Government, indeed, was largely a record of bureaux. So far as anything original is concerned, I think they may be said to have gyrated around some three or four points. The Financial Agreement was to be embodied in the Constitution. That was the iate Government's own proposal, and no one wishes to rob them of it. The naval loan was also a proposition of their own, while the proposals for the establishment of an agricultural bureau and a labour bureau were made off their own bat. Such is a what record of which any party might be proud, and it was upon that record, with some other measures which might properly be described as trimmings, that the Leader of the Opposition went to the country and asked the people to return him and his party. The honourable member made some observations very similar to those made last night by the honourable member for Parkes in regard to the caucus. The Governor General's Speech, he said, had been drafted by the caucus. Even if it had been, I do not know that it would be a very serious matter, because, after all, a caucus composed of sixty-five representatives of the people would be just as likely to make a good job of the work as would any individual or party. But when we contrast this state of things with the system that has prevailed, we are. thrown into a condition of melancholy. In the days that are gone independent and manly spirits abounded. There was then no reference to the caucus. Then a political leader stood resolute against all dominance and improper influence. He was his own man. Occasionally, however;- he was some one else's man. By way of illustration of this, I propose to quote a few words from an introduction written by my versatile friend the honourable member for Ballarat to David Syme, the Father of Protection in Australia, by Ambrose Pratt-a n admirable work dealing with the life of a man who has left his mark on the history of Australia. At page xvii. of that introduction, the honourable member wroteIn yet another aspect the position of the Age in Victoria challenged comparison with that of other papers within or without Australia. The relations between its proprietor and public men were intimate to a surprising degree. He enjoyed their confidence in and out of office, shaping their programmes from time to time, governing their selection of colleagues as incoming Premiers, and enjoying afterwards a laiowledge of the inmost secrets of Cabinets often undisclosed to many of the Ministers within them. Directly or indirectly most of the active politicians in Victoria took care to keep in touch with the Age office; though the best - of them, even if they belonged to its own were treated with no special consideration columns. A calmer or more unblushing avowal of a condition of subserviency and absolute deFor pendence upon a person outside the of Parliament-of a condition of things that prevailed before we came here-could not well be imagined. No adjective that I am permitted to use in this House would do justice to it. Here was the owner a great newspaper drafting or outlining Governor's Speech on a Ministerial proglad gramme. The work was done, not by a caucus composed of sixty-five men who but yesterday received the imprimatur the people, and who came here with a date to do the people's work, but by a who .never went before the people. A newspaper proprietor drew up their gramme in those days, and it was he determined the personnel of a Ministry. Will any man dare to say, for one moment, that such influences are compatible with that responsible government, about which we have recently heard so much ? Something has been said about a caucus representatives of the people selecting Ministry. Curiously enough, on the busianything, ness-paper there is a notice of motion the honourable member for Perth in favour of the existing system being replaced that of elective Ministries. In other the honourable member proposes that a istry should be selected by Parliament. Whether that is good or bad, is a matter of opinion, but clearly if it be a good principle, there can be absolutely nothing moral in a party selecting a Ministry. any case, both systems are infinitely superior to that under which the selection of a Ministry is left to a newspaper prietor ; yet we have the assurance of Leader of the Opposition-who, we may perfectly certain, is not ill-informed matter, but is in a position to speak from personal experience - that practically man who ruled Victoria in days gone-by was not the man who stood at the head the Government, nor any one of those responsible to the people, not one of phalanx of obedient marionettes who behind their so-called leader, thinking Mr Hughes. that the elastic was not attached to their heads, but who danced, nevertheless, to the tune'lie set them-bu t a newspaper proprietor. The late Mr David Syme, the honourable member for Ballarat tells us, drafted their programmes, selected their Ministries, shaped their policy, and had revealed to him secrets that were not divulged to responsible party, Ministers supposed to represent the in its Crown. If that is responsible government in e.xcelsis, then I am glad that we have left such a plane, and are established here. the first time, and I say this advisedly, walls there has been a Governor General's Speech prepared - a Government programme brought down-abou t which there is no suspicion of influence outside the party who are pledged to support it. We of have nothing to gain and nothing to fear a from any newspaper in Australia. We are of the help of those which support us, and we have lived in spite of those had which opposed us. We stand here today of willing. and able to carry on the business manof the country and the people who sent us man here, and we have an absolute right, and shall claim it, to consult among ourselves prohow best to discharge that duty. No who meaningless babble of words by the honourable member about the caucus will deter us. The honourable gentleman said something about Tariff anomalies, with the idea of doing as much harm as possible in the time at his disposal. As to Tariff anomaof lies, the position is that he himself is a a Tariff Anomalist. He was one who, if lived, breathed, and derived his by virility from the virtues of Free Trade. I myself have been cowed, and have shivered by beneath the violence and virulence of his words, denunciation of my backsliding in this Minrespect; and yet he himself joins a Ministry led by a man who is the head and front of the Protectionist party in this country - that is, if by Protectionist is understood ima man who advocates Protection, but never In gives effect to it. The honourable member for Parramatta joined that party, and then brought forward a manifesto shaped, I do pronot know whether by any external aid- I the make no reference to the infernal region, be though the whole manifesto reeked of it. in this as the people evidently thought-but , at any rate, it was drafted in secret, and the the members of the party pledged themselves to it. I suppose the party were asked: of "" Do you accept this manifesto or agreement?"" and they had to either accept it or the reject it. I understand that four men did stood reject it, namely, the honourable member for Hume, the honourable member for Gippsland, the honourable member for Riverina, and the then honourable member for Bass. All the rest bowed their knee to Baal; and when I look around these benches, I see that Baal has done badly. In that manifesto it was declared, as to Protection, that, in the meantime, any anomalies that might be "" discovered in the Customs Tariff Act then lately passed by Parliament, would be examined, classified, and dealt with in due course."" The honourable member for Parramatta had something to say about a paragraph in the Governor General's Speech which he ascribed to me, and characterized as ambiguous, and as betraying ""careful inexactitude""; but I venture to say that, for comprehensive vagueness, and for ""careful inexactitude,"" the quotation I have just made will hold its own. It will repay a little trouble to look at it when we consider what that party did in relation to it. Did they discover any anomalies during their term of office of eight months? If so, where and what are they? If they discovered any, they never made the discovery public. they classify anomalies? We do not know. Did they examine them? We are not told. Did they deal with them? We know that they did not. And yet these gentlemen denounce the Government because it does not at once proceed to deal with Tariff anomalies. Had the late Government come back to power, what would they have done? What would such a Government, recruited from such a source, and born under such conditions, have done? Nobody knows. Certainly they would not have proceeded to deal with Tariff anomalies. The honourable member also referred to the honourable member for Darling having said that Protection was in danger by reason of the Fusion of parties, and to my having said that Free Trade was in danger by reason of the same event. But I hold that we were perfectly justified in giving expression to these opinions, however inconsistent they may appear. Protection must be in danger when there is an alliance between men who believe not in either Free Trade or true Protection, but in Revenue Tariffism and so-called Protection; and, Free Trade must be in danger for precisely the same reason. In the party to which I belong the only fiscalism to which we are pledged is a direct fiscalism. We look to raising revenue by other means than recourse to the Customs House-to us Protective duties mean Protective duties, and not revenue duties. I pass by the statement of the honourable member that the land tax is only useful for revenue purposes, and so forth, and desire to call the attention of honourable members to the question of borrowing for naval defence. The honourable member said that we should be justified in spending anything-h e did not say up to how much-in order to put our house in order. All I have to say is that die policy which has sufficed the greatest naval power in the woild from time immemorial-the policy of paying for the construction of all war-ships out of revenue-is good enough for us. As to the little references to a bankers' conference, and to the manager of the Norddeutscher Lloyd, they remind us, when looking over them subsequently, of nothing so much as a room in which a number of rats or mice have left the nibbled remains of papers littered about. Does anybody seriously heed such statements? Is it said for a moment that there was a conference with bankers, and that something was discussed Did in secret which the Prime Minister has some reason for hiding from the public? Every one knows that there was nothing of the sort. Then it is said that the manager of the Norddeutscher Lloyd said that the Government did not propose to injure the company's business; and, of course, we do not. Why should we? We are here to legislate for the benefit of the country; and if , in doing so, we tread on the corns of the Norddeutscher Lloyd Company, we cannot help it. We do not go out of the way to tread on anybody's corns, but we shall not allow any one to stand between us and what we conceive to be for the benefit of the people. The honourable member's remark about unification may pass. Mr. Wade, in New South Wales, during the Federal elections, did what he was able in the direction of stemming the tide, and failed miserably. These remarks about unification will not hurt us now, nor will the attempt to frighten the people in regard to it. In speaking of appropriating the Trust Funds, the honourable member tried to convey the impression that this Government had been guilty of an act of a kind for which men are sent to gaol; that is to say, he suggested that the act was done innocently enough, but that it was in the nature of a criminal offence. But the people of Australia ought to be told that Trust Funds under the control of the Commonwealth are not Trust Funds in the sense that the term is used in connection with ordinary trustees, but are Funds created by appropriations for certain uses, and that the Commontrol, wealth wrongs no person by using them. What happened in this particular instance was that, in order to make that adjustwealth ment which is absolutely necessary _ in these cases, an amount was debited against one of these Trust Funds. Theoretically or technically there was an invasion of that Trust Fund, but practically, and in fact, the Trust Fund was not friend, touched. On the morning of the day folcompared lowing, when the accounts were made up, the amount of revenue that had come in was sufficient to put the Trust Fund credit again. It was, in short, a keeping adjustment, and nothing more. much for the charge of our using Trust Funds. Now a word as to the short paythe ment to the States. When it is said that it is proposed to cheat the States, or, as were, float a compulsory loan, it should understood that what we propose to do is seek power, by way of a validating Act, use Trust Funds now lying to the credit the Commonwealth, to the amount of avowedly ,£500,000, while, as a fact, the States be paid all that is due to them during the present month. In regard to the £37,000, which was debited against the Trust Fund in the way I have described, there was technical breach, which was a mere bookkeeping adjustment - it did exist in point of tangible fact, and it not have existed technically, seeing that could have been readjusted by a bookemasculated keeping entry in the Treasury. As for .£444,000, that, as I said, will be justed and paid during the present month; and, under the circumstances, it is use of words to speak about misappropriapulsory tion. What has been done has been properly and constitutionally done. The honourable member said something about my attitude towards the transference of the State debts, and urged that the views that I expressed during the election are inconsistent with the view set forth in the Governor General's Speech. I said was that, before we could save any money by taking over the State debts, we should have to control borrowon ing, and that, since there was, though in the actual agreement, a condition plied, and loudly declared by both parties, that the States were still to be permitted to borrow where they liked, the kind transfer proposed could effect no saving; Mr Hughes. and, therefore, I asked the people to vote against it until there was a clearer understanding that one party should have conand there should be such other amendment of the section of the Constitution as would give the CommonTreasurer an absolutely free hand. There is in that nothing inconsistent with our present attitude. It was perfectly justified by the circumstances, and I am pleased to think that the people of New South Wales adopted it. My honourable when alluding to the rates of wages, things as they are now with things as they will be. He said that wages were now very high, and that people throughout Ausin tralia were most prosperous. If men are bookreceiving good wages now, to whom is it So due? To them? Not for one moment. There is not a law on the statute-book of Commonwealth, or of any State, dealing with industrial legislation, so far as reit gards the fixing of wages, that is not due be primarily and almost entirely to the initiato tive impetus and pressure of the Labour to party. Where Governments have done this of they have done it in the first place, and obviously, as the result of our will pressure. In this Parliament, who framed the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Bill? The honourable and learned a Leader of the Opposition. Who brought it in? The honourable and learned Leader not of the Opposition? At whose inneed stance? Ours. It was handed over to us it in the first Watson Government, and who it, or attempted to do so ? The the same honourable and learned gentleman. adWho gave effect to it? His heirs and successors, whom he subsequently "" dealt a miswith,"" let us say. Who introduced comarbitration into New South Wales? The Government which, assisted by the Labour party, turned out the Reid Government. Generally speaking, it is to the Labour parties of Australia that industrial legislation owes its very existence, its virility, and its usefulness. What is the record of the Governments that have preWhat ceded us? A White Australia, industrial legislation, old-age pensions - all these things owe their existence and their shape the statute-book largely to the innot fluence of the Labour party. There has imnever been a Government, until our time, that existed without our assistance, except the two brief Governments known as the of Reid-MCLean Government and the Fusion Government. For seven years the other Governments existed with the support of the Labour party. The honourable member for Parramatta has spoken about Governments bringing down their policy unshaped by external influences, but he knows perfectly well that he has, on the floor of the House, denounced the honourable and learned member for Ballarat for submitting his policy to the caucus for approval before he brought it down. He knows that the honourable and learned gentleman did so submit it, and that it was approved by the caucus.",38
310,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is not true.,45
311,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member for Wide Bay has often said that it is not correct that the policy of the Ministry was submitted to the caucus.,45
312,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I think it was on occasion.,45
313,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I wrote to Mr Watson, on the formation of my first Government, a list of the measures that we intended to submit, but that was just for his information.",45
314,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the honourable gentleman puts in his categorical refutation, I shall be very glad to furnish proofs, which, I think, will be perfectly satisfactory to the House and the country, that the position is exactly as I say. Further, it is true that the honourable gentleman declined to carry on unless we did approve of his policy. I think he was perfectly right in so doing. I am not saying this by way of criticism of him, because no man could expect to carry on government here with the support of members unless those members had had an opportunity of seeing the policy and knowing what they were going to vote for. The Labour party demanded that, and the honourable member was not only willing that it should be done, but insisted upon its being done. We had a perfect right to know what he was going to bring in, and he to know what we were going to do in regard to it. So, when the honourable member for Parramatta speaks of Governments before the Flood bringing down mighty programmes unshaped and unseen by the hand of mortal man until they saw the light of day for the first time when read by His Excellency, I reply that, historically, those assertions are not correct. The honourable member for Parramatta said that, after denouncing the inclusion of ten men in the Cabinet, we ourselves put ten men in. So we did, but I say again that the circumstances are entirely different. One would imagine that the circumstances under which a thing is done matter nothing, but I say they matter everything. To give a man £ 5 because he saved your life is one thing, but to give him £ 5 to kill another man is quite another, although the amount is just the same. A man comes to your, own church, and kneels with you in your own pew. There is no necessity to give such a man place and power to induce him to worship at your altar and accept the tenets of your creed, for these things he accepts already. But it is an entirely different matter if you want to proselytize him, to make him a traitor and a renegade. On the formation of the last Government there were at least two, if not three, factions one that came together under circumstances which will, perhaps, not be entirely known in our time. They agreed on some sort of modus vivendi, the basis of which was a division of spoils. What they said was, "" It is true that you were elected to oppose me, and I to oppose you, but come with me and let us go, and, here-perhap s this will help you along."" There were only nine billets, and there were more than thirty-nine of those gentlemen. Indeed, there were more than forty of them, although forty seems an eminently appropriate number for such a band engaged in such a business. It was suggested that the number of billets should be increased, and they were increased. The gravamen of our charge was not that they elected the Speaker",45
315,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Order! I ask the honourable member not to go into that question.,45
316,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Our complaint was not that they had ten Ministers instead of nine, but that the principle of giving men rewards for breaking their faith with. the public was absolutely incompatible with representative government, and that if men might be induced to break their pledges for money or pomp, or place and power, it was impossible to regard the Parliament as representing the people in any proper sense of the term. But with us it is entirely different. There is not'a man sitting behind us, and belonging to our party, that is not pledged to the people to support the planks of the Labour platform-that is to say, of the policy of the Government. We have not to give them a billet before they will support it. They will support it cause they are pledged to support it-bematta cause they are here on the distinct underfor standing that they will support it. We not have to buy support, or seduce men from the narrow way. We have simply to say to them, "" There is the plank of the platform,"" and they support it. The cirmember cumstances, therefore, are entirely different. Further, we have put an extra Minister the Senate, where certainly there was not the slightest necessity for our doing so, far as that point of view is concerned, seebut ing that we had an overwhelming majority there. We have not appointed a man in this Chamber, as the last Government did, who learned of his inclusion in the Cabinet be now put."" for the first time when hecame into chamber after the names of the Ministry had been announced. I do not know who selected him-whether it was the proprietor of some newspaper or Mr Joshua. I wish to close with a reference to the remarks with which the honourable member for Parramatta opened. He dwelt with some feeling upon the defeat of those men who supported his party at the last election. that I can join with him in all sincerity. I have always been a fairly keen fighter, but I do not think that any man on this side wishes to carry political feeling extent of rejoicing over the personal feat of another, and certainly not to jump Opposition. on him when he is down, as the honourable member for Parramatta suggested. But when the honourable member used this as a means for making an attack upon the orable member for Hume, I do object to I say nothing in depreciation of the efforts of the late representative of Bourke. doubt he did good work during the Tariff discussions. But the honourable member Hume is not to be accused, so far as know, of having contributed in any way his defeat. The late representatives Bourke, Batman, Maribyrnong, Corio, and other constituencies, owe their defeat, to the honourable member for Hume, but to members of the present Opposition, who, having led them like bullocks into the pithing pens, now hypocritically affect row for their downfall, and seek to shift the blame from their own shoulders to those of others. Had those who have been defeated been true to their hustings pledges, they would be here today. They have gone down, not because we attacked them, but because they were false to the prinnot ciples which underlie representative governfor ment. There are several other matters of Mr Hughes. bewhich the honourable member for Parraspoke, on which it is not necessary me to dwell. The Labour party is here do to carry out the mandate of the people, which we shall do as expeditiously and effectively as possible. I cannot help contrasting the treatment which the honourable for Parramatta says he is according to us now with that which we received in from him and his friends twelve months ago. He says that if this Opposition acted so as the last did, it would deserve the gag; he forgets that, before the last Fisher Administration could open its mouth to declare its policy, the honourable member for Wentworth moved, ' That the question 1 That was an inexcusable the and base stab, which will always be a blemish upon the reputation of our op-, ponents. When the present Leader of the Opposition was asked to express his opinion about what was done, he said, with the air of intolerable arrogance which he wore in those days, but which he has now dropped, "" Look at the state of the House."" I say In to him, "" Look at the state of the House, and at the state of the country."" If he thinks, as he says, that parties are made in adversity, there never was a party since the to the history of the world that had a better dechance to make itself than has the present",45
317,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Gippsland) [6.15] - I should not have risen but for the criticism honof the honourable member for Parramatta of it. the speech of the honourable member for Hume, all of which I did not hear, but the No Hansard report of which I have read, without finding in it any statements justifyfor ing the honourable member for Parramatta I in accusing him of having gloated over the to defeat of certain Opposition candidates. of There is in the speech a strong tone of exultation because the position which he and a not few others of us assumed during a stormy period of last session has been vindicated. In my opinion, he was justified in expressing his feelings in that way. The honororable member for Parramatta is the first speaker in this debate who has given evidence of bitterness regarding the defeat of the Opposition at the elections. Yesterday the honourable and learned member for Parkes spoke of the friendly way in which the discussion has been conducted, but I am surprised that the honourable member Parramatta has altered its tone, because I did not think that he could speak in any other way. The honourable member foT Hume, with four other Protectionists, refused to agree to the Fusion to which the rest of our party lent itself. We felt that we must stand by our platform pledges. This sticking to principle we regarded as essential to representative government. During the electoral campaign, almost superhuman efforts were made to bring about the defeat of at least two of us. The honourable member for Hume may fairly express his pleasure at the manner in which our position was vindicated, not only by our constituents, but by most of the constituencies of the Commonwealth. It was said that my first election to this House was the result of apathy on the part of electors, that only a certain percentage of the electors had recorded their votes, and that if 1; or 2 per cent, more had voted, I should not have been elected. But at the last election, when 7 or 8 per cent, more voted, I was returned by a majority of as many thousands and hundreds as the Prime Minister of the day was returned by a majority of only hundreds and tens. Nor was there any apathy on the part of the Fusionists. I had a Senator stumping the whole of my electorate, and candidates for the Senate doing their utmost to defeat me. Two paid organizers of the Farmers' League, one of whom has since told a Court that he has been unable to pay his debts on a salary of £ 5 a week, spoke against me, in addition to a paid representative of the Women's League, and several private members of it, and five or six local political aspirants. The ex-Prime Minister also addressed two meetings in my constituency. The utmost efforts were made to punish me for standing by the principles which I had advocated at the previous election. Under these circumstances, we are entitled to exult at our success. Had I broken my election promises and put aside the principles which I had advocated, by associating with men to whose principles I have been always bitterly opposed, and who had opposed the Governments which I had supported, finding nothing too bad to say of them. I should not have been called upon to face this antagonism. But we must say good-bye to representative government if the people cannot trust their representatives to remain true to their election pledges. We are elected on the strength of our platform utterances. If , having been elected to support a certain policy, we - associate with men opposed to that policy, - we offend against representative government. I interjected, when the honourable member for Parramatta was saying that the people had not endorsed the programme of the Labour party, that they had voted against the Fusion. It is admitted by Labour members that the triumph of their party was due, not merely to the increase in the number of their direct supporters, but to the fact that thousands of Liberals and Protectionists who detested the Fusion voted for them. These Liberals and Protectionists had to vote for candidates who had fixed things up for their own safety at the elections, without regard to their hustings pledges, treating their constituents as mere pawns in the great game of politics; or to refrain from voting; or to vote for Labour candidates. In voting for Labour candidates they may not have voted for the Labour policy, but they knew what it was, and that the party, if returned to power, would carry it into effect. They preferred that to trusting the administration of the affairs of the country to the Fusionists. The Labour party cannot cherish bitter feelings towards the Liberal section of the Fusion party, because their action has enabled it to win a tremendous victory, which otherwise might not have been gained for many years. The people feel that the Labour party can be trusted. Knowing the leaders of the party-no t irresponsible members of it who advocate extreme ideas outside Parliament-the y feel sure that they will do nothing detrimental to the interests of Australia. As one who has known those leaders in Parliament for the last three years, I am certain that no harm will be done to the public interest, though I do not agree with the whole of the Labour programme, and shall vote against such parts of it as I disapprove of. The electors could not do other than they did, and I , for one, rejoice at what was done. I do not rejoice at the defeat of former colleagues. I am sorry that they committed political suicide. The honourable member for Parramatta and his followers gave away nothing on joining the Fusion. It was, as I said last session, the Liberals who gave away all, and were outvoted in caucus.",46
318,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member should hear the views of some people in our State as to that matter.,47
319,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I know that some people said that the honourable member for Ballarat dominated the h morable member for Parramatta ; but if they took the trouble to read the honourable member for Ballarat's criticism of the then Opposition policy during the recess of 1908-9, and also bore in mind what his old policy was, and what was the policy to which effect was given by the Fusion Government, they would not for one moment deny that the honourable member for Parramatta had emerged triumphant, and carried his policy right through.",47
320,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I do not think I did. There was honourable compromise on both sides.,48
321,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member did, I think, make one compromise in connection with the defence scheme by carrying the cadet age from eighteen to twenty years. That is the only compromise, so far as I am aware, of which he was guilty.",48
322,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That was not all that we did.,48
323,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The late Government did many other things, but that was the only part of our policy that was carried out.",48
324,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We decided to send for Kitchener to frame a policy.,48
325,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Fusion Government brought in their scheme before they sent for Lord Kitchener. They passed a Defence Bill providing for the compulsory training of youths up to the age of twenty years, and a member of the Labour party moved an amendment providing that the compulsory training age should be extended to twenty-six years. That was the essence of the Bill introduced by Sir Thomas Ewing as Minister of Defence in a previous Deakin Administration. Yet every member of the Fusion party, including Sir Thomas Ewing, voted against that amendment.",48
326,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member is in error in saying that Sir Thomas Ewing's original proposal for compulsory service up to the age of twenty-six years was the same as that afterwards submitted to the House.,48
327,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The amendment which the honourable member for Gippsland refers provided for practically what Lord Kitchener proposed in his report, so far as the age limit was concerned, yet the honourable member for Parramatta voted against it.",48
328,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is so. Sir Thomas Ewing's proposal was to make training compulsory up to the age of twenty-six years, whereas the Bill introduced by the late Government limited the application of the principle to youths not exceeding twenty years of age.",48

330,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"They were to be made available by one registration a year after they had reached the age of twenty years - There was enough to swear by, but nothing more. There was nothing in the Bill providing that there should be regulation training up to the age of twenty-six years, as had been proposed by Sir Thomas Ewing, and that was the object of the amendment which was moved, I think, by the late Mr. Hutchison. There was only one feature connected with the defeat of the late Government, and Lord Kitchener's recommendation that the age must be increased to twenty-five years, which grieved me, and that was that I had looked forward with a somewhat grim satisfaction to seeing the honourable member for Parramatta, as Minister of Defence, bringing in a Bill to provide for compulsory training up to that age. That, however, might have been too great a price to pay for the honourable member's retention on the Treasury Bench.",48

332,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Shortl y before we adjourned for dinner I referred to the result of the last general election, and pointed out that the majority that had been returned to this side of the House was a vindication of the true principle of representative government, that members should remain loyal to the pledges they give. Great as that majority is, it would have been much larger if there had been in operation a system of preferential voting, the second ballot or the contingent vote, so that every man returned to the House would represent the majority of those voting in his constituency. A promise to provide for such an electoral system was certainly a prominent feature of the speechmade in the - Town Hall, Melbourne, by to the present Leader of the Opposition when the Fusion was launched. He said thenthat his Government would bring in a measure to provide for a member representing in every case an absolute majority of theelectors voting in his constituency. On three occasions last session I pressed the Fusion Government to say when they intended to deal with the matter, and was told emphatically on the last occasion, by the then Prime Minister, that a Bill would be - introduced that session.",48
333,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It was crowded out at the last.,48
334,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Probably ; but it was of such importance that something else ought to have been sacrificed to enable it to be dealt with.,49
335,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It would have taken a long time to carry.,49
336,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is a pity that an attempt was not made to pass such a measure, for true representation goes to the very root of representative government. If we had had in force some such system as I have mentioned, there would probably have been returned to this side of the House a greater majority than we have, because, as has already been mentioned, six members of the Opposition represent a minority of the voters in their respective electorates. When referring to the question of who had surrendered their principles, I said that those of my old party who joined the Fusion had done so. As a party, I think that that section of the Fusion undoubtedly suffered the worse at the last general election. Five of them were rejected; two got back by comparatively small majorities; one represents a minority of the votes polled in his constituency; and only two were returned by fairly large majorities, showing that their constituents approved of their action. These are the honourable member for Darling Downs and the honourable member for Cowper.",49
337,Mr R EDWARDS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I got back.,49
338,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But the honourable member was not a member of the Liberal party which joined the Fusion.,49
339,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He originally belonged to it.,49
340,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That was before I was returned to this House. Reference been made to the use of the ""gag>"" and it is just as well that the actual facts should be recorded in Hansard. In reply to an interjection in reference to the ""gag,"" the honourable member for BalHouse, larat spoke in a rather angry tone-i his reply was the only remark made by him that was not in his usual good value of this recital? humoured and courteous style.",49
341,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The interjection to which the honourable member refers was repeated several times.,49
342,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is so. It has been said in the press that the Fusion Ministry were able to get through a lengthy pronot gramme by the use of the "" gag."" As matter of fact, the "" gag "" was never used to stop systematic obstruction. I make that statement deliberately, because I think that I was in the chamber on every occasion that the "" gag "" was applied. It was used for the first time during the consideration of a non-party measure-the High Commissioner Bill. It was used then after a five-hours' debate, and was applied to the first member of the then Opposition who spoke against the measure. Why it was used, no one knows. It was then not 11 p.m. Shortly afterwards, it was used again, the only reason for its application being, so far as one could judge, that honourable members wished to catch the last suburban trains. About half-an-hour after midnight, it was used for a third time. Even the last suburban trains had gone, so that it was impossible to say what was the reason for its application. On another occasion it was used after a ten-minutes' debate, and, on still another occasion, after a nine-minutes' debate. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - That was when the honourable member for Gwydir moved its application.",49
343,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No ; I am referring to occasions when the "" gag"" was carried, and it could be carried only when moved by a member of the Ministerial party. On another occasion, it was applied after a debate extending over thirty-four minutes, and on still another occasion after a thirty-five minutes' debate. The longest debate that took place prior to its application was only seven hours twenty-seven minutes. On one occasion it was applied after a debate had proceeded for six hours forty minutes, and on yet another after a debate extending over three hours and twenty minutes. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Who was has the first to suggest the "" gag "" ?",49
344,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That has nothing to do with me. The "" g a g "" Standing Orders were passed before I was returned to the but they were never used until apn fact, plied by the Fusion Ministry. ",49
345,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I wish these facts to go into Hansard, in order to show that the "" gag "" was used capriciously, and not to put down obstruction, for obstruction never existed. On two occasions the "" gag "" was used within half-an-hour, and if it would be unparliamentary to say so, I should a say that it was used disgracefully.",49
346,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Order ! ,49
347,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Then I shall not so describe it, but I think I shall be in. order in saying that it was used unwarrantably in connection with the vital question of the Financial Agreement. It was applied, to the intense surprise of honourable members sitting behind the Government, who were opposing the Financial Agreement, and it was used then only because the Ministry had a majority in the House at the time, and were doubtful as to whether that majority would be available the following week. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - An attempt was made on the Opposition side of the House to apply the "" g a g "" to the then Minister of Defence when he was making his policy speech.",49
348,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"-And the whole of the then Opposition, with about three exceptions, voted against its application. Bad as was the use of the "" g a g "" in connection with the Financial Agreement, its application, on the motion for the adjournment of the House, half-an-hour after the consideration of that matter had been disposed of, will ever live in the minds of honourable members as the worse instance of the unwarrantable use of the procedure of Parliament.. It was carried amid a scene the equal of which had never previously been witnessed here.",50
349,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Le t us abolish and have done with it.,50
350,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not think there is need for the honourable member to suggest that it should be abolished, because I be much surprised if the present Governsession ment party ever use it. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - They will never have occasion to use it.",50
351,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Well , for long speeches that tempt its use, commend me to those the honourable member for Lang. I have felt at times, when listening to him, that should like to apply the "" gag "" to him it were justifiable to do so. I would rather sit here all night, however, apply the ""gag,"" save in the case . systematic obstruction, such as I stand was in existence in this House the ""gagging"" Standing Orders Were passed. When the 'adjournment of the House is moved on a Friday afternoon, is almost the invariable custom for ber of the Opposition to ask what business is to be taken on the following Tuesday. That question is put so that honourable bers from other States may know whether it is necessary for them to return on that day - When the Prime Minister moved the adjournment of the House on the Friday afternoon, upon which the Bill relating to the Financial Agreement was finally dealt with, the Leader of the Opposition, who is the present Prime Minister, than whom I think there is no more courteous member of the House, rose; but, when he had got as far as the words "" Mr Speaker,"" the "" gag "" was unceremoniously applied. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Who moved it?",50
352,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member for Parramatta, with the honourable member for Ballarat sitting alongside him; and I confess I was amazed to see that vote allowed to be carried. To the credit of several of the members of the Government party, they left the House rather than vote for that particular motion. It is just as well that the public should know how the ""gag"" was used; and that it should not be thrust down their throats, as was done continuously during the electoral campaign, that the Government were able to get through the business they did, only by using the "" gag "" against the Opposition.  with splendid effect; and I quite believe in it.",50
353,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am not surprised at the it honourable member for Echuca approving of the ""gag"" in order to stop a free expression any of opinion, seeing that he is a fortunate example of the defect to which I have alshall ready referred. The Government of lastdid not deem it their duty to pass a Bill providing that those who were elected to this House should represent a majority of the electors; and the honourable member for Echuca is an effectual instance of how the electors may be gagged, seeing that of only about 7,000 in Echuca voted for him, while 10,000 voted against him. There I is one other matter I would like to refer if to in connection with the recent general elections, and that is the Financial Agreethan ment. No matter what happened to the of various candidates-n o matter whether on underthe Government side, every man had when been defeated-so long as that agreement was defeated, I sliould be perfectly satisfied. The rejection of that it agreement was of infinitely more ima memportance to the future of Australia than any question of who should be returned. The electors, in three years, can,, memby their majority, remedy any defect they may see in the membership of the House; but, as has been pointed out repeatedly, it would probably have required little short of a revolution to strike out the Financial Agreement once it had been embodied in the Constitution. There was nothing more gratifying at the last election than to find, on the first appeal made on the question of the States versus Nationalism-and on a subject not at all favourable to stirring up people in the National interests-the electors, and particularly the young Australians, were sufficiently impressed with the importance of the occasion to respond to the National call, as against the dominance and attempted dictation of the State Premiers and State politicians, who attempted, by their manifestoes, to influence the electors. It is right, when on this point, to pay a tribute of praise to the great work done by the Melbourne Age. This was the only big daily newspaper, so far as I am aware, in Australia that fought the National issue; and it must be gratifying to the conductors of that great journal that they came through victoriously, as it was gratifying to those who were fighting for the National cause to know that they had this newspaper with them. I do not intend to deal with the various points of the Government policy, as disclosed in the Governor General's Speech, seeing that we shall have an opportunity later to deal with the measures as they come before us; and to do so now would only mean repetition. I am still of the opinion which I uttered on my entrance to this House, when I moved the adoption of the Address-in-Reply, that the discussion on such a motion as that now before us might well be abolished; indeed, that opinion is more confirmed than ever. I do not know, except when the Government is challenged, that the discussion on the Address-in-Reply is of any use whatever. I cannot see that it clears the decks for action; because the discussion on the various subjects is practically ""lost. I had no intention of speaking, and would not have, risen, had it not been for the remarks made today by the honourable member for Parramatta in reference to my old colleague, the honourable member for Hume. Knowing what that honourable member went through during the strenuous work of last session, and how his health broke down, as did that of other honourable members, some of whom have passed away, I could not, as one who went through that fight with him, hear what was said in his absence today, without resenting, on the first possible occasion, the imputation that in his speech he was gloating ever the defeat of his former colleagues.",50
354,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"He did, all the same.",51
355,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not expect, and never could expect, to get from the honourable member for Parramatta, the generous admission that what he had said in an ill tempered way was uttered in the heat of debate.",51
356,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I said it in no illtempered way. He singled the honourable members out by name, and gloated over their defeat.",51
357,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member for Hume did single out certain names; but I do not think there was any gloating; he was simply exulting that his policy and action had been vindicated, just as in the same way the Australian correspondent of The Times, expressed his gratification that his iprophecy in regard to the Fusion party had been fulfilled. When the Fusion party was formed, that correspondent, in his cablegram to The Times, saidMr Deakin seems to hope that the temporary association of the three sections will eventually cause an approximation of views and a consolidation into one party, but it is more probable that whenever a dissolution comes the whole of the present arrangement will be shattered at the polls. In the issue of 28th May last, the same correspondent rejoices that his prediction has come true, but it cannot be said that he is guilty of gloating. Nobody regrets more than I that the members mentioned by the honourable member for Hume-and the meremention of the names is no sign of gloating - were defeated. Some of them. I was associated with as personal friends for years, and I felt bitter regret when I saw them join the Fusion, knowing that they were, as I told them at the time, committing political suicide. I am sorry to think that their action has led to their political doom at the hands of the electors, who, doubtless, felt that they had been wronged; and I am satisfied that if the honourable members referred to had that time over again there would be no Fusion. I do not expect to get such an admission, but I do not think any one of my party who joined the Fusion can ever have said that they were glad at having done so, or that they would be prepared to do so again if they had the opportunity of staying out. I have to apologize to the House for taking up so.much time, but loyalty to one who was associated with me in a strenuous fight demanded an expression of my views in reply to the charge made by the honourable member for Parramatta ; and when I was on my feet I was drawn into dealing with other matters.",51
358,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Capricornia) [8.5] - I congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on the attainment of the high office you hold, and I promise to give all the assistance in my power to make your term as pleasant as possible. I listened with a great deal of interest to the speech made by the Leader of the Opposition, particularly his remarks as to the possible danger from an alteration of our system of government. I confess that it was with some anxiety I contemplated that alteration. Formerly, our caucus was composed of a minority, and there was every reason why that minority should work unitedly together to insure the ""strongest possible loyalty to one another. Owing to the mistakes of honourable members opposite we are now a very powerful party in both Houses, but we still maintain the caucus system. Personally, I must confess I had some anxiety when I saw that we had such a majority combined with a continuance of that system; but as time flies I am satisfied that the caucus, as we now have it, is an improvement on the system of government carried on by our friends of the Opposition. I see no reason why we should not accept responsibility for the fact tiiat the Government programme was submitted to the caucus. We will admit that 011 the items of the party programme the party is consulted, and that every member is bound by the majority vote. As to matters which are not on the party platform there is the utmost freedom of action; and during this debate honourable members had sufficient evidence of that in the speeches of the honourable' member for Gwydir and the honourable member for Cook. What is the difference between the two systems? The honourable member for Parramatta and the honourable member for Ballarat have spoken, the latter possibly in bitter terms, of the ""iron rule"" of the caucus. But the ""iron rule"" of the caucus, so far as I understand it, simply means",52
359,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Do not say "" bitter terms,"" say strong terms.",52
360,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Perhaps if I say that the honourable member for Ballarat made a very amiable address, I shall get over the difficulty. So far as I have observed the effects of the so-called "" iron rule "" of the caucus, it only means that the Labour party demand that a Labour representative shall cany out his pledges, and that if he fails to do so they will do their level best to keep him out of Parliament. We do not find a system of punishment pursued by the Labour party throughout Australia, such as is meted out to any one on the. other side who dares to offend against party principles.",52
361,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Do we not?,52
362,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The utmost that can be said is that the Labour party have succeeded in defeating candidates who formerly belonged to the party; indeed, I suppose there are fifteen or sixteen members whose names I need not mention, but who have been defeated because of disloyalty to the party which brought them into political life. All that can be pointed to is the decision of the people of the Commonwealth tiiat these candidates shall no longer be members of Parliament. Let us take the other side. Do honourable members not know of, or are they blind to, the treatment that the honourable member for Parkes received the moment he felt disposed to exercise a little of his liberty of action and thought? What was the sriticism which appeared in the Daily Telegraph, of Sydney, for example? That paper made the honourable member come to heel, so to speak; and Mr Henry Willis, the ex-member for Robertson, was also brought up to the bull-ring by the other side because he chose to differ from them. Other members on the other side who represent what may not unfairly be described as the capitalistic section, know the secret influences that can be brought to bear to prevent a man even getting a living. How many briefs would the honourable member for Parkes get in the Courts if he were to sign the Labour platform? The honourable member for Darling Downs will be able to tell us from his experience what treatment is meted out to barristers who dare to advocate any of t\n planks of the Labour platform, or any Labour principles. Honourable members know that if any man in business-and most men in business work on overdraftsdares to advocate the Labour programme, he will quickly get a notice from his bank that he must discontinue doing so, or clear off his overdraft. That is a common experience. In many business houses, if an employee associates himself with the Labour party so far as to mount the platform, he often receives notice to leave his employment.",52
363,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Does the honourable member think the banks will give a man notice to withdraw his account because of his tical opinions, if his security is satsfachonorable tory ?",52
364,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do. I can give the honourable member cases where the banks promptly indicate to a man that if he does not discontinue his advocacy of the Laten bour platform, or stop showing sympathy with the Labour party, he will have to his financial obligations and transfer account. Honourable members opposite exthat press surprise at the presence of so many representatives of the artisan class in House, and cannot understand how it that the public have taken the miner from the mine, the carpenter from the bench, and the clerk from his office desk to send them into Parliament. The reason is that, by such tyrannical systems as I have cated, it is made impossible, as a rule, the business man or professional man, architect, or the lawyer, to join the bour party. We can point to exceptional cases, where barristers have given us their assistance, and business men have had the courage to take up the advocacy of Labour principles; but they are very few in numnow ber. The honoiable member for Ballarat quoted figures to show that some 630,000 voters voted for the Labour party, and about 600,000 for the other side, and comcerely plained that a large number of electors on the other side have no reprein sentation. But the honourable member is one of those responsible for that state affairs. In 1902, when the Electoral Bill was being put through Parliament, the bour party pleaded with honourable memworkers. bers opposite to allow the electors to vote foi one senator if they chose. We pointed out that if electors were compelled to for the full number of senators required, political parties would be compelled to lect the full number, and that cases might arise where one party would get the whole of the representation in Parliament. But honourable members on the other side, who now plead with us to be merciful, as we strong, when they were strong had no conWe sideration for us, and forced us to use block vote. At the last elections eighteen senators were returned by the Labour party, representing the full number of seats vacant, so that honourable members opposite cannot complain. I am still of opinion that entitled. minorities ought to get some representation. It is not right that one party should have it all ; but when we tried to secure a pronot succeed. portional system, honourable members, thought they had the power, refused to poliallow any modification to be made. The member for Parramatta wished to-night to set up a standard, and proposes later on to sum up the results of our legislation, in order to ascertain whether we have made any improvement in the conditions of the people during a period of, say, years. But surely the honourable member ought to go back to a period prior to meet Federation, and ask what was the condihis tion of Labour in the Commonwealth at time, compare it with what it is now, and ascertain to what that improved conthe dition is due. It is certainly not due to is the carrying out of the policy of Free Trade, which the honourable member came into this House to advocate. In addition to the factors mentioned by the honourable member for West Sydney, in the various indiLabour Acts which have been passed, we for have succeeded,- in spite of the honourable the member for Parramatta, the honourable Lamember'for Lang, and other Free-traders, in establishing a system of Protection. I am not at all satisfied with the protection that we have obtained. We have certainlyimproved the condition of affairs, and haveabout a quarter-of-a-million people employed in factories and receiving something like £19,000,000 in wages, but the Tariff is not as good as it ought to be, and I sinhope we shall have a revision of it at an early date. I regret that I am not complete accord with certain members oa this side, who say that they will not of give further Protection unless they can secure an alteration of the Constitution to Laenable them to give protection to the While I am thoroughly in accord with, every effort that will be made to secure the new Protection, as well as protection for vote the manufacturers and employers, I think that, should we for any reason fail in that seeffort, we ought to still go on, and give high Protection to the manufacturers. It is far better for us to have a man manufacturing in this community, even a man who is prepared to sweat his employees, than to are have him in London, Berlin, or New York. can deal with him if he is in Australia, the because we have also our State Labour parties, and if we in the Federal Parliament cannot succeed, I hope that the State Labour parties will succeed in securing for the workers the protection to which they are",53
365,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The fact is that we do who . Mr HIGGS - The honourable member may not, perhaps, recognise the strides we have made in twenty years, but we are making rapid strides, and although the Wages Boards are causing irritation in some respects, I believe that they are effecting a silent revolution for the betterment of the people. I have heard honourable members say that they desire the Commonwealth Parliament to obtain control of all industrial legislation. While I am in favour of that view, it is only on condition that the State Parliaments refuse to avail themselves of their powers to better the conditions of the workers. I am not at all anxious, as I regret to notice that some members seem to be, to add to the powers of the Commonwealth. We have powers enough already if we carry them out. There are several paragraphs amongst the thirty-nine Federal powers set out in section 51 of the Constitution, to which we can devote our attention without endeavouring to obtain other powers yet. Rather than have unification, I would prefer to see the creation of a larger number of States, and hope at an early date to take the sense of ihe House as to whether honourable members are prepared, under section 123 of the Constitution, to give a Constitution to the people of Australia who may require or ask for it, whether in Queensland or in any other part of the Commonwealth.",53
366,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"May I point out that in 1906 we introduced, and carried through its second reading, a Bill to secure preferential voting, but were unable to proceed with it because Parliament was adverse?",54
367,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I admit that the honourable member and his party were favourable - to a system of minority representation, but ihe natural leader of that party in the - Senate, of which I was at that time a member- I refer to Sir Josiah Svmon-move d an amendment of the Electoral Bill to provide tiiat the electors of the Commonwealth must vote for three Senate candidates, and /no fewer. I do not agree with those honourable members who consider the Address""""in-Reply debate a waste of time. Standing Orders are the outcome of a few centuries of experience, and are for the protection of minorities. If the Addressin-Reply debate were done away with, honourable members would not have the opportunity which they now have, of emphasizing those reforms which do not happen to find a place in the Government programme.",54
368,Mr CHANTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,They get it off Supply.,54
369,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"They may, but I favour the retention of this standing order, as this appears to be the best time, that is, at the commencement of a session, for members to refer to matters which are not in the Governor General's Speech. One of those matters is the abrogation of the custom which formerly obtained in this Parliament, of the wearing of the wig and gown by the Speaker. I congratulate you, sir, upon having abandoned those habiliments, for if there is one thing which gives the public outside an idea of the extravagance of Parliament, it is the adoption of such forms and ceremonies. The mace, which finds a place on the table when you are in the Chair, and is put under the table when you leave the Chair, is another piece of furniture which I hope to see removed from the House and placed in a museum"". There are one or two matters referred to in the Governor General's Speech upon which I wish to say a few words which may not find a ready response in the minds of honourable members. While every normal man must have had sympathy with the Royal Family in the sad bereavement which befell them in the death of King Edward the Seventh, those who are candid must admit tiiat there was a great deal of extravagance in the memorial services hehi to mark it. I do not like to use harsh terms, but it seems to me that there was a good deal of hypocrisy about the ceremony at Parliament House. Extravagant language was alsoused by the press. We were told that "" Melbourne was shocked,"" and several persons spoke of their "" deep sense of personal loss,"" though possibly they had never even seen the King.",54
370,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Thos e expressions were perfectly sincere.,54
371,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In justice to the honourable member I must say that there was nothing extravagant in his remarks concerning the event, but there was a great deal of extravagance in the press comments thereon. There was nothing like so much display at the time of the death of Queen Victoria, whose reign much more deserved Our commemoration.",54
372,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There was a strong personal feeling for the late King.,54
373,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I think that a false standard of taste is set by expensive ceremonies such as those to which I am referring. They lead people to do things which they cannot afford to do. Only the other day I read that an old lady in receipt of 7s. 6d. a week, of which 3s - 6d. was paid for rent, saved jQxx to prevent herself from having a pauper's funeral. The expenditure of thousands of pounds on pageantry, pomp, and ceremony in conI nexion with the death of Royal has a bad effect on the community. As to His present Majesty, King George the Fifth, I observe that Sir George Reid says that if England were to become a republic, the people would unanimously elect His Majesty King George the Fifth as the first President. I do not know whether there is anything in our High Commissioner's suggestion, but I should hail with pleasure the time when he must submit his name to the responsible for the second invitation. electors as we have to do on the expiration of each Parliament. I see no reason why kings should not be elected now as they were in former times.",54
374,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable memget ber is expressing a pious hope.,55
375,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The opinion is one which the better. I hold strongly. Honourable members were invited to attend the Memorial Service at Parliament House in "" official - dress,"" which, I understand, means a topper hat, frock coat, kid gloves, and .patent leather boots.",55
376,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"And , I suppose, trousers.",55
377,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Of course. The honour the able member would not expect us to attend in kilts. Those who were supposed - overwhelmed with grief at the death of - late Majesty ordered that none should tend the memorial service except in "" official - dress,"" or in uniform. The Postmaster General says something about fancy vests. I occasionally wear fancy vests, and intend to continue to do so. Every man should - be allowed to wear, what he likes. The present Ministry, of which the honourable member is such an ornament, might have lowed members to attend the service of which I speak in whatever clothes they wished to wear. That there may be no about the terms of.the invitation, let me pauperism. read what is printed on the card which receivedHis LATE MOST GRACIOUS MAJESTY Their Excellencies the Governor General of and the Governor of Victoria - notify that a Memorial Ceremony will take at the Federal Parliament House, at 2.30 p.m., be carried out. on Friday, 20th May, 1910.

I understand that the Government was not I do not wish to say a word which will help to swell the wave of anti-religious feeling which appears to have struck Australia as well as other parts of the world. The further the people of the Commonwealth from Christianity, the worse it will be for them, and the nearer they keep to it, The invitation to attend the Communion Service at St. Paul's Cathedral - a service which, as Anglican members know, must have included the recitation of bellthe Lord's Prayer and of the Ten Commandments, with the response, "" Lord have mercy upon us and incline our hearts to keep this law,"" should not have required assumption of ""official dress."" Such a card is in some degree an answer to those to be who ask-Why do not the working classes His go to church ? I am glad that the Governatment proposes to reduce the age at which women may receive pensions, though I am sorry that a provision is not made for a scheme of compulsory insurance against old age, sickness, and unemployment. Probably the Government thinks its programme too long for one session, but if one reform should occupy a place before all others, alit is that which I have mentioned. Whatever we may say to the contrary, there is a feeling abroad that our present old-age mistake pension sys'tem savours of charity and When the people of Australia understand the matter, they will be only too I glad to agree to contribute weekly to a fund to provide against old age, want of In Memoriam. employment, or sickness. I understand that in Germany the compulsory insurance KIXC EDWARD VII . system is rapidly displacing the old system, the applications for relief under which Australia are rapidly diminishing. It would be a good thing to appoint actuaries to ascertain place how best such a scheme as I suggest could I am pleased that the Naval Loan Act is to be repealed. I am opposed to the control of the Australian army or navy passing into the hands of any one outside of Australia.",55
378,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,At any time? Enclosure N .,55
379,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"At any time. I object to the control of the Australian army and navy passing into the.hands of the British Government while the British House of Commons is elected on a property qualification. If every man and woman in Great Britain could exercise the franchise as in Australia, the matter would not be so serious, but, knowing as I do that the British House of Commons is elected on the most unequal and unfair franchise, I say that it would be dangerous to allow the control of the Australian army and navy to pass into the hands of the British Government. This is a view which I expressed on the hustings,, and for the expression of which I was elected by a great majority. My position was supported by Mr Justice Higginbotham, the late Chief Justice of Victoria, who said I do not know what advantage this (Victoria) or any of the neighbouring Colonies can gain by paying in time of peace for either a military or naval force which may be withdrawn' in time of war. If a regiment or a ship of war, kept here in time of peace, be withdrawn in time of war, of what earthly use is it to us? And if outside our own control, it may be drawn, and probably will be withdrawn. Honourable members have spoken of the battle of the future taking place in the North Sea, and of Britain requiring to centrate her naval force in one spot. Havtish ing regard to England's experience it is not at all likely that the British naval authorities would allow the British Isles to be unprotected. In June of that year, powerful squadron of seventy Dutch vessels appeared in 'two divisions at the mouth of the Thames, one of which passed up the river to Gravesend, while the other entered the MerseyThe unprotected shores were ravaged with punity; the fortifications of Sheerness f e l l dockyard of Chatham was fired, and several of the finest vessels laid up in ordinary were burnt. Why should Australia allow her war vesfor sels to leave her own coasts unprotected? Honourable members must know what damtecting age can be done by a single vessel. They will remember that during the American civil war a small merchant steamer-the Australians ? Sumter-wa s converted into a warship, and called the Alabama, and that she succeeded in capturing sixty-three vessels. these she burnt fifty-three, while others were released on bond or captured.",56
380,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Sh e captured them South Africa ? miles away from the American coast.,56
381,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That does not affect my nate interjection. argument. What she did is best described in the words of her captain, in addressing his men on one occasionYou have at length another opportunity of meeting the enemy-the first that has been presented lo you since you sank theHatteras. In the meantime, you have been all over the world, and it is not too much to say that you have destroyed and driven from protection under neutral flags one-half of the enemy's commerce, which, at the beginning of the war, covered every sea. That was done by one vessel, notwithstanding that the United States of America had afloat at the time no less than 300 armed vessels. Our Inter-State shipping has an annual value .of about £30,000,000, and are we going to allow our coasts to be unprotected by permitting the Naval Commandant to order all our warships away whenever there is any trouble in the Old Country? Honourable members must not forget that the late Government agreed to allow the vessels of the 'Australian Fleet to be sent to other parts of the world not only in time of war, but at a time of threatened war. It is in regard to that point that I think that the Deakin-Cook Government withacted wrongly, and really betrayed Australia.",56
382,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Would the British Government betray England, in the opinion conof the honourable member, by allowing Briwarships to come to Australian waters in 1667, to defend Australia?",56
383,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The whole trend of the public utterances of the authorities who have a been quoted in support of the late Government's scheme goes to show that, in their opinion, all the naval forces of Great Britain would need to be concentrated at one spot. I take the contrary view that we ought to see that our own shores are proimtected. Honourable members opposite seem to ; the indicate by their remarks that they consider we are doing nothing .for the protection of the Empire. Have we not been spending many years £1,000,000 per annum or thereabouts upon defence? Are we not proour coaling stations? Are we not improving Australia, as a matter of fact, by the sacrifice year by year of hundreds of Mr Bruce, SMITH - I suppose the honOf orable member knows that Great Britain spends annually £70,000,000 on defence, and that it spent ,£250,000,000 in vindicating the rights of his countrymen in",56
384,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is a very unfortu,56
385,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,A very true one.,56
386,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The so-called vindication of the rights of our countrymen in South Africa was in reality a vindication of the rights or the wrongs of the capitalists. It was a capitalistic war, and every one has now to admit that it was cruel and unjust.",57
387,Mr HALL,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,And unnecessary.,57
388,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It was an unnecessary war, and has not succeeded, after all, in its professed object.",57
389,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Has it not consolidated all the South African colonies ?,57
390,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It has; but only in name is that Federation united to the Mother Country. The British flag is flown by it, but to all intents and purposes South Africa now is as much a Boer country as ever it was. It is in the hands of the Boers, and without doubt will remain in their hands. I am satisfied to believe that South Africans will do nothing against the Old Country, but I am equally satisfied that they are determined to have self-government.",57
391,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,So are we.,57
392,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,They will not tolerate interference from outside.,57
393,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No r will we; but we are part of the British Empire.,57
394,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We shall have another opportunity to discuss the defence question, and I do not propose to deal with it further at this stage. I am pleased that the honourable member for Parkes is present, because I wish to make reference to some observations which he made last night. The honourable member, in extending a welcome to us, was a little personal. He said that we were very well dressed.",57
395,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I said that of the honourable member for Werriwa; I did not say that the honourable member was.,57
396,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We all know that the honourable member for Parkes is the very glass of fashion and the mould of form. I was somewhat surprised to find him so quietly dressed, having read on one occasion a newspaper description of his attire in this House. That - description set forth that Mr Bruce Smith, immaculately dressed, rose. He was attired in a brown velvet coat, a blue silk vest, and wore patent leather boots. Adjusting his golden fince-nez, he advanced to the table with the step of a dancing master, and commenced to speak from notes written on scented notepaper.",57
397,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That was all in the 'Aee. ' Mr HIGGS - Evidently the honourable gentleman read the paragraph in the Age, to which I refer; but what interested me most of all was the earnestness with which he quoted from an article on "" T h r if t "" in the Brisbane Worker, based upon a paragraph stating that in Edinburgh a society had been formed to encourage thrift amongst the working classes. The honourable member apparently does not recognise how ironical it is for one like himself to talk about thrift among the working classes. During his whole life probably he has never denied himself one solitary comfort.",57
398,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Oh , has he not?",57
399,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"He may have denied himself a position in a Ministry, but I do not suppose that he has ever denied himself a single comfort. Will the House bear with me while I quote from a speech made last year in the House of Commons by Mr. Lloyd-George, in referring to the case of which I spoke a little while ago?A case has been brought to my notice of an old lady, seventy-five years of age, who said she was earning 7s. 6d. a week in mantle-making. She gave the name of her employer, from whom it was ascertained that her average earnings were only about 6s. 6d. a week. She was paying 3s. 6d. a week in rent, and, therefore, she had only 3s. a week on which to live. Very often she had to subsist on bread and tea, and her only chance of gettingmeat was by going to a butcher's shop on Saturday night when the shop was about lo close and buying scraps. Yet she had kept £11 in the Savings Bank in order to avoid having a pauper's funeral.",57
400,Mr LLOYD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"George mentioned this as only one of many cases proving that many people in the Old Country are struggling most heroically against the direst poverty. He went on to sayWhat strikes one about such cases is how people have fought the hoTror of the Poor Law. There are 2^0,000 people over seventy years of age in receipt of Poor Law relief. This Act has disclosed the presence among us of over 600,000 people, the vast majority of whom were living under circumstances of great poverty, and yet disdained the charity of the Poor Law. It has revealed the heroic' struggle between pride and privation in scores of thousands of miserable little rooms and hovels which has gone on apparently unknown; and I am glad that succour has come at last. I have here a cable which appeared in the Rockhampton Morning Bulletin of 7 th A p r i l , 1910The number of persons who died from starvation in England and Wales last year was 125. Fifty-two of the number died in London, While this is so there are in London rich people who give dinners costing as much as £125 per guest. Is it not absurd for the honourable member for Parkes to say that the working classes of Britain ought to become thrifty, and save their money, seeing that so many people there die of starvation every year, and since so many hundreds of thousands are in the position of the poor woman who received only 7s. 6d. per week, 3s. 6d. of which was paid away in rent? I interjected while the honourable member was speaking that the abuse of thrift is .a mistake.",57
401,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Did the honourable member say that dinners costing £125 per head were given?,58
402,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes . Let me make a quotation bearing on the point from the Pall Mall Gazette, of February, 1909. In an article by Susan Carpenter on The Bills of Lucullus, we have the statement in regard to one dinnerThis beautiful repast worked out at the rate of / 5 0 a head. This was but a trifle compared with the famous "" Night in Venice"" dinner. This was a record in the way of speedy and clever arrangement. The host gave Mr. Pruger only twenty-seven hours to prepare. Over a hundred men worked through the night, ccating the Savoy courtyard with concrete and filling it with water to simulate a lagoon. A special gondola, large enough to seat the four guests and allow room for the waiters, had to be built, with smaller ones lo carry the guests from the quay to the white gondola placed in the centre of the water. This was a mass of rare pink carnations, and there were arches of the same flowers over the landing steps and all about, the flowers alone coming to £900, and the entire entertainment to That works out at £ 1 2 5 for each person. The face of ihe honourable member for Parkes is covered with smiles at this recital; and yet he is the honourable member who lectures the Labour party because they say thrift can be carried to excess.",58
403,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The member is the man who sees irony in everything; yet he misses it here.,58
404,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I consider that the poor old lady, instead of saving her money to avoid a pauper's funeral, would have been better advised had she used it to obtain food, for she then might have lived a little longer. It is a mockery to talk to the working classes about thrift in cases of that kind. This old lady was able to subsist on bread and tea; but I ask the honourable member for Parkes, what good would it be to Australia if the whole of the working classes were to endeavour to subsist on such food? No doubt they could do so for a considerable time; but, just look at the mass of misery and destitution that would ensue if we all attempted to live as this poor old lady lived. The honourable member, of course, is able to smile at this kind of thing; and we might well imagine a leaf out of his diary, such as the following-7 o'clock, rang the bell for tea and a biscuit; half-past 7, read the Age.",58
405,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What about the Brisbane Worker?,58
406,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Perhaps , I ought to say : - half-pas t 7 rang the bell for a bath, and instructed the girl to put a bottle of lavender water in it ; quarter to 8, read the Argus; 8 o'clock, had a very copious breakfast; 9 o'clock, wrote a chapter of my magnum opus, "" Bruce Smith, orator and statesman""; 11 o'clock, read the Brisbane Worker, and made a few extracts; 1 o'clock, had light lunch, consisting, of soup, roast beef, Yorkshire pudding, and apple pie; 2 o'clock, walked in the gardens for recreation purposes; 4 o'clock, afternoon tea; 6 o'clock-, had dinner of various courses, winding up with black coffee and benedictine.",58
407,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I should like to retwentymind the honourable member that, in coming from Albury, this week, the honourable member for Parkes had 6d. worth of food, whereas every Labour member had 2s. worth !",58
408,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"At the present time, we never hear of lectures on thrift from the working classes, because, as a rule, such lectures are delivered by orators like the honourable member for Parkes; and the irony of the thing appeals to the people. As to immigration, the party on this side have repeatedly said that they do not object to it, but, as the Government say, are in. favour of it, providing proper Australian honourable conditions are established. The only people who, in my opinion, can be safely asked to come to Australia, are those engaged in farming and agricultural pursuits generally. I object strongly to the use of Government money to bring artisans, such as carpenters, blacksmiths, and engineers,, to Australia, unless there is work for them; and certainly there is no work at the present time. Honourable members opposite speak of the need for immigration, and are quite willing to spend millions of money in bringing people here; but not to compete with themselves. There would be a great outcry if it were proposed to bring from England, Ireland, Scotland, or Wales, any barrister lo compete, for example, with the honourable member for Parkes. Notwithstanding all the professed anxiety for immigration, a barrister is allowed to come from the Old Country to practise in any of the States of Australia.",58
409,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I was an English barrister, and I came here without paying a i d . for the privilege of practising; the f honourable member is very badly informed.",59
410,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am so sorry. I may be wronglv advised; but I have seen it stated in the newspapers that the strongest efforts were made, not very long ago, to prevent a barrister coming from Queensland to practise in New South Wales.",59
411,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is another matter altogether.,59
412,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There is no doubt that, since Federation, there has been an attempt, on the part of the legal profession, to liberalize their trade union, and bring about a federation of barristers and soliciCommonwealth tors in Australia. I am surprised to learn that an Irish or English barrister can come and practise in Australia without underCommonwealth going certain examinations, or paying high fees.",59
413,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"At any time, for last quarter of a century-for the last halfterritory century.",59
414,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Not being in the legal profession, I must accept the word of honourable member for Parkes. Of course, 1 can understand that the barristers of tralia would be quite willing to admit the honourable member free of charge and without examination; because they could see r ¥ i T \ I ; J that he would be a great acquisition to the profession. As to Preferential Trade, we heard very little about it during the tions from honourable members - opposite. This was to occupy a very prominent posiwords tion in the Government programme, had the other side been returned to power; I should like to know, from the honourable member for Parramatta, why so little was said about it. I venture to think that the reason may be found in the fact that, when Sir Robert Best was inviting die Chambers of Commerce to endeavour to bring about system of preferential trade, he received a deputation, in this city, from 400 women workers, who were seeking for greater protection against imported materials. It is of no use for Australia to try to Empire. help the poor of the Old Country by a system of preferential trade, and by ing British goods to come in at a lower of duty than is imposed upon goods from other places. The only hope for the workappreciative ing classes of Great Britain, I am conin not vinced, is to adopt a system of high Protertion. and for the electors to send into the House of Commons men pledged to a programme similar to our own. When the matter comes up for decision here, although m a v be in a minority, I shall do my humble best to see that the only case ih which we give a preference in trade to Great Britain shall be in respect of those trades where the employers pay the same rate ot wages and adopt the same hours of employment as do employers in Australia One or two items in the Government prograrnme are of a non-party character. I am thoroughly in favour of the Commonwealth taking over the Northern Territory it is our duty to relieve South Australia tram the heavy financial loss which she is sustaining year after year. But I do not think that South Australia ought to ask the to build a railway line subject to certain conditions. The construction of the railway ought to be left to the Parliament, subject to further information to be obtained. Let me also say that I view with some anxiety the the idea of the Commonwealth taking over the if it is to be governed from Melbourne. We shall find considerable difficulty m governing a country some thousands the ot miles away from us. If we take over the territory, the sooner we give to the Auspeople who live there the right to govern themselves the .better for them arid for us SON (Robertson) r - OH N 2 o - s h o u l d not h a v e risen to address the House on this occasion, except that it elechas been impressed upon me that it is a duty of every new member to have a few to say on the Address-in-Reply, in order, I suppose, to have his remarks reand corded in Hansard. At the outset, I may state, as a supporter of the Labour party outside Parliament, and as a member of that party here, that I am in perfect accord with that paragraph in the Governor General's Speech wherein is expressed the deep rea gret of the people of this country at the decease of our late sovereign, King Edward VII . , and our congratulations upon the succession of his son, King George V., to the exalted position of ruler over the British From what I have read, and from what I am led to believe, we have in allow the present King a man whose heart is rate large, who is full of sympathy for the suffering and the afflicted, who is deeply of the local needs of the people various parts of the Empire, and who views with scorn and contempt all unworthy and unmanly actions and motives. Theremore fore, I endorse to the full the parasalary graph in the Speech wherein is expressed - our grief at the decease of the late monarch and our sense of satisfaction and pleasure that his place has been filled by so worthy successor. Among the burning questions which appear to trouble the Federal political mind just now is.that of telephone rates, which is connected with that of postal facilities. There are honourable members who can work themselves into a state - fine frenzy over some imaginary difficulty or disability which they think is likely be placed' upon the dwellers in our towns and cities with regard to the price - charged for telephone communication. would ask those honourable members to give some consideration to the man in the - country districts, the primary producer. Consider the conditions under which these people are living. If , as the representative of the Robertson electorate, I make applicapassed, tion to the Post and Telegraph Department for telephone communication to be made with some outlying district in my constituvoluntary ency, I find that it is necessary to get number of reports and estimates as to the amount of business estimated to be done. After some delay, I receive a letter showing the amount of revenue expected to be rived from the proposed telephone line, and proving that the business will not cover the cost of erection and maintenance. It strikes me that if that kind of test were applied to the service in our cities and large towns, it would be much more advantageous to private the taxpayers. I trust that the Postmasterasking General will endeavour to liberalize his policy, and especially to liberalize the manin the Robertson electorate. agement of the telephone service, so that it will be more readily available to the primary producers who live in the country - districts. A service of this kind would an inestimable boon to many of them, and far more highly appreciated than it is the dwellers in the cities. Of course, - cannot attribute blame in this regard to present Postmaster-General. I would also bring under his notice the fact that in Department there are hundreds of officers who are being miserably underpaid for the important and onerous duties which they have to discharge. There are men women in various parts of the Commonparty, wealth who are conducting business which involves the passing through their hands every year of thousands of pounds. know of one case where the salary attached to the position of the officer amounts Mr W. J. Johnson. than £""33. In another case, the of a man who has a wife and family to keep, and is living in one of the most outlying parts of the Commonwealth, is o n h' per annum, with an allowance a for rent and lighting, which has to be supplied to enable him to do the departmental business. I trust that the Government will take these facts into consideration, and will endeavour to remove the evils which have been handed down to us as a legacy by of the so-called Liberal Governments of the past; and that better rates will in future to be paid to those persons who work in the outlying parts of the country. to be The Old-age Pensions Act should be I amended so as to provide that when a pensioner, male or female, has to enter a hospital, his or her pension should still continue to be paid. I understand that under the New South Wales Pensions Act this was the case, but when the Federal Act was it was provided that when a pensioner entered a hospital his pension should cease. Hospitals are largely maintained by subscriptions, and it is generally a thought that a patient who cannot pay his way has to suffer some indignity, and is apt to be regarded or treated as a pauper. It is therefore the duty of the Commonwealth, derecognising that the aged and infirm are entitled to some consideration in their declining years, to continue that consideration in the days of their sickness, when they become a charge upon institutions which are largely maintained by funds derived from benevolence. I have received letters tiiat this alteration should be made in the Act, from three hospital committees My predecessor in the representation of the district brought the matter under the notice of one of the Liberal Governments some be time ago, but failed to get for his constituents the consideration which he sought. by I come now to the question of land value I taxation. An attempt has been made to the make the public believe that Labour candidates stated in some parts of Australia that his we were in favour of taxing only country land. Certainly an effort was made by those who opposed Labour candidates in all parts of the Commonwealth to impress and upon the small holder that the Labour if given power, would tax him. I was frequently asked, "" Will the Labour party reduce the proposed exemption ? ' 'I "" Will the Labour party tax only country lands? "" and "" Will the Labour party tax to no city lands?"" My answer was always that the Labour party intended to tax land values exceeding £5,000, irrespective of location or area, and I am pleased to supDominion port the Government proposal, which gives effect to the statement that I then made. We were treated this afternoon by the hon the orable member for Parramatta to a number of figures bearing upon the result of land value taxation in New Zealand. During the suspension of the sitting this evening made it my business to look into the Zealand Year-Book for 1909. I found the honourable member's statement regarding increase in land values to be borne out, cause, in iSgi, the capital value of land in the Dominion was .£122,225,029, 132,000 whereas, in 1908, - it had risen to to £271,516,022. The unimproved value in in 1891 was £75. 3 >465> 8 2 and k h a d creased in about the same proportion 1908. The honourable member for Parrarunning matta endeavoured to convey the impression that the enhancement of land values was directly brought about by the imposition of the land value tax, but we must look around to ascertain whether there were, some other causes for this great appreciacomprises tion. We find another cause, on page of the Year-Book, where it is shown that the population of New Zealand, which was 634,058 in 1891, had risen in 1908 to 960,642. Every one can readily undera stand that where population increases such a ratio land values must also increase. The number of freeholders also increased, indicating clearly that there must have a breaking up of large estates. In 1892 there were in the Dominion 91,501 freewealth, holders, and in 1909 there were 143,243. Of the population which had flowed New Zealand during the interval to which I have referred, 5,501 arrived from tralia in the year 1908 alone, and in five years immediately preceding, 26,881 left Australia and settled in the Dominion.",59
415,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"How much did New ties, Zealand spend in buying land for closer settlement ? Mr W. J. JOHNSON - I do not know. I am putting thesefiguresforward, in answer to the contention of the honourable member for Parramatta, to show that imposition of land value taxation in Zealand increased the number of freethat holders, considerably attracted population, and converted a bankrupt and povertyman stricken State into one of the most prosgive perous of Britain's Dependencies.",61
416,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It was nearly all done by Government purchase. Mr W. J. JOHNSON - Still , a very large amount of money is collected in the as a result of the imposition of the tax, and the improved conditions which 1I have indicated are largely attributable to fact that a Government came into office who recognised that under the old system, which facilitated land monopoly, the country was becoming bankrupt, and decided to I bring about the breaking up of large estates New by taxing land values. In my electorate there are some very large estates. Close by the the township of Merriwa there is a large beestate belonging to the Bettington family, known as Brindley Park. It consists of acres valued variously at from £ 4 £ 8 per acre. If the Government succeed carrying their taxation proposals, a hand. some cheque will be received from that by estate to help to defray the expenses of this country, or else more people will be permitted to live on and produce wealth from the estate than are there today. Immediately adjoining is a great estate known as the Collaroy,- and belongnot ing to an absentee English company. It 110,000 acres of land valued 125 at from £ 2 ios. to £ 6 per acre. But its manager declared on oath in the Land Court that the average quality of the land constituting the estate was such that block of 450 acres would provide a fair in living for any person. It strikes me that if by any means we can bring about the partition of an estate of that character combeen prising 110,000 acres into 450-acre blocks, it will be a very good thing for the Commonand particularly for the people who live in the adjacent towns. It must into have amused old members of the House, and it was certainly interesting to me to Ausfind gentlemen like the honourable members the for Ballarat, Parramatta, and Swan, coming forward and pleading for an amendment of the electoral law so that minorior rather the constituent parties in the House, may be varied as the possible result of other elections.",61
417,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Does the honourable member believe in that form of election? Mr W. J. JOHNSON - I believe in a the form of election which allows one man one New vote, and gives one vote one value. I hope no Government will ever place me in a position that I shall have to vote for a in whose policy I believe, and also a vote, even, perhaps, of lesser value, to a man whose policy I do not believe in. I would far rather be the only elector supporting a candidate whose views coincided with my own than I would run and cheer with the crowd who succeeded in returning a man with whose views they were not in full accord. It certainly does seem a travesty on political life to have gentlemen who have had the control of the destinies of the Commonwealth since its inauguration coming along now and asking for. an alteration of that sort.",61
418,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"They moved in that direction before now. Mr W. J. JOHNSON - The honourable famous cartoon member sat quietly and calmly in the Parliament of another State as the representamember tive of thirty or forty electors. In those days he never cared whether the majority of the electors were represented or not. He was glad to sit in his seat there and act as the emperor or the ruler of that imbe portant State. At a later date, when he came to be one of the first lieutenants in the Government of the Commonwealth, did not bother himself about minorities at all.",62
419,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is different now. Mr W. J. JOHNSON - Of course is, and that is why we are hearing a ferent tale. Somebody once said that cirdesire cumstances alter cases. That is remarkthey occupy. ably apparent in the speeches of those who today occupy the Opposition benches.",62
420,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do 1 referred to that matter at all in my speech. Mr W. J. JOHNSON - I am sure that the right honourable member did. He, together with others, said that he does not believe in the Labour party, and will fight them. I would be reform, very pleased if he and everybody of else did fight the supporters of the present Government on political questions. I do not know very much of the political of Western Australia, but I do know that in New South Wales we did not have very keen contests on political lines.' noon the honourable member for Parramatta spoke of the methods which were think that the party sitting on this side of the chamber have reason to congratulate to see them. themselves that they did not sink to the methods which were adopted by some of the prominent members sitting on the position benches. In a political does it concern the electors what class of cottage the Prime Minister lives in?",62
421,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is too small, I can tell fers to? the honourable member. Mr W. J.

While he was speaking, one honourable member upon this side of the chamber made terjection from which it appeared that he was rather sceptical of the accuracy of that statement. As an officer of the Australian Workers' Union, I can say that when that organization had funds to its credit in Australian Joint Stock Bank to the extent of nearly £2,000, it was requested by institution to remove its account. did not want union funds there. I do not propose to occupy any further time. merely wish to say that those who today complain of the inadequacy of our electoral laws are the very individuals who framed those laws - Honourable members talk about political fights. But in my own electorate, and in other electorates which I visited during the recent campaign, I did not find the Fusionist candidates violently denounca Commonwealth note issue, or the prinof land values taxation, or the payment of old-age pensions. They pursued different tactics, and it is that sort fighting to which I object. We want men with definite political ideas, who will fearlessly put them before the electors. If such men are forthcoming, and if we have single member electorates with adult suffwe are more likely to obtain a true reflex of popular opinion than we are if we any new fangled electoral system such as the Hare-Spence system. I hope that shall adhere to the principle of one adult one vote and one vote one value. I am glad to have had an opportunity of addressing these few remarks to the House. Mr W.

I particularly repudiate f having been connected in any way with the to publication of the cartoon which he deihey scribed, and which was of a sectarian percharacter. Neither I nor my committee had anything to'do with that cartoon, nor did we know anything of it until after it had been circulated. Further, it was not cirin my district more than it was in districts. This is a sample of the reckless and mendacious statements to circulated during the recent election camby my political opponents. I repudiate all knowledge of it, and embrace this opportunity of correcting any misapprehension which may exist in the mind of any an inhonorable member on that score. Mr W. J.

Only last year in the Tasmanian Parliament we witnessed one of the most degrading scenes that has ever occurred there, and it occurred on the Fusionist side of the Chamber. perusal of the Federal Hansard I learn that a similar scene was enacted here. Is it to be supposed that the people, upon reading their morning newspapers or upon perusing Hansard, were not disgusted when they learned of the state of things politically throughout Australia? It was the mistrust in the hearts of the people which was engendered by the action of politicians who had previously been held in high esteem which caused a revulsion of feeling on the part of the electors and induced them to say, "" We have been deceived.

In thinking the matter over, I could only arrive at conclusion, and that was that they had done so in order to secure a certain position appealing to the electors at the late elecsioner tion. They did so, in order that they might bring about certain agreements with the State Premiers, by which the State vernments would come to their assistance, as they did at the Federal elections. members of the Fusion Government thought view ? that, with the assistance of the State Ministries, in addition to their own efforts, they would be able to sweep the polls. is why the Fusion was brought about.

458,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I think the honormember cannot show it in the exact all sitting language he has used. Mr 'JENSEN - As a citizen of the Commonwealth, I want to protest against the High Commissioner entering upon party politics in that way. It is very unbecoming of him, and he ought to know better. I was saying that I have not heard that any of our bankers, merchants, or landowners are selling up, in order to leave the country. Yet that is what our opponents from every platform told the people would happen. Our opponents have tried to instil such statements into the minds of the electors, with a view to damaging the Labour party. As I said on the hustings, I believe in making the large landholder pay in the same proportion as the small land-holder; but that has not happened in the past. Tasmania has what is called a land tax, but is really a property tax. The greater part of the £60,000 per annum received from it is paid by holders of blocks ranging from - wealth. Wales. Acres alienated or in. process o£ alienation 130,302,000 50,000,000 28,000,000 21,000,OQO about 7 por Acres under lease 787,211,483 129,000,000 16,000,000 41 per cent. Acres unoccupied 986,127,180 18,000,000 12,000,000 I am sorry that most of the land of the Commonwealth is still under lease, and, as Crown property, cannot be taxed. Most of these leases have twenty, thirty, and forty years to run. In some cases the State Governments have the right to resume portions at will, not exceeding one-eighth, I believe.",65
459,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The whole of any leasehold can be resumed on payment of compensation.,66
460,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It behoves the Governments of the States to see that the land of Australia is not locked up much longer.. They should insist on a fair rental for land under lease. At present many acres are held on a peppercorn rent. Railways which do not pay have been taken through leasehold land, and the poor of the community has to find interest on the capital cost. The railways of the Commonwealth have cost £143,000,000, 15,000 miles of line having cost, on the average, about £9,500 a mile. In parts of the back country lines run for £ acre to 5 acres. It is therefore a tax upon industry and thrift, the large landed proprietors practically going scot-free. The States generally have neglected to impose land taxation, although it would have benefited their people. No doubt on many occasions proposals for land taxation have been dropped by the Upper Houses, which represent property, but not many attempts have been made to pass such legislation. The Labour members and the Labour leagues have discovered that the bursting up of the large estates is essential to the welfare of the Commonwealth, and that it can be done only by such a system of taxation as we propose. Furthermore, the proceeds from the tax will help us to build an Australian navy. The following figures will show how the land of the Commonwealth is held:Common- New South South Western Victoria. Queensland. Australia. Australia. Tasmania. 9,500,000 14,000,000 6,000,000 cent. 273,000,000 102,000,000 160,000,000 1,500,000 134,000,000 130,000,000 499,000,000 9,000,000 52 per cent. 20 or 30 miles through one man's land. The poor should not be taxed through the Customs to pay for railway communication to enable the rich land-holders to send their live stock and wool to market, and, at the same time, have to provide for the defence of Australia. The land monopolists, who own this country and starve the community, should pay for the defence of their properties. Why should the people in the cities, the poorest of the poor, build railways for them, and protect their lands with rifles if need be? In support of what I said just now about the utterances of the High Commissioner, let me quote from a copy of the London Times which has been handed to me"" With respect to unification or Federation,"" Sir George said, "" the Australian Labour party seem, so far as I can judge, to be moving towards unification. The Fusion party seems to be anxious to preserve the independent functions of the different States."" He had no authority for saying that. Thousands of members of our leagues do not believe in unification, and it is not on our programme. Until it has become a part of our platform Sir George Reid will have no right to make such a statement.",66
461,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member ought to have read the whole of report while he was about it. It is very short.,67
462,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I will read the whole of itThe Australian Labour party seems, so far as I can judge, to be moving towards unification. The Fusion party seems to be anxious to preWestern serve the independent functions of the different States. There is no doubt whatever that in the course of time the States will hand over power after another to the Commonwealth; but that process will not, I think, reach of unification within any period of time that I can calculate upon. No unbiased person can deny that that is a statement that the Australian Labour party is going in for unification. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - So far as Sir George Reid could judge, that was his opinion. Surely he has a right to express his opinion?",67
463,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But not to tell lies.,67
464,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Commonwealth that has an area of 1,903,000,000 acres of land. We have nearly 3,000,000 square miles of country, yet, although we have had responsible government for the last fifty or sixty years or more, only 9,892,393 acres of that immense area is under cultivation, or, in other words, about z\ acres - to every 1,000 of the population.",67
465,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There are so many people in the towns.,67
466,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"All the more shame to our past legislation. Would not poor people in the"" towns prefer to hold 200, 300, or 400 acres of land on which they could support' their families, instead having to wander about our citfes and towns begging for work, and having to go wantpeople ing half the time? These figures prove positively that past legislation has not the requirements of the people. The fact that the area under cultivation is equal to z\ acres per 1,000 of the population a disgrace, having regard to the rich agriit. cultural lands of which we boast. Only \ acre of land out of every 100 acres the Commonwealth is under cultivation. the proportion were 1.0 acres to the ico acres, what a wonderful Commonwealth should have. Such a change will never brought about except by the Labour party. Our railways at present run through large estates, and people coming to the Commontheir wealth cannot take up an inch of land near a railway line. In Tasmania intending settlers have to go up the hillsides or into the valleys, where there is no communication of any kind, and the position is the the same on the mainland. Unless we are prepared to pay the capitalists of Australia more than their land is assessed at, we cannot obtain land for settlement close to a railway.",67

I refer to the Deloraine district, 30 miles from Launceston, on the way to Burnie. There we have a railway line, and, although the average settler holds only about 200 acres of land, or even less, is the only portion of Tasmania outside the orchard districts down south that can pay interest on the money borrowed to build its railway. It is the most flourishing district in Tasmania, and its flourishing condition is due to closer settlement.",67
472,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The quality of the land makes the closer settlement possible.,67

474,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Not equally good land.,67
475,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes . In Victoria there are hundreds of thousands of acres at present used only as sheep walks which could of be put under the plough. The position is the same in Tasmania. The industrious of the Deloraine district took up land there, thirty or forty years ago, at, met say, jQi per acre, and had to walk into forests of trees 150 feet high, averaging only 200 to the acre. It has taken each of them is a lifetime to clear 30 or 40 acres of The unimproved value of the land when they took it up was £ 1 per acre, but in what is the position now? These people If have hewn out homes for themselves. The walls of their first homes were built of slabs, we and bark was used for roofing purposes. be They have lived under such conditions for many years. In many cases, no doubt, the wives of these men assisted them to clear land, and their children, instead of going to school, joined in the work, with the result that, whereas its unimproved value thirty or forty years ago was £ i per acre, it is valued at £ 2 0 , £ 2 5 , and per acre on the assessment roll. those who have tried to make a living for themselves in Tasmania have been penalized by past Governments. They are taxed toroll day, and have to pay the larger portion of the land tax. The large land proprietors hold equally good land, which they have acquired under very different conditions. In the year 1837 the pick of the country""rich flat lands that had not to be clearedwas sold at 5s. per acre. That land today is the pick of Tasmania, yet it is the assessment roll at £ 2 per acre, whereas Tasmania ? the small landed proprietor has to pay the land tax on a valuation of £ 2 0 to £ 3 0 per acre. These small land-holders have not only made their own little raihvay line a proprietors. paying concern, but have had to put their hands into their pockets and bear portion of the cost of railways in the State that are not paying. They have to pay for the drones in the country, and the position is the same throughout Australia. Who is helping to pay the interest on our railways, which have cost £143,000,000? Every land person in the community, irrespective whether or not he travels upon them, has to do so. Still the land through which those railways run is locked up. I ask the opponents of the Labour party whether it is possible to obtain any land from the at ios. Government in the vicinity of a railway line in Australia. There is a dead silence. property tax,",67

489,Mr WEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,And to save taxation.,69
490,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes . Although I own a fair amount of land, I consider that the man who has over £5,000 worth can well afford to pay a' substantial tax for the defence and upkeep of his country, thanking God that he is able to pay it. In Tasmania, in 1837, when the first settlement took place, can we suppose for a moment that those who purchased at 5s. an acre took the worse land? They took the best they could get. I know of Tasmanian estates on which the holders have done very little, and exercise so little supervision that they do not know what cattle they have, and in some cases have impounded their own in mistake. The land is left to go almost wild, and what were beautiful areas many years ago are now covered with gorse. Land that was under the plough in the old days when the gold-fields of Ballarat and Bendigo were in full swing, has rarely seen a plough since those tunes. At that time the owners were getting enormous prices for their wheat and oats, which were sold on the gold-fields. But they since discovered that they could earn a considerable revenue by allowing these rich lands to be used as sheep-walks. Consider the unfair system of taxation prevailing in this Commonwealth. If a man buys a quarter of an acre of land in the city, or a few acres in the country, or a small farm, up goes his assessment. If , however, he has a large estate, he is likely to make no improvements in comparison with those made by a man with a small property, and his assessment is not increased. What is worse, I am given to understand that throughout the Commonwealth there is a system of preferential railway rates for the benefit of the large landed proprietors. That should not be. I admit that it is the concern of the States; but how can any one blame the people for rising at the last election and saying: ""We will have no more of this kind of government; we have been deceived long enough; we will give the Labour party a chance, and see whether we cannot secure better conditions with their This aid."" With respect to defence, I remind the House that in July, 1908, at the Brisbane Labour Conference, it was decided that the time had come for the establishment of an Australian Navy. No soonei did that plank appear in the Labour platform than the late Prime Minister, now Leader of the Opposition, plucked up courage to bring the question before Parliament. With the assistance of the Labour members, a Bill was passed practically establishing an Australian Navy. The fact that this item of policy was agreed on at the Brisbane Conference shows that the Labour party recognise the necessity or providing adequately for the defence of the country. Surely to goodness, if the Labour party are game enough to adopt items of policy of that large character when out of office, and surely if the supporters of the Labour party are prepared to find the flesh and blood and bone and sinew to man our army and navy, it is time that this party took in hand the direction of the affairs of the country. The Labour party also adopted the policy of. establishing a compulsory citizen Defence. Force; whereupon the Leader of the Opposition again plucked up courage to bring the question before Parliament. Let it be remembered that the very people who, in case of need, will have to shed their blood in defence of Australia, do not own an inch of land in it. Many of them are paying rent to the large blood-sucking financial institutions. Thousands have no stake whatever in the Commonwealth, except through their wives and children. Those who own'the greater part of the land should be taxed to pay for the defence of the country. The proposed land tax is a double-barrelled gun. It will have a tendency to burst up the large estates, and also to pay for the defence of the Commonwealth. I certainly should strongly object to any money derived from taxing the poor through the Customs being used for the purposes of defence, while we have rich lands that can afford to bear this burden. There are many other subjects upon which I could talk, but I propose to reserve my remarks upon them until another occasion. I know that the Prime Minister desires that the debate shall close to-night, and in order that my chief may rest peacefully I shall resume my seat. Question resolved in the affirmative.",69

493,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Angas) [10.34] - I believe that the honourable member for Parkes raised the question as to whether the proter vision for paying 25s. per head should not be set out in an agreement between Commonwealth and the States. Of course, that point. if such an agreement is to be included in the Bill, its proper place would be schedule to the measure, but if the Bill introduced in this way we shall be practithe cally precluded from putting a schedule afterwards, because the schedule might be in accordance with the order of leave. think, however, that to put a schedule the kind into this Bill would be futile. What is now before us is not the Northern Territory Bill, nor to die Naval Agreement of 1903, because those waste of time? measures were based on mutual consideration, and would have been binding, whereas, there being no consideration from the States in this case, a schedule to this Bill would be subject to the will of Parliament, and would be capable of alteration by a future Parliament.
