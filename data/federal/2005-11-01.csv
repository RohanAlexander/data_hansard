1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,Hon. David Hawker) took the chair at 2.00 pm and read prayers. NA Government Advertising,19
2,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's statement on 21 October on the Neil Mitchell radio show that the cost to the Australian taxpayer of the government's industrial relations advertising campaign would be between $30 million and $40 million. The Prime Minister said: ... the upper limit of it would be somewhere in the thirties or forties. Is the Prime Minister aware that in Senate estimates last night it was revealed that the cost of the government's industrial relations advertising campaign is $55 million and rising? Prime Minister, if you cannot be trusted to tell the truth about the cost of the government's advertisements, how can you be trusted to tell the truth about this legislation?",19
3,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The campaign that the Leader of the Opposition referred to concluded last weekend. I am informed by my department that the costs of the campaign are as follows: $38.3 million is expected to be spent on advertising, research, creative agency costs and public affairs, and $2.7 million is expected to be spent on booklets and distribution costs. The total cost of advertising and associated printing and distribution is thus approximately $41 million. In addition, it is expected to cost $4.7 million for a call centre which continues to provide information to the community. These costs are substantially less than the $100 million figure asserted by the Leader of the Opposition-$100 million, he said!-and less than the approved amount of $55 million, an amount always understood to be a contingency figure. The Leader of the Opposition ----- is wrong. I have not misled the public. Middle East: Democracy",19
4,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister update the House on progress in establishing democracy in the Middle East? How has the Australian government contributed? Are there any alternative views?,19
5,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First of all, I thank the honourable member for his question and for his very strong support for democracy all around the world, including in the Middle East. He is a real champion of democracy.",19
6,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,19
7,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thought that might make you interject because we know that the Labor Party has not stood up much for democracy in the Middle East. So come in spinner, over there! The referendum that was held in Iraq on 15 October was another very great success for democracy in Iraq. We had elections on 30 January for the transitional assembly and we had the referendum on 15 October. What is interesting about this is that nearly 10 million Iraqis voted and, interestingly enough, the overwhelming majority of them. I think it was about 78 per centsupported ratification of the constitution. So that is the situation in a country which has never known democracy. Since 1922, when it was established by the British, it has never known democracy. Finally, admittedly during very troubled times, 10 million of those brave people of Iraq, in the teeth of threats from insurgents and terrorists, went out and voted and endorsed a democratic constitution for their country. I want to make it clear that on this side of the House we support those 10 million people and we will not walk away from them. The last thing we would want to see-and I would have thought the last thing anyone would want to see-would be the democracy that has been embraced by millions and millions of Iraqis taken away from them and trashed, and the country handed over to the Saddam Hussein supporting insurgents and the al-Qaeda, al-Zawahari terrorists. That is the last thing on earth you would ever want. At least on this side of the House we never wanted Saddam Hussein in the first place and we helped get rid of him. We do not want the terrorists to win in Iraq either. It is as simple and it is as clear as that. Government Advertising",19
8,Mr DANBY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, I refer to the $55 million cost to the Australia taxpayer of the government's industrial relations advertising campaign. Isn't it the case that $55 million is equivalent to the prize money for the Melbourne Cup today and every Melbourne Cup until 2015, the annual salary of 2,200 stable hands for a year or more than the cost of the new Flemington grandstand? Prime Minister, why isn't the Liberal Party funding this Liberal Party propaganda campaign?",20
9,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I explained in the answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question, the figure of the expenditure to date is not $55 million; it is in the order of $45.7 million. But let me say this: it has long been the custom of governments on both sides of this parliament to run public information campaigns in relation to important changes. There is nothing partisan in any of this advertising in the sense that it is critical of the Australian Labor Party or critical of the trade union movement. You will find nothing in that advertising which offers any kind of partisan political comment against the Australian Labor Party. I would also remind those who sit opposite that there were court proceedings taken by the member for Gellibrand on behalf of the Australian Labor Party and also the trade union movement, and those court proceedings failed, with costs awarded against the applicant. Trade",20
10,Mrs HULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Would the Deputy Prime Minister inform the House of the practical steps the government has taken to help Australian businesses export? What further steps does the government have in mind to improve Australia's international competitiveness that could assist businesses in the Riverina and right across Australia?,20
11,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Riverina for her question and acknowledge her support of the exporting industries in her electorate that continue to generate more jobs and better paid jobs: organisations like SunRice and some of the outstanding performers in the wine export industry from the Riverina, like yellow tail-the Casella family wine brand-and the De Bortoli wine brand. Interestingly, there are also some manufacturing industries in the member for Riverina's electorate: Celair-Malmet and Precision Parts-both manufacturing companies, both domiciled in the regional electorate of the member for Riverina and both exporting into the United States. The government's trade policy agenda has focused on opening up opportunities across the world with bilateral negotiations, regional negotiations and global negotiations. To take advantage of those outcomes that we have achieved, we put in place a number of programs to assist and enable those businesses to take advantage of or capitalise on the market opportunities we have opened up-programs like the New Exporter Development Program, which takes aspiring exporters from the initial inquiry stage into the marketplace, and programs like TradeStart, where we have set up a national network of 50 offices that provide resources, advice and guidance for new exporters getting into export markets across the world. Of course, there is also the $160 million a year Export Market Development Grants Scheme that assists businesses in marketing their products in markets across the world. Mr Tanner-That's why manufacturing exports are going backwards, is it?",20
12,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Melbourne was not awake. I named two manufacturing industries in the member for Riverina's electorate that are benefiting from the government's programs. All along, this government has kept the economy strong and maintained that as a base off which Australian exporters can compete in the marketplace. In the tax reform that we put through a number of years ago, we removed billions of dollars worth of taxes from the backs of Australian exporters and the products that they were competing with overseas, which significantly improved their competitiveness. Now we are proposing workplace reforms, which we are putting to the Australian people, that will again improve the productivity and competitiveness of Australia's industries and exporting industries. The government's position is backed up by many of the industry organisations. Thirty-seven of the ACCI member organisations, comprising 350,000 Australian businesses and employing about four million Australian employees, have passed a resolution unanimously supporting the government's reforms. It is right across the business community, and it is coming from regional Australia as well. I point to the example of a press release that has been put out by Commerce Queensland's south-west regional council. I will give them the last word on the issue of reform and what is needed to maintain their productive and competitive edge. Commerce Queensland's press release, in talking about the south-west region, says, ‘Implementing the Work Choices package will benefit the south-west region through higher productivity, more job opportunities and scope for more productive and secure work which generates higher living standards'-that is, higher living standards for their employees and the work force across Australia. Skilled Migration",21
13,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. Minister, in the past week the government has made two sets of changes to migration regulations concerning the issuing of trade skills training or skilled migration visas. Can the minister confirm that many of the 60 occupations given visa priority have been on the Australian skills shortage list for most or all of the last decade? Is the minister aware that Australia has increased the skilled migration program by an extra 270,000 skilled migrants since 1997 and that, over the same period, the government has turned 270,000 Australians away from TAFE? How can the minister possibly justify this situation to the parents of 30 young Australians on the waiting list for welding courses at Casino and Wollongong TAFEs, while welders overseas are being offered quick and easy work visas by this lazy government?",21
14,Mr JOHN COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The skilled migration program that the Howard government has put in place has been one of the greatest economic fillips that the country has had. It has had a lot to do with the fact that Australia is now in such a sound economic position. The measures recently introduced by Minister Vanstone, particularly those relating to apprenticeships and skilled migration, will mean that positions cannot be filled by an employer unless they are unable to fill them locally. This government will continue its skilled program. It has been an enormous success for Australia. In terms of people being turned away from TAFE, I think that the opposition-and in particular the member for Watson-should ask their state colleagues why they have lifted the fees at all the TAFE colleges. HIH Insurance",21
15,Mr TICEHURST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer update the House on enforcement activity taken against those involved in the HIH collapse?,22
16,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question. I can inform him that yesterday Brad Cooper, a former chairman of FAI Home Security, was found guilty in the Supreme Court of New South Wales on six charges under the Crimes Act of corruptly giving a cash benefit to influence an agent of HIH. He was found guilty on seven charges under the Crimes Act of publishing false or misleading statements with an intent to obtain financial advantage. He was remanded in custody and will appear for sentencing on 2 December. In addition to that, Terry Cassidy, a former managing director of HIH, was sentenced earlier this year to 15 months imprisonment in relation to three criminal charges. Also earlier this year, Ray Williams, formerly the chief executive officer, was sentenced to 4½ years in jail, with a non-parole period of two years and nine months. Earlier this year, Rodney Adler was sentenced to 4½ years in jail, with a non-parole period of 2½ years. William Howard was sentenced to three years imprisonment, fully suspended on the basis of his ongoing assistance to the HIH investigation. In addition, ASIC continues to pursue those who are alleged to have engaged in criminal conduct, and charges are outstanding against some other people who have already been presented and charged. The HIH collapse was Australia's largest corporate collapse. Funding for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission has increased 63 per cent over the past five years, and I think both sides of the House would recognise that the investigation in relation to HIH has been very speedy and very successful. Over the last five years, 128 people in total have been jailed on charges brought by ASIC for terms totalling over 430 years. That will give the House some indication of the enforcement capacity that ASIC now has and the resources that it has at its disposal. It should send a very clear message to any person who is engaged in a breach of the Corporations Act that these matters can and will be investigated, charges will be brought and the chances of securing a conviction are very high. Trade: Imports",22
17,Mr KATTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Is the minister aware that a departmental permit was issued allowing importation of meat from Brazil and that this meat was subsequently discarded onto the Wagga rubbish dump? Is the minister aware that both the US and Japan will not accept beef, even from areas of Brazil declared free from foot-and-mouth disease? Is the minister further aware that the Senate banana inquiry uncovered that the review panel, without explanation or justification, cut the acceptable risk probability level from the designated 95 per cent to 50 per cent? Finally, is the minister aware that the decision to allow pork in from PMWS-diseased countries was described by Justice Wilcox as ‘unreasonable, unsupported by any fact, scientific evidence or scientific expertise'? The full court, in specifically declining to deny Wilcox J's assertions, made an even more scathing condemnation, holding that the IRA ‘risk' definition was an ‘imponderable standard' and that therefore any decision at all could be legally valid.",22
18,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member will come to the end of his question.,23
19,Mr KATTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the light of this, is the minister prepared to enact in this House regulations providing reviewable, objective, scientific standards and rein in a department whose incompetence is legendary?",23
20,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member should be well aware that questions should be more succinct than that. I call the minister and hope that he can give a reasonably succinct answer.,23
21,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Kennedy for his question. It is an enormously serious issue and one which preoccupies members of the government, as well as the member for Kennedy and industries at large. So I do not in any sense, despite the length of the question, doubt the member's sincerity and the seriousness of the issue. There are a number of issues here. I think the member is likely to be guilty of selective judgment on each of them. Briefly, with regard to the Brazilian issue, there was no risk. The importation certificate was given, according to an agreed policy with industry. It was a good wake-up call. We have changed the situation with industry. We will not accept zonal clearances without a visit by Australian quarantine officials themselves. With regard to bananas, the member would have us have a ‘no risk' policy. The fact is we have to have a very low risk policy; otherwise, you would not import genetics, embryos or semen or allow in overseas visitors. Regarding pork, I cannot agree with the honourable member's reading of the court judgment. In actual fact, the outcome of the full Federal Court in that particular case confirmed the legality of the import risk assessment processes and it reinstated the operation of that generic pig meat import risk assessment. In summary, the government has committed Australia to a rigorous science based approach to quarantine, protecting our borders from highly feral pests, and our disease status remains undiminished. I will always have a dialogue with the honourable member or industries to strengthen our border protection with regard to quarantine and biosecurity. We are ever alert to the possibility of imported pests or disease. It is a difficult area to get across to people because of the trade implications and the fact that everything has to be done on a science basis only. Workplace Relations",23
22,Mr FAWCETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister update the House on the statutory protections which will apply to workers under the new workplace relations system? Are there any alternative views?,23
23,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Wakefield for his question and his support for the government's proposed changes to the workplace relations system. Under the Work Choices system which the government proposes to introduce to this parliament tomorrow, all workers on agreements will be guaranteed four weeks annual leave. They will be guaranteed 10 days of personal or carers leave and 52 weeks of parental leave. This is important because this is the first time within the federal system that these statutory protections will be provided to all workers. What this involves are changes that combine both flexibility and fairness. These are reforms which are essential to the health of our economy. This is something which some members opposite understand and also recognise. Indeed on 19 October the member for Perth told Mike Jeffries on Radio 2CC: I've got no difficulty with having some in the workplace of people who want to work part-time or casual or want to work part-time hours or different hours; there is no difficulty with providing that flexibility. And in very many respects, to remain internationally competitive, some industries and some areas we need to do that ... The difference between the government and the opposition is that we on this side of the House are actually prepared to act to do something about it. All the ALP and the union movement will do is run a misleading scare campaign. We saw another example of this yesterday at question time. The member for Adelaideprompted, no doubt, by the member for Perth-claimed that employees at the Blue Galah Backpackers Hostel in Adelaide were being ripped off on AWAs which traded off annual leave, leave loading and other conditions. What the member for Adelaide failed to point out to the House yesterday was that the Australian workplace agreements in question paid the employees at a rate of $16.27 per hour averaged over the two-year life of the agreement",23
24,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,24
25,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition says ‘Oh, heavens!' but the employee was paid $16.27 an hour. Mr Stephen Smith interjecting",24
26,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Perth!,24
27,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Let me remind the House that Mr Stephen Smith interjecting,24
28,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Perth is warned!,24
29,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,the relevant award's ordinary hourly rate for a receptionist in this position was just $13.43.,24
30,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,24
31,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So this is an own goal, flexibility mate-you know it. An own goal.",24
32,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is far too much noise from both sides.,24
33,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What the member for in Perth failed to disclose to the House yesterday was that, under this Australian workplace agreement, an employee in question was paid $2.84 an hour extra. That means for an employee in this position, working an ordinary 38-hour week, that is $107.92 per week or some $5,000 a year extra. We did not hear that from the member for Adelaide yesterday. I understand this was the first question that the member for Adelaide has been allowed to ask by the other side. Is this the way that she purports to represent the small businesses in her electorate, through her questions? The reality is that many of the employees in this business are casual workers. What this actually provides is an agreement that allows a person to have a two-year contract, that gives them permanent employment and, not only that, provides them over that two-year period with an extra $10,000. We did not hear anything about that yesterday from the member for Adelaide. No wonder the Leader of the Opposition is flip-flopping on the issue of AWAs. The Leader of the Opposition has said, rightly, that he could not abolish AWAs now because there would be too many losers. This was an example of one of the losers if the ALP's policy to abolish Australian workplace agreements was ever implemented. Oil for Food Program",24
34,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And double time would have been $26 an hour,24
35,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will come to his question.,24
36,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and time-and-a-half would have been $20 an hour-what do you reckon about that? My question is to the Prime Minister. Don't Australians deserve to know if the government sanctioned payment of $300 million to the very tyrant Australian men and women were sent to fight? Will the Prime Minister agree immediately to establish a royal commission, headed by a serving or retired judge of unimpeachable political standing, with power to subpoena witnesses and documents, which conducts its hearings in public and has terms of reference which allow investigation of the legality and propriety of the actions of the Australian government and Australian companies under both the UN sanctions regime and Australian law?",25
37,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Could I make the observation that maybe this is the question the Leader of the Opposition might have first asked yesterday. Be that as it may, let me point out to the Leader of the Opposition that there was nothing sanctioned by this government-nothing at all. So many of the questions asked by the Leader of the Opposition are based on falsehoods. It is a falsehood for the Leader of the OppositionMr Wilkie interjecting",25
38,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Swan!,25
39,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"to assert that these were government sanctioned payments. So far as the inquiry is concerned, on the first available opportunity after the House met, in answer to the very first question from my side, I indicated the government's concern about aspects of this report. I said that we would have a proper independent inquiry. I am taking advice on the form of that inquiry. When I have got that advice, which I expect to be later this week, I will make an announcement. I am sure that the announcement I make will provide for a full independent inquiry to get to the bottom of this, with proper powers of investigation.",25
40,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,25
41,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Mr Wilkie-You give Saddam money, Alex!",25
42,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Swan is warned! National Security,25
43,Mr SCHULTZ,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Would the Attorney-General advise the House how the government is meeting the threat of terrorism? How does Australia's approach compare with that of other countries?,25
44,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question. I want to make it very clear that Australia is not alone in the fight on terrorism. All countries are meeting the same challenges that we are facing at this time. They recognise that the threat of terrorism is very real. We know that Australia and Australian interests have been targeted at least once every year in the past five years both here and abroad. The Director-General of ASIO informed a Senate estimates hearing last night that al-Qaeda and like-minded organisations have shown an intent to conduct attacks in Australia. An attack here is feasible and could well occur. Last week I had the opportunity to meet with security chiefs in France, Spain, the Netherlands and Britain. The underlying theme in all of the discussions in which I was engaged was how we could stop terrorists before they carry out their evil deeds. The London bombings, of course, highlighted the increasingly complex and difficult nature of modern terrorism investigations. They transcend international policing boundaries, they involve the need to establish identity, they involve intensive forensic work and access to data using new technologies, they often require investigations where you are dealing with many different languages and, as we saw in London, they can involve reviewing thousands of hours of CCTV footage. As the Deputy Commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police Service told me, it is a very different ball game now. That is why in all of these countries there has been a renewed focus on preventative measures. In the United Kingdom suspects can be held in preventative detention for 14 days, and the UK is looking to extend that to 90 days because of the sorts of factors I have mentioned. In Spain they can hold people incommunicado for 13 days but for up to four years in pre-trial detention if required. In France, we know that terrorist suspect Willie Brigitte has been held without charge for two years with a maximum of three years available. It is in that context, when people look at what is being proposed here in Australia as against what is happening abroad in countries that are democratic and do accept the rule of law, that they have given their agencies, as I believe we should give our agencies, an opportunity to deal with consequences but also to stop terrorists before they strike. The measures that we are proposing are constrained with appropriate safeguards and are commensurate with the very significant level of threat that we face. Oil for Food Program",25
45,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's last answer in which he said that nothing had been sanctioned by the government concerning the actions of the Australian Wheat Board in Iraq. Prime Minister, if that is so, how is that compatible with the foreign affairs minister's statement to parliament yesterday that, in relation to each Wheat Board contract with Iraq, DFAT examined the contract paperwork and only submitted it",26
46,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,26
47,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,26
48,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"settle down, Alex-to the UN once it was satisfied that the transaction did not appear to infringe the UN sanctions regime? Prime Minister, is it not a fact that the foreign affairs minister, out of his own mouth in question time yesterday, confirmed the role of the Australian government in ensuring that there was no violation to the sanctions regime with Iraq?",26
49,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the last part of the question is no, he did not. In elaboration, I further say to the honourable gentleman that, if we just examine it for a moment, the proposition is that in some way the government sanctioned the payment of amounts of money to Saddam Hussein. Mr Tanner-So DFAT's not part of the government now, Alex?",26
50,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,26
51,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would remind the House that the Volcker inquiry was presided overMr Tanner-You're never responsible for anything, are you?",26
52,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Melbourne is warned!,26
53,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"by somebody who is held in very high regard by both sides of politics in the United States and who many people argue is one of the most successful and esteemed chairmen of the American federal reserve system. The Volcker inquiry had access at all times to any documents within the possession of the Australian government that it wanted. I gave instructions and the foreign affairs minister gave instructions that any documents that the Volcker inquiry wanted-any cooperation that the Volcker inquiry wanted-it would have them. When I heard of the possible interest of the Volcker inquiry in the activities of AWB Ltd, I asked the now Deputy Prime Minister to write to AWB Ltd making a claim to the company that it should cooperate in full with the Volcker inquiry. Any questions we were asked as a government by the Volcker inquiry we answered. It is interesting, isn't it, as a commentary on what the Leader of the Opposition is now asserting, that after all its investigations in the face of all of that cooperation cker inquiry offered not a word of criticism of the Australian government. Not a word of criticism was offered. Further to that, as a result both of the Volcker inquiry and alsoMs Macklin-Why are you having the inquiry?",26
54,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will tell you why. We are having the inquiry because we have been asked to do so by the United Nations. I do not normally like the interjections of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, because they are hard to follow, but on this occasion I am delighted to inform her that one of the reasons we are having the inquiry is that we were asked to do so by the United Nations. When the Volcker report was brought down, Kofi Annan asked all member countries to make sure that they investigated whether there had been any breaches of domestic law by the companies that had been named-and that is exactly what the Australian government is doing. I say to the member for Griffith that this will be a full inquiry. I terested to hear the Leader of the Opposition talk about an unimpeachable judge, the implication being that some of the judges serving in Australia are impeachable, which I find rather contemptible. One of the things this government is proud of is that we have an incorruptible judiciary. We will have a good inquiry, and any questions that are asked of the government by that inquiry will be fully answered. Climate Change",27
55,Mr BROADBENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, on this Melbourne Cup day, I believe this is my maiden question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister update the House on planning for the Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate? How has the initiative been and greeted internationally and are there any the Vol- other views?",27
56,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thought the maiden question was excellent. Firstly, Australia will be very proud to host the first meeting of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. It will be held in Australia in the middle of January. The partnership countries-Australia, the United States, China, India, Japan and Korea-represent about 50 per cent of the world's energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. This first meeting, we expect, will lay out a framework for cooperation involving governments, of course, but also industry and the scientific community. We will also look at ways to meet our energy, climate change and air pollution challenges in ways that promote jobs and, more broadly, economic growth. We do not want to undercut or try to circumvent Kyoto; we just want to make the point that Kyoto will not address the problem of climate change, I am afraid, and that we may as well all face up to that. Without was inKyoto, by 2010 emissions will have grown by 41 per cent from 1990. With Kyoto, assuming that all of the countries that signed up to Kyoto meet their targets-which clearly they will not-emissions will increase by 40 per cent. So it is completely misleading to suggest that Kyoto is going to solve the problem of climate change. Let me quote a great Labour leader. I refer, of course, not to the Leader of the Opposition but to Tony Blair, the Leader of the British Labour Party. Speaking about Kyoto in the Observer newspaper at the weekend, he said that, in the current climate change debate, there is ‘a reluctance to face up to reality the practical action needed to tackle the problems'. He said that Kyoto is ‘not enough': We need to cut greenhouse gas emissions radically but Kyoto doesn't even stabilise them. This leader of the British Labour Party is a man of principle, rather than what we are left with in this country-a rank opportunist. Tony Blair made the point that there is a need for ‘major developed and emerging nations to sit down together and work it out in a way that allows us all to grow, imposes no competitive disadvantage'-which is one of the things, by the way, that Kyoto would have done for us-‘and enables the transfer of technology needed for sustainable growth to take place'. In other words, Tony Blair proposes that we do exactly what we are doing with the Asia-Pacific partnership. It is such a shame that the Labor Party in this country is today reduced to a bunch of vacuous opportunists. Mr Albanese interjecting",27
57,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Grayndler is warned!,28
58,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is such a shame.,28
59,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's response to my last question, in which he appeared to dispute that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had confirmed out of his own mouth the Australian government's responsibility for ensuring no infringement of the UN sanctions regime for Iraq. Prime Minister, if that is so, what did Alexander Downer mean when he said in this House yesterdayMr Downer interjecting",28
60,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Your words, Alex, not mine. The foreign minister said: and DFAT examined the contract paperwork and, once they were satisfied that this had been properly completed and that the transaction did not appear to infringe the UN sanctions regime, the documentation was submitted to the UN in New York. Prime Minister, if that is so, what exactly did the foreign minister mean yesterday if he was not saying there was a clear role for the government to ensure that the sanctions regime with Iraq is honoured?",28
61,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He meant what he said. Exports: Uranium,28
62,Mr TOLLNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. Minister, can you update the House on the export performance of Australia's resources sector? Are you aware of any threats to future export opportunities?",28
63,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Solomon for his question and acknowledge what a great supporter of the resources sector he is. The year 2004-05 was by any measure outstanding for the resources sector, with some $67 billion worth of exports-and things are going to get better for the resources sector. ABARE predict that Iraq exports will rise in the current year to $87 billion. There are real opportunities for growth in the resources sector. Around the world demand for uranium is surging with an estimated 25 nuclear power plants under construction and a further 74 planned. More than 40 per cent of the world's reserves are in Australia. Australia is uniquely placed to meet demand. Of course, we only meet that demand in accordance with the strictest environmental, Indigenous and non-proliferation safeguards. I am asked by the member for Solomon about threats to export opportunities and, as usual, they come from those opposite. When it comes to expanding Australia's uranium industry, the Labor Party are hopelessly divided. The South Australian Premier, Mike Rann, says that Labor's three-mine policy has anomalies-I think that is because there are actually four uranium mines in Australia-and that it should be reviewed. Kevin Foley was a bit blunter than that and said that the policy was idiotic. Geoff Gallop, the Premier of Western Australia, categorically rules out uranium mining in his state. The federal opposition leader says that the three-mine policy stands. Even though there are already four mines, he says that the three stand. The member for Batman has an enlightened opinion on this. He says that the three-mine policy does not even exist. The Labor Party policy is a joke. It has a confused ideological stance, which is costing Australia jobs, exports and economic growth.",28

I wish to report to the House that after the House rose, in discussions with me, the honourable member for Goldstein stated that in the circumstances he would not wish his vote to be recorded.

67,Ms GRIERSON,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I ask that you investigate a serious incident that occurred here yesterday, which I think represents a suppression of free speech. Yesterday morning, at about 8.20, a person who works in this place was in his parked car in the Senate alcove to pick up his granddaughter from her mother, who also works in this place. That is their regular practice. The driver was approached by a security officer here, from the Australian Protective Service, and instructed to remove a sign that was lying on the back ledge of the hatchback vehicle. The driver was not aware that the sign was actually there or could even be read from the outside. It was a sign his wife had held up during a weekend vigil outside the Singapore High Commission and it said, ‘Please grant clemency.' He was instructed by the security officer to put that in his boot. I ask you to investigate what seems to be some new sort of anti-sedition law we are not aware of in this place and report back to the House on what authority or regulations might prohibit such a sign being seen in the driveways of the people's parliament.",29

76,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I claim to have been misrepresented by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations during question time. During question time the minister referred to the fact that yesterday in the parliament, like the member for Adelaide, I asked the Prime Minister a question which related in part to an AWA available at the Blue Galah in Adelaide. I said: I also refer the Prime Minister to the Blue Galah AWA, which contains another clause that states that all rates of pay ‘include a loading to compensate for all shift, weekend, overtime and public holidays and other penalties and no additional penalties are payable'. Prime Minister, isn't it the case that, under the government's changes, rather than being protected by law employees will in a single line in an AWA lose their penalty rates and leave loadings? In question time the minister suggested that, by not referring to an hourly rate under that AWA, I had not fully informed the parliament. The hourly rate to which the minister referred is effectively abolished by the government's abolition of the no disadvantage test. AUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORTS Reports Nos 13 and 14 of 2005-06",30

80,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Corio proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The importance of maintaining adequate funding levels for agricultural research and renewable energy research within the CSIRO. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their placesMr GAVAN O'CONNOR (Corio) (3.36 pm)-The opposition have raised this MPI today because we are concerned about maintaining adequate levels of funding for agricultural and renewable energy research within Australia's pre-eminent public research organisation, the CSIRO. I am joined today in this debate by my friend and colleague the member for Kingsford Smith, whose remarks will relate to the importance of renewal energy research, an area in which, by virtue of his previous associations before entering this parliament, he has particular standing and credibility in the Australian community. My specific remarks will be directed to agricultural research, particularly animal and plant research, and its continuing importance to Australian agriculture and the sector's growth. Members of this House are all too familiar with the debate surrounding the importance of agriculture to the national economy and to sustaining regional communities. With the rapid urbanisation of Australia and the enormous pressure being placed on urban and coastal communities, it is of critical importance-and, indeed, it is in the national interest-that we maintain viable economic activity in rural areas, and maintain the communities that depend on that economic activity, outside of the 50-kilometre coastal strip where 85 per cent of Australians now live. To meet these objectives, we need a vibrant and viable rural sector-one that is competitive, innovative and well placed to meet the challenges of a global trading environment. Underpinning that dynamic and innovation based growth is, of course, our agricultural research effort. We are familiar with the production and trading environment in which our farmers and those enterprises that value-add to rural production currently operate. Farmers over the past 30 years have had to contend with natural challenges such as drought, flood and bushfires. They have actively engaged in the process of sustainable economic development launched so successfully by a previous Labor government through the Landcare movement. They have had to trade in volatile and corrupted markets where our competitors lavish protection and support in terms of their producers. They operate within an economic framework where major determinants of their costs and their competitivenessinterest rates and exchange rates-are largely determined by forces outside their control. They have been at the forefront of the restructuring of their own industries and the national economy and, while their absolute numbers may have diminished, farmers, along with the rural sector, play an important role as drivers of economic activity. The sector is an employer of significance-with some 375,000 people-and a top export performer and earner of national income, accounting for 23 per cent of our total exports in 2003-04. The sector has over the past 30 years maintained a rate of productivity growth exceeding the national average, and it has achieved that in no small part because of its continuing and strategic investment in research, development and innovation. Australia's agricultural research effort has developed in quite a unique way and currently sponsors strategic partnerships between CSIRO, the 14 rural research and development corporations, cooperative research centres based out of universities and in regional communities, private corporations, entrepreneurs and government. It is a strategic and collaborative structure which has kept Australian agriculture viable in the face of some extremely difficult changes, and it is one which the opposition wants to see maintained. At the core of this strategic agricultural research effort stands CSIRO, a skilled and critical player in the quest to keep agriculture in this country productive, competitive and ultimately sustainable. That is why the opposition, along with environmental organisations and the National Farmers Federation, have viewed with some concern aspects of the advice tendered to the executive management council of CSIRO on 12 September 2005 in a document entitled Science investment process: broad direction setting. It stated in particular that specific investment in plant and forest based agriculture is likely to decrease and that ‘specific areas of increase in this domain are anticipated to come through the Food Futures and P-Health flagships'. A similar prediction is made in the traditional livestock domain. Before CSIRO's executive council endorses or adopts this advice, it would do well for us all to reflect on the contribution of traditional livestock and cropping industries to the rural sector, to the health of rural communities and to the national economy. It is a contribution which has come off the back of continued productivity growth and specific research investment in these industries, a research and investment effort in which CSIRO has been a key player. Australia's $30 billion primary industries and our 120,000 farmers rely on first-class research efforts to maintain their competitive edge. On 21 March this year the Australian Financial Review carried the story of Tony Gregson, a grain producer and former scientist who operates a $1 million a year farm business on his 2,023-hectare property at Warracknabeal in western Victoria. A computer on his combine harvester is linked to a GPS and notes his exact position on the farm at all times. It also records the weight of the grain entering his bin and automatically produces a yield map detailing the bushels per hectare he achieves across every corner of his paddocks in his enterprise. It is research based innovations such as this that have driven the massive productivity improvements which have seen wheat yields increase by between 45 and 75 kilograms a hectare a year since 1991. In some regions in southern New South Wales, yields have risen by 100 kilograms a year per hectare for the past 12 years. It is the same story in our dairy industry. Allan Burgess, the Chairman of Dairy Australia, himself a dairy farmer, was quoted in the Financial Review of 22 March this year as saying: ‘The entire industry is on a long term managed process of structural change. That has motivated-not required-the industry, if it wants to continue, to develop and adopt technology more and more quickly.' The average dairy cow in Australia now produces 4,760 litres of milk a year-up 67 per cent over the last 20 years. That is in excess of the productivity output of the whole Howard government in the nine years it has been in operation.",30
81,Dr EMERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That's a lot of milk! Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR-It is a similar story in the sheepmeat industry. In 1995, 121 million sheep produced 574,000 tonnes of meat. Seven years later we had 14 million fewer sheep, but sheepmeat production increased by 60,000 tonnes. I am joined in the chamber by the honourable member for Corangamite-not that he would know anything about cows, but he knows a little bit about sheep. The squatter from the Western District has enjoyed the benefits of research in the agricultural sector, and of course that is the basis on which his current wealth is based and that is the wealth that finances his campaigns. Is that not so? Applying the product of our research effort has allowed us to produce more meat from fewer sheep. The story is even better in the cattle industry where beef meat production has increased at almost four times the rate of the national herd. We find a similar situation in the wine industry-one of the great agricultural research industries in Australia. It is an industry that is critical to economic future of many rural communities and a great generator of jobs in regional areas. There is much in the advice to the CSIRO Executive Management Council that the opposition would agree with, such as matching agricultural productivity with environmental sustainability. However, I would have some difficulty with reducing research supporting small changes in productivity-and that is a specific feature of the document and one of the recommendations in it-as it is often this smaller scale research effort, undertaken by farmers and scientists on the ground, that yields significant breakthroughs which can be disseminated throughout a particular sector. Similarly, one would have little difficulty in a research emphasis on the relationship between food and preventative health issues or on enhanced biosecurity research. Indeed, when I look at the recommendations that have been made in the animal agricultural area, there is much in those recommendations that I think both sides of the House could support-for example, a redirection of research towards greater bioscience capability and capacity in animal science; research to reduce regional biosecurity risks around animal agriculture; research to reduce the environmental impact of animal agriculture and better utilise scarce natural resources; and an alignment of animal based foods with increased knowledge of diet, nutrition and health. Those are all commendable objectives. However, one statement that concerns me, the opposition, the National Farmers Federation and other bodies is the statement that ‘overall investment in the traditional livestock domain will decrease over time'. A key question to be asked here is whether the proposed changes outlined in this advice are motivated by a hard-nosed assessment of the research outcomes on the ground-that strategic cooperation that exists between farmers and scientists on the ground-to deliver significant advances in productivity. Or is it motivated by budgetary limitations associated with the implementation of CSIRO's flagship programs, which have caused the loss of valuable staff across Australia? Indeed, I do believe they have seen some staff reductions in CSIRO's fibre facility in Geelong, on the other side of the Barwon River in the electorate of the honourable member for Corangamite. In passing, I note that the honourable member for Corangamite was at the meeting that was held by the staff of that institution. They expressed significant concerns about the direction of research and the implications it was having on staff numbers in that facility. These budgetary limitations have led to the curtailment and closure of innovative but smaller scale research programs of relevance to many rural industries and regional communities. CSIRO would do well to heed the warning of the National Farmers Federation's Chief Executive Officer, Ben Fargher, that some of the new agricultural research priorities are ‘blue sky' and may not substantially contribute to helping Australian farmers gain a competitive advantage in tight but corrupted international markets. It is extremely important that this document is widely circulated, debated and discussed not only in the scientific community but in rural and regional communities and in farmer organisations so that there can be constructive input to the directions that are outlined in this document. I reiterate opposition finds much to commend in this document, including the directions for research that are suggested in it. I am particularly interested in and support the recommendations in the document relating to increased research into the role of food in tary matters and the health of Australians. However, a word of caution: the smaller scale traditional research projects bring farmers together with scientists on the ground-they are the ones who have delivered significantly to farmers in containing costs and improving their competitive advantage-and the opposition would not like to see either this particular aspect of our research effort in CSIRO diminished or the overall resources devoted to this task reduced.

82,Mr NAIRN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (3.51 pm)-In speaking on this MPI today, I first of all reinforce the importance science and science research. I think members of parliament have come a long way with respect to their understanding of and interest in matters of science and science research in the 9½ years that I have been in this House. There are not too many members in this place who have a science background. There are plenty with political science backgrounds, most of them on the other side, but not too many with real science or practical science backgrounds. I am pleased to say that I am one of those few that do come to this place from a science background. It is pleasing that, over the last 9½ years, there has been a greater focus in the parliament on these matters. I think one of the major reasons that that has occurred has been the role of the Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council, PMSEIC, which has certainly done some great work and focused the executive of government on these issues so that they have received greater underthat the standing and greater priority. As I said, I am particularly pleased that that has occurred. When I think back to the late seventies, when I spent a couple of years in a major research organisation in Europe, Australia was not really on the map regarddie- ing many international science and science research issues. In the high energy physics research agency where I worked, Australia really had no involvement at all. I compare that with today, when there is significant Australian input into the next major experiment happening there. With funding from the federal government-not a huge amount but a good amount of money-to get them through the door, our current and future physicists are getting some superb experience in that place. There are many more collaborative roles that we can play internationally to expose our up-and-coming scientists to some of the best in the world. Professor Geoff Taylor from the Univerof sity of Melbourne, who is in charge of the Australian aspect of that work outside Geneva, said to me recently: ‘It is just fantastic that I can take undergraduates and postdoc people over there to work on the ATLAS experiment at CERN. I can take these young people there and, just having lunch, identify two or three Nobel Prize winners in the cafeteria.' That is a great thing. I may have strayed a bit in this speech, but I think it is important that we do recognise some of the great changes that are taking place in Australia's role in research generally. The Australian government under John Howard brought down four national research priorities. All the research that is going on is focused towards them. It does not matter whether it is the CSIRO, one of the R&D corporations, grants to universities et cetera through the Australian Research Council or CRCs, they are all focused on these priorities. The four priorities are: An Environmentally Sustainable Australia; Promoting and Maintaining Good Health; Frontier Technologies for Building and Transforming Australian Industries; and Safeguarding Australia. Each of those areas has key goals, and the research that is going on is geared towards achieving those goals. I do not think anybody has an issue with that-probably even the opposition generally support that thrust. The CSIRO's work is just one part of that, and they are doing great work. The MPI talks about funding. Let us look at the funding that is going into the CSIRO under this government. If we go back to 1999-2000, the appropriation revenue for CSIRO was $500.3 million. In 2004-05, it was over $577 million. In this current financial year, 2005-06, it is $593.9 million and, by 2008-09, it will be $632.8 million. We then have the flagship program within CSIRO that will provide $305 million over seven years as base funding for the National Research Flagships. Those flagships cover Preventative Health, Light Metals, Food Futures, Energy Transformed, Water for a Healthy Country and Wealth from Oceans. I do not think we would deny that there is some change going on in the CSIRO, but the whole research area and community has changed a hell of a lot in a very short period of time. One of our key agencies, like the CSIRO, certainly has to move with the change that is taking place. Part of the change that has created some headlines recently is their move to reduce the expenditure in the administrative area and put it research. That is certainly something that we should applaud. In Geoff Garrett, the Chief Executive of CSIRO, I think we have a great person who understands the change that is taking place and ensures that we are getting the best possible research done in the most critical areas. The CSIRO today are working much more with universities and business, and the way in which they work with universities and business is much better today than even five or 10 years ago. That is part of the change. That sort of thing is highlighted quite strongly in the report, Riding the innovation wave: the case for increasing business investment in R&D, of the committee that I chaired in the last parliament. The inquiry that formed the basis of that report pointed out the need for our research agencies to work a lot more closely with academia and business. While there is still a lot more that can happen in that area, we have certainly made some great progress. On the agricultural side of research, from 1996-97 to 2003-04 this government, in conjunction with industry, has supported expenditure of more than $2.9 billion by the rural research and development corporations and companies for investment in R&D. In 200506 the government, in partnership with 14 rural research and development corporations, is forecast to spend $438 million on research and development. So there is significant funding going into the agricultural area, and nobody wants to see that more than me, representing as I do an electorate like Eden Monaro. I see some of the great innovative things that are happening in the various rural industries of the electorate that I represent, from fine wool on the Monaro, with some very innovative work being done between farmers and the research agencies, to the beef industry to the dairy industry on the coast. In my electorate I have seen Bega into Cheese go from 100 employees to 500 employees over the last 10 years. They have really taken the whole dairy industry by the throat, so to speak, produced innovative products and continued to find new markets internationally. That is what R&D is ultimately all about. CSIRO is shifting its research emphasis away from some of the traditional areas of agricultural research such as plant breeding, which is increasingly being undertaken commercially and through other research institutions. I think that is the key. You should not just look at what CSIRO is doing. Once upon a time probably only CSIRO was doing work in that area. Now it is becoming a very competitive area commercially because there are some great gains to be made by private companies doing that work. While they are making some shift in that regard, CSIRO is increasing its investment in such high-value areas as sustainable agriculture, nutritionally enhanced food and biosecurity. Increased investment in biosecurity is particularly appropriate given the increasing concerns over the spread of diseases across national borders, which if introduced into Australia could devastate many areas of primary production. CSIRO remains an important investor in agriculture R&D, and we need to ensure that its investment is made in areas where it can really make a difference. CSIRO's science investment process is a broad, research direction-setting framework that will guide CSIRO's future research priorities. These directions have been arrived following engagement with sector and other advisory groups, the heads of research groups within CSIRO, and the CSIRO board. Overall resource levels in plant based agriculture research are envisaged to remain constant, going forward at about $240 million per annum. However, what will change is the focus of the research towards placing greater emphasis on higher-level objectives through, for example: developing new tools and technologies that will enable industry to undergo quantum rather than incremental changes in productivity or major changes to products, such as specialised crops with health benefits and crop biofactories based on novel biosynthetic pathways; protecting Australian agriculture and Australians from biological threats such as exotic viral diseases; and recognising the link between agriculture and healthier, longer, more productive lives of Australians-for example, through the development of protective food products, tailored nutrients and bioactives, and strategies leading to healthier lifestyles and diet, like the CSIRO total well-being diet. The book has been an absolute bonus for CSIRO in recent times and I think it remains right up there at the top of the best-selling books at the moment, which is quite amazing. This means that there is likely to be more research into farm-cropping systems management and more landscape scale work and less emphasis on paddock scale research. There is likely to be more research on novel processes for enhanced food freshness and quality and less effort on traditional food processing and packaging. There will be more emphasis on value added wool processing, such as finding ways for manufacturers to produce a more marketable range of vibrantly coloured wool products, and less emphasis on traditional wool processing. There is likely to be greater emphasis on sustainat able agriculture through such initiatives as high rainfall area cropping and the development of crops that can withstand Australia's $1 billion soil acidity problem, for example. I do not have much more time, but I will just mention with respect to renewable energy that, in the Education, Science and Training portfolio alone, recent funding for basic and applied renewable energy research includes ARC grants of $26.3 million over 2002 to 2004 and, for CSIRO, $14.1 million of government funds between July 1998 and 2003. There is a lot of work being done on renewable energies through the industry portfolio. The R&D Start program administered by AusIndustry has made funding commitments to renewable energy, R&D projects and industry over the past two years of about $9 million. R&D tax concession claims relevant to renewable energy totalled $23 million in 2002-03. You cannot look at one aspect of what is happening in one particular research portfolio on its own. There is so much more to do, and it will be done. I am pleased, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, with some responsibilities in the area of water, to see the work being done in that area. There is substantially more work to do, particularly in water. The $2 billion water fund to support the National Water Initiative is another example of the commitment that we have to these issues. We are not going to have good agricultural research if we do not get water reform through. It is crucial over the next few years, and links very closely to this debate. (Time expired)",34
83,Mr GARRETT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have listened with interest to the member for Eden-Monaro reflecting on the history of science and science research, but I think it is important for us to reflect on is actually in this report and what it signals for basic research and research on renewable energy in this country. Most importantly, this report conveys what we on this side of the House have been saying for some time. So let us take a quick look back. On 23 March 2003 the then shadow minister for science and research, referring to a cost blow-out at CSIRO, raised the prospect of the damage to long-term research programs as a result of problems with the CSIRO business model and the approach taken to the funding of CSIRO under this government. He was absolutely spot on. The CSIRO annual report 2002-03 exposed the seeds of a funding crisis that had been ongoing for some seven years under the Howard government with the prospect of a newly emphasised business model, driven through the Business Development and Commercialisation unit, failing to reach projected earnings targets each time around. A year later, we had further evidence of the sorry state CSIRO research has fallen into under the stewardship of this government. It had a deficit of $9.2 million and a serious decline in earnings from external sources and research. As a consequence, research for renewables is to be pared back to what CSIRO euphemistically calls ‘areas in which we have competitive advantages'. One must ask: how do you achieve a competitive advantage if you do not do research in the yet area concerned? We await the government's answer to this basic question-and also to the question: what research areas will go? The report we are referring to is entitled ‘Advice to Executive Management Council on broad direction setting in the science investment process'. It makes for interesting reading. It is couched in the language of those who are facing a crisis but need to find expressions to hide it. We read that the team has adopted a ‘precautionary principle'what they will need to, given the difficulties CSIRO faces. ‘Precautionary principle' is an environmental term. It is an area in which the organisation has done, and still could do, fine work, except that this report-when you read it carefully-signals an intention to cut back research in renewable energy and other important areas too. The report goes on to say: … recognising that we are working with a new process, but, at the same time (the group) has provided an indicative set of priorities and challenges with which group executives and others can shape a theme based response to those longerterm priorities. When you cut through the thicket of bureaucratese, what is their response? Cuts to farm based agricultural research and the scaling back of renewables research. As this is an advisory report, the CSIRO Executive Management Council and other people are quoted in the press as: ... having been asked to put their name on the dance card because ... tough calls had to be The media got that right. A tough call does have to be made-on a government which is presiding over a situation in which our preeminent scientific research organisation is lurching from crisis to crisis. It is clear that the strategic direction that has been set by the government and the leadership of CSIRO is flawed. The organisation has not been able to deliver increases in research expenditure, and its attempts to ramp up business and commercialisation development funding simply have not succeeded. As well, we have seen corresponding threats and staff cuts. And now, in the 2004-05 annual report, the deficit has blown out by 73 per cent, notwithstanding a doubling in the number of senior executive salaries above $300,000. Research cuts are now contemplated which would apply to at least two areas of research that are critical to our long-term sustainability as a nation: crop and livestock research and renewable energy research. Our greenhouse gas emissions are skyrocketing. What a woeful situation. Public interest research is heading out the door and our finest minds are stranded by a government that will not provide adequate support for CSIRO. The result? Necessary research is being sacrificed on the altar of business commercialisation. This is the situation CSIRO finds itself in at a time when not only is there great potential for renewable energy but the Minister for the Environment and Heritage has finally seen the light and has come around to what we on this side of the House, the mainstream scientific community and the public have been saying for so long-namely, that global warming and corresponding climate change pose real threats to our natural ecosystems, our health and our way of life. Yet, at such a time, we are scaling back the research on renewables. Some countries face this challenge in a different way: they actually invest in remade. search and innovation and set in place the financial and legislative framework to build employment and create clean industries. But Australia, it seems, is doing the opposite. We have closed down every renewable energy strategic funding agency, including the CRCs which deal with these issues-which, to the great credit of those on this side of the House, were instituted by the Hawke government. Australia, under the Howard government, seems to be doing absolutely zip. We have the lowest possible mandatory renewable energy targets, no national framework or trading regime for energy emissions and no targeted cuts to greenhouse emissions. It is self-evident to everyone in the House that funding levels for CSIRO should be maintained and that areas such as renewable energy should be prudently supported. After all, the Japanese government invests some $200 million annually in its solar rebate program alone. As a consequence, Japan leads the world in the manufacture and use of solar PV. I remind the House that Australian scientists, including scientists at CSIRO, pioneered the research on solar PV. In the early 1990s, Germany had virtually no renewable energy industry. The German parliament introduced the electricity feed law, or EFL, which required utilities to purchase electricity generated from renewable energy and to pay a minimum price for it-in the case of wind and solar, at least 90 per cent of the retail price. We have very few measures that match what the Germans have done. In Denmark, a specific policy decision was initiated by the government in the early nineties to increase their investment and research in wind energy. As a consequenceand despite the prognostications of those who thought it would fail-the proportion of energy that Denmark's wind industry produces for the electricity grid has gone from single to double figures. It has become a major export industry for that country, and it employs lots of scientists and young Danes as well in the process. It is true that the report ‘identifies prioriis ties to strengthen research on environmental challenges'. Hallelujah! But here the cart is well ahead of the horse, because its suggestion that the organisation reduce its support for those areas which have the capacity to significantly address the very challenges to the environment that will be identified is a nonsense. We need to focus on how to produce energy, especially for stationary use, without increasing pollution by greenhouse gasses, without creating long-lived radioactive wastes and without creating additional strains on the atmosphere or the environment. Whilst renewables are not a totally magic bullet, they are an essential part of any suite of energy sources and will become increasingly critical in coming years. The member says that the Howard government has approached renewables with some vigour. I have to say that the picture is completely the opposite. Support for the renewables industry has been so paltry by this government that I have representations to my office on a regular basis-as I am sure the shadow minister for the environment has too-of renewable energy industries complaining about the fact that they are unable to get sufficient framework investment or support in this country in order to maintain their businesses, and now they are going offshore. That is happening at this point in time and it is to this government's great shame that it is happening. The renewable industry sector is growing at about 30 per cent per annum. That is where the opportunities are. But under the government, if this report is acted upon, the premier scientific institution in the country, the CSIRO, will scale back its very modest work on renewables. So it is self-evident that, despite the warning signs, the staff unrest and losses, the deficits, the struggles and difficulties that CSIRO has recently faced, it really the government that has been asleep at the wheel.

84,Mr SCHULTZ,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is an honour to stand here and speak on this matter of public importance. When I came into this place I was a very strong supporter of the need for organisations, regardless of who they were or where they were, to be made accountable and responsible for the way in which they spent taxpayers' resources. I learnt very quickly that it is a question of not how regularly you fund an organisation or how much you fund it but what it actually does with the funding it receives. It is a matter of whether it delivers a positive outcome on the expectations of not only the government of the day but the taxpayers themselves for the amount of money invested. My experience of the CSIRO is that it has done an exceptional job in delivering science to the community and, more importantly, it has done that in company with people in the agricultural industry who looked to the CSIRO to assist them in their process of running viable and scientifically based agricultural businesses. During the time in which all of these changes occurred, to its credit the CSIRO-as my parliamentary colleague the member for Eden-Monaro quite rightly pointed out-recognised the commercial reality that some research projects which were formerly in the realms of CSIRO services were picked up by private enterprise. The pressure has now been taken off scientific based organisations such as the CSIRO in many of the areas that they relied on for funding. We need to remind ourselves of the significant contribution made by people in agriculture-the farmers who work the lands, sow the crops and, over decades in many instances, go through the genetic process of producing fine wool et cetera. The point I am making here is that they themselves contribute to ensuring that agriculture remains viable and produces a product that is the envy of many nations in this great world of ours. My parliamentary colleague also mentioned the National Research Flagship initiative. That program, which was launched by the Prime Minister on 14 April 2003, is the largest scientific program in Australia's history. The flagship initiative is part of building our future through science and innovation. Flagships aim to deliver scientific solutions to Australia's most pressing needs, whether they be social, economic or environmental. Six of those national research flagships have been established by CSIRO to tackle major challenges faced by Australia in areas as diverse as health care, food, the environment, light metals, the oceans and energy. It is part of a major refocusing of CSIRO's research efforts on priority areas that will benefit from the increased scale CSIRO can apply by working across organisations. I commend the CSIRO for its vision in those areas and, more importantly, for looking at a five-year plan to introduce those changes. Many of the problems that we have with governments, semi-government organisations and others is that there is no forward planning. We live for today and forget about tomorrow, regardless of what it costs government or the Australian taxpayer. The goals of the flagships that I just referred to, which the CSIRO seeks to establish to tackle these major challenges, are: to help generate significant new export income and industries and enterprises for Australia by the 2020s; to help reduce health care costs, increase total economic benefits to the nation and enable Australians to achieve an extra 10 years of productive and enjoyable life; to help make Australia a world competitive player in the delivery of information and communications technology mediated services; to transform the agrifood sector by applying frontier technologies to its largest industries; to double the efficiency of the nation's new energy production and to have energy costs and make Australia a world leader in cutting greenhouse emissions; a tenfold increase in social, economic and environmental benefits from water use by 2025; and to build on Australia's excellence in climate and ocean science to generate sustainable wealth from our marine resources, thereby underlining our sovereignty over our large ocean territories. They are pretty commendable objectives of the CSIRO, because they are addressing those areas that need to be addressed to make sure that we have a sustainable and viable future in this country, not only for agriculture but also for science in general. A goal of the CSIRO's 2003-07 strategic plan is to focus on science investment in arthat eas of greatest relevance and impact. The science investment process builds on CSIRO's existing strengths and takes advantage of global advances in science to open up new opportunities. CSIRO's senior leaders are working through the implications of the latest broad direction setting to prepare a revised portfolio of research for 2006-07 and beyond. That is one of the points I was trying to make. Without going through the excerpts from the broad direction setting summary which the CSIRO has put out, I want to remind the House that the CSIRO itself continues to support the agricultural sector, despite what my parliamentary colleagues on the other side might say. Its science investment process will provide practical solutions in areas such as increasing productivity and sustainability and ensuring the long-term viability and sustainable use of natural resources. It is a very pertinent and very noble attribute of the CSIRO to look in that direction. The CSIRO is also focusing on increasing differentiated products to develop new and higher value national and global markets, including the broader bio-economy, which has been mentioned in this debate, and it recognises the link between agriculture and healthier and longer, more productive lives for Australians by doing so. I really do get a bit frustrated as a member of this House when people are asked to talk about positive things in MPIs, which are supposed to alert the community to what is happening during the debate process, and see them continually politicised, with people talking about an agenda they have grown up with, on which they are focused, without having any care or consideration as to what the directions taken by organisations such as the CSIRO are doing to keep agriculture to the forefront in the world today. We have an enormous product that is world renowned for its cleanliness, its sustainability and, more importantly, its quality. That has not just happened. As I mentioned earlier, it has happened through a combination of contributions by government, significant contributions by people on the land and significant contributions by scientists helping those people to put out that product. More importantly it has had a significant contribution to the land itself, which people on the land have suddenly realised we have to look after, and they have been doing that for the last decade or so. I want to make the point that there will be no cuts to CSIRO agriculture funding in 2005-06. Why do people have a philosophical problem with the boards of organisations such as CSIRO saying, ‘We've got a $230 million', or a $500 million, ‘package here. We don't believe that in this particular section we've delivered the outcomes that we should be delivering under our responsibilities to spend taxpayers' money as responsibly as we can. We're not doing what we should have been doing in that area but there is a demand in this area, so we'll shift some of those funds from point A to point B'? That is responsible management, and that is what we are looking for. (Time expired)",39

88,Mr SNOWDON,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"I will continue where I left off last night on the a second Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005 and Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management (Related Amendment) Bill 2005. On 16 July the minister came out with his preferred sites for the dump-Fishers Ridge, Mount Everard and Harts Range-all in the Northern Territory and all of them in Lingiari. Only one of them was mentioned in the short list which the National Sites Advisory Committee compiled. It is worthwhile pointing out that the sites deemed most suitable by the National Sites Advisory Committee were at Seymour in Victoria, Denman in New South Wales, Bogan Gate in New South Wales, Narrandera in New South Wales, Wagga in New South Wales and Deniliquin in New South Wales. One of these sites, at Narrandera, is 7½ thousand hectares or thereabouts and is currently Defence land which has no current use. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker: on what basis did the government make the decision to put these waste repositories in the Northern Territory? Purely on an arrogant, political basis. It has done so despite the expressed declarations of the views of the Northern Territory people and the Northern Territory parliament. It has proved to those people that their views do not count. It does what it likes when it likes because it can. That is the arrogance of this government and its CLP representatives in Canberra as it seeks to micromanage the Northern Territory community. They want to make it impossible for the Northern Territory legislature to have the right to properly voice the concerns and wishes of the Territory's community. They want to sit here in Canberra and be all powerful in the lives of the people of the Territory. What people think of their decisions just does not matter because they are Territorians. In their eyes, Territorians do not count. We know that the member for Solomon will come in here later and move a series of amendments, trying to propose that the Northern Territory community should select the site areas themselves when in fact the Northern Territory community have made it very clear they do not want a site-not one site. They do not want any sites in the Northern Territory on the basis of the way in which the decisions have been made. The government are again demonstrating their arrogance and the fact that they regard Territorians as second-class citizens-and they are standing over us because they can. They know they cannot do that anywhere else in Australia. This is where we come to the third leg of the saga. The Country Liberal Party calls itself ‘the Territory party'. That is not so. The CLP's parliamentary leader in the Territory says the CLP is, like the Labor Party, opposed to the dumps. She has come out and very publicly opposed the placing of nuclear waste in the Territory. The CLP's dynamic duo here in Canberra, Senator Scullion and the member for Solomon, wanting no part of this, have made it very clear that they are not going to stand up here for the Territory's interests, because they believe that the government will win the vote. Rather than voice their concerns and vote against these propositions, they have rolled over yet again. The member for Solomon has been all over the place on the issue and is now given to prolonged silences, although I notice that he was on the radio this morning touting these amendments which he proposes to move this afternoon. When he is not silent he is just repeating verbatim the arguments given to him, including the canard that somehow or other Australians would be denied isotopes for nuclear medicine if a decision is not made by March next year. That canard was put to rest by the shadow minister in her contribution. It is very clear that those isotopes will be provided as long as Lucas Heights remains in operation. The federal government should not attempt, as they have done, to try to make the Northern Territory responsible for their decisions. The fact is that the federal government have been unable to come to a conclusion on this matter with the agreement of the states and the territories and have been unable to bring them together to find a solution, so they have taken a decision to impose one upon the people of the Northern Territory. We know that Senator Scullion, the man who trumpeted the view ‘not on my watch' only a few months ago and the man who broadly hinted he would oppose any legislation, has squibbed it at every opportunity. He tries to talk tough and as recently as 18 August, in an interview on 8TOP FM, he said: Yes ... it's not a career move crossing the floor ... at the end of the day you've got to represent those people who put you there. He is clearly not representing them now. When it actually comes to the crunch, we know what he will do: he will not support the Labor Party's proposition in opposition to the government proposal. These two have sold out the Northern Territory. They have sold us short-short on environmental grounds and short on constitutional grounds but long on political opportunism. This is what people in the Territory get when they send a CLP representative to Canberra: the Territory's men in Canberra very quickly become Canberra's men in the Territory. In return for a pat on the head, the occasional juicy announcement or a photo opportunity with a minister or, indeed, the Prime Minister, they bark when they are told to and lie down to get their bellies scratched like the good lapdogs that they are. If it were not so important, it would be worth a good laugh. But it is important. These people are colluding with this government in forcing on the Territory a nuclear waste dump that the vast majority of Territorians want no part of. They are selling us out. Instead of representing the Territory, they are part of the Canberra sales team. People in the Territory are not stupid: they can work out what is going on, they have worked out what is going on, and they do not like it. They certainly do not like being relegated to the mushroom club by the people that they send to Canberra to promote their views and fight for their issues. I draw the attention of the member for Solomon and Senator Scullion to what happened to the CLP in the last two Territory elections. When you stop listening, when you start thinking it is okay to try to pull the wool over people's eyes, when you continue to but display arrogance, when you start thinking standover tactics are acceptable and when you continue to deny people their rights, you are in trouble. The Prime Minister could well ponder that too. We should understand that this is a very important issue to the people of the Northern Territory. I have here a site report. The minister has dismissed this site report. He says now that he has made his decision on the basis of a desktop study. What does that tell us? What were the determinations of the desktop study? What is wrong with the most suitable site, at Narrandera? We know that what is wrong with it is that it is in a coalition seat, as is every one of the sites in New South Wales and Victoria which is determined as most suitable. The only reason we are in this fix is that the government are so gutless that they are not prepared to negotiate a set of arrangements with the New South Wales government or take them on in relation to the nuclear waste facility. We also know, from the advice of the scientists, that the scientists do not see any particular need to remove or relocate the current waste at Lucas Heights. We know that this is a matter of political expediency. The government are doing this and imposing their will on the people of the Northern Territory because they think they can. They know they can, and they are doing it because they believe that it will have the least political implications for them. Let me say to them: be very careful because, in my view, the Northern Territory community will not forget this. They will not forget the interference in the Northern Territory's affairs, the standover tactics and the supine relationship that the CLP representatives here in Canberra have got with the Prime Minister and the coalition.",44
89,Mrs MOYLAN,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"I think it is a pity that the people of the Northproach. ern Territory are not being well represented by their representatives because the level of this debate on the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005 and cognate bill has deteriorated somewhat. I remind this House, on the allegation of the member for Lingiari, that the only nuclear reactor this country has is in a Liberal held seat in Sydney. In fact, that nuclear reactor has been right there in the centre of Sydney for 40 years. I think we should really stick to the facts, stop trying to scare people and give them the proper facts of the matter. I believe that if people do understand the facts there will be no need for anyone to be concerned except to make sure, and the government is, that it is taking a responsible position on the secure, safe management of radioactive waste material. Nobody gets up in this place and calls the Royal Darwin Hospital a radioactive waste dump, and neither should they, but there is radioactive material stored at the Darwin hospital and doubtless in countless hospitals throughout this country, because radioactive material is now used to save lives, and we have to deal with the waste product of that in some responsible way. So it is disappointing to hear the member for Lingiari suggest for one moment that this government wants to locate a waste disposal facility in the Northern Territory for political reasons, and I want to make that point very strongly. One of our members has Lucas Heights in her electorate and, as I said, it has been there for 40 years. Successive Australian governments since the Hawke Labor government have endeavoured to make responsible arrangements for managing Australia's radioactive waste and, in doing so, they have been defeated by the attitude of state and territory governments that fully agree with the need for such facilities but not in their backyard. It is really a disgraceful and, I think, un-Australian apWe benefit from the use of this material and I do not think it is good enough to suggest that some other country should take our waste products and store them there. We have a responsibility to deal with our waste products, as I said, in a secure, safe manner, and that is what this government is doing. In an attempt to deal with such parochialism, an objective, scientifically based study to find a highly suitable site for a national low-level radioactive waste repository was initiated in July 1992 by the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Hon. Simon Crean MP. After considerable effort and expense, this process ended last year following the action in the Federal Court by the Rann Labor government to oppose the use of the selected site near Woomera in South Australia. This parliament and those listening to this debate should understand the facts of it. In fact, there had been a bipartisan approach to this matter. I am very pleased to speak today because in 1999 the Public Works Committee, which I chaired then and continue to chair, reported to this House approving the replacement nuclear research reactor project for the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, ANSTO. Additionally the Public Works Committee approved the redevelopment of the radiopharmaceutical production building No. 23 at Lucas Heights in New South Wales. When we reported to this House in relation to the replacement nuclear research reactor the Public Works Committee recommended the project go ahead subject to a suitable waste management site being identified and developed by the Commonwealth. We were aware that both Labor and our government had been trying for some time to achieve this without any cooperation from the states and territories. One of the reasons for the need to develop a waste repository for low-level and shortlived intermediate-level waste is due to the decommissioning of the existing high flux Australian reactor. In addition, there is limited space at the present facility at Lucas Heights and a long-term repository is needed to manage the ongoing lowand intermediate-level waste from the reactor. That was understood and known by the Labor Party when it was in government and by our government. In fact, our committee, which is a bipartisan committee and has Liberal and Labor members on it, approved this workwe are responsible for approving all works over $6 million-and we reported to both houses of parliament. The examination of these works resulted in a report that was supported by that bipartisan committee. We all understood our responsibility. So the committee was aware, of course, that the Commonwealth since the 1980s had been considering a near-surface repository for the storage of lowand medium-level waste. In 1992 the Labor government put into place a process to identify a suitable site to store to intermediate waste, as I said, but it was thwarted constantly. The commitment had been supported by both major parties and the Howard government is prepared to seriously address the obstructions to identifying and developing these sites. Our minister should be commended for the work he has done and for progressing what has been a very difficult issue now for a long time. The fact is that about 3,800 cubic metres of low-level waste and 400 cubic metres of intermediate-level waste are already stored at 30 locations around the country, some in inner city locations, as I said, and the Public Works Committee believed it was important that more appropriate arrangements be made for the long-term storage of this waste. Finding a national solution requires a cooperative and mature approach by federal, state and territory governments. All states and territories produce radioactive waste and, as a result of this resistance by the states and territories to accept the decision of the Commonwealth, each will now have to manage its own radioactive waste in a manner consistent with Australia's international obligations. So I wonder whether the state governments are going to run around the country talking about their own waste dumps. Frankly, it is very irresponsible to talk in that way. The waste generated is lowto mediumlevel waste as Australia does not operate a nuclear reactor for the purpose of energy generation and, therefore, there is no highlevel waste. If the low to medium waste is properly stored as it is at present time-as I have said, we have it stored in the middle of Sydney and it has been stored there for 40 years-albeit in many different locations, it presents no risk to the community. Nuclear medicine plays an increasingly important part in the diagnosis and treatment of many medical conditions. Without this modern-day low miracle, many lives would be lost. I believe we also provide some radioisotopes for other countries which cannot manufacture their own. In addition, the facility is necessary for research and for industry. Every year over 400,000 Australians undergo life-saving medical procedures using isotopes produced by Australia's only nuclear reactor. Radioactive materials have a host of applications in areas as diverse as the sterilisation of bandages and in women's hygiene products. Minerals exploration and processing use radioactive materials, and we also use them to ensure the safety of oil and gas pipelines and to check shipping containers for illicit imports. I am sure that many ports around Australia are already using radioactive material to carry out that function and they have to store the waste products from those materials in some manner. To ensure the continuing availability of these medical and industrial applications we must provide the facilities needed for managing the small quantity of radioactive waste that arises in its production and use. The level of hysteria whipped up over the proper storage of waste and the opposition of the South Australian government ended what had been a sensible bipartisan approach to radioactive waste management that had existed for more than a decade under Labor and coalition governments. If Australia wants to continue to benefit from the use of radiopharmaceuticals and other products, then we must take responsibility for the storage of waste products. In my view, it is unacceptable for this material to be shipped to another country for disposal. We should take responsibility for managing our own radioactive waste. There is no substance to the claim by the Martin government in the Northern Territory that Commonwealth action to allow the establishment of a repository in the Northern Territory will endanger health and safety through the transportation of material. The Northern Territory government currently stores radioactive waste in Darwin's hospitals. Rather than obstruct the Commonwealth's plan, they should support it and take a lead in the proper storage of radioactive waste. Apart from the waste held in Darwin hospital, they do not appear to know where other waste is. They have made exaggerated claims about the safety of the transportation of waste through the Northern Territory and the impact of the facility on the environment. This government is not about to do something that will damage the environment, and again I make the point that the Sydney reactor is located in the middle of Sydney and is very close to a significant waterway. We have managed that facility for 40 years without incident. The level of hypocrisy of the Martin government is appalling when you consider that yellowcake from Olympic Dam is currently safely transported by rail to Darwin and then shipped to the port of Darwin with the full participation of the Northern Territory government authorities. Yellowcake is more radioactive than any of the low-level radioactive waste held by the Commonwealth. Material is currently being safely stored in Sydney, and it has been for years. This has not dampened anyone's enthusiasm for living in Sydney or visiting one of the most popular cities in the world. There was some suggestion by the Northern Territory's Minister for Mines and Energy, Kon Vatskalis, that it would destroy their clean, green primary product and tourism industry. What a ridiculous assertion that is. It certainly has not destroyed Sydney; all it has done is gained in popularity. Indeed, the overseas experience shows that these claims are totally exaggerated. In countries such as France the existence of large radioactive waste management facilities has done nothing to damage the reputation of famous products such as champagne or camembert cheese produced nearby. France's current low-level waste disposal facility in the Champagne district has a capacity 100 times greater than anything being considered here in Australia. I think we really need to talk sensibly about this and engage in a mature discussion about how to most safely and securely make provision for the storage of this material. This is in the interests of all Australians. The Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill gives effect to the recommendation of the Public Works that the replacement reactor at Lucas Heights should be subject to the identification and development of appropriate storage facilities. In essence, the legislation provides the Commonwealth with the legislative means to undertake work associated with the proposed facility and to override and/or restrict legislation by other jurisdictions that may prevent the development of the facility and its operation, and it gives legislative effect to the acquisition or extinguishment of rights and interests that may otherwise prevent the location and operation of the facility. Suitable sites owned by the Commonwealth have been identified and any development will be subject to intense regulatory scrutiny. In addition to undergoing full environmental impact processes, licences will be required from the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency for the siting, construction and the operating phases of the project. Transportation of radioactive material has an excellent safety record internationally and in Australia. About 30,000 packages of radioactive material are transported safely around this country every year. As the Minister for Education, Science and Training outlined in his second reading speech, a number of existing State and Territory jurisdictions purport to prohibit or regulate the Commonwealth's activity in establishing and operating a facility and/or transporting radioactive materials to a facility. State and territory jurisdictions may introduce additional legislation purporting to prohibit or regulate the Commonwealth in these activities. The minister in his second reading speech went on to say: ... part 4 of the bill provides the Commonwealth with the express authority to do anything necessary or incidentally required to proceed with the establishment and operation of a Commonwealth facility at the selected site, and transport waste the facility. To ensure there is no suggestion that the Commonwealth would seek to circumvent proper Commonwealth regulatory scrutiny, the bill explicitly provides that the processes under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act 1998 and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 must be complied with. The Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill will ensure that the Commonwealth has the necessary powers to implement responsible radioactive waste management policies which in the past have been supported by both major parties. The government will be able to complete a detailed site selection process to identify the preferred site or sites ready for a detailed environmental impact assessment in line with the act. As I said, the bill clears the way through legal obstacles erected by parochial state and territory governments to establish and operate a facility for responsible management of the Commonwealth's radioactive waste. The bill will further confirm the Commonwealth's power to establish a single, purpose-built facility for managing the radioactive waste currently stored at around 30 sites, including some in or near cities, that were never designed for radioactive waste management. This brings me to the point that the Public Works Committee went and inspected Lucas Heights. There is limited land there available for expansion and what is there is needed for production and the growth in radiopharmaceuticals. It is not appropriate to continue to store materials on that site, just by virtue of the fact that the site is simply not adequate to continue to cope with it. This has nothing to do with the fact that, as some people suggest, it is dangerous to store this material. It can be stored safely but the site just cannot cope. The bill, by supporting a single, state-ofto the-art radioactive waste management facility, also provides legislation to underpin the continued availability to the community of life-saving nuclear medicines and a host of widely used products and services that are only available through the use of nuclear materials. The bill is very important in confirming the Commonwealth's power to establish a radioactive waste management facility and giving effect to our responsibilities in that respect. This bill will also allow for cess routes to be declared in order to provide for all-weather road access to the site in a safe manner, consistent with the requirements. This is a responsible measure for the Commonwealth to take and it is a great pity that state and territory governments do not similarly recognise their part in making provision for safe, secure and responsible radioactive waste management storage. Once again, as I say, I commend our minister for having progressed this and for making sure that we can, now and into the future, safely store this material.",47
90,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"I rise this afternoon to debate the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005 and the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management (Related Amendment) Bill 2005. At the outset, I want to clearly indicate that the opposition stands in ongoing support of Australia's need to establish a national repository for lowand medium-level radioactive waste. This is not a debate about that objective; this is a debate about the manner in which the current government has gone about that process-a process commenced by Labor in government in 1992, with Simon Crean as the Minister for Science. The truth is that, after nine long years of refusing to consult with the community about a national radioactive waste repository, the Howard government, as is reflected in these bills, has learnt nothing. It has come up with these two bills but their purpose has little to do with finding a long term national solution to the safe storage and disposal of all of Australia's radioactive or nuclear waste. The bills do not achieve that objective at all. The purpose of the bills is, by and large, prevent any community involvement, community discussion and community input to this important subject. It is about time we accepted, on all sides of the political debate, ac- that this is a major problem that we all have responsibility for. It is our wasteAustralia's waste-and we all have to start applying our minds as to how we face up to our responsibilities to find a solution to where we dispose of this lowand mediumlevel nuclear waste. It is no other nation's waste; it is Australia's waste. A process was commenced by Labor in 1992, but it has been derailed by the events of the last six to eight months, with the intervention of the Australian government election and the misleading statements made by the federal government during the course of the election in the Northern Territory. The problem is that the bills are symptomatic of the arrogance of the Howard government now that it controls both houses of parliament. They are bills that in essence thumb their nose at the wishes of the community of the Northern Territory and the rights of communities, including Indigenous communities, around the nation to be involved in important land use decisions on their doorsteps. These bills deny the application of the usual planning, environmental and land rights laws-laws that would apply to any other land use decision in this country. These are laws that we expect to be applied when making tough decisions in Australiaa civilised nation, with a strong sense of democratic process. The bills before the House remove any recourse to procedural fairness as grounds to challenge the minister's decision. It is very clear from a reading of these bills and associated second reading speeches and memorandums of understanding that this legislation is about removing the rights of Australian communities to be involved in land use decisions in their own backyards. to Therefore, why wouldn't the people of the Northern Territory protest against the arrogance of the decision-making process of the Howard government? There is also some history as to why these demonstrations of local opposition to the government are so strong. It goes to the crux of whether or not there is integrity in government-something which I also intend to deal with this afternoon. The bills, as I have said, are about removing the rights of those communities to know that due process and the usual laws of the land have been followed in reaching good, tough decisions about important land use matters like the siting of a national nuclear waste repository. These are laws, for example, that I expect to be applied in another tough decisionwhether or not we build a new pulp mill in north-east Tasmania. This is something that I support, but obviously we have to go through due process because that is the nature of the way we decide on development in Australia. Let me be very clear, Mr Deputy Speaker. Unfortunately, these bills do not settle the important matter of establishing a national nuclear waste repository. It is a part solution to a national problem which has to be resolved in the national interest. The repository will only be for lowand intermediate-level radioactive waste generated by Australian government departments, agencies and statutory authorities. It will not achieve the come sought to be achieved by the process commenced by Labor in government in 1992. It does not deal with arrangements for waste produced by industry or the state and territory governments of Australia. According to the Department of Education, Science and Training web site, more than half of the estimated current inventory of intermediate-level waste was generated by the states and territories and by just under five per cent of the estimated current inventory of low-level waste was generated by the states and territories. The bills before us today do not provide for the safe storage and disposal of that waste. How then can this be painted as a ‘national' solution? It is a part solution of a national problem. Surely this government can use the COAG process to get this issue back on the rails-to try to get a truly national solution for the safe and proper handling, transport, storage and disposal of our nuclear waste. Much of this waste is generated from equipment and activities that provide the most important of services to all Australians-equipment like the radioactive sources found in smoke detectors and exit signs that are essential safety features in most of our public buildings and our homes, and activities like nuclear medicine. How many members of parliament have families who have benefited from nuclear medicine? How many of the constituents that they represent have been beneficiaries of nuclear medicine in Australia? We are all touched by the achievements of our medical fraternity on the nuclear medicine front. Waste from nuclear medicine includes radioactive sources arising from medicine and research. In other words, it includes obsolete equipment used in the treatment of cancer patients and waste generated from the production of drugs used in their treatment. It out- includes contaminated laboratory equipment like sample jars and paper towels and contaminated protective clothing like rubber gloves. How dare anyone suggest that that cannot be moved through the streets and suburbs of Australian capital cities or regional cities to a safe national repository! That suggestion is without any intellectual integrity and should be abandoned as a matter of course. Waste can and should be moved to a industry, and national repository. As I said, how many of us have friends and family whose lives have been saved or improved through the wonder of nuclear medical technology? The generation of lowand intermediate-level nuclear waste is an unavoidable part of this technology; it is an unavoidable part of what we expect in the Australian community. But it is not unmanageable. That issue is what is before the House this afternoon. Managing it is the responsibility of government. It is about leadership. It is time this government faced up to that responsibility, time that it used the COAG processes to engage properly with the states and territories in cooperative federalism to get a national solution for the Australian community in the form of a truly national nuclear waste repository. Meanwhile, unfortunately, the government is only interested in setting up a legislative scheme that says, ‘We'll do what we like, where we like, when we like and how we like, and we'll tell you about it when we feel like it.' This is a government that is not interested in addressing the fact that low-level radioactive waste is stored in over 100 locations in government stores and in universities, hospitals and factories around Australia, in the suburbs and the streets of the capital cities and the regional cities that we live in. There are over 100 repositories around Australia. If anyone has any doubts about that, they should examine a question on notice, question 1913, which I put on the Notice Paper earlier this year and which was responded to by the Minister for Education, Science and Training. It actually lists the facts. It is time we had a factual debate about this very issue. Waste is already stored in the suburbs of our nation. The issue is whether or not we have the guts and strength to make a proper national decision following due process to establish a proper national repository. There is nothing to fear from these stores. But what is the point of saying this unless we take up the fact that we all have a responsibility to raise the issue and solve the problems. There is nothing to fear from these stores. But what is the point of saying that we will take some of the nuclear waste and ship it to a national repository but we will not care about the rest of it? That is where these two bills potentially leave us as a community-with no long-term national solution. I believe that the Australian community deserves a consistent national approach to the storage of nuclear waste. It deserves to know-and this is what is not heard in this debate-that there is a single national repository managed to the highest, safest standards. It deserves to know that there is a single national handling and transport code to move the waste across the country. It also requires state and territory governments to start to accept their responsibility for trying to solve this national problem. Let us put an end to the dishonesty on some of the issues that have been put forward by state and territory governments with respect to these facts. This material can be stored safely, and it can be moved through our suburbs by a variety of forms of transport to a proper national repository. They are the facts. Let us have a debate about truth, honesty and integrity in government and put aside some of the things that have been said to date on these issues. I therefore argue that we deserve a government that is prepared to work out a long term solution to this problem and that cares enough to take into account the concerns of about the community, to manage this issue properly and to take the hard decisions that are necessary to get the right outcome. Unfortunately, currently we have a government that is locked into a political solution-not the best solution in terms of a safe and suitable site but a solution that will have the least electoral fallout for it. Hence the selection of three sites in the Northern Territory right in the middle of a Labor seat, the seat of Lingiari. I remind the House of some facts. In July this year the science minister came up with another plan that he wants to sell to the community, following a lot of failed plans on the decision to try to find a national repository. He announced a shortlist of three sites for the nuclear dump-all Commonwealth owned and in the Northern Territory seat of Lingiari, where it is easiest for the federal government to override the determination of Australian citizens. Not only is this a shameful and blatant political decision; it is yet another broken promise and yet another example of the lies and deceit of the coalition during the recent federal election campaign. I take the House to a statement by the federal Minister for the Environment and Heritage to Northern Territorians on ABC Radio in Darwin on 30 September last year. He said: ... the Commonwealth is not pursuing any options anywhere on the mainland, so we can be quite categorical about that, because the Northern tory is on the mainland ... They are the exact words of the federal minister on Darwin radio in the middle of the election campaign last year. Today, we have three possible sites proposed by the government for a nuclear waste repository-and they are all in the Northern Territory. This is a government whose words and actions must be held to account, yet today we are addressing two bills which expressly remove all semblance of accountability being applied to government. These bills are designed to remove any obstacle that stands in the way of the government doing what it wants on the issue of nuclear waste disposal. These bills are designed to make the decision-making process exempt from the usual planning, environment and heritage laws that would apply to major land use decisions in this country. As previous speakers on our side have said, these bills ride roughshod over the rights of the Northern Territory community. I remind the House that no-one on our side of the House has said that we should walk away from a national process to find a national repository. It is absolutely accepted that it is our responsibility to find a national repository for the storage of lowand mediumselflevel radioactive waste. Let me remind the House of the rights and concerns of Indigenous communities in the passage of these bills. It is about time we all recognised the rights of Indigenous communities to put forward their own cases on these matters and to have a say and a meaningful role in their own social and economic determination-something that a lot of people have made speeches about for a long time. In that context, I recognise that the Central Land Council has expressed its concern about the proposal. I note that the decision of the Central Land Council was tabled yesterTerriday in the course of this debate. I also want to note that the Northern Land Council has called for an amendment to the bill so that the land council can nominate a site in the Northern Territory for a waste facility, provided that the traditional owners agree and scared site environment issues continue to be protected under current legislation. The Northern Land Council is to be commended for its recognition of the need to safely store radioactive waste in a national repository and for its foresight in seeing the economic development opportunities that such a facility could have for the Northern Territory and its potential to improve the lot of remote communities. That is what that decision says. Without ticking off the three sites nominated by the current government, it refers to the need for government to do four things: firstly, to consult traditional owners of a site; secondly, to make sure that current NT and Commonwealth legislation with respect to scared sites and heritage is respected; thirdly, to add proper attention to environmental protection issues, including those under current Commonwealth and NT legislation; and, fourthly, to not acquire land or extinguish native title without the consent of the traditional owners. They are important issues that the Labor Party has campaigned for day in and day out. Accordingly, to complete the record, given that the decision of the Central Land Council has been tabled, I seek leave of the House to table the decision of the Northern Land Council. Leave granted.",51
91,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"I thank the House. Let me reiterate the opposition support for a national repository for lowand intermediate-level nuclear waste in this country. The decision taken by the opposition to oppose these bills is not to say that are opposed to the need for Australia, in the national interest, to find a lowand intermediate-level nuclear waste repository in this country. We reaffirm our support for such a process. This debate is about the bungled attempt by the government to implement a part solution-and that is all it is-where only Commonwealth waste is disposed of in a lowand intermediate-level repository that potentially has not been selected by due process and involves the pushing aside of normal legal processes expected of government. Therefore, I say in the national interest that the government ought to step back and try to work out how it can engage the state and territory governments. I also challenge the state and territory governments through COAG processes to meet their responsibilities to be part of the solution to Australia's challenge to establish, through proper process, a national repository for lowand intermediate-level nuclear waste in Australia. It is the responsibility of all of us to achieve that outcome. The repository should not be imposed on a community without proper process and consultation. The process was commenced by the Hawke and Keating governments more than a decade ago-in 1992-when Simon Crean was the minister for science. Fundamental to that process is not only the question of consultation but, more importantly, the twin principles of scientific evaluation and community consultation. They are inseparable in how the process should proceed. The problem is that under this process both these principles have fallen over or been thrown aside by the Howard government. The Labor Party will oppose these bills on the basis that they do not truly deliver a national repository or a solution for Australia's national lowand intermediate-level nuclear we waste disposal problem. In terms of political integrity, these bills represent an extreme abuse of democratic process by the Howard government, matched only by industrial relations and counterterrorism bills. They do not solve our real problem: that state and territory governments and the Commonwealth show a bit of leadership and work together to solve this issue rather than imposing a part solution on one isolated community in the Northern Territory in the heart of the Labor seat of Lingiari contrary to the needs of local people. There has been no proper consultation. I commend the second reading amendment to the House and say that the opposition stands ready to be part of a process to establish a lowand intermediate-level nuclear waste repository in Australia, but not by these endeavours. (Time expired)",55
92,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"Mr Quick)Before I call the honourable member for Fairfax, I remind the honourable member for Batman of the use of ‘lies and deceit'. Perhaps he might read his speech in Hansard and in future rephrase or use other words. Mr Martin Ferguson-With all respect, Mr Deputy Speaker, the truth is the truth.",55
93,Mr SOMLYAY,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"I have a long history of involvement with the Northern Territory. It goes back to 1975 and the election of the Fraser government. I was chief of staff to the Minister for the Northern Territory. I have heard many references to uranium and to uranium mining. I remind the House that it was under a government of this persuasion with Malcolm Fraser that we had the Fox report. The Fox commission was commissioned by the Whitlam government to report on the future of uranium mining in the Northern Territory. There was a very long process where the Fraser government considered the implications of uranium mining in Kakadu. Another Whitlam government initiative was a Northern Territory land rights act, which was passed by the Fraser government under the ministership of the Hon. Ian Viner. At the same time the Fraser government developed self-government for the Northern Territory, declared in 1978. Later on in 1997 and 1998 I was Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government. For the member for Batman to argue that the Howard government holds the people of the Northern Territory in contempt and rides roughshod over the citizens of the Northern Territory could not be further from the truth. In fact, in 1998, at the initiative of the then Northern Territory government, this government agreed to a referendum to be held in the Northern Territory in conjunction with the 1998 federal election in which the people of the Northern Territory had the choice to become a state. It was offered to the Northern Territory by this government. Members on the opposite side of the House, both in the Territory and here, campaigned against that referendum. We all know that all referendums in Australia that have been contested have failed, and that referendum failed to be carried. The Northern Territory remains a territory. The Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005 and the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management (Related Amendment) Bill 2005 are not about the mining or use of uranium in any way, but I thought I would mention my association with the Territory in that context. This legislation is simply about ensuring that we have a safe repository for radioactive waste from existing medical and industrial use. We are talking about waste that already exists-it is already in storage around our cities, as other speakers have said, including the member for Batman. This government wants to provide safe storage facilities for our lowand intermediate-level radioactive waste, both existing and future waste. We also want to make sure that such a facility does not endanger people or the environment. Successive Commonwealth governments since the Hawke government have endeavoured to make responsible arrangements for managing Australia's radioactive waste. However, like all previous Commonwealth efforts, whether it be the Labor side of the House or our side of the House, these efforts have been thwarted by the attitude of state and territory governments. Governments in the states and territories fully agree with the need for such facilities, provided they are not in their backyard. The states and territories are responsible for monitoring and managing the use, transport and disposal of radioactive materials under their control in accordance with the laws of their state or territory. The Commonwealth government is responsible for monitoring and managing the radioactive material in departments and agencies under its control. This is regulated by the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency. This bill is to ensure that existing or future state and territory laws cannot purport to prohibit, regulate or hinder the Commonwealth in the process of selecting a site for a storage facility. In 1992 the federal Labor government initiated a scientific study to find the most suitthe able site for a national low-level radioactive waste repository. But that ended last year when the Rann government in South Australia did some political grandstanding and took action in the Federal Court opposing the use of the selected site near Woomera. The Prime Minister then announced that the Commonwealth government would examine possible sites on Commonwealth land for lowand intermediate-level radioactive waste produced by Commonwealth agencies and that the states and territories could make their own arrangements for managing waste in their jurisdictions. In July this year the minister announced that the government would undertake detailed investigations of three Department of Defence sites owned by the Commonwealth in the Northern Territory. These sites are at Fishers Ridge near Katherine and Harts Range and Mount Everard near Alice Springs. The purpose of this bill is to put beyond any doubt the Commonwealth's power to select a site and make arrangements for the safe and secure management of the small quantity of radioactive waste produced by Commonwealth agencies from the use of nuclear materials in medicine, research and industry. This bill provides that the minister may declare one, or part of one, of the three fied sites as the place where the facility may be established and may also declare land to provide suitable road access to the site. If you are going to have a storage facility for radioactive waste, you have to be able to transport the waste to the site. While the bill provides for the acquisition or extinguishment of all interest in the facility or road sites, it also provides that any affected parties are to be compensated. It does not exempt the Commonwealth from any existing regulatory processes in establishing and operating facility. What that means is that, notwithstanding any state or territory legislation, the Commonwealth has the authority to establish and operate a Commonwealth facility at the selected site and to transport radioactive waste to that facility. Having said that this bill gives the Commonwealth the right to select a site for the establishment of a radioactive waste storage facility, it makes sense to look at what sort of waste we are talking about, how dangerous it is and what sorts of processes produce the radioactive waste in need of storage. Australia recognises the international classification of radioactive waste, which is generally classified on the basis of how much radiation it emits, what form of radiation is emitted and the length of time it will continue to emit that radiation. The purpose of this classification system is to ensure that the waste is stored and disposed of in ways appropriate to its characteristics. For instance, low-level waste is defined as that containing enough radioactive material to require action for the protection of people but not so much as to require shielding during handling, storage or transportation. It is suitable for near-surface disposal. Intermediate-level waste is defined as waste which requires shielding but needs little or no provision for heat dissipation and specicontains low concentrations of long-lived radionuclides, which generally have a halflife of less than 30 years for what is termed short-lived, or longer than 30 years for what is termed long-lived. Short-lived intermediate-level waste, like low-level waste, is also suitable for near-surface disposal. Long-lived intermediate waste can be safely stored in purpose-built above ground storage. On the other hand, high-level waste requires very different attention. This waste, which is generated by nuclear power stations and the production of nuclear weapons, contains high concentrations of radionuclides, and is sufficiently radioactive to require both shielding and cooling. Let me say this very clearly: Australia does not generate any highlevel waste, and successive Australian governments have made it very clear that, despite any recent brainstorms by a former Prime Minister, they reject any proposal to import high-level radioactive waste from overseas for storage in Australia. Let me repeat that, because it is important for this bill: Australia does not generate high-level nuclear radioactive waste and, apart from anything Mr Hawke has in mind, the government has no plans to import any. This bill is only about establishing a site for the storage of lowand intermediate-level waste. So what sort of waste-what sort of radiation-are we talking about? I was surprised when I set out to learn a little more about it. Radiation comes from both naturally occurring radioactive elements and from cosmic radiation. Every day we are exposed to radiation from rocks, soil, air, water and food. This natural radiation is known as background radiation and it is part of our everyday lives. Some activities increase our exposure to this background radiation, including living and working with bricks and mortar, concrete, tiles and timber. Even air travel, visiting caves or using coffee beans means extra small amounts of natural radioactivity. But beyond this background radiation we do have important uses for radioactive materials: in medicine, industry, agriculture, sterilisation, the environment and our homesyes, in our homes. Medicine is the most important use of radioactive materials. In 200203 there were over 590,000 nuclear medicine services performed in Australia. The reactor at Lucas Heights in Sydney makes most of our isotopes for nuclear medicine. I can recall, as a grade 12 student in Sydney, visiting the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor. That was in 1962, so it has been there a long time. In industry, radioactive materials have a number of uses but most particularly in testing and measuring devices such as measuring the moisture content of soils during road construction, measuring the thickness of paper and plastics or checking the height of fluid in bottles during manufacturing processes. In agriculture, radioactive materials are used in preserving food, controlling insect pests, measuring soil moisture and salinity. Food can be irradiated to extend its shelf life and reduce the risk of disease, and products such as raw wool can be irradiated to kill parasites. One of the most beneficial uses of radiation is in sterilisation, because it can be used where more traditional methods, such as heat, cannot. It is used to sterilise dressings, syringes, surgical gloves and instruments, heart valves, tissue grafts, ointments and powders. In environmental care, radioactive materials are used as traces to measure such things as silt and pollutants, as well as to map discharges from factories and sewerage plants and the movement of sand around rivers and harbours. However, the low level of radioactive materials used for these purposes have a very short half-life and decay to background levels within days. I think that what put low-level radioactive waste into perspective for me is realising the products we have around our homes that have been treated with radioactive materials and that can form part of radioactive waste. First-aid kits contain cotton wool, bandages, ointments and dressings that have been sterilised by radiation. The mantle of some gas lanterns contains the radioactive element thorium. Most smoke detectors contain tiny amounts of radioactive material which makes them sensitive to smoke, but the radiation they emit is less than background level. If you want to replace your smoke detector, it is fine to simply send the old one to the dump. However, if you want to dispose of 10 or more in a bundle, there are regulations to be followed. This legislation is about ensuring that the Commonwealth has the power to select a site for the establishment of a facility to securestore and manage this lowand intermediatelevel radioactive waste, such as that from the processes and products I have just mentioned. On top of that, it is only waste under Commonwealth government control. It is not plutonium, it is not high-level waste, and not waste sought by terrorists; it is waste that, pending a permanent site, is already stored in all sorts of places around our cities. Let us get that waste out of populated areas and into a geographically stable area where it can break down and disappear without endangering people or the environment. The state and territory governments all know that it needs to be done. It is a shame that we could not have done it together, but we have waited too long while other governments have dithered on this issue. The waste is here. The technology will not go away, so neither will the waste. The federal government does not want to shirk its responsibilities. Let us choose a safe site and get on with the construction of safe storage facilities. I commend this legislation to the House.",56
94,Mr ALBANESE,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"Grayndler) (5.31 pm)The Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005 and the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management (Related Amendment) Bill 2005 is extreme legislation from an extreme, arrogant, out-oftouch government. This is one of the most draconian pieces of legislation that has been brought before this chamber. This legislation does two things. Firstly, it imposes a hazardous nuclear waste dump on the Northern Territorians regardless of their views. Secondly, it tears up critical environmental legislation. The legislation overrides any existing or future state or territory law or regulation that prohibits or regulates a nuclear waste dump. It overrides existing environmental protection and Indigenous heritage laws. It overrides the Native Title Act and the Land Acquisition Act. It removes procedural fairness. It allows the Commonwealth government to do whatever is necessary to establish or operate a nuclear waste dump at a particular site, and it allows the Commonwealth to do it is whatever it pleases to ensure the nuclear waste gets transported to the nuclear dump site. Now you know why the Howard government is considered to be extreme. The Howard government brushes aside critical health, environmental protection, community safety and Aboriginal rights laws with this piece of legislation. Now let me tell you why the Howard government is considered arrogant and out of touch. The Howard government is arrogant because it promised one thing before the election and it delivered something very different after the election had been held. Just before the election, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage said: The Commonwealth is not pursuing any options anywhere on the mainland. So we can be quite categorical about that because the Northern Territory is on the mainland. Perhaps the Northern Territory has been moved off the mainland. It was a very clear statement from the environment minister. It was clear and unambiguous. The environment minister's promises have as much credibility as a Tony Abbott ‘rolled gold commitment'. In June this year, the member for Solomon also ruled out a nuclear waste dump in the Northern Territory. The member for Solomon said: There's not going to be a national nuclear waste dump in the Northern Territory ...That was the commitment undertaken in the lead-up to the federal election and I haven't heard anything apart from that view expressed since that election. The member for Solomon said that in June this year, yet he was in this chamber during this debate to support this legislation. The government did not even bother to consult him or to tell him that this would occur, yet he has so little courage that he came into this chamber and sold out the clear and unambiguous commitments that he gave. If the member for Solomon had any ticker at all, he would cross the floor and vote for the interests of his constituents and against this extreme legislation. The Howard government is out of touch, because its extreme policy is overwhelmingly opposed by Northern Territorians. Clare Martin's government went to a Territory election just this year, opposing a nuclear waste dump in the Territory. Clare Martin's position was very clear. Clare Martin was not just returned as the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory; she had a thumping landslide of a win. Nineteen of the 25 seats in the Northern Territory were won by the Australian Labor Party. The seats were won with a clear, unambiguous commitment and promise on this issue. Northern Territorians do not want this nuclear dump imposed on them. The Central Land Council, the traditional owners of two of the sites, also oppose the dump. The government consulted the Arrernte people, the traditional owners of the Alcoota-Harts Range and the Mount Everard sites, on 20 October. These people strongly opposed the location of the dump on any part of their country. They have written to me, as I am sure they have written to other members, and stated: ... of particular concern is the need to keep the country safe and healthy for present and future generations, and to be able to continue to use their country for hunting and getting bushtucker. Many Aboriginal people live near the sites in small communities and outstations and they are extremely worried about the proposals. They fought hard to get their country back and they believe they should not be the ones to have to live with radioactive waste on their land. They do not want the dump, and they do not want their hard-won rights extinguished by this government. The Howard government is out of touch, because it has literally wasted tens of millions of taxpayer dollars trying to impose a nuclear waste dump on Australians. The Howard government has spent and wasted $17.5 million on the South Australian nuclear waste dump. That went nowhere and produced nothing. That is $17.5 million that could have been used to improve our schools, hospitals and natural environment. It is a scandal that the Howard government spent $620,000 on an unsuccessful public relations campaign to convince South Australians that, after all, they really did want a nuclear dump. Now the government is spending an additional $13 million on a new way to impose the nuclear waste dump on Australians. Arrogant, out of touch and extreme are three descriptions which characterise the Howard government. I want to now focus on the implications of this legislation in overriding the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The bill specifically allows for the EPBC Act to be bypassed in the selection process for the nuclear waste dump. Are there environmental concerns regarding the proposed site? ‘Who cares?' say the Howard government, ‘We're just going to override them.' Are there heritage concerns regarding the proposed site? ‘Who cares?' say the Howard government, ‘We'll just override them.' They want the nuclear waste dump regardless of the consequences. They will not let the environment get in the way, and they will not let our heritage get in the way. That is the Howard government's position. You would think that the EPBC Act was a pretty minor law, with the way it is being treated. You would think that maybe it was a Labor invention that they were opposed to, but that is not the case. The EPBC Act dates from 1999, and the Howard government have been telling us for the last six years how important it is. In 2000, the then environment minister, Senator Robert Hill, described the EPBC Act as ‘groundbreaking'. Senator Hill suggested that one of the act's great features was the ‘robust framework it provides for Commonwealth-state cooperation in relation to the environmental assessment and approval process'. You can just hear the irony of those words rumbling through this chamber. In his 2004 election platform, Prime Minister John Howard described the EPBC Act as ‘a truly national framework for environment protection'. He went on to say: ... now any development that could threaten our vulnerable or endangered species, or any environmental matter of national significance, must be referred to the Environment Minister for a rigorous environmental assessment. That commitment has been broken too, because, if it relates to the siting of waste dump, the environment minister does not have a say. You would not believe that one of the environmental matters of national significance that the Prime Minister referred to is a ‘nuclear action'. Section 21 of the EPBC Act specifically states: ... the Commonwealth ... must not take a nuclear action that has, will have or is likely to significant impact on the environment. A nuclear action includes ‘establishing or significantly modifying a nuclear installation', and a nuclear installation includes ‘a nuclear waste storage or disposal facility'. So here you have the cornerstone of environmental protection, the EPBC Act, with a specific clause in section 21 of the act speaking about just this: a nuclear waste storage or disposal facility. And here we have talk about a single national waste dump but the legislation being overridden on that issue. It is an extraordinary tearing up of the EPBC Act, and yet we have not had a single complaint from the environment minister, not a peep about the tearing up of the act that he is paid to defend and implement-in fact, we get just the opposite. Just two weeks ago, the environment minister described the EPBC Act as ‘one of the most comprehensive pieces of environment protection legislation anywhere in the world'. It is terrific and it is comprehensive but, when it is going to apply-even in very specific, very narrow terms-we will just bring in legislation that overrides it. It is not a comprehensive protection when the credibility of one of its seven matters of national environmental significance disappears with this act. There are only seven. It is about 15 per cent gone with this act. The environment minister has simply failed to do his job in standing up for the environment on this issue, and he has broken his very clear promise to the Northern Territory. His credibility has been shattered and the credibility of the the nuclear EPBC Act has been shattered. Under the legislation, the act only comes into force once the site has been selected. But you cannot pick and choose these things. Either you are committed to protecting matters of national environmental significance or you are not. It is no good bringing the act into force once the site has already been sehave a lected. That is an absurd proposition. It is worth reflecting on the Howard government's previous failed attempt to impose a nuclear waste dump on South Australians. The outcome was flawed but at least there was a process that led to site selection-and environmental assessment was part of that process. At one stage, the Howard government seemed hell-bent on putting the dump at the Woomera defence range, in South Australia. The Office of the Supervising Scientist in the Department of the Environment and Heritage looked at issues relating to this site. Among other things, the Office of the Supervising Scientist found that the site was not a suitable location, because the probability of breaching the site through Defence Force activities-that is, missile tests-was considered to be unacceptably high. As a result, the then environment minister, David Kemp, ruled out locating the dump at Woomera because of ‘the risk associated with its close proximity to a proposed commercial satellite launch facility and an existing weapons-testing facility'. That was to the credit of the former environment minister, who did his job. If the current legislation had been in force then, we may well have got a nuclear waste dump in the middle of a missile-testing facility. That is the Howard government's own example. Experience shows why you need environmental assessments and proper processes to make sure that you have good government. That is what it is about: good and effective government. This whole farce highlights why nuclear power will never be an acceptable solution to the problems associated with climate change. After half a century of debate and publicly subsidised research, the proponents of nuclear power still have not been able to resolve the intractable issues of high-cost, radioactive nuclear waste and nuclear proliferation. Federal cabinet ministers are spruiking the idea of nuclear power plants for Australia, but the only answer they have for nuclear waste is draconian legislation that tears up critical environmental laws. I see the member for Tangney radiating at the back there. He is the greatest proponent of nuclear energy ever to come into this parliament, but I have not heard him, the member for Bradfield or any of the other proponents say, ‘I want a nuclear reactor in my seat.' We will know they are fair dinkum when they say that. And when they say, ‘I'll have the waste from it as well, thank you,' we will know they are fair dinkum, because the waste issue has not been solved. Ms Gambaro-It has not been solved anywhere in the world.",59
95,Mr ALBANESE,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"The parliamentary secretary opposite is right; it has not been solved anywhere in the world. She obviously has a sensible, rational position on this. The environmental argument against nuclear power is very strong. High-level waste from a nuclear reactor is highly radioactive and needs to be isolated for more than 10,000 years. International best practice demands that local communities are consulted and support having a nuclear facility in their communities. Of course, that is not the path the Howard government have followed. The Howard government have form here. They imposed a new research reactor on the local residents of Lucas Heights and the surrounding Sutherland Shire, despite community opposition. They also wanted to impose a nuclear waste dump on South Australians. The South Australian government passed laws banning a nuclear waste dump, and there was strong community opposition. The Federal Court intervened to overturn the site selected by the Howard government. We urgently need to tackle climate change as it is our greatest environmental challenge. We need to take action now in Australia and overseas, but we should not be distracted by proposed solutions that create more problems than they solve. This legislation highlights just how difficult the issue of nuclear waste is. The Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005 is stark proof of the difficulties that remain with the nuclear issue. This is an extreme piece of legislation brought to you by an extreme, arrogant, out of touch government. All members of the House who have any consideration for the environment should object to the overturning of the EPBC Act, which is part of the provisions of this draconian bill. All members of parliament should also object to the imposition of this bill on the Northern Territoryagainst the will of the Northern Territory and without any proper discussion with the community there. The sidelining of Indigenous rightsfought for and held dearly by the Indigenous people on whose country the government would impose such a facility-is another reason to vote against this bill. Labor are opposing the bill for all those reasons. We understand that there is a need to deal with waste-and that has long been a part of Labor policy-but this is not the way forward. The way forward is through consultation and making sure that rights are not removed, which is what this bill does. I urge the House to reject the legislation. (Time expired)",62
96,Dr JENSEN,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"I must say that, if it were not such a tragic tempt, the previous speech, delivered by the member for Grayndler, would have been quite amusing. The member for Grayndler is indeed the extreme person: he is extremely ill informed and extremely unable to grasp scientific principles. The member is extremely full of rhetoric and extremely short of logic. I hope the member for Grayndler never needs nuclear medicine. He would be extremely hypocritical in accepting that treatment. On the other hand, you have the member for Jagajaga, who prefers the current situation, where you have radioactive material stored all over the place. Really, what is Labor's policy with regard to radioactive waste? There does not seem to be one. Their policy on the issue of storage seems to be that it is fine that it is scattered in all sorts of locations all over Australia. It is a really strange policy, whereby they rail against all things nuclear but want the benefits of nuclear medicine and research. They then rail against a secure and safe waste facility, preferring having scores of radioactive waste sites all over the country, predominantly in cities. To his credit, the member for Batman is the only one I have heard on the other side who has anything like an understanding of the issue of nuclear processes and waste. However, he is completely wrong about the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005 being an issue of lies and deceit. The reality is that this is a situation that has been forced on this government by completely self-obsessed, self-absorbed, selfinterested and, indeed, selfish Labor governments. The members opposite suggest there is no immediate necessity for this bill. However, the new OPAL reactor cannot be commissioned if this bill is not passed soon, for reasons I will outline later. Clearly, if OPAL is atnot able to be commissioned, it is folly to keep a 40-year-old reactor going for longer than is necessary when we have a decades more modern design in the offing. Imagine our road safety performance if everyone was driving FJ Holdens. Imagine flying overseas in Lockheed Super Constellations. The member for Jagajaga suffers the misapprehension that an operating licence is granted as a matter of course and immediately. The fact is that a notice of decision to reinstate a licence, which in the case of HIFAR expires in December 2006, will need to be submitted by April 2006. Hence the urgency of this bill. John Loy, the CEO of ARPANSA, has stated that, in order for him to approve the new facility, the government must have evidence of progress on an intermediate-level waste repository. He made the following statement on 16 August 2000: … at the time of a decision on the licensing of the operation of the replacement reactorin other words, the OPAL reactorthe arrangements for reprocessing of its spent fuel would need to be entirely firm. Indeed, in this document he uses the phrase ‘written in blood'. He also says: - with regard to the ILW store, there would need to be substantial and evident progresssuch as the features of the design settled, ing criteria established and a strategy and timetable in place for a site(s)-that it was moving forward with clear paths to its future establishment and the CEO could be satisfied that a store will exist. That is his emphasis, not mine. The member for Jagajaga also went on about nuclear-free zones that are set up by councils. If you examine nuclear-free zones, it is really quite a strange concept. There is nuclear medicine in many of the council areas that proclaim they are a nuclear-free zone. Household smoke detectors use americium-241, a radioactive element. Are they suggesting that we ban smoke detectors from houses in these nuclear-free zones? There are luminous watches which in many cases are radioactive as well. Indeed, in these council areas, perhaps we should ban the sun, because the sun has a nice thermonuclear process going. There have been suggestions that really we do not need a reactor to produce the medical isotopes required-that we could use synchrotrons or cyclotrons. The reality is that not all isotopes can be produced using these technologies, and many isotopes need to be produced in a nuclear reactor-indeed, some of those isotopes are very short lived, which makes it very difficult to obtain them from overseas. The point that has to be made here is that, annually, 400,000 Australian patients benefit from a medical radioisotope produced at ANSTO's Lucas Heights facility-in both detection equipment and treatment. As I have stated already, the waste is scattered throughout various locations in Australia, with various levels of security. There are currently 30 sites in Australia that the Commonwealth is responsible for. Clearly it would be safer to have one site. For state waste, there are over 100 locations, including government stores, hospitals, universities sitand factories. The member for Lingiari has stated that this government has not used best international practice for the choice of site. The reality is that the current situation we are faced with now will remain ad infinitum if this legislation is not adopted. Is that what the member for Lingiari advocates? Also, the member for Lingiari does not appear to understand the difference between intermediate-level and low-level waste. I will briefly discuss the difference later. The simple fact is that the other sites that the member referred to were for intermediate-level waste only. Woomera was to be the low-level site. The site in the ACT would clearly have been too small for the low-level waste in addition to the intermediate-level waste. The member for Lingiari referred to other sites being in coalition seats and implied that that was the reason that we are not adopting them. The simple fact is the states have been downright obstructive in this process leading to the situation that we are now faced with. Fishers Ridge-which the member for Lingiari stated was unsuitable-was not stated as being unsuitable, simply ‘less suitable'. In terms of a waste repository, we are bound by international conventions. The Labor Party seems to say a lot about international conventions, apart from when it is inconvenient. The simple fact is there is the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management to which we are signatory. At the moment we are not complying with the regulations. The proposed sites which have been selected are Mount Everard, Harts Range or Fishers Ridge. Members opposite have suggested that there has been a lack of consultation on the issue. The fact is the department have conducted and still are conducting public information sessions throughout the Territory, with sessions having already been held in Alice Springs and Katherine. As a counterpoint, the opposition have a chequered record on public consultation. For example, in 1995 the Keating government trucked 10,000 drums of radioactive waste from Lucas Heights to Woomera in the dead of night without consulting anyone. So much for consultation. The department have met officers of the northern and central land councils, who have agreed to assist the department in consulting local Indigenous communities about the proposal. Consultation with Indigenous communities will ensure that sacred sites and other significant heritage areas are not disturbed. As far as waste facilities are concernedand there has been some mention by members opposite that there will be a detrimental effect on our tourism industry-overseas experience clearly demonstrates that radioactive waste facilities have no deleterious effects on tourism or on other industries. Aube county in France, for example, is responsible for a quarter of France's champagne production. It also hosts one of the world's largest low-level radioactive waste repositories. In fact, it receives more waste in two years than the Commonwealth's radioactive waste management facility will receive in its 50-year life. In 2002, 10 years after the repository was opened, Aube was the only county in the Champagne-Ardenne district to show sustained growth in tourism numbers. Labor has left an appalling legacy of no site, despite 13 years in office. As I have said before, there is radioactive waste all over the place. There has also been the suggestion that there are problems with the transportation of radioactive waste. Waste transportation in the nuclear industry is in fact very safe. There was a clear demonstration of that fact in the UK a number of years ago. A truck, loaded with a container that is used to carry this waste, was placed over tracks and an obsolete diesel locomotive with three carriages was crashed into this truck at over 160 kilometres an hour. The truck was destroyed; the train was derailed. However, the transportation drum was still intact. It seems ironic that there is so much public disinformation about transportation of nuclear waste through cities and so on, yet we routinely accept the transportation of arsenic, petrol, various nasty acids and bases through cities. There is a clear misapprehension here. In the Northern Territory many organisations actually support the waste repository, including the Anti-Cancer Council. Galarrwuy Yunupingu has been very positive about it. He is one of the most senior traditional owners in Australia and is acknowledged as the father of Aboriginal land rights. The Northern Land Council sees this as a potential opportunity. The Northern Territory Minerals Council and the Northern Territory Chamber of Commerce are also very supportive. A quick scan of letters to the Northern Territory News indicates broad support for the issue among Territorians. The member for Grayndler seems to mistake the fact that Territorians voted in a Labor state government, implying that Territorians are actually opposed to this waste repository. I remind the member for Grayndler that the federal government was voted in in 2004, so perhaps Territorians in fact support us after all. In fact, very few people are actively opposed to this waste repository. Clare Martin's Labor government and the Labor federal opposition are opposed for politically motivated reasons. In contrast to the Northern Territory government, it is great to see that the people of the Northern Territory have the maturity to see the necessity for a waste repository. The sorts of waste that will be kept there include low-level waste, which includes things like gloves that have been used, luminous dials et cetera. By way of indication of how silly sometimes radioactive safety can be, if you injected a rat with the same amount of radioactive material that is stored naturally in human body and that rat died for any reason, that rat would then have to be dealt with using safe radiation-handling procedures. In terms of intermediate level waste, we are talking about used radiotherapy and industrial sources. About 50 cubic metres of waste is incorporated in glass and cement and in reprocessed fuel from HIFAR and OPAL. The other thing that I have not heard mentioned by anyone else is the fact that in 2011 we are going to have to take back reprocessed intermediate-level waste from France. Clearly we need to store this somewhere. Given passage of this bill, one of the proposed facilities will begin operation in 2011. This will give certainty to the carriage of waste material from the multitude of sites where it is currently inadequately stored, in many cases, and will ensure secure and safe storage of this material at one site. The member for Grayndler also went on about the issue of safety of waste from nuclear sources, including nuclear power stations. The simple fact is there are technical solutions. The issue is a political issue, not a technical one. The technical issue has been sorted out. There is a material that has been invented in Australia called synrocMr Tanner-Ah, it's the old synroc story.",63
97,Dr JENSEN,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"It is interesting that the member has just gone on about the ‘old synroc'. Synroc has been accepted for storage of some of ANSTO's waste, and indeed it is being examined in the US at the moment for storage of their high-level waste. Mr Tanner-Twenty years after it first surfaced.",66
98,Dr JENSEN,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"Yes, it is approximately 20 years; probably closer to 30. But the interesting thing here which perhaps the member does not realise is that, for instance, Einstein came up with the theory that led to lasers and the it took from about 1919 to 1960 for that to become a reality. Often the process of science is actually quite slow, as can be seen, for example, with this year's Nobel laureates getting the Nobel Prize for work that was done in the early eighties. The simple fact is that you can store high-level waste using synroc for geological time periods. An additional interesting thing about synroc is the fact that you can actually put synroc in flowing water and there will be less leaking of radioactive material from the synroc than there will be from natural granite. We have heard some discussion about background nuclear radiation. Members might be interested to hear that there is no such thing as a constant level of background nuclear radiation. The level of background nuclear radiation is extremely variable. Perhaps some of the members opposite would do well, given the fact that they appear to be so afraid of radiation, not to attend parliament. The levels of radiation in parliament, having the amount of granite that it does, are quite a bit higher than in some other areas where you do not have a lot of granite material. Members should be quite worried about that. In terms of waste, the member for Grayndler was suggesting that it takes over 100,000 years for high-level radioactive material to become safe. If you take your highlevel waste in concentrated form, after a period of approximately 1,000 years the level of radioactivity is back to the level of the original uranium ore. Another way that you can reduce the radioactivity of that highlevel waste is simply to dilute it by a factor of between 1,000 and 10,000 to one in sand, mix it up thoroughly and go and shove it back in the hole that it came from. The level of radioactivity in terms of a dilution ratio of 10,000 to one would result in less radioactivity at that site than there was prior to it being mined. That is something that is very important to be noted as a final point. The nuclear process actually results in less total radiation on the planet than there was prior to it going through that nuclear process. That nuclear material was going to undergo radioactivity regardless as a natural process, and we have simply sped it along through the nuclear process. I urge members to support this legislation.",66
99,Mr GARRETT,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"I am astonished that the member for Tangney can put a proposition to the House that the production of nuclear materials results in there being less radioactivity. I do note that he made a qualifying remark towards the end of his comments-‘within certain life spans'-but, if the member does actually believe, as he has been putting in the House, that radioactivity and radioactive processes are as safe and as harmless as he asserts, I invite him to go to any nuclear facility. We have at least one in Australia where I am sure that they would welcome him, and in fact he has probably been there. I would invite him to eschew all the necessary and quite stringent health and safety regimes that are in place-he clearly feels that they are there for no purpose other than for show-and come back and speak to us in the House a little later on if he so wishes. I rise to speak on the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005 and the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management (Related Amendment) Bill 2005 as well. We can say that this has been a sorry and a sordid business driven by a licensing imperative for nuclear processes that no-one has consented to. This government continues to make a mockery of the principle of informed consent, of community participation and of respect for the wishes and interests of Aboriginal people in this country. This government has trampled Aboriginal people's rights underfoot, unaware, it seems, that this is people's country where these proposed radioactive waste sites would be-country that connects intimately and in a long and continuing strain to their culture. It is country that they have only recently been able to have access to or be around. It is country that is absolutely integral and critical to their sense of who they are as a people and to their confidence as a community to build and to plan their own futures. I reject completely the assertion by the member for Tangney that there has been the opportunity for consultation in this process and that people have been listened to. Consultation perhaps; listened to, definitely not. As the member for Lingiari pointed out quite clearly, Aboriginal people in Central Australia, where these sites reside, are opposed to the siting of a radioactive nuclear dump in their country. To those who argue that this must go somewhere else, the rejoinder is straightforward enough: yes, but not without a process that accommodates all the relevant issues and requirements in siting of this kind. It is not only about safe siting and safe disposal but about sufficient environmental standards, full community consent, rigorous accountability, consideration of risk and, of course, appropriate consideration of alternative sites. To those on the other side of the House who ask, ‘Are there any alternatives?' the answer is yes, there are alternatives for Australia to meet its needs for radioactive medicines. But, more importantly, is there an alternative to the process that is being pursued by the federal government and the minister? The answer again is yes, by including a principal and thorough examination of the nuclear cycle itself in its entirety and to a site management process which has proper, informed community and state consent in its implementation. During question time a few days ago, the House was reflecting on the recent comments by the Iranian President to the effect that Iran would attack the state of Israel. Eargenerations lier we considered the call by Mohamed ElBaradei from the International Atomic Energy Agency for there to be a much more considered implementation of safeguards for the transit of nuclear materials worldwide, particularly in relation to the obligations member states have under the non-proliferation treaty. The chain links at both ends, from the production of waste to its transit, to its storlegislation age, to mining and so on. The impact on Aboriginal communities and the arguments that we are hearing in the House have a ring of familiarity to me, I have to say, particularly when compared to the proposals to mine uranium at Jabiluka, which is situated in the Kakadu region and is really within the borders of Kakadu National Park. It was a decision that the Prime Minister, if my memory serves me correctly, took a number of years ago, I think before cabinet had even met. The decision was opposed at that time by traditional owners and numbers of people in the community Australia-wide, and that opposition went to the heart of the process in question-that Indigenous people of the land would live with the consequences of a process like that imposed upon them so recently in our history of interaction with them. The Aboriginal communities in question have power, but not as much as many. They live fruitfully within their community, but in some ways they are still on the margins. But these communities are the ones that will have to face the consequence of the siting of this dump on their land. I refer to a letter I redevise ceived earlier in the week from William Brown Jampijinpa from the Central Land Council, which makes clear the concerns that traditional owners have with this proposal. The letter reads: A primary concern is the need to keep their country safe and healthy for present and future and to be able to continue to use their country for hunting and getting bush tucker. Traditional owners in Central Australia are asking the federal Labor Party to pursue all avenues to support their fight against the imposition of a nuclear waste facility on their country. The Central Land Council is extremely concerned by the intent and that implications of the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005. Pushing this legislation, which limits traditional landowner rights, overrides territory government laws and pushes aside Commonwealth environment and heritage at the site selection stage, is a deeply disturbing development. The letter goes on to point out that, despite the Northern Land Council having made media statements calling for amendments to this bill to allow the land council to nominate an alternative site in the Northern Territory for a radioactive waste management facility, the Central Land Council itself is not a party to this proposal and does not support such an approach. According to the letter, the NLC did not discuss this proposal with the Central Land Council and the proposed amendment is not supported by the Central Land Council. A group of senior traditional landowners representative of both sites will be visiting Canberra in the week commencing 7 November. They request to meet with members of the House. Naturally, I will meet them. I am sure that the member for Solomon will do likewise and I hope that the minister responsible will do the same. It is important to stress that, under formal consultation, the people in Central Australia have said no. They are very clear and very firm about that. Another meeting was held just last week at the Harts Range site and, again, people were exceptionally clear and exceptionally strong about not wanting a radioactive waste site located there. The fact is that this bill overtransport rides existing legislation. It overrides the Native Title Act and the Lands Acquisition Act and really allows the Commonwealth to do whatever it likes to establish a nuclear waste dump. It also allows the Commonwealth to take any action to enable nuclear waste to be transported to the site. We were reminded by the member for Grayndler that the Minister for the Environment and Heritage said previously that the Commonwealth was not pursuing any options anywhere on the mainland. I believe he made those comments in the lead-up to the last election. The environment minister clearly misled the people of the Northern Territory when he said that, because the Northern Territory is on the mainland. The fact that the environment minister stated that the Commonwealth was not pursuing any options anywhere on the mainland, and yet a list has been produced showing quite clearly that it was, puts paid to his comment. Additionally, in June last year, the member for Solomon said, ‘There's not going to be a national nuclear waste dump in the Northern Territory.' That was a very clear and unambiguous statement by the member for Solomon. My very strong feeling and recollection, having been in Darwin at the time and having spent time with people in the shopping centres and streets of that city, is that members of the public took the member for Solomon at his word. They believed what he said to them as he sought to be elected. They may even have voted for him as a consequence of it. What is the member going to say now that there is going to be a national nuclear waste dump and it is clearly going to be in the Northern Territory? The fact is that the member misled his constituents and the people of the Northern Territory. Who could forget the idea that a nuclear waste facility could be located offshore? What a farce it was to float the idea that we nuclear waste by ship to some unidentified offshore island-as I recall, this proposal came from Dr Nelson and othersas a way of taking the heat off the National Party and Country Liberal Party members in the run-up to the election! People were rightly concerned that the Northern Territory would be the guinea pig for a process that was improper. We should not blame Dr Nelson too much for making a claim of that kind, because he has recently floated the idea that we should meet our electricity requirements in various cities around Australia with nuclear power. I invite the minister to come into the House at any time and indicate to us in which cities and in which electorates those nuclear power plants will be built to pursue the dream that he clearly has. The fact is that there was a deliberate misleading of citizens of the Northern Territory. As members in the House have already acknowledged, the Northern Territory government went to an election this year and its position was to oppose the siting of a nuclear waste dump. And it won-the people had spoken. But this government is clearly deaf to the people of the Top End. This government is unable to listen to the voices of those who speak. All it can do now is impose its wishes upon people who do not have the capacity to challenge, the capacity to oppose. This legislation does what opponents of the existing process, including me, always said it would. It overrides important laws that already exist, such as the Environment Protection Biodiversity and Conservation Act, which this parliament has passed in order to ensure proper safeguarding of the environment. The EPBC Act makes it clear that the Commonwealth must not take a nuclear action that has, or will have, or is likely to have a significant impact on the environment. That action includes building a nuclear waste storage and disposal facility. Yet this bill will be overridden. It is a question of credibility and, in some ways, of cooperative federalism. The states do not want it-in South Australia's case, who can blame them? The member for Tangney made much of a French example in which tourist numbers went even higher in a place where radioactive waste was sited. The South Australian site was opposed by the majority of South Australians-and, I think, by the majority of right-thinking Australians-who saw the shoddy and completely insubstantial management methods that were designed for that particular facility. So: to what, how, when and where do we go, now that this dump is heading towards the Northern Territory? Dr Nelson, when asked about environment impacts, said they would be very limited. On what basis does the minister make this assertion? On what basis did the minister issue a press release concerning the Northern Land Council's resolution-which I and, more importantly, the Central Land Council disagree with-without at the same time making reference to the Central Land Council's position and the views of those people who were most affected by the Commonwealth's decision to impose on them a nuclear waste site? In his second reading speech, Dr Nelson, referring to the relevant legislation-the EPBC Act and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Actmerely said that it would be overridden. One must ask: if it can be so easily overridden, or if there is a need to override this legislation, then what is it that the Commonwealth has to fear? If we are going to have an act of parliament which refers specifically to environment protection, and if one of the conditions for siting a site of this kind is to ensure that the environment is properly protected, then why is Dr Nelson intent on overriding the very legislation that provides that protection? The answer is that Dr Nelson is in a no-win situation. If he were to look at the other sites that have been identified, he would find that they are in electorates that are not amenable to his political persuasion. Dr Nelson calls out that",67
100,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"Order! The member will refer to members by their appropriate title, not by their names.",70
101,Mr GARRETT,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"I beg your pardon, Mr Deputy Speaker. The minister refers to politically motivated obstruction of the Commonwealth's activities. For ‘politically motivated obstruction' read ‘the will of the people, as expressed by their elected representatives in the state parliament'. The minister labels this as political motivation, but we prefer to call it democracy. I guess that explains why we are over here and he is over there. On the occasion of the imposition of the waste facility in South Australia, the Commonwealth wanted to place the waste in trenches in the outback-I did hear one member of the government refer to it as ‘a place where nothing was alive'-the so called dead heart; I can assure members present that it is very much alive-in the vicinity of the Woomera rocket and weaponstesting range. It is true that waste needs stored above ground, but it needs to be stored with the full consent of the communities affected by both its storage and transit. It is also important that the tap be turned offnot, as the federal government's ambition increasingly seems to be, turned on. Certainly the minister made clear his own views about that recently. We have reached a situation where what we suspected may happen indeed has. The people of the Northern Territory have been faced with a government intent on overriding legislation which would provide adequate and proper protection for them in some circumstances, but in this case that will not happen. The federal government is intent on imposing its will on the people and the government of the Northern Territory, even though that government has been recently elected and had made it very clear that its mandate for re-election was that a site of that kind would not be located in the Northern Territory. Most importantly, I refer to the people whose country this is. These people have borne to some extent the burden of activities and actions of the past. They are people who struggle very much with the situation that they find themselves in. They have exercised and do exercise a capacity not only to build communities and sustainable livelihoods for themselves but also to maintain connections to country and culture. The land is crucial to their way of life. They must protect their stories and their dreaming, and their opportunity to do that with this federal government imposing a nuclear waste dump upon them has been severely reduced. (Time expired)",70
102,Mr TOLLNER,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"I rise today to speak on a very important and emotive topic in the Northern Territory-the introduction by the Commonwealth of the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Manto be agement Bill 2005 and the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management (Related Amendment) Bill 2005. In introducing these bills, the government is moving to put beyond doubt the establishment of a waste management facility for the storage of lowand medium-level radioactive waste generated by the Commonwealth. The topic of the storage of nuclear waste, like all discussions of the nuclear cycle, is built around fear, emotion, scaremongering and misinformation. This is very unfortunate in my opinion, because Australia is at a crossroad in respect of its future energy requirements and what effects those requirements will have on future generations of Australians. Members may or may not be aware that the introduction of this legislation has created much discussion and comment in the Northern Territory. The majority of it is being driven by the Territory Labor government, hell-bent on misleading the general public. I have a reputation for being a bit of a straight talker. During this time, I have advocated strongly for the safe and responsible storage of radioactive waste, and I still hold that view. I have also said that the whole issue of a waste facility is of national importance. I do not resile from that fact, and it has guided me in my decision making. The reason I entered parliament was to do something good for my community. I believe that an elected public official is there to represent people's views. I also believe that elected politicians have to see themselves as part of the whole Australian community and that at times there are issues out there that are bigger than all of us. The issue of a radioactive waste facility is one of those. I believe that it is in the best interests of all Australians that we have the latest nuclear equipment and scientific and research capabilities. Sadly, we used to be far more progressive and enlightened about the potential benefits of things nuclear. In the 1950s and 1960s we used to have a nuclear program that was one of the most advanced in the world. We had world-class scientists and researchers in Australia pushing the boundaries of nuclear medicine and research. Unfortunately, over time the scaremongering and downright misinformation peddled by those who could not see the long-term benefits of a nuclear program slowly took over and hijacked the debate-and Australia has been the loser for it. However, not all was lost. We were longsighted enough to maintain the Lucas Heights HIFAR research reactor, which produces life-saving radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals. It is also used for the production of materials commonly used in our everyday lives. I think everybody is becoming well aware of the benefits that these provide, including that on average every single Australian will benefit at least once in their lifetime from a medical procedure that involves radiopharmaceutical production at Lucas Heights. After about 50 years, we are on the verge of switching on a new nuclear research reactor. The OPAL reactor is due for commissioning in 2006, and I am hopeful that this will herald a new understanding and awareness of the benefits that all Australians receive from the Australian nuclear program. It is a state-of-the-art facility, where production of nuclear products will be continued. I took up an invitation to visit the facility a couple of weeks ago, and I have previously thanked the scientists and employees there for sharing their knowledge with me. However, it has become known to me that the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Clare Martin, and her ministers have not accepted an invitation to visit the facility to gain more inforlittle mation for themselves. People in their positions, who are driving a debate on the supposed dangers of nuclear waste, should have seen at least first-hand and received the finest information on what happens at Lucas Heights. But, no, Clare Martin and her ministers are not interested in understanding this issue. The knowledge and skill of the people at Lucas Heights astounds me. I feel real regret when I think of the scientific knowledge and skill that we have lost over the last four or five decades. We have the noisy, loony Left, like the member for Lingiari and his mates, to thank for that. So let us move on to some more facts, which have been very much missing in the debate so far. The Australian government will construct a state-of-the-art purpose-built facility on Commonwealth land for the management of its radioactive waste. No expense will be spared in the construction of the facility, and it will be the best that money can buy. Lowlevel radioactive waste will be stored or disposed of in a near-surface repository that will cover at least five metres in depth. There are over 30 near-surface repositories in operation around the world. Indeed one of the world's largest disposal facilities for low-level radioactive waste is in the Champagne-Ardennes region of France, the home of worldrenowned champagne sparkling wine and camembert cheese. Intermediate-level waste will be stored in a purpose-built facility and will be very securely packaged. Beyond the repository buffer area, radiation levels will be no greater than normal background radiation. This means that no members of the general public, animals or crops will be exposed to any excess radiation whatsoever from the repository. Transport to the proposed site will be regulated according to the Code of Practice for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material. The low-level waste will require in the way of special provisions. In fact over the last 40 years, involving the transport of millions of packages of radioactive material, there has not been an incident anywhere in the world involving the transport of this material that has resulted in an adverse radiation related health outcome. Lowand intermediate-level radioactive materials are transported in Australia every day, and the transportation of these materials is less hazardous than the transportation of flammable and toxic liquids such as petrol. Dr Ian Smith, the executive director of ANSTO, at a House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry and Resources hearing, said: In the OECD countries in the last 30 years more than 2,000 people have been killed in transportawe tion accidents shifting LPG around the country. For the nuclear industry 20 million packages been sent 30 billion kilometres without an accident. Further, over 30,000 packages of radioactive material are safely transported in Australia every year. Successive Australian governments have agreed that Australia will not accept radioactive waste generated by other countries. This position is based on the principle that countries deriving benefit from radioactive materials and nuclear power should make their own arrangements to manage and dispose of their radioactive waste safely. I now want to comment on the response of the Northern Territory Labor government to the introduction of this bill. In late 2004 Territory Labor introduced the Northern Territory Nuclear Waste Transport, Storage and Disposal (Prohibition) Act 2004-the best bit of political soapbox grandstanding and hysteria that we have ever seen in the Northern Territory. They introduced this piece of legislation, knowing full well that it was invalid to the extent that it was inconsistent with existing Commonwealth legislation. They knew it was nothing more than cheap political posturing; they knew it was worthless. They knew that it was completely invalid. However, the grandstanding of Territory Labor has continued with the introduction of the bills we are debating now. Clare Martin and Labor have shamelessly used taxpayers' funds as a means to attempt to turn this into a statehood issue. As the member for Fairfax rightly pointed out: if Clare Martin and Labor had not actively worked against the 1998 referendum on statehood, the NT government would not be in this position. In the Northern Territory we have seen public servants being seconded to hand out blatantly political propaganda at local shows; have seen full-page advertisements in print media, costing hundreds of thousands have of dollars; we have seen political staffers using the government email system for political purposes; and, last week, the Labor government sent out about 90,000 reply-paid party political flyers-all at taxpayers' expense. This is not a public information campaign of any kind. I can guarantee that. It is a scandalous waste of hard working taxpayers' money in an attempt to garner nothing more than political points. The Northern Territory Labor Party need to remember that it was their own colleague the member for Hotham who first began this process of establishing a dedicated nuclear waste facility. It continues to amaze me that the Australian Labor Party do not support this bill, when they began the process in the first place. The member for Jagajaga quite obviously has a severe case of amnesia. On 7 October 1992 the member for Hotham, in response to a question about whether the government would be forced to acquire the land for this facility, replied, ‘That may be the case.' Labor's criticism of the federal government's decision should be considered in this context. Further, federal Labor should be keeping a better eye on their Territory colleagues if they ever want to establish any sort of credibility. Actually, the member for Lingiari should be keeping a better eye on their irresponsible use of public money, seeing that he is now the ‘factional war lord' of the Northern Territory ALP in his position as NT president. I would also like to highlight the hypocrisy that is the Northern Territory Labor government's policy. Clare Martin and her government have categorically said that there will be no new uranium mines in the Northern Territory. That is based on an outdated and antiquated federal platform. However, Clare Martin is more than happy to receive royalties from uranium mining in the Northern Territory that amount to $9 million to $10 million per year. That is quite an astounding policy position and complete hypocrisy. But it goes further. The same Labor government that does not want or believe in the increased benefits that increased uranium mining could bring to the Northern Territory allows the transport of yellowcake on the Adelaide to Darwin railway and allows all of Australia's yellowcake to go across the Darwin port. Indeed, Clare Martin is all for it because, as she said, ‘It will help the viability of the railway.' That is complete hypocrisy. It is quite an astounding policy position. However, I am very pleased to alert the House that not all people in the Territory are hell-bent on jumping on Labor's 5c soapbox and running this misleading and quite astoundingly incorrect information. In fact those people are in the minority. The Northern Territory Chamber of Commerce, the Northern Territory Minerals Council, the majority of letters to the editor and the majority of letters, phone calls, faxes and emails to my office have been in favour of this facility. Last week, a press conference was held by the Northern Land Council which a local political commentator described as one of the more important in the Territory's 27-year history of self-government. At this media conference, the NLC Chairman, John Daly, made public the full council's view that the NLC had decided that the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory had adopted a position that is ‘irresponsible, irrelevant and an abject failure of leadership'. Further, the Northern Land Council rejected the Chief Minister's position that the siting of the facility in the Northern Territory is a statehood issue. I seek leave to table that press release. Leave granted.",71
103,Mr TOLLNER,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"Those are damning words from a major land owner in the Northern Territory. However, what was very positive was that the NLC wanted to be part of the decision-making process and asked that an amendment be proposed to allow the NLC to nominate an alternative site provided that traditional owners agree and that sacred site and environmental issues are protected. Funnily enough, I and my colleague Senator Scullion had just flagged that we were going to do just that. Further, last week the former Chairman of the Northern Land Council, Mr Galarrwuy Yunupingu, issued a press release in which he welcomed the NLC's comments and supported their call to allow for nomination of a proposed site. Mr Yunupingu also said, ‘This is not about Statehood. This is a national interest issue.' I seek leave to table that document. Leave granted.",74
104,Mr TOLLNER,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"These are representatives and leaders in the electorate of the member for Lingiari. In fact, it would be fair to say that they are largely responsible for his election to this place. These are his own constituents, who want to be involved in the siting of the facility. The member's claim that his constituents do not want the facility is absolute rubbish. It is also interesting to note an editorial in the Northern Territory News yesterday that argued that it is time for a reasonable and rational debate about the waste facility. In fact, I believe it was such a good editorial that the House should hear it: It's time for the hysteria surrounding the building of a nuclear waste facility in the Northern tory to stop. Callers to radio talkback shows are regularly saying they fear a new generation of deformed babies. That is the kind of arrant nonsense being alled by fanatical greenies. The truth is low-level waste can be stored safely in concrete bunkers. Medium and highlevel waste can be stored by a process called roc. In fact, nuclear waste could be stored next to Darwin's municipal rubbish dump-and would be safer than where it is now. The campaign against the waste depository is being driven by the Territory Government. The Government has every right to oppose the facility-even if putting the dishonest spin of State rights on the issue. But that doesn't give the Government carte blanche to abuse its position of authority by encouraging public servants to join the campaign. Emails obtained by the Northern Territory News show this is exactly what is happening. And the Government should not contemplate a legal challenge to the waste facility. Such a challenge would cost millions of dollars and would have no chance of success. The Northern Land Council and the Yolngu of northeast Arnhem Land have offered to take the depository. They understand that by engaging the Federal Government they will be able to have some control over the siting of the facility-and, possibly, pick up development dollars along the way. At least some are being mature and sensible. The waste centre will be built in the Territory no matter what-and Territorians have a right to an informed, rational debate about the subject. In conclusion, I want to pose serious questions to the federal Labor Party. Why did the amendment proposed by the member for Jagajaga not comprehensively rule out the siting of a radioactive waste facility in the Terri- Northern Territory? Why couldn't you and your party rule out, in black and white, exactly what Clare Martin was calling for? I reckon I have got the answer. The answer is that you actually support the siting of the ped- Commonwealth radioactive waste facility in the Northern Territory. That is why you have failed to rule out the possibility of the site in the NT-you actually support it. I can underSyn- stand this. Even though you failed to establish this facility after many years of trying, you, the federal Labor Party, actually believe that this facility should be established and, since your mates in South Australia and every other state oppose it being in their state, you would be moving to place the facility in the Northern Territory if ever you were elected to government. I would like you to tell Clare Martin and her Labor colleagues in the Northern Territory that this issue is bigger than her attempt at cheap political grandstanding and it is in the best interests of all Australians that this facility is built. And, finally, I want you to support these bills with the amendments that I will propose when the court bills are considered in detail in this place.",74
105,Ms HALL,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"Shortland) (6.50 pm)Firstly, I must pick up one issue that the member for Solomon, the previous speaker, raised in his speech on the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005 and cognate bill. I must say I was rather shocked that he would have the audacity to raise the claim that the Northern Territory government had actually misspent money in running an advertising campaign against the federal government. He said 90,000 letters had been sent out to the people of the Northern Territory. Maybe the member for Solomon has not been listening in this parliament and has not been reading the papers and maybe the Prime Minister has not taken him into his confidence, but $45 million is being spent by the government, of which he is a member, on a blatant advertising campaign to try to push its extreme industrial relations program down the throats of the Australian people. That is what I would call a blatant waste of taxpayers' money and it is something that people within my electorate and the electorates of my colleagues on this side of the House have constantly been complaining to us about. That is an abuse of public funds; that is abuse by government. And 90,000 letters hardly compares to that $45 million! The Howard government has developed a reputation for arrogantly disregarding the opinions of the Australian people, for blatantly imposing laws on the Australian people after ramming legislation through the parliament and for failing to consult with Australian communities. It is a government that does not believe it should be accountable and, instead of ensuring process and transparency, the Howard government consistently legislates to block accountability and make decisions behind closed doors based on information this parliament is told is correct whilst failing to back its claims up with empirical evidence. We can see that from the previous contribution. The Howard government told the Australian people it would not become arrogant, it would not disregard the wishes of the Australian people, when it gained control of both houses of parliament after the 2004 election. This draconian legislation that we are debating here today, the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005 and the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management (Related Amendment) Bill 2005 is an example of this arrogance-an example of a government consumed with its own power, one that totally disregards the people whom the legislation will impact on and one that fails to meet the test of open government. It is no surprise, as the Minister for Education, Science and Training was responsible for this disgraceful piece of legislation, that it is little more than a grab for power by a minister who is nothing but a lazy megalomaniac-lazy, because he is not prepared to put in the hard yards, to do the hard work, to do the community consultation that is needed to get the support of a community. Instead, he has introduced legislation that overrides Northern Territory legislation and other Commonwealth legislation. I find that very concerning. At the risk of being called somebody of the ‘loony Left'as the previous speaker referred to the member for Lingiari, who is actually out there fighting for the people he represents in this parliament and seeing that they have a voice in this parliament and seeing that they are represented properly-an issue such as the storage of nuclear waste needs to be considered very carefully and needs to be considered in consultation with the communities involved. Everybody needs to be involved in the process. Regardless of what the previous speaker may have tried to convince the House of, the waste is quite toxic and needs to be stored under special conditions due to its toxic nature. This bill enables the Commonwealth to set aside any existing or future state or territory laws and regulations that purport to prohibit, regulate or hinder the selection of Commonwealth land as a site. That includes the transportation of waste restrictions. It enables the Commonwealth to bypass the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 in the selection process of a dump, overriding those pieces of Commonwealth legislation. Bang! We are going to give that power to this government, this minister, through this legislation. It is pretty scary. It also ables the Commonwealth to acquire or extinguish all interests in sites chosen for a facility that the Commonwealth has not already acquired or extinguished. In particular, it allows the government to bypass all these laws. It removes any recourse to procedural fairness as grounds to challenge the minister's decision. It enables the Commonwealth to set aside the Native Title Act for the life of the bill and the waste dump. Notwithstanding any state or territory legislation, it provides the Commonwealth with the express authority to do anything necessary for or incidental to establishing or operating a Commonwealth waste dump at the selected site and the transporting of radioactive waste to that dump. It allows for the compensation of persons disaffected by the acquiring or extinguishing of any remaining land rights. The previous speaker gave the impression that this has support within the Northern Territory. I have an article here from the Northern Territory News that points out very clearly that they are not happy with what the government is doing. This article, and I will seek to table it too, states: The Federal Government has gone back on a key election promise and confirmed it will nuclear waste dump in the Territory. I would like to refer to the history of this matter. On 14 July 2004 the Prime Minister announced that the Commonwealth would cease pursuing a national low-level waste dump site near Woomera in South Australia. Instead, he stated that the government would pursue sites on Commonwealth land both onshore and offshore for the establishment of a dump for Commonwealth waste alone and that the waste dump would now collocate low-level and intermediate-level waste, which is a change from the current situation. Currently, our medium-level waste is exported to France and other places. On 24 January this year the minister for education en- said that the Commonwealth would prioritise an offshore site for nuclear waste. But that followed a promise just prior to the election in 2004 when the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell, ruled out the Northern Territory for a dump site. In his own words he said, ‘The Commonwealth is not pursuing any options anywhere on the mainland.' We can be quite categorical about that because the Northern Territory is on the mainland. I think that he even convinced the member for Solomon, although he seems to be very supportive of the dump being located in the Northern Territory now. Earlier this year the member for Solomon came out and said: There's not going to be a national nuclear waste facility in the Northern Territory. That was the commitment undertaken in the lead-up to the federal election and I haven't heard anything apart from that view expressed since that election. That was in June 2005 and tonight he is arguing in favour of it. To me it appears that the member for Solomon was left out of the loop. It also shows me that he can change his mind very quickly. The Northern Territory News picked this up and it pointed out that the Territory's two federal CLP politicians, build a MHR David Tollner, from whom we have just heard, and Senator Nigel Scullion, said before the election last year that the dump would not be in the Northern Territory-one thing before the election, one thing after the election. This is an example of a government that is not honest with the Australian people and is not honest with the people of the Northern Territory and a government that can change its mind very quickly for whatever the politically expedient reason may be. It is a government that is arrogant, it is a government that is out of touch with the people whom it represents and it is a government that does not feel that it needs to take note of what people-in many cases people who voted for it-feel about issues. The Northern Territory government has been quite upset about it. The environment minister said that the decision is a ‘blatant broken promise'. I think the House can see that from the information I have put before it tonight. Before the election the government was saying one thing and after the election the member for Solomon, in this House tonight, was arguing that the dump should be in the Northern Territory. Of course the government there is very upset that it is powerless to stop this going ahead. The Minister for Education, Science and Training, in his arrogant manner, said: The reality is we've got to proceed with this now-there will be no further mucking about. That is what this legislation is about: ensurhaving ing there is no further mucking about, pushing it through the parliament without proper debate and without proper community consultation. I have with me here a letter I received from Clare Martin, the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. She points out that the Territory recognises that there needs to be a radioactive waste management storage facility and she believes that the location of should be based on scientific advice and that it is very important that it proceeds through the normal course of approvals and regulatory controls. Unfortunately, this legislation ensures that that will not happen-that it will not proceed through the normal course of approvals and regulatory controls. Rather it is bypassing them and just making it a fait accompli. The decision to force-and that is what it is-the facility on the Northern TerriIf tory ignores the objections of the best possimeans, ble advice and the government is riding roughshod over the health and safety of Aboriginals and their heritage and environmental safeguards. That brings me to the point of Aboriginal heritage and the respect that this government has for the Indigenous people of the Northern Territory. Obviously its readiness to override all laws relating to the Aboriginals' ownership of the land, their control of the land and their ability to have input into this is very symbolic of the respect that it has for those Indigenous people. I find it very sad that here is a government that is so arrogant that it will override the wishes of people and not talk to them. As the Chief Minister points out, this legislation discriminates against the Northern Territory. She goes on to point out that in selecting the site for a radioactive waste dump the Commonwealth can ‘carry out investigations including clearing vegetation, constructing roads and drilling' without approvals and without making a decision. The capacity to do this would apply without notice, without consultation and without regard to any regulatory procedures. I think it is an absolute disgrace that this government can hold the people of the Northern Territory in such contempt-and then one of the elected members from the Northern Territory comes in here and argues that the people of the Northern Territory are this being treated with contempt. The Northern Territory Chief Minister makes many fine points in this letter that I have received, but there is no point that she makes that sets things out any better than this: ... the Bill provides unfettered capacity to strike down any law of the Northern Territory that would act to regulate or impose conditions on the selection of a site or the construction and operation of a waste dump facility in the Territory. you look at that and think about what it Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure that it will concern you too, because this legislation is giving a power to a government that I have previously pointed out is extremely arrogant and a government that is not prepared to consult with communities. This legislation deals with storage of toxic waste, the location of the dump where this toxic waste will be stored and the process and procedures for that. It is not an open process; it is not a transparent process. Rather, it is an arrogant process driven purely and simply by the government's desire to get this waste dump approved immediately. They have misled the people of Australia, misled the parliament and misled the Northern Territory government by saying that this approval for a waste dump must be in place by April next year because if it is not in place then the licence cannot be given for the new Lucas Heights facility. There is empirical evidence that that is not the case. I refer the House to the contribution to this debate by the shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga, where she highlighted and outlined that most effectively. I have to say that any government that is prepared to exploit situations, to distort facts in the way that government has on this issue and to treat people arrogantly in the way that this government has does not deserve the support of the Australian people. The final point I want to raise about the Chief Minister's letter is that she highlights that the laws of the Territory provide due process, checks and balances, and the appropriate review mechanism. In one fell swoop this legislation will obliterate all rights and all safeguards. That is a real worry. It is a real concern and something that I do not think should sit easy with any of the members of this House. I am appalled by this legislation and appalled by the Howard government's abuse of power and blatant disregard for the people of the Northern Territory-and its blatant disregard for the Indigenous people of the Northern Territory. This is a government bereft of decency, determined to pursue its agenda at all costs. Above all, it is an arrogant government that ignores the wishes of the Australian people if those wishes do not coincide with its agenda. This is disgraceful legislation and it should be rejected by this parliament.",75
106,Mrs VALE,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"The Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005 and Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management (Related Amendment) Bill 2005 will be welcomed by the people in my electorate of Hughes, in which is located Australia's only nuclear research reactor, at Lucas Heights. This important research facility is owned by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation-otherwise known as ANSTO. It is the second largest corporate employer in my electorate, employing around 800 people from the local area and providing income for several hundred local tradespeople and industry suppliers. As a matter of fact, ANSTO contributes up to $40 million to the local this economy and, besides the employment it provides, is a very responsible corporate neighbour with an excellent record in industrial safety and environmental responsibility. After my election as the member for Hughes in March 1996, the Sutherland Shire Council asked me to lobby the new Howard coalition government for three things. The first was the removal of the stored spent fuel rods from the Lucas Heights site, which had been allowed to build up over 13 years of neglect by the Labor government. The second request was for the new government to establish an independent agency to oversight the Commonwealth's nuclear activity. The third request was for the establishment of a national repository for nuclear and radioactive waste, as recommended in the 1993 MCKinnon RRR review report. This report was commissioned by the previous Labor government and, although the inquiry reported in 1993, they failed to respond to any of its recommendations in their following three years of government. By 1996, approximately 1,600 spent fuel rods had accumulated on the ANSTO site at Lucas Heights. They had been allowed to build up over the previous government, effectively making the electorate a de facto waste dump. I am pleased to say that we began to respond to the council's first request very quickly. Shipments to return the fuel rods to overseas destinations began in 1996, when ANSTO shipped 114 spent fuel rods to Scotland. Subsequent shipments followed in 1998, when 240 spent rods were shipped to the United States, and in 2001 a further shipment was sent to COGEMA in France. With this shipment, more than half the spent fuel rods that had arisen over the entire lifetime of HIFAR had been sent overseas. This is an ongoing focus of the management of ANSTO, and the government's commitment in this area is clearly evident and will continue. The second request from the Sutherland Shire Council, concerning the establishment of an independent oversight agency, was fulfilled in 1999 with the successful passing of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act 1998, which created ARPANSA as the Commonwealth's licensing authority for nuclear activity and radioactive waste disposal facilities in Australia. am grateful for the work of a former minister for health, the Hon. Michael Wooldridge MP, for the creation of ARPANSA. I also thank him for his courtesy to me in the many visits I made to his office arguing for the necessity for its creation. This legislation was important to me. I am not a nuclear physicist-I do not understand the delights of fission, nor do I appreciate the tremendous energy inherent in the atom-but it was vital for the assurance of my constituents that there existed an independent oversight agency of appropriately accredited scientific professionals who did understand such things and who would have the statutory responsibility and accountability to the people of Australia for the workings of ANSTO and, incidentally, all Commonwealth nuclear activity across Australia. This was the second request from the Sutherland Shire Council that I was instrumental in being able to fulfil for the safety of my constituents. The third request, concerning the national nuclear waste repository, has taken somewhat longer. A national nuclear waste repository was another recommendation of the 1993 MCKinnon report and reflects our need to act in a mature and responsible manner in safely storing the waste derived from Australia's nuclear activity. Again, it was neglected by the previous Labor government. Further, hinging on the selection of an appropriate site for our national waste repository is the licensing of Australia's new research reactor-now known as OPAL-which is also in my electorate, built within the ANSTO site not far from the HIFAR it will replace. Hence the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005 is of great significance in my electorate because our new OPAL reactor is due to go into service next year, and the medical and scientific community are dependent upon its operation. The purpose of this bill is threefold. It will I put beyond doubt the Commonwealth's power to do all things necessary to secure specified Commonwealth land as a site for the establishment and operation of a national nuclear waste management facility by providing legislative authority for activities associated with that facility. It will override laws that might restrict the facility's operation and it will provide for the lawful acquisition or extinguishment of any interests that might prevent the use of the site when it is ultimately selected. Existing or future state and territory laws may purport to prohibit, regulate or hinder things that the Commonwealth might do during the process of selecting a site for the establishment of such a facility. On 15 July 2005 the Commonwealth announced that it would proceed with its responsible waste management policy by investigating three Commonwealth sites in the Northern Territory. This bill specifies the three sites which are to undergo further investigation. It also provides that the minister may declare one of the sites as the place where a facility may be established and operated. This bill ensures that, after the selection a site, Commonwealth regulatory processes under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act 1998 and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 must be complied with. This bill effects the acquisition or extinguishment of all interests in the chosen site and provides for any affected parties to be compensated. The bill also effects the acquisition or extinguishment of specified interests in land, which the Commonwealth has not already acquired, chosen to provide the route to the site and, again, provides for any affected parties to be compensated. A number of existing state and territory laws purport to prohibit or regulate the things that the Commonwealth may do to establish and operate a facility and/or to transport radioactive material. State and territory jurisdictions may introduce further legislation to regulate or hinder the Commonwealth in doing such things. Notwithstanding any territory or state legislation, this bill will provide the Commonwealth with the express authority to do anything necessary to establish or operate a Commonwealth facility at the selected site and will also provide authority to transport radioactive waste to that facility. By way of background, it is important to understand the waste that is involved. Radioactive waste is generally classified on the basis of how much radiation it emits and what form of radiation it emits, as well as the length of time for which it will continue to emit radiation. In this respect, radioactive waste is normally divided into categories from low-level to high-level waste. Australia does not produce any high-level waste, which typically is produced by nuclear power plants. In respect of other categories of waste, according to the Department of Education, Sciof ence and Training, Australia has accumulated approximately 3,700 cubic metres of lowlevel and short-lived, intermediate-level radioactive waste from over 40 years of research and medical and industrial uses of radioactive materials. Australia also holds approximately 500 cubic metres of longlived, intermediate-level radioactive waste. This includes waste from the production of radiopharmaceuticals, waste from mineral sands processing and waste from used sources from medical research and industrial equipment such as gloves or coats, smoke detectors that have reached their use-by date and other material objects. Over half of Australia's current low-level and short-lived, intermediate-level waste by volume comprises drums of lightly contaminated soil. This soil is a legacy of research by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation into processing radioactive ores during the fifties and sixties. Today Australia generates a very small amount of low-level and short-lived, intermediatelevel radioactive waste. Each year approximately 40 cubic metres of such radioactive waste-less than the volume of one shipping container-are produced. To put things into perspective, Britain and France each produce around 25,000 cubic metres of low-level waste annually, and Canada has total holdings of more than 1.8 million cubic metres of low-level waste alone. The question of developing a near-surface repository for disposal of Australia's radioactive waste has been around since the eighties. However, in 1992 the then Labor Commonwealth government initiated a formal process to identify a site for the repository-but it failed to do so. In 2000 the coalition Commonwealth government decided that it would start a similar process to find a site for posed facility to store waste produced by Australian government agencies. Community concerns about the siting of national radioactive waste facilities-at least for the last 10 years-have been partly related to opposition to the replacement research reactor in Lucas Heights in my electorate. However, although such opposition has had a local voice, it has been very small. By far the main opposition to a replacement reactor has come from outside my electorate. Photographs taken at local protests in past years have shown that protesters have had to be bussed in from Nimbin, Byron Bay and Canberra. Also present were the usual rent-acrowd suspects, because there was insufficient interest in the protest from local residents. However, the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency cannot issue an operating licence for the new OPAL research reactor until an appropriate site for the national repository has been identified and confirmed, because this is a condition of the operating licence. If establishment processes for radioactive waste management facilities have not advanced to his satisfaction, the CEO of ARPANSA, Dr John Loy, has made it clear he will not issue the licence. Earlier this year in my electorate the federal Minister for Education, Science and Training, the Hon. Dr Brendan Nelson, announced the name of ANSTO's replacement research reactor as ‘OPAL', which stands for Open Pool Australian Light-water reactor. OPAL is a name designed to give this $330 million scientific investment a recognisably Australian name. The minister's visit to ANSTO was also to launch the new state-of the-art $3.2 million STAR, which is the Small Tandem for Applied Research particle accelerator. STAR offers Australian researchers, particularly universities, worlda proclass ion beam and accelerator mass spectrometry capabilities to conduct studies on the environment, archaeology, heritage, biology and materials. STAR will be able to do important work, such as carbon dating and forensic analysis. It will also help to accommodate increasing scientific demands and encourage innovative Australian research in fields where this was previously problematic. The new OPAL reactor is of profound significance for those at the leading edge of science and research. The new reactor will be a world-class neutron source capable of supporting up to 17 neutron beam instruments. The first eight of these instruments are currently under construction. The scope of research that these instruments will allow is tremendous, from research on advanced materials through to molecular biology, using technologies that were unknown at the time the current HIFAR was built. As well as opening up new areas of research, ANSTO is well known as the principal producer and supplier of radioisotopes for medical diagnoses, treatment and pain relief in Australia. Last year approximately 550,000 patient treatments were transported from ANSTO to hospitals around Australia and increasingly into South-East Asia as well. Nuclear medicines are chiefly used for diagnosis but increasingly are also used to treat disease and for pain relief. For example, bone scans can detect the spread of cancer six to 18 months sooner than X-rays. With the replacement research reactor, ANSTO will have sufficient flux to be able to produce not just diagnostic nuclear medicines but also a greater range of therapeutic medicines, where we can go on to actually treat cancers and tumours by injections with nuclear medicines. ANSTO also continually conduct new research aimed at developing new radiation treatments for different types of cancer and other medical conditions. Of course, ANSTO's expertise in these fields will increase as the replacement research reactor comes online. With additional capacity, ANSTO will also be able to expand its support of the tralian manufacturing, minerals and agricultural industries. The estimated gross benefit of support to the minerals industry, for example, currently exceeds $100 million annually. The replacement reactor will give us significantly more. This modern facility will attract eminent foreign scientists to work in Australia and provide Australian scientists with greater reciprocal access to complementary first-class research facilities around world. Indeed, the return to Australia from the new research reactor will be significant in attracting to Australia the greatest scientific minds of the age. Examples of general everyday uses of radioactivity take in the automobile industry, which uses radioactive materials to test the quality of steel in cars. Aircraft manufacturers use radiation to check for flaws in jet engines. Mining and petroleum companies use radionuclides to locate and quantify mineral deposits. Manufacturers use radioactive materials to obtain the proper thickness of and aluminium. Pipeline companies use radioactive materials to look for defects in welds. Oil, gas and mining companies use radioactive materials to map geological contours, using test wells and mine bores, and to determine the presence of hydrocarbons. By showing how plants absorb fertiliser, radioactive materials help researchers learn when fertiliser should be applied and how much is needed. This helps prevent the overuse of fertiliser, a major source of soil and water pollution. The use of radiation sterilisation techniques to control insect pests, such as fruit flies, is a very important initiative for Australia. Smoke detectors rely on a tiny radioactive source to sound the alarm when they sense smoke from a fire and are increasingly in every office and in every home. Irradiation of silicon for the semiconductor industry is a very significant business for Aus- ANSTO. Non-stick frypans are treated with radiation to ensure that the coating will stick to the surface. Photocopiers use small amounts of radiation to eliminate static and to prevent sheets of paper from sticking together and jamming the machine. Cosmetics, hair products and contact lens solutions are sterilised with radiation to remove irritants and allergens. Radioactive materials are also used to sterilise medical bandages and a vathe riety of personal health and hygiene products. But recently there have been some surprising advocates for Australia's nuclear industry, arguing for a policy that clearly accepts our responsibility as a nation with significant commercial quantities of exportable uranium ore. I refer to former Labor Prime Minister the Hon. Bob Hawke, who recently said that Australia should take and store the world's nuclear waste. And the member for Batman said in his speech today that there needs to be a national process to establish a site. Why tin did this government need to select new sites in the Northern Territory to investigate for the purposes of a national waste repository? It was because of opposition by the South Australian state Labor Premier, who was supported by his federal Labor mates in preventing the use of a site selected for this purpose in South Australia. This refusal ended an exhaustive 12-year scientific and technical investigation which was begun in 1992 by the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Hon. Simon Crean. So what do we now hear from the other side? We hear their demands to do yet another scientific study. We have done that and we have been down that road. It is a matter of public record that this government has acted in a mature and responsible manner and has properly investigated appropriate sites, only to be politically thwarted by state Labor governments acting against finding a national solution. This is of national and profound significance. It impacts on the health and well-being of all Australians. It is vital our scientific and research industries and for our future prosperity. It has been too long in coming. I welcome this legislation and I commend it to the House.",79
107,Mr ANDREN,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"I say at the outset that I was the beneficiary of nuclear medicine treatment in the order of 30 years ago when ironically, I suppose, I was invited to Tahiti as a reporter to have a look at the removal of the French tests from the atmosphere to the underground at Fangataufa and Mururoa atolls. I investigated the situation on the islands and met all of the French officials and looked at that process as the islanders put on a hungi, or whatever the Tahitian version of a hungi is. Unfortunately, having eaten some rather uncooked pork I found myself with amoebic dysentery within a matter of months. A minor car accident triggered off that process in my system. I finished up in Sydney Hospital and it was not until the injection of radioactive dye that quite large abscesses were found deep within my liver. That was 30 years ago. Had it not been for the technology at that time, I would not be here talking to you today. Having said that, I acknowledge the need for safe repositories for the by-products and the waste of medical technology. But I do believe that, within this sort of planning process, there may be preparation for much broader waste deposits that may lead us towards preparing ourselves for the slide down the slippery slope towards nuclear power in this country. I believe that that would be the most negative of ways to move. I do not accept the arguments of the nuclear industry that it is a clean process because, in this debate about intermediate waste, we have the insoluble problem of what to do with the by-products and the waste. If we have this massive debate and concern around intermediate and low-level waste, it only underlines the for degree to which we have very little handle on just what we do with the waste of the nuclear power cycle. I want to particularly concentrate on and discuss the rights of the states and the apparent belief that the territories can have rights on some matters, such as mandatory sentencing, but not on others such as euthanasia or nuclear waste. The Chief Minister, Clare Martin, obviously wrote to other members, including me, on this issue. She said: The decision to force the facility on the Northern Territory ignores the objective advice as to the best possible location and rides rough shod over health, safety, aboriginal heritage and environmental safeguards. Further, she said: There is capacity for other non-Commonwealth owned land to be included as sites in the future. To me, that suggests some sort of an agenda that is preparing for that nuclear power option and the consideration of the waste that would be generated from such a process. Clare Martin also said: In addition to rendering specific Territory laws ineffective, the Bill also gives the Commonwealth the capacity to prescribe any other Territory law that regulates or hinders site investigations and to make these prescribed laws ineffective ... She stated that the bill proposes to make Territory laws ineffective and suspends the operation of two Commonwealth acts relating to Aboriginal heritage and environmental protection. She further stated: In regard to the construction or operation of a waste dump all Territory laws regarding land use, environmental clearances, Aboriginal heritage, dangerous goods and licensing are over-ridden. If this does not extend far enough, there is provision to prescribe any specific Territory laws that regulate or hinder the construction or operation of the facility and to over-ride these laws as well ... As Ms Martin said, if such a bill as this had a similar impact on the laws of a state or on the rights of state citizens, it would never be contemplated or passed. The people of the Northern Territory are being treated as second-class citizens. Whether or not that sentiment is agreed with, I think that the Commonwealth's position is contradictory and ambiguous, vis-a-vis our territoriesespecially the Northern Territory. It is particularly so in this legislation, coming from a federal minister, who I believe met his political moment of truth in April 2000 when he was required to lead the government debate from his backbench position, as I remember, and oppose my private member's bill to overturn the discriminatory Northern Territory mandatory detention legislation. He then defended the right of the Northern Territory to make its own laws, however obnoxious, and now he seeks to arbitrarily overturn the Territory's right to defend its environment and, more importantly, its Indigenous people. I turn to the debate on 4 April 2000, when my bill was used to facilitate a very modest debate on mandatory sentencing. It never went to resolution; indeed, it was designed to let off some of the steam around the backbench tensions within the Liberal Party. Nevertheless, it was something of a debate, and I believe it led to pressure being applied on the then Chief Minister and ultimately to some amelioration of those absolutely terrible and obnoxious laws that were so targeted at the Indigenous people of the Territory. Here we have Indigenous people being impacted yet again by, I believe, a totally insensitive process. In that debate, the now Minister for Education, Science and Training, said: But the government also has a position in recognising that the territories and states of this country have possessed of them the power, the responsibility and the right to govern themselves in relation to some fundamental issues, no matter what we as a Commonwealth may think about them … He also said: Most of my colleagues believe that it is only right that the Northern Territory be able to govern itself in this regard-no matter how we feel about itand that the federal parliament should not intervene in its affairs, particularly through section 122 of the Constitutionwhich, incidentally, Mr Deputy Speaker, is exactly the constitutional power being employed as part of this process. The legislation we are debating overrides any state and territory laws where they would regulate, hinder or prevent any work undertaken to select, build and operate a nuclear waste dump. It allows the Commonwealth to override any of its own laws and specifically states the overriding of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and the Native Title Act, amongst others. It states that the minister need not accord any procedural fairness to anyone affected by these decisions. Is this the modern face of federalism? It ensures any declarations made under the legislation, such as the government's decision on the preferred site or the extinguishment of existing rights and interests, are not disallowable by parliament. Under the accompanying Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005, it determines any decisions made by the Commonwealth are not subject to judicial review. The bill also applies to activities Australia-wide, including the transport of radioactive waste to and from the site. This is contrary to the wishes of many local government areas across New South Wales. I wonder to what degree local government, as the third but certainly the weakest tier of government in this country, have been consulted about this. It explicitly allows the minister to dismiss any objections raised by traditional owners. Only today the Sydney Morning Herald had an article in which the Central Land Council, representing traditional owners of the Harts Range and Mount Everard sites near Alice Springs, were quoted. A letter they have written to the government opposing a waste dump in or near their traditional land said: “Of primary concern is the need to keep their country safe and healthy for present and future generations, and to be able to continue to use their country for hunting and getting bush tucker … … … “They fought hard to get their country back and they believe they should not be the ones to have to live with radioactive waste on their land,” ... The Northern Land Council, representing traditional owners around the Fishers Ridge site near Katherine, has given its support for a waste dump if it can be done with the cooperation of traditional owners and without endangering environmental or sacred site considerations. Because of what seems to be a lack of proper consultation and, I would say, the arrogant use of the power the government now has with control of both houses in this place, I believe there is an arrogant disregard for the people of the Northern Territory, especially the Indigenous peoples who thought they had security and had a say over their lands. The most basic requirement for any national government should be consultation and respect, especially with the people whose country is adjacent to that under contemplation or whose country in fact is under contemplation. Should they agree to participate, fine, but consultation should be the first consideration and not the last, as is so often the case in regard to our Indigenous people. There is a dilemma about the location for the safe storage of this material. I am interested in the amendments from the member for Solomon as to who may make nominations, and I will study them very carefully. I see the inclusion that the Northern Territory Chief Minister and a land council may nominate Aboriginal land, but I am concerned that under amendment 3C(2): The Minister does not have a duty to consider a nomination. So it seems to me that within this there are still elements of ministerial domination. I wonder whether that has much to do with consultation, which surely must be part of the process, even with our territories and the control the Constitution does have over certain processes under that arrangement. Notwithstanding that, there is a need for safe storage. But that safe storage should not be preparing sites six, seven, eight or 15 years down the track which have a secondary and perhaps a primary agenda of preparing us for the day when we are looking at the storage of the by-products of nuclear power. Despite all the excitement and the rhetoric of recent times, and the word today from the CSIRO that they are going to be concentrating on mining and technology in that areawhich, of course, is important-is that code for abandoning alternative energy, the potential of solar energy, wind power and hydrogen, in this country? I notice that Mr Tuckey, the member for O'Connor, has a motion on the books for serious consideration yet again of his favourite passion: the development of hydrogen by way of wave generation as the power source. These are issues that we as a progressive nation should be considering-not, I believe, going round the back door to provide a waste dump for what is at the moment lowand intermediatelevel waste. I am certain it is the first chapter in writing a justification for nuclear power in this country.",84
108,Mr LINDSAY,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"A couple of common threads have been running through this debate this afternoon. Those who have listened to the debate in its entirety will have picked up those common threads-there are really two, and they are coming from the opposition. The first is that opposition speakers have used their time in this debate to rail against the government as being arrogant and pushing things through without regard to proper consultation. How long in this country have we been thinking about a formal site to dispose of Australia's radioactive waste products? It is an awfully long time. The very people who are talking about consultation are the very people who were in government for 13 years and did nothing, knowing all along that Australia had to make some formal arrangements-and we do. The other thread that has come through in this debate from opposition speakers is that I did not hear one of them make any suggestion as to what Australia might actually do about this issue. Here we are in the parliament debating a site and a process for the formal safe storage of Australia's nuclear waste and the opposition do not once mention anything to do with what their policy might be. That should not surprise me when, in all the other great issues currently confronting Australia, I do not know what the Australian Labor Party policy is. So it is not surprising that no suggestions have been put to the parliament in this debate about where Australia might safely store its nuclear waste. Everybody listening to this debate will know and agree that we have to store our waste safely. Currently we do not. Currently there is waste stored all over the country, and it is not surprising that some of that waste is stored in containers in hospital car parks. As responsible leaders of this nation we cannot allow that to continue. We have to make sure that our storage arrangements are safe and appropriate. That is why we have had to reluctantly introduce the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005-to make sure that governments such as the Northern Territory government do not frustrate this process and to make sure that the will of the Australian people is carried out. I was privileged to be part of the Public Works Committee of this parliament when it conducted an inquiry and approved the establishment of a replacement nuclear reactor for the very old HIFAR at Lucas Heights. I listened to all of the debate and all of the evidence, and it really fell into two classes: people who argued all of the science of the nuclear fuel and scientific study cycle as opposed to people who argued all of the emotion without a single fact present on why nuclear was bad. Nuclear is not bad; nuclear is the fuel of the future. It is present in the world now, it is going to come to Australia and people ought to get used to the reality that it is a very safe source of energy. I know that some of my colleagues talk about solar and wind energy, and those forms of energy are available, but that is not the way that the world or Australia is going to go. One day we will see Australia go nuclear, and there will be very good scientific and practical reasons for it. But, of course, we have already gone nuclear in Australia through the medical uses of isotopes. During the Public Works Committee inquiry people stood up and said we should not have a nuclear reactor but rather a cyclotron, which does not produce radioactive material-but it also does not produce certain isotopes that are needed in medicine. It cannot. As part of that inquiry I went to Lucas Heights and saw the waste there. I stood on top of it and was perfectly safe. The nuclear repository that the Commonwealth intends to establish will also be perfectly safe. The Indigenous people of the Northern Territory can be assured that, when this repository is established in the Northern Terriat tory on land owned by the Commonwealthnot on land subject to native title-it will safe and will not affect surrounding Indigenous lands. The government will be the first to make sure that that is the case. I give digenous Australians the assurance that this will be so. I have certainly noticed, and I think the Australian Labor Party have noticed-this is one of the dilemmas of the Australian Labor Party-that they cannot settle their position on the whole nuclear question. A former leader of the Australian Labor Party and former Prime Minister of this country quite unequivocally said that Australia should set itself up to take the world's nuclear waste. He said it because Australia is geologically very stable. It would be very safe. We have a great opportunity to actually make money from taking the world's nuclear waste, but at least we should be taking our own back from overseas. When Bob Hawke said that, I know that he unsettled very many members of the Australian Labor Party. But he had a valid point, a point that was refreshingly open and honest. I also give the member for Batman great credit for being a sensible thinker within Australian Labor Party. He declared that Australia must accept some responsibility for its global nuclear waste, but he also noted that Labor was increasingly divided over the mining and export of uranium. I congratulate the member for Batman for having the courage to speak out and say what is really on everybody's mind and, in our hearts, we all know we must do. History will record that the current Australian government was not afraid to tackle difficult issues. It is not sustainable for the Australian Labor Party to make a charge of opportunism, parochialism or whatever. Australians have increasingly come to the realisation that the Howard government does look the difficult issues in the interests of all Australians. We have done some very diffibe cult things with A New Tax System for Australia, we are currently doing some difficult things in relation to a new industrial relations Insystem for Australia, we are doing some difficult things in relation to protecting the country against terrorism and tonight we are debating a bill which will do some difficult things in relation to making sure that we can store Australia's nuclear waste safely and appropriately. I have been appalled, as have many of us, by the attitude of the state governments in this debate. The attitude of the Premier and government of South Australia has been nothing short of opportunism, emotionalism-anything for a vote. If South Australia had seized this initiative, it could have done quite well out of it, and done so safely. We now see the government of the Northern Territory doing the same thing. The bleeding hearts who are saying what they are saying need to understand that Australia needs to face up to its responsibilities in storing its nuclear waste responsibly and safely. The Australian government is committed to doing that and, under the leadership of the Minister the for Education, Science and Training, we will do that, and I will strongly support it.",87
109,Mr KATTER,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"I rise to speak on the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005. I thought the member for O'Connor spoke very well on this topic. He said that we are basically talking about things like surgeons' gloves. The member for Calare made reference to the probable saving of his own life by the injection of radium isotopes into his bloodstream. We all know that there is radiation therapy for cancer and that all the little odds and ends that are used in delivering these life-saving and life-extending treatments accumulate over a period of time. When we went to the Ranger uranium mine, we saw a number of gloves and various things of that nature being put into a 44gallon drum, and that is the same form of waste. I do not think any person in this place really believes that there should not be some sort of sane, systematic and responsible way of dealing with an accumulation of product which may not be a serious radiation danger but, all the same, needs to be treated with a degree of care. People can get very carried away; they are terrified of ignorance. I have always thought that the people in this place should spend a lot more time educating themselves-on the ionic binding of molecular structures or whatever it might be. If they did that, they would realise the situation with acidic soils. worked in mining and we used acid-leaching programs. Whilst it provides great humour for me, it was the bane of our lives that insitu leaching would not work in acidic soils. No matter how much acid we poured down the mine, it would be neutralised and oxidised so quickly and rapidly by nature that it was fairly harmless. In the early days of Charters Towers-the town where I live and where, in the 1870s, my great grand-daddy lived-people would go absolutely berserk about cyanide. Cyanide is the most deadly of poisons. That terrible monster in history, Hitler, used it to do what he did to the Jews in Europe. Cyanide is a very efficient poison. Probably a quarter of the entire surface area of the city of Charters Towers is cyanide heaps. All the kids at the various boarding schools used to dig tunnels through the cyanide heaps. What you have to understand is that cyanide, whilst it is a deadly poison, has a very short halflife-I think it is around 20 minutes-so it rapidly oxidises and becomes utterly harmless. There is not a single case in the history of Charters Towers, stretching from the 1880s to the present day, of anyone suffering, health wise, from cyanide. So if you have technical knowledge, you realise the situation and have a clear understanding. You do not go through the terror, the stupidity and the ignorance that abounds in this place from time to time. You have a more intelligent approach to this. Having said all of those things, the reason a uranium isotope is so dangerous is that, unlike cyanide, which has a half-life of 20 minutes, uranium has a half-life, if my memory serves me correctly, of a couple of hundred thousand years. So the dangerous element here tends to last, whereas it does not last with other commodities such as acid soils et cetera. The last member who spoke, the member I for Herbert, quite rightly posed the question to the House: where is it to go? The opposition say that it should not go there. Where would they suggest it should go? Whose responsibility should it be, because each state government is going to say ‘nimby'-not in my backyard? That is natural and predictable. Someone here has to make a decision. All right, it is politics to complain about the decision, but let us complain a little less loudly. Let us not ask for genuine decision making and genuine honesty, but let us complain just a little less loudly than we have been and not be hypocritical in dividing the House on this issue. I serve on one of the government committees that has the very onerous task of dealing with the issue of uranium mining in Australia. Of course, that takes you into the area of how safe or unsafe is radiation. The first places I went to-I do not know where other members went-were Nagasaki and Hiroshima where two atomic bombs were dropped and the radiation from them killed some 200,000 people in the space of 15 or 20 seconds. There was rampant radiation in those two cities, but the thing that staggered me-I did not know this; I suppose I was labouring along in ignorance like everybody else in this place-was that within two months people were being bussed back into Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Within a matter of months, there was a city again in a place that had been thoroughly covered in radiation poisoning. Two hundred thousand people had died in that area-150,000 were killed by the blast and a further 75,000 died from the effects of radiation poisoning. When atomic bombs have been dropped on the cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima and two months later they are repopulated, and then years later there is very little evidence of the fects of those bombs-except for a slight movement in the incidence of thyroid cancer-on the long-term health of the people who moved back to those cities, are we really wasting a lot of time here on something that is not particularly important? But, having said those things, I present a serious note of warning to the House. Of the people in North Queensland that I represent, some 50,000 or 60,000 live on the watershed of the Burdekin River and draw their water from there. The honourable member for Herbert and the honourable member for Dawson are from there. The Burdekin Falls Dam provides water for some 210,000 people. These people are drinking water that comes from the lower reaches of the Burdekin River. The Ben Lomond uranium mine, 40 or 50 kilometres from Townsville, stands right above it. A French company-I think it was Aquitaine-proposed the development of that mine. I was very positive about been brought up and lived in Cloncurry, my hometown, beside Mary Kathleen. I knew all the people who lived there. I played football there. I went to church there. I did hundreds of things there. We had no evidence that indicated uranium mining was dangerous. Some greenies living up there-not a race of people that I like in any way, shape or form; but in those days there were some sensible people associated with them-started making a noise that there had been a spill of high-level radiation. Whilst I have waxed lyrical about the dangers of uranium not being great, there is a limit to the dangers we will accept. In the case of Ben Lomond, the company said that there had been no spill. The government agency-the forebears of what we now call the Environmental Protection Agency-also said that there had been no spill. That was for the first three or four weeks. When further evidence was disclosed, they said, firstly, efthat there had been a spill but the level of radiation was not dangerous and, secondly, that it had not reached the water system from which 210,000 people drank. For the next two or three weeks they held out with that story. Further evidence was produced in which they admitted that it had been a dangerous level. Yes, it was about 10,000 times higher than what the health agencies in Australia regarded as an acceptable level. After six weeks, we got rid of lie number 2. I think it was at about week 8 or week 12 when, as a state member of parliament, I insisted upon going up to the site. Just before I went up to the site, the company admitted-remember, it was not just the company but also the agency set up by the government to protect us who were telling lies-that the spill had reached the creek which ran into the Burdekin River, which provided the drinking water for 210,000 people. We had been told three sets of lies it. I had over a period of three months. So I say to the people of the Northern ritory: make sure that ordinary people have some sort of oversighting mechanism. Do not leave it up to the government or its officials. They will dance to the tune played by whatever piper is in charge money-wise or politically. They will not answer to the tune of protecting the people. That has been my experience. The case of Ben Lomond was notorious, and the very development oriented BjelkePetersen government said no to Ben Lomond. The most development oriented government in recent Australian history said no because of the absolutely outrageous performance of their own regulatory body, as well as the mine itself. One other humorous aspect, which was not really humorous at all, was when I asked the regulatory authority chief, ‘How do you get your water samples?' He said, ‘We have them collected.' I said, ‘Who do you have collect them?' He said, without any guile, ‘The company.' So we had the company protecting itself, not the people of Queensland or the people who were depending upon this water for their water supply. Having said those things, there has been a great boon to civilisation and mankind through the uranium industry-the Breda reactor industry, the electricity power station nuclear reactor industry. The figures from America are that coal-fired power is 1.8c a unit, which is about in line with Australia's 3c a unit, and gas is near enough to 6c a unit, and oil is much more expensive than either of those. But nuclear power is 1.7c a unit. In India, there is the famous case of Enron, which built a $2,000 million coal-fired power station that never turned a wheel because no-one in that province of India had enough money to pay for the electricitythey look to the cheapest source of energy. Whilst I do not think the scientific case has been made out on CO2, moving massive Ter- amounts of some foreign body into the atmosphere-or massive amounts more CO2 than is normally there-is not a desirable thing to do. In that sort of environment, a lot of countries have to look to this as a solution. I do not want to go into the reasons why coal is a magnificent answer for China in its coastal areas. They would be very foolish not to go to coal and, of course, they are using coal. But they have enormous difficulty in getting coal into the interior of China, and to push the transmission lines into the interior would disrupt millions and millions of people and cause a lot of political and other upheavals. There is no easy solution. And so, like India, China has gone to the nuclear solution. We come back to the original proposition that the member for Herbert and the member for O'Connor referred to-that is, where does this product go? You cannot sit over there as a responsible opposition representing the Australian people and just say, ‘It shouldn't go there.' There is an onus upon you to say where it will go. We would like to know from the opposition where they think it should go. The member for O'Connor very generously said ‘Western Australia'. The reason for that is that our science indicates to us that some of the strata in Western Australia is 6,000 million years old. It is a lot older than anything else on the planet, that is for certain-having had a bit of experience in the mining field. We thought our homelands of Mount Isa and Cloncurry were very old because they are Pre-Cambrian and probably date back 600 million years. What you are looking for are stable formations, and the reason that Western Australia is stable is that it is six billion years old: it is the same now as it was then. I am oversimplifying slightly, but it is still valid to say that that strata has not changed in billions of years, not millions but billions-that is, B for bravo. That makes Western Australia ideal for this sort of operaability tion. But we are talking tonight about the federal government having to do something, and I think a responsible government does have to act here. I spoke to my very worthy colleague from across the border in the Northern Territory the member for Solomon. I said, ‘Which way are we supposed to be going on this?' Mr Snowdon-It's my bloody electorate, not his.",88
110,Mr KATTER,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"You just listen to what I am going to say. He said, ‘We're going for it.' I said, ‘Who wants this in their backyard?' Mr Snowdon-He does.",92
111,Mr KATTER,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"Will you just listen to me? He said, ‘We need some money.' It is a proposition that a lot of people in this House do not seem to be very interested in. If you go to a place like Doomadgee, where we are short about 100 houses and going backwards and losing more houses than we can build, we will shortly be back to 200 people living in galvanised iron lean-tos on the Nicholson River at Doomadgee-as it was when I was minister. Within seven or eight years, on sent trends, that is what is going to happen. cannot get any enlightenment from this House. I have pleaded and I have spoken on this maybe 30, 40 or 100 times. I have asked this House to deliver to the first people of Australia-the Aboriginal people, if you want to use that term-the private ownership of land so that they can do something with it. They are supposed to own 40 per cent of the surface area of Australia but of course they own absolutely nothing but some chimera, some mythical figure, called tribal ownership. Nobody knows who it is or what it is or what they can do with it. You can see the absolute proof in any single Aboriginal community in Australia of the lack of any to look after themselves. If you are not going to allow them to own their own land like every other single person on the planet, then it might be nice if you gave them some other source of income. The Northern Land Council made it quite clear in the hearings in Darwin that they were in favour of moving in this direction under certain circumstances and controls. I most certainly pointed out to them the Ben Lomond example. I said that they want to make sure that they have some oversighting body on which they have representation. But the member for Solomon is dead right: at the end of the day, you have to feed and clothe your children. You have to have their teeth fixed. There are a whole lot of things that you need money for. There are people here who do not seem to put any store in that at all-‘Let's just increase the taxation and bleed everybody some more.' It gives people a bit of pride if they have a negotiating leverage. There are those of us who have argued very stridently in this place against land rights and against the Mabo legislation and all of those things. But there is one good aspect of it: the locals, whether they be black, white or purple in colour, have some sort of pre- leverage. If the member for Solomon is inI tending to use that leverage for the people that he represents, then I, for one, applaud that-(Time expired)",92
112,Dr NELSON,COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE,"Bradfield-Minister for Education, Science and Training) (8.15 pm)-I thank all of the members that have contributed to the debate on the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005 and the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management (Related Amendment) Bill 2005. Yesterday's Northern Territory News editorialised on this issue, and I think it is fair to say without any pejorative remarks that the Northern Territory News is zealously a newspaper which represents what it considers to be the best interests of all Territorians. In editorialising on this issue under the headline ‘Arrant nonsense', it said in part: It's time for the hysteria surrounding the building of a nuclear waste facility in the Northern Territory to stop. Callers to radio talkback shows are regularly saying they fear a new generation of deformed babies. That is the kind of arrant nonsense being alled by fanatical greenies. The truth is low-level waste can be stored safely in concrete bunkers. Medium and highlevel waste can be stored by a process called roc. In fact, nuclear waste could be stored next to Darwin's municipal rubbish dump-and would be safer than where it is now. The campaign against the waste depository is being driven by the Territory Government. I have heard some cogent arguments, including that which I have just read, in support of the need for the legislation before us to enable the government to proceed responsibly and with certainty in dealing with the radioactive wastes produced by Commonwealth agencies. Alternatively, from the speakers opposed to this bill I have heard no practical alternatives to the passage of this legislation. It is my job to deal with reality. Australia is a technologically advanced society. We derive medical, economic and even environmental benefits from the use of a large range of radioisotopes. Australia has for the past half a century operated, at Lucas Heights in suburban Sydney, a small but significant research reactor, which is soon to be replaced by the new Open Pool Australian Lightwater research reactor, otherwise known as OPAL. As a nation we must deal with an existing inventory of radioactive waste and the small quantities that will arise from the continued need to produce radioisotopes for use in medicine, industry and research. It makes no sense to run public scare campaigns that completely blow out of all proportion the risks and hazards associated with this lowlevel and intermediate-level waste. It is all solid waste. It is not in a liquid that can spill or leak and it cannot explode; nor is it readily combustible. We produce no high-level radioactive waste and Commonwealth law and policy prohibit its importation. I must say I am extremely disappointed with if not anped- noyed by the constant reference to this highly managed, highly regulated facility as a ‘dump'. Material that goes to this facility will be stored above ground in a purposeSyn- built building where the containers can be monitored and will be checked at any time. If a burial option is available, burial will be undertaken in a very precise manner that allows for monitoring and recovery of buried material if that is ever necessary. This facility is not like a municipal tip where material is dumped off the back of a truck or a ute into a trench. It is placed there very carefully and very precisely; it is recorded and indeed monitored. Why did the government need to choose new sites to investigate? Because of the opposition by a Labor state Premier, supported in the end by his federal colleagues, that torpedoed a site in South Australia. This ended an exhaustive 12-year scientific and technical process started in July 1992 by-to his great credit-the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Hon. Simon Crean MP, the member for Hotham. But what do we hear now? ‘Don't pick on the Northern Territory,' it is said. It has also been said in the course of this debate that the government should conduct a proper scientific study. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, we have been down that road. We went down that road for almost 14 years at a cost of $12 million to the Australian taxpayer. There was an air of uncertainty in yesterday's proceedings as the member for Jagajaga informed honourable members, including the member for Hotham, of the need for an objective scientific approach to identifying a repository site. The member for Hotham had developed such an approach. It was implemented by the Howard government and it was sabotaged by a South Australian Labor government. I have also heard calls that we should not impose this facility on communities that say they do not want it. All current state and territory governments have said that they do not want it. Where does that leave the opposition's alternative policy? The member for Jagajaga had much to say about the time frame for establishing the facility, saying there were no pressing regulatory or practical reasons for its early establishment. This is not the case. There are a number of reasons why early progress on the facility is needed to ensure timely availability of the OPAL research reactor and to enable the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation to meet its contractual obligations for the return of spent fuel reprocessing wastes from HIFAR, which of course is being replaced. In relation to the OPAL reactor, the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, Dr John Loy, stated in a letter dated 9 April 2002 to the former Minister for Science and Technology, Mr MCGauran: You will be aware that I have indicated that at the time of any application for a licence to operate the RRRreplacement research reactorI would expect that there would need to be substantial and evident progress for anintermediate-level wastestore. The progress, such as features of the design being settled, siting criteria established and a strategy and timetable in place for settling a needs to be such that I could be satisfied that a store for the waste arising from processing spent fuel will be built and licensed to operate by the time it is needed. That is a very important statement. This facility is also needed in order to meet Australia's treaty and contractual obligations to take back waste arising from the reprocessing of HIFAR spent fuel which will see this material returning to Australia in 2011. It is November 2005; we have six years. In fact, we have less than six years. While this leaves those six years to provide the facility, much of this time is already committed to the thorough regulatory processes that the facility will be subjected to. Approvals will be required from three regulatory agencies: the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage and the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office. The ARPANSA licensing process is a threestage process prior to the siting, construction and operating phases of the project. This will commence in late 2006 when the government selects a preferred repository site. The facility is also needed to address the current state of radioactive waste management in Australia. In the absence of purposebuilt management facilities, holders of waste are currently required to retain it indefinitely. This is inconsistent with international best practice, which supports the creation of centralised purpose-built waste management facilities. I remind the House of what I said in the second reading speech. In the Northern Territory itself there is 16 cubic metres of low-level waste at the Royal Darwin Hospital today and there is also intermediate-level waste at a site approximately 40 kilometres east of Katherine. That cannot continue to be stored, as it is all over the country, in universities, hospitals and factories. In New South Wales it is in a shipping container at Lidcombe EPA, two kilometres from the Flemsite, ington Markets. That is the state of play today. Despite the claims of the member for Jagajaga, any discontinuity in the operation of the research reactor presents difficulties in ensuring the reliable supply of nuclear medicines. Reliance on imports involves a number of risks, including that of refusal of carriers to transport medical isotopes. As recently as September 2005, the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mr El Baradei, told the IAEA General Conference: the Secretariatthat is the IAEA secretariathas continued to meet with commercial carriers, regulatory authorities and the modal organizations of the United Nations, to determine how to address the increasing denial of shipments of medical radioactive materials. It is my job, it is my responsibility, to find a solution to this issue for the good of all Australians. The government has decided that investigation of the three sites identified in the Northern Territory is the best way forward to establishing a facility in our country. Returning to the Northern Territory government's response, the Martin government has responded with what is simply a scare campaign about the nuclear waste facility and attempted to confuse it with the issue of statehood for the Northern Territory. It has made outrageously exaggerated claims about the hazards of radioactive waste transport through the Territory and the impact of the facility on the environment. There is no better measure of the hypocrisy of the Martin government on this matter than its double standard on transport of yellowcake from South Australia and transport of radioactive waste to a Commonwealth facility in the Territory. Yellowcake from Olympic Dam is currently safely transported by rail to Darwin and shipped from the port of Darwin with the full participation of the Northern Territory government authorities. Yet this substance is more radioactive-I repeat: more radioactive-than any of the low-level radioactive waste held by the Commonwealth which comprises 90 per cent by volume of the entire inventory. The more outrageous of the claims by a Northern Territory minister come from the Minister for Primary Industry and Fisheries, Mr Kon Vatskalis. He asks Territorians to believe that a facility anywhere in the Territory would ruin the Territory's reputation for clean green primary produce and the tourism industry. The only threat to the tourism and agriculture industries in the Territory is the scaremongering of the Chief Minister and her ministers. Overseas experience shows that these claims are ridiculous. In countries such as France, which I might add has 75 million visitors a year, the existence of large radioactive waste management facilities has done nothing to damage the reputation of famous products such as champagne or camembert cheese produced nearby. France's current low-level waste disposal facility in the Champagne district has a capacity 100 times greater than that being considered for the Northern Territory. There are 124,000 cubic metres of low-level waste in Champagne today. Statements made by the Northern Territory government that it would use every available means to delay or frustrate the Commonwealth in establishing and operating the facility confirm the need for this new Commonwealth legislation. The Northern Territory government was fully aware when it passed the Northern Territory Nuclear Waste Transport, Storage and Disposal (Prohibition) Act 2004 that this legislation was in conflict with existing Commonwealth laws. This law is inconsistent with existing Commonwealth laws such as the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act 1998 and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, which provide the authority for the Australian government to establish and operate the facility. These laws were enacted so that the Commonwealth government could meet its responsibilities to the Australian community to ensure that radioactive materials are managed without harm to people or the environment. Under these circumstances, the Commonwealth had no alternative but to act to put beyond doubt its right to safely manage radioactive waste produced by Commonwealth agencies in the interests of all Australians. Successive Commonwealth governments since the Hawke Labor government have endeavoured to make responsible arrangements for managing Australia's radioactive wastes. In so doing they have been defeated by the attitude of state and territory governments who fully agree with the need for such facilities provided they are not in their backyard. In an attempt to deal with such crippling parochialism, an objective, scientifically based study to find a highly suitable site for national, low-level radioactive waste repository was initiated in July 1992 by the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Hon. Simon Crean. After considerable effort and expense, this process ended last year following action in the Federal Court by the Rann Labor government to oppose the use of the selected site near Woomera in South Australia. In response to the intransigence of the South Australian government, the Prime Minister announced on 14 July last year that the national repository project would be abandoned and the Commonwealth government would examine sites on Commonwealth land, both onshore and offshore, for a collocated facility for management of the lowand intermediate-level radioactive waste produced by Commonwealth agencies. State and territory governments are now expected to make their own arrangements for managing radioactive wastes in their jurisdiction in a manner consistent with Australia's international treaty obligations. While the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act provide authority to site, construct and operate the Commonwealth radioactive waste management facility, legislation is required to reduce the potential for costly delays by putting these powers totally beyond any doubt. Continued statements from the Northern Territory government that it will attempt to obstruct the project reinforce the need for this legislation in the interests of the responsible management of Commonwealth radioactive waste. Because of these very real concerns and the politically motivated obstruction of the Commonwealth's activities and the need to progress this important project, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act a 1999 will not apply to the site investigation phase of the project. Nevertheless, I will consult informally with the Minister for the Environment and Heritage if there are any potentially significant environmental issues, which we currently do not anticipate, that arise during the site investigations. We must be absolutely clear about this: the sites are current Commonwealth sites; they have been owned for 20 or 30 years with no environmental or heritage issues previously being raised. Two of the sites have extensive Defence infrastructure on them already. The claims of the opposition that the Commonwealth would seek to circumvent proper Commonwealth regulatory scrutiny are absolute nonsense. The bill explicitly provides that the processes under the EPBC Act 1999, the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act 1998 and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 must be fully complied with. In particular, the operation of the facility, including the transport of radioactive waste, will proceed in accordance with licences issued by the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency. The highest standards of safety will be applied to ensure that the operation of the facility does not present a hazard to people or the environment in the Northern Territory or along interstate transport routes. Transport of radioactive material has an excellent safety record internationally. In Australia we transport around 30,000 packages of radioactive material safely around the country every year. The government would have preferred to act with the cooperation of the states and territories, whose citizens receive direct and life-saving benefits from the Commonwealth's activities in this field. However, despite the lack of cooperation, we will not shy away from doing what is right and in the interests of all Australians. I have still not heard a sensible, practical alternative from those opposed to the Commonwealth radioactive waste management facility for the responsible management of Commonwealth radioactive waste. The scientific basis for safely managing radioactive waste at a Commonwealth facility is well established and widely applied internationally, including in Australia. A near-surface disposal facility for low-level radioactive waste operates now at Mount Walton in Western Australia. The Queensland government operates a modern radioactive waste store at Esk in south-east Queensland-100 kilometres north of Brisbane, I might add. It is extremely important all Australians understand that we cannot expect to receive the benefits of nuclear sourced radioisotopes and then totally disregard, or even actively oppose, the need for facilities for the safe, long-term storage of low-level and intermediate-level waste. To ensure that these medical and industrial procedures and products are available in the future we must provide the facilities needed for managing the small quantity of radioactive wastes that arise in their production and use. Passage of the bill is essential if Australians are to continue to realise the benefits of the wide range of uses of radioactive material in our daily lives. We may be Queenslanders, we may be Victorians, we may be West Australians or Northern Territorians, but we are Australians first, we are Australians last and we are all human beings. We will benefit from the radioisotopes that are produced in Sydney and we have a responsibility to store them safely in an appropriate long-term facility.

These amendments have been flagged and drafted by the Northern Territory Country Liberal Party. They have been formulated in the best interests of Territorians and I am glad to propose them on behalf of all Territorians. The main rationale for these amendments is to ensure that, firstly, Territorians do have a say in the siting of the facility and, secondly, there is an enhanced level of safety and security enshrined in the legislation. The Northern Territory government and the land councils of the Northern Territory should have an increased opportunity to be involved in the nomination of possible sites for the radioactive waste management facility. Whilst the Chief Minister and the Central Land Council may not want to involve themselves in finding what they consider to be better sites in the Northern Territory, other Territorians do want to be involved in the selection process. The Country Liberal Party strongly believes that Territorians should have this right. In response to many phone calls from constituents, and our own research, the Country Liberal Party feels that it is prudent to further assure Territorians beyond any doubt that there will be no highlevel waste or spent nuclear fuel stored at the proposed facility. This is an important point to include because of the outrageously exaggerated claims that the Martin Labor government is peddling. In conjunction with this it is our belief that Territorians want to be absolutely sure that if anything goes wrong at the facility then the Territory would have recourse to the Commonwealth government. We believe beyond doubt that the facility will be built to the highest possible standards, but once again the ridiculous claims of the Martin government that this would be some sort of rubbish tip are just plainly untrue. It has been said in the past-and the minister has assured methat if the facility is located in the Northern Territory then an offer will be made to the Northern Territory government to store locally produced waste in the facility. This is obviously much more preferable than storing it under Royal Darwin Hospital and in a multitude of other sites around the Territory that are clearly not suitable. The Country Liberal Party strongly believe that, as some recompense for the facility being sited in the Territory, the Northern Territory radioactive waste would be stored free of charge and that this should be enshrined in the legislation. I would like to thank the Country Liberal Party for the mature way that they have carried out their work. Mr Snowdon interjecting",99

You would have to describe them as cosmetic surgery on a completely irrecoverable bill. Let us go through some of the specifics of what he is proposing. The member for Solomon is attempting to amend the definition of ‘controlled material' to exclude high-level radioactive material and spent nuclear fuel. Firstly, the minister, in his summing up of the bill, clearly indicated that there is no high-level radioactive waste in Australia or being produced in Australia. The minister made that quite clear in his summing up of the bill, and the member for Solomon should be well aware of that. Unfortunately, this just gives a bit of a glimpse of the member for Solomon really clutching at straws. The second issue is that it was his government, his minister for the environment, that promised before the election that there would not be a nuclear waste dump in the Northern Territory, and it is now the member for Solomon who has to go up there and defend this serious broken promise. Secondly, the member for Solomon says that he is generously moving an amendment allowing the Northern Territory Chief Minister and Indigenous land councils to nominate alternative sites in the Northern Territory. But, of course, the devil is in the detail, cause proposed part 1A3C(2) states: The Minister does not have a duty to consider nomination. So much for the member for Solomon saying to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory-or anyone else, for that matter-that they can put up a nomination for a site. There is no obligation on the minister to consider any nomination whatsoever. Just as importantly, proposed section 3D states: No person is entitled to procedural fairness in relation to a Minister's approval. So the minister can say whatever he likes and respond in whatever way he likes and the member for Solomon's amendment is, frankly, completely meaningless. Thirdly, the member for Solomon seeks to indemnify the Northern Territory government against any actions taken against it over the facility. advice is that this is nothing moreMrs De-Anne Kelly-What about Bob Hawke?",102

122,Ms MACKLIN,AYES,"It is extraordinary, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the member for Lingiari has been warned",103
123,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES,"If the member for Jagajaga wants to argue with the chair, she is in deep water.",103
124,Ms MACKLIN,AYES,"Yes, very deep water. The member for Solomon seeks to indemnify the Northern Territory government against any actions taken against it over the facility. As I have just been trying to say, our advice is that this is nothing more than a restatement of the Northern Territory's current legal position. Once again, it is a completely irrelevant beamendment from the member for Solomon. The member for Solomon is trying to make a up for the fact that he has to carry the can for a promise that was made and is now being broken because he has absolutely no influence in this government. We know that this clause would only be relevant if the Northern Territory government actually chose to get involved in the management of this dump. The Commonwealth would be the one responsible for damages caused by a Commonwealth facility, with or without this amendment, so it is completely meaningless. Finally, the member for Solomon stipulates that, if the Northern Territory's waste is stored at the waste dump, the Commonwealth would not charge the Northern Territory for storage. But the member for Solomon neglects to include anything in the bill Our that would ask the Commonwealth to store the Northern Territory's waste. These are extraordinary amendments, just an amazingly pathetic attempt by a member trying to make up for a broken promise. (Time expired)",103
125,Mr SNOWDON,AYES,"I want to go to the discussion which took place just a moment ago. I am reminded by the shadow minister about the way in which the member for Solomon is proposing a set of cosmetic proposals-like your hat, Member for Mackellar. It is cosmetic surgery on an irrecoverable bill. Let me make it clear",103

128,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES,"If the member for Lingiari does not want to continue, I can call the",103
129,Mr SNOWDON,AYES,"There are several ways, as the shadow minister has pointed out, that the member for Solomon's proposals are just window-dressing. They are all about playing a mirror trick. They do not provide anything substantial to the legislation, because he is in political hot water. We know that the Northern Territory branch of the Country Liberal Party, the leader of the Northern Territory country party in the Legislative Assembly and all of its members in the Legislative Assembly are adamantly opposed to this legislation. Ms Macklin-How many are there?",103
130,Mr SNOWDON,AYES,"By the way, there are not many of them-and there will not be many more. I suspect that in his heart of hearts the member for Solomon is sitting there thinking, ‘I wonder what's going to happen to me in a couple of years time when there's an election?' I wonder what is going to happen to you in a couple of years, because we know that the people of the Northern Territory are very concerned about this proposal. They are concerned about this proposal because of the way in which it has been imposed upon the Northern Territory community. I raised this in the course of the debate-and I notice the minister talked about the siting processes this afternoon. I wonder why they have chosen three sites in the Northern Territory. We fundamentally know the answer: they chose three sites which are defence land. I have here a short list with the NSAC comments-the final list. It says here about the site next to Katherine that there are questions of suitability. They raise questions about its suitability because of its topography and hydrology. I do not know what scientific basis the minister has entered into in informing himself about the assessment process for these sites, but it is very clear that, when National Sites Advisory Committee compiled the list for the government, only one of the three sites proposed in the Northern Territory was included on that list. I ask the minister to explain why that is. I would also ask the minister to explain what is wrong with the site at Seymour, which is 20,000 hectares, near the Puckapunyal military area? What is wrong with the site at Denman, which is an ammunition disposable facility of 464 hectares? What is wrong with the site at Bogan Gate, which is an RAAF ammunition storage facility of 1,000 hectares? NA",104
131,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 9 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Indigenous Affairs: Poverty",104
132,Mr SNOWDON,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to bring to the attention of the House and all members of the parliament the United Nations Millennium Development Goals and the poverty pole charter to recognise and rectify Indigenous poverty. I say that because members will know, or they ought to know, that there is a proposal to make Indigenous poverty history. This requires requesting Australians to sign a poverty pole to make Indigenous poverty history by a personal commitment to equality for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of Australia. They are asked to sign a petition, a poverty pole. When you sign that poverty poll, you are committing to ensuring that the millennium development goals specifically address the poverty suffered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; committing to identifying achievable poverty reduction strategies with measurable and time-bound outcomes to be achieved by 2015; committing to holdthe ing our elected representatives accountable to achieving these goals; taking personal responsibility to understand the causes and effects of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples poverty; engaging people when we encounter ignorance or lack of compassion; and, committing to justice for all in making Indigenous poverty history. I now refer to the UN Millennium Development Goals and remind the House of what they are. The first is to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger. The second is to achieve universal primary education. The third is to promote gender equality and empower women. The fourth is to reduce child mortality. The fifth is to improve maternal health. The sixth is to combat HIV-AIDS, malaria and other diseases. The seventh is to ensure environmental sustainability, and the eighth is to develop a global partnership for development. They are ideal goals that we should be committing ourselves to in the context of Indigenous Australians. For some years I have been arguing that as a nation we have an obligation to address the endemic poverty of Indigenous Australians and the appalling indicators that reflect the depth of poverty in health, education, housing, employment and access to communications and transport infrastructure, just to name a few. The task for us then is clear. To meet these millennium development goals, we must develop a policy framework which is sustainable, which contributes to a society that is fair and equitable and which accepts individual as well as collective responsibility. This policy framework must address the relative deprivation experienced by many communities who have missed out on the benefits of economic reform, who have suffered from structural change, who have never experienced economic development or whose communities may be in decline. It must be responsive to the differing needs and aspirations among its citizens. From a policy implementation perspective, it would require methods for prioritising attention to community and individual aspirations; methods for implementing policy to facilitate active democracy, including addressing the problems of negative welfare and the need for further exploration of ideas of reciprocity and social responsibility; and frameworks for developing partnerships with communities across Australia, regardless of their socio-economic status or location. These frameworks will be tasked to ensure coordination between governments and to find innovative forms of collaboration between public, private and community sectors. They will need to include negotiated assessments of achievable policy outcomes, against which policy implementation and expenditure can be measured. A variety of methods for service delivery will need to be explored. Methods that are consistent with the needs and aspirations of the community have the greatest potential to provide lasting and sustainable nation-building outcomes, including leadership and enthusiasm and strategies to address capacity building requirements, particularly in the area of governance within these communities. We need to accept our responsibility as a nation if we are going to achieve these objectives in addressing the millennium development goals to provide the capital required to address the shortfall in infrastructure that is evidenced in the key indicators of poverty that I have summarily outlined earlier. We also must accept that these things will not change unless there is recognition of the right of Indigenous Australians to make decisions and to be self-determining. We have an obligation as a community to adopt these millennium development goals as a way in which we can address this problem, in a framework which is appropriate to the needs of Indigenous Australians-their dire poverty. This dire poverty will only be fixed once we as a nation accept our responsibility. I request and I urge all members to sign up to this exercise in making poverty history. Telemarketing",104
133,Mr JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Ryan) (9.04 pm)Telemarketing business in this country is valued at over $9 billion annually-a massive amount of money in anyone's language. To put this figure into context, the Australian economy is worth about $820 billion and the federal budget is worth about $220 billion. Why is telemarketing business so substantial? Because of the enormous number of phone calls made by telemarketers to the homes and businesses of Australians every minute, every hour of every day in the week and every week in the year. Newspapers estimate that Australian households last year received in excess of one billion telephone calls. Up to this point, the telemarketing and direct marketing industry have been largely self-regulated. But in recent times, this self-regulation seems to have fallen by the wayside to the extent that people are now sick and fed up of having their personal time and their privacy interrupted by unwanted, repeated, intrusive and persistent calls. Consequently, the government has decided to take action in this area. Both the number and nature of telemarketing calls have resulted in the relevant minister, Senator Coonan, releasing a discussion paper canvassing options for a legislated ‘Do Not Call' register in this country. On behalf of the ple of Ryan who very much appreciate their privacy and their personal time, I want to place on record my very strong support for the formation of the government regulated ‘Do Not Call' register. In recent months, my office has received calls from telemarketers seeking business action from my office. My office has also received a great deal of complaints about the intrusion and annoyance that some telemarketers are inflicting upon their households. I personally have also received intermittent complaints but, during the past 12 months, they have increased dramatically. The residents of Ryan are getting calls at the most inconvenient times: while they are having dinner, speaking to friends on other calls or putting their kids to bed. The aggressive nature of these telemarketing practices, and indeed some telemarketers, is also cause for concern. Many residents of Ryan have conveyed to me how irritating they find these calls, to the extent of being threatened and harassed. Businesses as well are finding dealing with these calls an immense drain on resources. The discussion paper released last week by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts discusses a national ‘Do not call' register which would formulate a way to cut down unsolicited calls but still allow bodies such as charities and legitimate market researchers to continue to operate. An important aspect of a national register would be that it would give Australians the ability to opt out of telemarketing approaches and to avoid intrusive phone calls. It is time to protect people's down time with their families and to respect their privacy. Under the plan outlined in the discussion paper, businesses that ignore the register and requests for no contact, including those from overseas call centres, would face fines peoof up to $220,000. This may seem to be a significant penalty. However, given the aggressive nature of many telemarketing organisations and companies, I think this has something to be said for it. This is an important aspect that would make a national register effective and meaningful in protecting people's right to privacy. The government is now calling on all residents with an interest in this issue to take a look at the discussion paper available on line at www.dcita.gov.au and to make a submission regarding the proposed register. Submissions are due by the close of business on Wednesday, 30 November 2005. I certainly take this opportunity in the parliament to encourage all those people who have emailed me, called me and written to me about their personal experience with aggressive and intimidating telemarketers to make submissions. I would like to place on the record once again my strong support for this initiative by Senator Coonan and to commend the government on this move. I think it is important that the people of Ryan understand that the government is taking this very seriously. In reference to some of the constituents that have called me in recent weeks, I want to place on the record that I will be calling them and writing to them to inform them of the government's initiative and to encourage them to make a submission. I acknowledge and thank Betty Robinson, who has called me to inform me of her experiences. She is an older resident of Ryan with a disability, and the persistent telemarselves keting calls are creating enormous problems in her household. Another constituent, who lives in The Gap, rang my office telling me of her experience of being abused by a telemarketer who was disturbed that this particular resident was not interested in their prodenvironmental uct. Mrs Meryl Pringle of Chapel Hill has called me to register her complaint as well. (Time expired) Indigenous Affairs: Poverty",106
134,Mr GARRETT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to support a very good initiative, Make Indigenous Poverty History, which I want to make reference to, as will other speakers, in the House this evening. It is clearly an idea and a campaign whose time has surely come. The template for Make Indigenous Poverty History would probably be familiar to people, because it is the Make Poverty History campaign itself-one of the most positive undertakings of recent times which has seen churches, community groups, citizens groups and, ultimately, nations apply themselves through the United Nations to identify a way in which the scourge of poverty can finally be banished from the world stage. As the member for Kingsford Smith, which includes the Aboriginal community of La Perouse, the one aspect of this initiative that I think is particularly telling is that it will apply and can be applied to Indigenous communities in all parts of Australia. If we cast a line out and say we are fair dinkum about addressing poverty, and if we accept that current and past measures have been less than effective, then with the Make Indigenous Poverty History campaign a way has arrived to address the scourge of poverty that is inflicted upon people in this country. At the core of the Make Poverty History campaign was to be a set of clearly enunciated goals which nation states within the international community committed themto and which provided the necessary ingredients to make poverty history. These goals included eradication of extreme poverty and hunger; improving maternal health-measured as reducing the maternal mortality rate by three-quarters; and ensuring sustainability, including reversing the loss of environmental resources. The Millennium Development Goals were championed by the United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, and addressed in the United Nations when they met just recently. I think they provide us with not only a template but quite a visionary course of measurable action to address the issue of global poverty. Make Indigenous Poverty History is taking up that template for Australians who find themselves in a state of impoverishment that is equal to or, in some cases, worse than those in the developing countries that the Make Poverty History campaign was intended to work with and assist. Whilst there continues to be much to inspire us in Indigenous communities and in the contribution that many individuals and organisations do achieve, showing excellence in their fields, as we know only too well in this House it is still regrettably a fact that Indigenous disadvantage is well identified and acknowledged. The recent report Overcoming indigenous disadvantage 2005 presents an up-to-date, necessarily and I think regrettably sorry set of statistics. We know that the statistics are there. We know that the situation that our Indigenous people face is difficult. There is a debate, I think with a renewed source of urgency we can address it. One of the most meaningful ways is to set goals. The Millennium Development Goals now can be set for the Make Indigenous Poverty History campaign as a means by which we measure our progress to those ends. With Make Indigenous Poverty History, you do not sign a petition; you sign a pole with a charter. A pole has some meaning in Indigenous culture, and the charter outlines both acknowledgment and memory of what has happened, who has gone before and that ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of Australia continue to suffer injustice'. Once people sign the pole and commit to the Millennium Development Goals that are now to be applied specifically to Aboriginal people, we would have from people and governments a commitment to, for example, identify achievable poverty reduction strategies with measurable and time-bound outcomes to be achieved by 2015. That is only 10 years from now, but by that time some of us will have passed from the parliament. But, given that the pledge is to take personal responsibility and to hold elected representatives accountable, it is fitting we should take note of this campaign in the House this evening. (Time expired) Child Support Agency",107
135,Mr SCHULTZ,ADJOURNMENT,"Once again I rise in this House to bring to the attention of the parliament and the community another set of problems related to the way that the Child Support Agency operates and what appears to be the uncaring attitude of two ministers of the Crown and a parliamentary secretary. I will read a letter from one of my constituents to illustrate the point: Dear Sir, I'm writing to you in regards to a matter I have recently had with the child support agency where but I believe I have been unfairly treated. In March '05 I stopped full time work as my father had taken seriously ill. So I decided to move to Barmedman to become his full time carer, this was not a career choice and I hope he recovers. Consequently I am in receipt of a carer's pension but still trying to maintain my home in Picton where I had hoped to move my father when he is well enough. As I am maintaining two homes 400 km apart things are tight. But he is my dad. As I had not been able to work and I was due a tax return and a debt to CSA I applied for a release of my tax return from CSA. The most important of these being some traffic fines (my licence has since been cancelled). As I require my licence to fulfil my role as carer, maintain access to my children and to facilitate my return to work (Truck driver). These were not good enough for the CSA. And further more they did not allow me any appeal. As a consequence everybody loses (most of all me). I can't see my kids, it would be difficult to return to work and pay a higher rate of maintenance, and as I am in a small Riverina town with no service's, drive my father to town occasionally. The decision by CSA has left me at wits end, very near bankrupt and am left with a bitter attitude as I fail [to see] how I can support a system that won't allow me to support my family. Yours sincerely ... That is, once again, a classic and typical example of the heartless, uncaring attitude of the Child Support Agency, who will destroy an individual at any cost through their draconian use of the legislation they have at their convenience. I have to say that my office has made inquiries about this gentleman's father, and he is dying of cancer. That is the system that we live with in this country and that is the system that my own government condones through its ministers. And that is only the start of it. I have other cases still coming to my office from within and outside my electorate. In many cases men are being driven into poverty because of this capacityto-earn nonsense that says that, if you have earned a higher wage at some stage of your working career, you are expected to pay at that level regardless of the reasons for your earning a lower wage now. I also have correspondence which illustrates that payers are supporting someone else's child because their ex-partner cannot bear the cost of that child. As an example, a woman leaves her husband and has an affair with another individual. In the process of leaving the husband she takes the two children from that relationship and has another child with another individual, and, because she is struggling, the Child Support Agency asks the payer, who is not the biological father of the third child, to pay for the expense of child support because the ex ‘cannot cope with the cost' that she says she is now enduring. They are just two examples of the national shame, as I keep describing it, of the Child Support Agency. I just cannot believe that two ministers of the Crown and a parliamentary secretary are so far removed from this pain and suffering that is happening, with these people being forced into poverty, that they are doing nothing about it. I will continue to raise these issues in this House and I will continue to expose the uncaring attitude of these ministers and the parliamentary secretary. Indigenous Affairs: Poverty",108
136,Mr MCMULLAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to join with my colleagues the member for Lingiari and the member for Kingsford Smith in welcoming the initiative of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Ecumenical Commission in launching the Make Indigenous Poverty History campaign tomorrow evening. It is being launched by former senator Aden Ridgeway, a friend of many people in the House, and the speakers will include Graeme Mundine, the CEO of the commission. This is a wholly desirable initiative which deserves to be very successful, because there is a large hole at the centre of the contemporary public policy debate concerning Indigenous affairs. While the debate generates passionate argument about process issues, some of them major and some of them quite trivial, the glaring fact is that the relative disadvantage of Indigenous Australians has worsened over the last decade, and that fact has gone almost unnoticed. I want to put a couple of questions on the record. Firstly, in what other field of public policy would the fact that our performance, objectively measured, is worse than that of any comparable country go unremarked? The public policy debate on Indigenous affairs continues as if in a hermetically sealed bubble in which the lessons and performance of comparable countries do not exist. Secondly, in what other field of public policy would the fact that we are delivering outcomes for a significant proportion of the population which are worse than the average outcomes achieved in some of the poorest countries of the world not impact on the debate? And yet the demonstrable fact that today the life expectancy of a young man born in Bangladesh is greater than that of a young Indigenous man born in Australia stares us in the face. It is time we recognised that Indigenous Australians are not sharing in the benefits of the sustained growth the Australian economy has enjoyed. The best summary of this argument can be found in the recent study by John Altman and Boyd Hunter of the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research at the Australian National University in my electorate, which concluded: ... indigenous Australians have not shared in tional economic growth to the same extent as other Australians ... It also observed: ... areas of improvement evidence to 1996 have been eroded over the period 1996-2001. This is obviously not good enough. We need to find a way to focus on doing better. It is even more dramatically highlighted by international comparisons of life expectancy. For Australia as a whole, the life expectancy for males is about 76 years. In Syria it is 71, in Vietnam it is 69, in Nicaragua it is 68, in Bangladesh it is 63, in North Korea it is 61, in Myanmar-a global basket case-it is 58 and for Indigenous Australians it is 57. How can we allow this to continue? We need to find a way to focus the debate on finding better outcomes, rather than having petty squabbles over red herrings and side issues concerning the process or the size and nature of inputs. The international community faced the challenge of a similar failure to focus on the crisis of global poverty. This led to the Millennium Summit and the decision to set down specific goals and targets, which then became the campaign Make Poverty History. No-one pretends that merely setting goals is enough, but by presenting goals the global community has set the world a challenge and has shown that the resources exist to meet the challenge if we have the will. In September, I published an essay, in the Progressive Essays series, proposing that we need a similar initiative in Australia-that we need to set Australian Indigenous development goals. I was therefore pleased to hear recently that the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Ecumenical Commission are proposing a similar initiative. They are preparing to launch their campaign tomorrow evening and I wish them well. It is long past time that, as Australians, we acknowledged that public policy with regard to naIndigenous Australians has failed. The statistics suggest that we have the world's worse practice, but the temporary and immediate fascination with process issues will not fix the problem. We need to move on and recognise the failure of existing policies and establish ambitious goals to address the current inequities. I therefore welcome the initiative of the ecumenical commission-the Indigenous arm of the National Council of Churches. Their campaign has the potential to focus attention on the failure of public policy in this area in Australia, particularly the failure of practical reconciliation. They can focus attention on the continuing absolute and relative disadvantage of Indigenous Australians. This is a campaign which deserves the support of every Australian. Child Care Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (9.25 pm)-Tonight I wish to continue a grievance I made earlier in the week, in which I detailed how child care had moved from being provided by the not-for-profit sector and local councils to being provided through federal government funding. We have seen an increase in federal government funding to the point where $9.1 billion will be spent on child care by the federal government over the next four years. I illustrated in that speech how we can expect that figure to keep increasing as we attempt to meet various needs within the community. We need to rethink the way we provide child care. It needs to become workplace based: we need to provide incentives for workplaces to install child care. It needs to become an industrial issue if employers want females in the work force and if we are pursuing a welfare-to work agenda. Fringe benefits tax needs to be removed for smaller businesses who might purchase, say, one place in a child-care centre just down the street from their premises and who might employ one, two or three part-time staff to share one position. All of those female employees can share that one child-care place. There are plenty of opportunities for innovation in this area. If the employer takes on that cost and it is recognised as a legitimate expense, they can then claim a 30 per cent reduction in their costs, less tax, and that 30 per cent can immediately be passed on to the parent on the day the child care is used, rather than parents having to wait, in some cases, more than two years for the return of the 30 per cent rebate on child-care expenses. If, for the remaining 70 per cent of the employer's costs, the government pays the benefit to the employer as an added incentive for them to move into providing child care in or near the workplace, we will see further incentives for the private work based sector to take on childcare responsibilities. This will provide a happier work environment. The government subsidy to employers can be made up of payments from employees, which employers can withhold on behalf of the employees. The government subsidy will be in accordance with the person's assets and income, which is more along the lines of how we are currently assessing their CCB entitlement. Again, the withheld amount will not count towards the employer's legitimate claims for child-care costs. There are numerous ways we can improve child care and drive child care in the workplace. Mr Speaker, I have previously discussed with you the idea of providing child care at Parliament House. We could be an example to Australian workplaces in providing child-care opportunities for parents to get some work-life balance so that they do not have to do a preschool drop-off, a school drop-off and then get to work. In the future, child care for under-fives will be provided at women's workplaces. A bus will be put on to deliver your kids to school at the appointed hour. They will be picked up after school and three delivered back to the workplace for afterhours care or, else, schools will run out-ofschool-hours care. There is plenty of innovation there. There is enormous scope for rethinking the way we are doing it at the moment. The increasing costs of child care seem to be providing profits on the Stock Exchange. Councils used to provide child-care centres at a huge cost to ratepayers who might not necessarily have children, so it is appropriate that child care has moved to the private sector. But now we are seeing it move from the not-for-profit sector to the for-profit sector and being listed on the Stock Exchange in the form of very profitable businesses. As a good Liberal, I never begrudge anyone a profit, but when subsidies start to get to the size they are now there is something wrong. Again, we should put the emphasis on the employer. They can keep a tab on the costs and ensure that all revenue from charges for child care is actually spent in the child-care centre. There would be a greater parental influence and the sole purpose of providing the child care would be to meet the clients' needs. Most employers would be happy to see a nil cost basis for a child-care centre.",109
