4,Mr HAWKE,DEATH OF MR RAJ IV GANDHI,"I move: That this House records its deep regret at the death, on 21 May 1991, of Rajiv Gandhi, former Prime Minister of India, expresses its deep sympathy to Mrs Sonia Gandhi and family, and to the people of India, in their bereavement, urges all Indians to respond to this outrage by strengthcountries. ening their commitment to democracy and, requests that this motion be conveyed by the Speaker on behalf of the Australian Parliament to the Government of India. Mr Speaker, the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi was a despicable and senseless act of violence. It was a tragedy for India and for its people. It must not become also a tragedy for lndia's political process. I hope that all Australians, and every member of this House, will join me in expressing our profound sorrow and regret at his untimely death. Mr Gandhi assumed the reins of power and the responsibilities of national leadership at a relatively young age and under very difficult circumstances. He accepted the challenge with courage, with commitment and with a sense of duty that was truly admirable. As Prime Minister, Mr Gandhi set about reforming, modernising and consolidating development in his country of some 800 million people. He was an innovator, introducing many policies designed to equip India to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century. I came to know Rajiv Gandhi as a personal friend and as a result of our close working relationship in the Commonwealth. I found his insights and his cooperation on international issues, particularly on such difficult questions as South Africa, of enduring value. Everyone in the Commonwealth who met him found him tenacious and constructive, as well as a man of very considerable personal charm. In regional and international affairs, Mr Gandhi sought a responsible and a measured role for India. He attempted to forge closer relations with Pakistan and he was the first Indian leader to visit China since the 1950s. Australia's long standing friendship with India was strengthened considerably during Rajiv Gandhi's prime ministership. He was personally committed to maintaining a strong relationship with us. I recall with pleasure his visit to Australia in 1986 and my own visit to India in 1989. As recently as last month, Rajiv Gandhi spoke with a member of this Parliament, Senator Graham Maguire, of his desire for closer ties between our two It is true that our economic ties have never been as close as they should be or as they could be. That is all the more reason why we should mourn the loss of one such as Rajiv Gandhi, committed as he was to strengthening those ties. Rajiv Gandhi's contribution to India's democracy and parliamentary government followed the strong tradition set by his grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, a founder of independent India and its first Prime Minister, and his mother, Indira Gandhi. During my visit to India in 1989 I delivered the third Indira Gandhi Memorial Lecture. That evening was chaired by Rajiv Gandhi. In his concluding comments on that occasion he spoke movingly of his mother and of her admiration for Australia and described the new recognition, the new understanding and the sense of common purpose which make India and Australia partners in the great tasks ahead. He said that he looked forward to building, in partnership with Australians, a new era in Indo-Australian relations. For any democracy to lose two leaders of the stature of Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi is to suffer a doubly grievous blow. However, I have confidence that India is resilient enough to overcome this loss and to endure this provocation. Mr Speaker, I mourn the passing of a friend. We have all been robbed of the greater contribution that this man, still relatively young, could have made to his nation and to the world. Rajiv Gandhi's widow and family have been robbed of the presence of a husband and a father. It is to that tragic family and to the nation they have served so well that our thoughts are dedicated with this motion.",12
5,Dr HEWSON,DEATH OF MR RAJ IV GANDHI,"The Opposition joins the Government today in mourning the death of Rajiv Gandhi and in conveying our sympathy to his family and to the Government and the people of India. r, unfortunately, did not have the opportunity to meet Mr Gandhi. I cannot, therefore, speak of him in personal terms, as has the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) today. But in speaking today of the public man I can sav that we on this side mourn Mr Gandhi's 'loss for many reasons. We mourn his passing because of the manner of it. The brutal and coldly calculated violence that caused his death sent waves of shock and outrage around the world. It was not as if the world had not seen such violence against political leaders before: political assassinations have been one of the more deplorable features of the history of the late twentieth century. There was something particularly tragic and poignant about the bomb that killed Rajiv Gandhi last week. That such a gentle man should die such a violent death seemed especially appalling. That yet another member of the Gandhi family should die in this way seemed a particularly tragic waste of human life and talent. We also mourn the death of Mr Gandhi because India has lost a political leader with a clear vision for the future of his country. He knew the serious challenges which the processes of technological and structural change pose for India and he was prepared to face up to them directly. He was also prepared to chart a clear course for India's international role in a rapidly changing world. Rajiv Gandhi was a man who learnt from his experiences. He well understood both the successes and the shortcomings of his prime ministership from 1984 to 1989. He was seeking the office of Prime Minister again in 1991 with a clear vision for India's future, based on both his experience and his beliefs. Rajiv Gandhi knew that India's internal antagonisms had the potential to erode confidence in the processes of India's democratic government. He knew the dangers posed by competing castes, by warring religions, by cultural divisions, by grinding poverty and by widespread illiteracy. His message was clear to all prepared to listen to it. He believed that the only path to stability, modernisation and economic prosperity for India lay in a secular ideology for government and in a strong centralised system of government. At an international level, Mr Gandhi saw a constructi vc role for India separate to, but not isolated from, the role of other major powers. He saw a special role for India as a champion of Third World aspirations, as a leader of the non-aligned movement and as a dynamic force within the Commonwealth. In his own period as India's Prime Minister, Mr Gandhi gave practical effect to those aspirations in his efforts to resolve the Gulf war, to enhance the prospects for disarmament and to end apartheid in South Africa. There were those who disagreed with these prescriptions for Indian domestic and foreign policy. There were those who argued that Mr Gandhi had misread the mood of the times and that his policies would accentuate divisions rather than resolve them. But no-one could argue that Rajiv Gandhi had not offered a clear vision for India's future or dispute that he had done so with eloquence, with cogency and with style. We mourn the death of Rajiv Gandhi for another reason-for its personal dimensions. He was an intensely private man called by circumstance to a life of public political service. India and the world have lost a man who was prepared to put the honour of his family and the service of his country above his personal preferences. Were it not for the death of his brother Sanjay in a plane crash in 1980 and the murder of his mother in 1984, Rajiv Gandhi would have been free to devote himself to the consuming passions of his lifehis family, his flying, his photography and his friends. He would have been free to avoid controversy and stay out of harm's way. But that was not the path that Rajiv Gandhi chose. The deaths of his brother and his mother invested him with unexpected responsibilities and created expectations of him among millions of people in India. He did not avoid those responsibilities, nor deny those expectations. A reluctant politician he may have been, but when fate made its call on him he answered it with a sense of deep commitment and courage. Finally, we mourn the death of Rajiv Gandhi because in his passing Australia has lost a good friend. Australia's and India's international interests do not always coincide, but Rajiv Gandhi was committed to maximising the prospects for effective cooperation, particularly at an economic level. He was interested in the substance, not just the symbolism, of Australia-India relations. He was committed to upgrading both private sector and government links, and his commitment had practical results. We acknowledge Mr Gandhi's work in the creation of the Australia-India Business Cooperation Council. Across a very wide range of bilateral issues he provided a conducive climate for the resurgence of an active, positive and constructive relationship between Australia and India. During the ycars of Rajiv Gandhi's prime ministership thcre was a revival of Australian-Indian trade flows, science and technology exchanges, and cultural links. Mr Speaker, this motion is before the House at a critical time for India. Indian politics have been thrown into disarray with the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. The Indian nation is reeling with shock and anger at what has happened. The Congress Party is in search of a leader and the national elections have been deferred until next month. In these circumstances, the challenges to India's democratic system are very real and very obvious, but the foundations of stable, democratic and peaceful government in India are very strong and I am confident that they will not only withstand this violent challenge but continue to grow in strength and stature. Like his mother and grandfather, Rajiv Gandhi's vision for India was that of a secular union. That vision has well served a nation of over 800 million people-a nation with deep racial, religious and social divisions. Although Rajiv Gandhi has now gone, it would be a tragedy for India if the Gandhi vision, which has guided India since independence, were now to be overturned. A senseless act of violence has robbed India of a man committed to democracy and committed to the rule of law. The world has lost a true believer in the benefits of internationalism, and Australia has been deprived of a good friend. For all these reasons, I am pleased to support the Prime Minister in what he said today and to endorse the motion before the House.",13
6,Mr LLOYD,DEATH OF MR RAJ IV GANDHI,"On behalf of the National Party of Australia. I want to join with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in speaking to this condolence motion. When Rajiv Gandhi became in 1984 Prime Minister of India, the world's most populous democracy, the question asked by many in India and around the world was whether he could change Indian politics or whether Indian politics would change him. It was known that Rajiv Gandhi was reluctant to enter politics. He was a cautious and gcntle man who was devoted to his family and who found the rough and tumble of Indian politics contrary to his personality. For the sake of stability in India, and in line with his family sense of responsibility, Gandhi entered politics and, as we all know, like his mother before him he has paid the supreme sacrifice. He was thrust into the leadership of the Congress (I) Party immediately after the tragic death of his mother, Indira Gandhi, and in 1984 he led that Party to a bigger majority than that achieved by either his mother or his grandfather. He visited Australia during his time as Prime Minister and strengthened the relationship between our two countries. In Australia it is difficult to understand the difficulties of governing what is, in effect, a multinational country with ethnic and religious minorities who have no overriding sense of acceptance of the power of New Delhi. Nevertheless, Rajiv Gandhi led India from 1984 to 1989. It would seem that he was never entirely comfortable with political life and especially the constant threat to his life which accompanied his leadership. When asked about the constant threat of terrorism, he said that it did not bother him, but 'it has upset our family life a lot'. He was a gentle man, a family man, thrust into the leadership of this massive and diverse nation of India. So it is with great sadness that today this condolence motion is before the House marking this most tragic and violent death. I am sure that on both sides of the House our thoughts are with his family, and our thoughts are also focused on the future of India during this very difficult time. Stability and democracy in India are critical to the people of India, for the region and for the cause of democracy.",14
7,Dr BLEWEIT,DEATH OF MR RAJ IV GANDHI,"It is a tragedy when a political leader is wantonly and deliberately murdered while pursuing the ordinary practices of democracy, that is, communicating with the people whom he seeks to lead. This was particularly the case with Rajiv Gandhi who pursued those practices courageously and who died in the prime of his life and whilst poised to bring new political stability to India and its people. In my one brief meeting with him, it was. c.lear t.hat he was a man of great qualIties, WIth a rare capacity to communicate, lead and unify-a genuinely decent, humane person. The nature of the tributes which have flowed in reflect the international standing of the man and the high esteem in which he was held both as a leader and as a person. Rajiv Gandhi devoted considerable personal effort to the development of a broader and closer relationship between India and Australia. During his visit to Australia as Prime Minister in 1986 he launched a range of initiatives which focused particularly on commercial aspects of the relationship, and further impetus was givcn to the relationship during the visit of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to India in February 1989. During the recent election campaign Rajiv Gandhi made it clear that he would continue to work towards the development of a closer relationship with Australia. With his death, Australia has lost a good friend. No nation can easily overcome the loss of a leader such as Rajiv Gandhi. His importance as a member cifthe now tragic Nehru-Gandhi dynasty in binding together the world's largest and most plural democracy was manifest. His commitment to overcoming the divisions of race, of language, of religion, and to the advancement of the welfare of all of India's people makes his loss to India doubly tragic. As Benazir Bhutto, another leader of Rajiv's generation and experience and of the Indian subcontinent, put it: We are here to pay our respects to India's son who rose up to many challenges and was slain as he stood on the threshold of victory . . . I support the motion.",15
8,Mr HOLLIS,DEATH OF MR RAJ IV GANDHI,"As Chairman of the Australian-Indian Parliamentary Friendship Group, I should like to add my voice to this motion and express my sympathy to the Gandhi family, the Parliament and the people of India. It was my privilege to meet Rajiv Gandhi twice, and I know that he viewed Australia with great interest and friendship. India has lost a leader, Australia has lost a friend, and the world has lost a statesman with Rajiv Gandhi's tragic death.",15
9,Mr CONNOLLY,DEATH OF MR RAJ IV GANDHI,"Having had the honour of meeting Rajiv Gandhi some years ago and having spent some of my youth on the Indian subcontinent, 1 should like to be associated with this motion. Rajiv Gandhi was a son of and a leader of post-independence India, a fact we tend to ignore but which is of tremendous significance for the contribution he made to his country, which is not only the world's largest democracy, with some 800 million people, but is also a land of great contrasts and in many ways of basic contradictions. He did not choose to enter politics and, as has been said, it was the assassination of his mother in 1984 which made that essential. In doing so, he did indeed put his own interests and that of his family in a secondary role to that of his responsibility to his nation. The Congress Party, which he led and which was established by his grandfather, was India's great secular party. It not only led India into independence but, until relatively recently, has also managed to keep control of an extremely complex nation. After three generations of the Nehru family we have seen what people have regarded as a dynasty being born. The fact is that dynasties are not the norm in democracies, but India is no ordinary democracy. It is a rich polyglot of races, religions, cultures, castes and classes of wealth and of great poverty. It is a nation inexorably linked with its rich and long history; at the same time it is struggling to be a great nation in the twentieth century; When one asks the question 'Why did Rajiv Gandhi die?', the answer probably is: because he tried to bridge a basic contradiction, a contradiction that is found only in Indiathe contradiction between the past, the present and the future. We as Australians can only hope that democracy in India is not now, as some claim it to be, at the crossroads. Should democracy die or go through any period of considerable setback, which some commentators claim that it will, I can assure all members of this House that Australians may well rue the day. I should like to join members of this House in offering my sympathy to his family and to the Indian people in their great loss. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. NA CHARLES MANNING HOPE CLARK, AC",16
10,Mr HAWKE,DEATH OF EMERITUS PROFESSOR,"I move: That this House expresses its deep regret at the death, on 23 May 1991, of Emeritus Professor Manning Clark, AC, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. It is fitting that we record today in Parliament the passing of an eminent Australian. Manning Clark, Australia's most celebrated historian, died at his home in Canberra on Thursday, 23 May, at the age of 76. Manning Clark was born at Burwood, New South Wales, on 3 March 1915, the son of an Anglican clergyman. He was educated at Mont Albert Central School, Melbourne Grammar School, the University of Melbourne and Oxford University. He taught in England and at Geelong Grammar School before joining a faculty at Melbourne University. From 1949 to 1975 he was Professor of Australian History at the Australian National University-the first person to hold that postand in 1978 he was the first Visiting Professor of Australian Studies at Harvard. Manning Clark wilI best be remembered for the six monumental volumes of his A History of Australia. The very least one can say about this work is that it is and will remain an essential reference point for anyone who seeks to understand this nation and its people. This history is a comprehensively national one, yet it is also a deeply personal one and, just as Manning Clark wanted and expected, it is an unfailingly controversial one. Its esscntial qualities-its breadth of vision, unfailing idealism, boundless imagination and abiding love of country-were in fact the essential qualities of Manning Clark himself. His subject was Australia, but his conception and treatment of that subject were breathtakingly broad. He was at case with great themes-the human condition, the life of the spirit, the conflict betwcen good and evil-but these great themes were expressed through, and distilled by, a work whose focus was at all times national. Such history does not simply enrich our national life; it actually helps to create it. A History of Australia is itself a landmark in our life as a nation. In his last year, Manning Clark turned his hand to writing his personal history. The Puzzles of Childhood and The Quest for Grace reinforced his reputation as a perennial asker of questions and prober of answers. Manning Clark was made a Companion of the Order of Australia in 1975 and was named Australian of the Year for 1981. He was a man of passionately held beliefs who fought for equality for all Australians. He was a scholar, teacher and thinker who never sought refuge in what is for some the ivory tower of academia; rather, he was engaged-and passionately so-in the great issues of his time. For him, history was a living affair, and as a historian he was engaged with the present as with the past. Through his writing he has contributed to a greater understanding by Australians of their country and of themselves. In one of his last public speeches, Manning Clark expressed his hope for the future of Australia's youth. He said: I hope you people will believe passionately in the destiny of Australia-enough to make a contribution to all the great prohlcms. You are terribly lucky to be alive at this time because your lives will be probably more interesting and lively than my own or those of my contemporaries. We have lost a grcat and respected member of our national community. On behalf of the Government I cxtcnd our sincere sympathy to his wife Dymphna and to his family in their bereavement.",16
11,Dr HEWSON,DEATH OF EMERITUS PROFESSOR,"With the death of Professor Manning Clark last Thursday Australia lost a man who felt passionately about his country and who devoted his life to trying to understand it better. Professor Manning Clark once wrote that his six volume history of Australia should be read 'as what one man saw when he opened a window on our past'. Through his teaching, his writing and his speeches he conveyed what he saw when he opened that window. In doing so he made a distinctive contribution to Australian intellectuaJ life. Manning Clark had a very elear personal view of the purpose of studying history and that view gave his work a special character. He once wrote: . . . every historian must preserve a halance, a harmony between his duty as an artist to celebrate life as it is, and his duty as a moralist to show the world how it can be improved. Such a view of history is not one that is shared by all historians or indeed by all those interested in the study of history, but Manning Clark assumed the prominence he did within his own profession and among the wider Australian population because he gave effect to his particular view of history with style, eJegance and force. He will be rcmembered for the questions he asked about Australia's history as much as for the answers he suggested. He opened up debates and outlined grand themes in a way that will keep generations of students, scholars and readers stimulated for years to come. He portrayed the clash within and between the secular and religious faiths in Australia as vital to the understanding of Australian history and Australian society. He was among the vanguard of intellectuals who studied the impact of the Australian environment on European settlers, as well as the reverse. He sought to explain the consequences of European settlement for the Aborigines. He explored the legacies of the convict era. And he chronicled the decline of religious faith in Australia-what he called the descent from the 'Kingdom of God' to the 'Kingdom of Nothingness'. Above all, perhaps, Manning Clark agonised over the priorities of Australian society in the past and the present. He sought an answer to the question whether the search for equality necessarily meant mediocrity, conformity and loss of freedom. He thus became both a historian and a public controversialist-and, in fact, saw both roles as mutually supportive. As he wrestled with these grand themes for over 40 years, Manning Clark developed a distinctive view of Australia's past and present. It was a view that won the admiration of those who agreed with it and challenged those who did not. For example, his A History of Australia was acclaimed by some critics as a masterpiece and judged by others to be flawed. There were those who claimed that Manning Clark had created a new and better way of learning about Australian history. And there were others who disagreed with his approach and particularly with his assessment of Australia's British heritage. Some saw his tragic view of Australian history as the appropriate perspective from which to view our past. Others insisted that it was unduly pessimistic and exaggerated the shortcomings of Australian values and institutions. These debates over the substance of Manning Clark's work will continue. They are the very heart of what intellectual life is all about and Manning Clark contributed uniquely to that process in Australia. For that reason, he will be missed as much by his admirers as by his critics. Manning Clark believed that one of the aims of a historian should be to write great literature. His work reflects that piration. Of all Australian writers, he had a greater capacity than most to evoke the spirit of a place. He was a historian whose sensitivity to the Australian environment gave his work a special, personalised character. Manning Clark will be remembered for who he was as much as for what he did. He also opened himself to his fellow countrymen in a way few historians have. His autobiography has given us a unique insight into the forces that drove him and the influences that shaped his thinking and that of his generation in Australia. He had a capacity for great warmth, friendship and generosity that so many people can attest to. He loved the bush capital of Canberra with an enduring affection. He also loved music, fishing and cricket but held a special place in his heart for Australian rules football. It was the true blue Carlton man, and not the academic historian, who wrote in 1962 that: When the umpire at the start of the match holds the ball on the palm of his left hand, blows the whistle and bounces the ball, anyone not moved must have a heart of stone. Manning Clark made lesser claims about his own work and views than many of his admirers did. Unlike some others, he never pretended that he had the definitive answers to the great questions that he asked about our past. He said that historians should be 'divided and tormented people' .and he put himself clearly in that category. He said it better than anyone when, in the preface to the fifth volume of his A History of Australia, he wrote: No matter how hard anyone tries, no matter what their gifts, they will always feel dissatisfied with their attempt to match the majesty of the themes. Manning Clark himself once categorised historians into what he called 'photographers', who re-create the past in careful detail, and those who 'touch up' photographs who, in Professor Clark's words, 'abandon the language of the observer and begin to use the language of the prophet'. As a historian, Manning Clark was both a 'photographer' and a 'prophet'. As such, he would not have expected everyone to agree with his conclusions-and that asagreement did not exist. But what did exist was respect for his views, admiration for his commitment and recognition of his contribution to the search for an Australian identity. Manning Clark once said that a man can give only what he has. He gave generously of what he had, and Australians have cause to be grateful. To Professor Clark's wife and family, we on this side of the House join v.::ith the Government in extending our deep sympathy. I support the motion before the House.",17
12,Mr KEATING,DEATH OF EMERITUS PROFESSOR," I knew Manning Clark, but not as well as I would like to have known him. He was a very kindly person and r think most people on this side of the House would believe that he was a fairly strong supporter of the Australian Labor Party. Whether he began life as a strong supporter of it, I am not sure, but I think he finished life as a supporter of it. He adopted a lot of its values and in fact some of its values were his values; we adopted some of his values. As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said earlier, he never pretended to have the definitive answer to the basic questions of life, but he tried very hard to get to them. I think that, as all of us know, anyone who has devoted one's life to thinking about basic questions, as he did in a constructive and structured way, is always tantalising for those of us who are interested in those questions. When one talked to him, one invariably came away wiser for the event. He was always able to impart something. Both the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition remarked on his kindliness. He was a very kind person. There was a benevolen't quality about him that endeared him to most people. What is referred to as his great work, his A History of Australia, has provided this country with its first definitive and comprehensive history. It developed a frame of reference for assessing Australia that went weIJ beyond material values. It stressed an accentuation on human values and human affairs. We often heard him remark in his television interviews about the conversation of humanity. He was very interested in Australia participating in this conversation. He said the following in the epilogue to his last chapter: This generation has a chance to be wiser than previous generations. They can makc their own history. With the end of domination by the straighteners, the enlargers of life now have chance. By 'the straighteners' 'I think he meant people who do not see or believe in higher values. He believed Australia had a choice between those two paths: the path of the straighteners and the path of the people he called the 'enlargers of life', who, he believed, had their chance. On that latter theme, the enlargers of life, he said in the previous paragraph, about the southland: Of all the dreams of those Europeans of what Australia might be, the southland of the holy spirit or the land where the great dream of the cnlightenment would be fulfilled, or the land whcre blood would never stain the wattle or the new Britannia-another world. All that seemed to survive was the idea that Australia was a place of uncommonly large profit. He was, of course, disparaging of that sort of notion and interested in the notion of enlightenment, the promise, which the place held. It is for that promise, I think, and for his focus upon human values and human affairs and writing out history in that frame of reference that we owe him the greatest debt. This tradition of equality which he invoked in his daily and personal life and which came out so much in his writing and his relationships with others was probably the most remarkable thing about him. Those of us who knew him will all miss him. Our nation, indeed, has lost a very important son. But the greatest loss is to his wife, Dymphna, and his children, to whom I join the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in expressing my sympathy. NIr CARLTO- (Mackellar)-I support this condolence motion because of my admiration for Manning Clark. I admired him not for the goals he pursued for Australia, with which I did not really agree, but for the fact that he did have such goals and he pursued them not only tenaciously and persistently but also so courteously and so elegantly. Few historians, few intellectuals and few public policy protagonists wrote such captivating prose or spoke so eloquently. Manning Clark was a man with ideas in a land often short of ideas, and a cultivated man in an often barren landscape. their But he was also a very generous man, generous towards those whose views he opposed. This morning I saw in Melbourne a former member of this House, Tony Staley, who is recovering painfully over a long period from a very serious accident. He was one who developed a very great friendship with Manning Clark and would want to be associated with our remarks here today. Manning Clark wrote in his scratchy, squiggly handwriting a nice note when I was appointed to the ministry back in 1982. I will quote one sentence from that: I still believe it is important now that people who stand in entrenched ground should be prominent in our public life-even though the ground in which you have chosen to stand is not my choice-or the ground in which I would stand. I was very moved by that. In a country where we are all struggling to get ideas up, to get them accepted, to change the country for the better, I think there is a generosity that people can share across great chasms of intellectual thought, and together we can all, somehow, make this country a better place. We shall miss him greatly and I offer my deepest sympathy to his wife and family.",19
13,Dr BLEWETT,DEATH OF EMERITUS PROFESSOR,"I came to know Manning Clark only in the last years of his life, although I was very familiar with his works. By a chapter of accidents-they were not his fault-I happened to launch the Italian edition of his work A Short Hist01Y of Australia, and he did me the great honour of asking me to launch the second and now, sadly, last volume of his autobiography, The Quest for Grace. That volume, as many honourable members know, is very much a young historian's odyssey, a search, a quest to find out how he should write history and what he should write that history about. In form he opted for a narrative style which is not popular among many modern historians. It certainly was an unconventional choice, and of course as his subject he chose Australia. At the end of that autobiography, The Quest for Grace, he has written that first and very controversial sentence of his great work: Civilisation did not begin in Australia until the last quarter of the eighteenth century. Then, six volumes, 11/2 million words and a quarter of a century later, he concluded that great work in these words, which sum up his credo as a historian: It is the task of the historian and the myth maker to tell the story of how the world came to be as it is. It is the task of the prophet to tell the story of what might be. The historian presents the choice. History is a book of wisdom for those making that choice. He will be remembered for that great monument, that life's work of his. In many ways it is monstrous, magnificent, idiosyncratic and inescapable-inescapable because it towers above all other works as yet written on Australian history. Whatever its flaws, all future historians will have to come to terms with that history. I think all of us who would want to understand what being an Australian is have to wrestle with that work. Another very great writer with whom he shared much in common, William Faulkner-I once reminded Manning Clark that his style was very Faulknerian-said: It is his (the writer's) privilege to help man endure by lifting his heart, by reminding him of the courage and honour and hope and pride and compassion and pity and sacrifice which have been the glory of his past. Certainly, Manning Clark did that for antipodean man, and when all of us here are dust and ashes, future generations of Australians will go on wrestling with that great work. As has been noted, he was proud of his Labor commitments but not always proud of those of us entrusted with putting some of those commitments into practice. As the honourable member for MACKellar (Mr Carlton) has said, he was very generous to his opponents. I really only knew him for a short time and I will miss him very much. To Oymphna, his partner of 50 years, and to his sons and his daughter, I offer my sympathy.",20
14,Dr KEMP,DEATH OF EMERITUS PROFESSOR,"The passing of Manning Clark is a significant moment for all who care about the history of Australia and the meaning of our country's historical experience. My personal contact with Manning Clark was slight, but his life occasionally made contact with mine in a variety of incidental ways. He played cricket with my father in the first XI at Melbourne University. My father, whose whole lifc has been - evoted to defending ideals of frce cnterpnse that Manning Clark differed from, recalls him as a very likeable and warm person, and one of exceptional ability in cricket. In fact, he says that, had it not been for a defect in health, Manning Clark might have used his sporting talent to reach even the Australian Test side. 'Say something nice about him', my father, who is now 80 years of age, said yesterday. It is not difficult to say something nice about Manning Clark. It is also not difficult to refer to differences, even in this context, for Clark expected and welcomed the expression of views different from his own. As a student in history at Melbourne University in the early 1960s, I was a student of the post-Clark era, but I was taught by lecturers for whom Clark was an ideal, a model and an inspiration. Some of these lecturers had been taught by him in the Australian history course he had established on Max Crawford's initiative. To the extent that he had taught them, he had taught them well. They were professional and they loved Australian history. They have since made substantial contributions of their own. Clark's Select Documents in Australian History was an essential source we all had to read. By that time, of course, I was realising that Clark's view of Australia and, indeed, of history was different from mine, but there was no escaping his presence. Later again, after I had written a little about Australian politics and society, I found that from time to time Manning Clark had suggested me to radio stations as someone they might approach for a view he knew would be different from his. When on one occasion we appeared on the same television program, he reminisced beforehand that my fathcr had been a canny bowler when thcy had played together and that they both barracked for Carlton. He was a warm person. As ·Geoffrey Blainey wrote: He was very human. He fclt deeply some of the attacks on the early volumes of his big history of Australia. Perhaps he felt them the more deeply because he himself was always generous in writing about other historians. He had warmth of spirit . . . We remained good friends though we disagreed on most political topics and indeed on many historical questions. These words from Geoffrey Blainey, himself a student of Clark's, carry particular weight because Blainey had suffered from a more dogmatic group of young historians not schooled in tolerance by Clark. At the funeral service yesterday I listened to the farewells from four of Clark's sons. I was impressed by the common love and the fervour with which they spoke of their father and the wonderful diversity of styles and approaches amongst them. Each had grown within the Clark family as an individual, as Clark's students had done. As a teacher and as a father he had brought out what each had to offer, and that is in many ways the ultimate achievement. Yet what an infuriating man. He was a man of great bravado and also of great doubt. At one moment he was the best of professionals, at another a man who used his craft to promote his highly personal and often political agenda. He wrote a history of this country in which his own overwhelming questioning and vision seem at times to blot out what many others, professional and lay, see as key and central to the Australian experience .. Clark was not the historian of the Australia that many, professional historians and others, have experienced and see as so important. Like so many on the romantic Left, he did not seem to understand or care about the essential role of institutions in protecting human liberties. Australia's democratic institutions, their strengths and weaknesses, the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, constitutional government-for him these were not the important things, even though today their re-establishment in countries long deprived of them is the most important thing of al I. Clark took them for granted and prided himself on seeing through the facade of the British heritage. Amongst Manning Clark's heroes there were not the great heroes of the Australian economy. The institutions of private enterprise and the market economy, and the courage of pioneers on which Australian prosperity and its capacity to be more humane than most societies has been based, did not figure in Clark's documents or his histories to any great extent except when the human failings which afflict all institutions and times provided an opportunity to denigrate bourgeois institutions. Clark rejected the British heritage and his interest in economics was influenced more by Marxist concepts of the material basis of society than by any comprehension of its role in human progress and well-being. In short, Manning Clark rejected that vein of Western society which has most profoundly shaped civilisation in modern times-the liberal tradition and its institutions. In his vision of the forces of darkness battling the forces of light there was little room for the crystal spirit of liberalism to shed its light. His blind spot obscured much of the pervasive dynamic of liberalism that has shaped Australia and, indeed, most of Western civilisation. What is the significance of this? It is, in my view, that a history to guide the Australian people into the future remains to be written. Clark constructed his own vision. He was the son of an evangelical Anglican and his work often reads like a sermon from the pulpit of an Old Testament preacher. Ironically, the revolutions of our time, the revolutions of eastern Europe, were liberal revolutions to establish the institutions of human freedom and democracy, not the revolutions Clark had been anticipating and which he constantly saw behind the institutions of Australian society. His vision in the end was uncertain, because he was always on the move, always seeking for the faith that eluded him-and he knew that. He consciously titled his great work A HistOlY of Australia, not 'The history of Australia'. His awareness of this made him critical. As he looked back on the first five volUlITeS he conceded: I . . . regret that in presenting a tragic vision life that I unwittingly muted that voice hoping for better things for humanity. Writing in that tragic vein, you have to be very careful not to be counselling resignation and acceptance. I found it very hard to walk on the tightrope of tragedy without resignation and without acceptance-and, I might add, there was too much about the fatal flaws in individuals, especially in the earlier volumes, and not enough about overcoming weakness. In his preface Clark says that the main theme of his work is 'the debate in Australia about the life of man without God'. The Australia he wrote about was an Australia in search of faith, as he himself was. Manning Clark taught us, harangued us, irritated us and charmed us. At his funeral service yesterday the two hymns which were sung, songs which were favourites of Clark-John Henry Newman's Lead, Kindly Light and Abide with mewere songs of movement from unbelief and concern with self to belief and surrender to God. Manning Clark was a seeker, and perhaps at the end he found what he was looking for. I extend my deepest sympathy and condolences to his wife and children.",20
15,Mr DAWKINS,DEATH OF EMERITUS PROFESSOR,"My wife and I were to have dined with Professor and Mrs Clark next week. We were both looking forward to this occasion, denied now sadly us. I will have to console myself-as will many others of his admirers-with his prolific and everlasting writing. But what a consolation that is. His literature is, of course, his greatest legacy. What we have lost is his towering, though gentle, presence. Let me make a few observations about this truly impressive man. Whilst we in Australia have no shortage of great thinkers and scholars, all too rarely do we have the combination of a great intellect with a great orator and a great and perceptive commentator. Manning Clark was one of those who was prepared to leap the boundaries of his profession and to participate in the current and contemporary issues of Australian life. His view of Australian history was, as has already been indicated, one which was uniquely his own. But what made it particularly speof cial was the way in which he faced up to the sometimes uncomfortable realities of Australia's history-for instance, the richness of our pre-settlement history; the effect of the brutality, as well as the beauty, of Australia's extraordinary terrain; and the importance of our catastrophes, as well as our triumphs, on shaping the country we are today. It was perhaps his most signal achievement to ensure that Australian history became a permanent part of Australian academic and intellectual life. Of course, that will be carried on by his many and brilliant students. What was perhaps a bit ironic was the way-despite the fact that he eschewed any stupid glorification of Australian history-he managed to popularise Australian history far beyond the confines of academia or our universities. Perhaps it was because he saw history as a central part of the enrichment of life generally. As he wrote in Australian Civilisation: In every generation . . . mcnI assume he meant women as wellwill communicate to us their vision of the and terror of this world. Some will write poetry: some novels: some plays: some will paint, some will compose music: and some, I believe most defending it. passionately, will write history. This passion for history rests on his that history is much more than just a record and an analysis of the past. It is study essential to the way in which we carve out our future. It is perhaps an extraordinary coincidence that I, the uty Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Trade and Overseas Develaround opment (Dr Blewett) have all chosen to refer to one single paragraph of the less thousands of paragraphs he wroteabout this paragraph being in the last pages of his last volume of A History I will not repeat what has already been said. The last line, which I wish to refer to, states: The historian presents the choice: history book of wisdom for those making that choice. The choice we make for the future of our country will be the more inspired, the more we reflect upon and learn from the life and works of Manning Clark. I wish to associate myself with the motion of condolence and extend my sympathy to his family.",22
16,Mrs KELLY,DEATH OF EMERITUS PROFESSOR,"Canberra-Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories)-Professor Manning Clark was my friend and a fellow Canberran, so I will speak about him in a very different light from the others who have spoken of him today. Manning was Canberra's most respected citizen. I use the word 'citizen' deliberately because the concept of citizenship means thought, action and participation in the life of the city. Manning never believed that Canberra did not have a soul, because if he was not it, he was certainly its heart and its mind. . He came here more than 40 years ago and he participated vigorously in the life of the national capital. He was everywhere. One would often see him walking around the streets. In fact, the library in my little girl's school in Forrest was opened by him. He was everywhere: at the big functions, at the small functions. He saw himself very much as a Canberran beauty and he was very proud of it. If anybody criticised this town he would be up there He was involved right to the last few view days of his life. Last Monday morning, about 8.30, he called me at home to tell a me of some problem occurring in relation to an environmental issue in his neck of the woods. He was still alert and active. DepTwo weeks before that he had opened a conference for me for university students Australia. It was marvellous to see the way he related to those kids; the way counthe was able to put forward his vision the environment and about the future of Australia because of his experiof Australia. ences of the past. Manning was devoted to his familyDymphna, his sons and his daughter. But that sort of devotion extended to his wider is a family and I regarded myself as part of that. He was such a kind, loving and generous person that he would take an interest in all people, no matter whom he met, because they would add to his collection of thoughts about this country that he loved 'so desperately. He was a man of incredible passion. As speakers before me have said, his passion extended not just to history, our culture, but also, obviously, to sport. He was a very loyal supporter of me over the years-not only because I represented the Australian Labor Party, which he criticised, but I think basically loved, but also because I was a woman. Over the yearS Manning had an amazing capacity to grow and change his own attitudes about life. Perhaps his greatest achievement was while he was constructing and inventing his A History of Australia. During this time he also changed his views on what was important in it. We will hardly find mention of a woman or an Aboriginal, for example, in volumes 1 to 3, but they are crucial to volumes 4 to 6. In giving Australia history, Manning did not neglect another great passion of histhat is, of course, sport, especially Australian football and the fate of his team, Carlton. I would like to read an article that he wrote before one of Carlton's grand finals. It portrays tRe passion, the intensity and the love of life that Manning had. He writes: On the last Saturday of September every year many of the inhabitants of Melbourne, and indeed of the whole of Australia and even in foreign lands, are stricken with a strange infirmity. Happily for me, ever since 1937 I only get a bad attack when Carlton is in the Grand Final. One of the many virtues of the Carlton players over the years is that they do give their supporters years in which they can convalesce and strengthen themselves for another bout of this strange malady. The truth is: I love it. I love it to the point of madness of repeating the words of the popular song: 'Just keep on doing what you're doing/Although you're leading me to ruin. Just keep on doing what you're doing. 'Cos I love what you're doing to me.' I love every minute of it. So today, as happily Carlton has once more made it, I shall be there ready for a good wallow, an emotional bath of agony and ecstasy. There will be much of both. If the game is close, there may be more than I can endure in my season of the sere and the yellow leaf. There will be so much to enjoy. If the weather is right, it is one of those halcyon spring days in Australia when you have the feeling you can see forever, and if Carlton plays well, and if I can silence that fear that what matters most in life does not happen very often, then there will be the moments of wild ecstasy. Mr Hand-Did they win?",23
17,Mrs KELLY,DEATH OF EMERITUS PROFESSOR,"They won, of course. That article shows the spirit and the intensity of the man. Manning would believe that Australian football is the game they play in heaven. Though Manning was sceptical about his chances of getting there, or even whether it existed, I know that right at this moment it is time on in the last quarter and Carlton are five points behind the Demons but Jezza has taken a screamer in the goal square. He will kick the goal and beat the devil by the best possible margin-one point. My condolences go to Dymphna and the family. Manning, you are missed by all your friends, but we have a better understanding of ourselves and respect for ourselves as Australians because of you.",24
18,Dr THEOPHANOUS,DEATH OF EMERITUS PROFESSOR," Mr Speaker, I had the honour of having Professor Manning Clark launch in 1970 my book Australian Democracy in Crisis. The circumstances of that were somewhat unusual because I had not met him up to that time, although I met him many times after that. I wrote to him-I suppose rather impertinently-and asked him whether he would launch the book. He asked me to send him a copy, which I did. He read the whole book and he sent back a very enthusiastic letter saying that he would be very happy to launch the book. At the launching we heard some words of his wisdom, which he was always giving on every one of those sorts of occasions. Indeed, even when one met him at a personal level and had a discussion with him-and he always involved people in discussions-there were always words of wisdom. Manning Clark is the father of Australian history, not merely because of the great work that has been referred to-A History of Australia-but also because he passionately believed that the history of Australia should be taught in schools and universities. In 1946 he taught the first ever course on Australian history at a university. One would not believe it took that long-until 1946. Prior to that time Australian history was merely considered an adjunct to British history or imperial history. Manning Clark began the process whereby now there is not a single university or college that does not teach Australian history. It is taught in most schools in this country, and so it ought to be. So whether or not we agree with his approach, whether we consider it too tragic-I must say that I find it a very fine drama, and I think those who referred to it as 'too tragic' missed the point of the dramatic way in which he wrote about history-in the way that he wrote, he made Australian history very interesting and very dramatic. He had a huge list of friends, people from all walks of life and from all political persuasions. His political persuasion towards the Australian Labor Party was clear; nevertheless, he had friends in all directions, and that group of friends in fact increased as Australia developed as a multicultural society. I discussed with him on a number of occasions the concept of multiculturalism. He supported completely what was happening to the Australian identity as a result of multiculturalism. He said that multiculturalism was finally giving Australia the kind of identity that he had written about as a vision in earlier times. The honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) referred to some aspccts of Manning Clark's work and maintained that he had been critical of the liberal tradition. Maybe he had been critical of certain aspects of the liberal tradition, but he still maintained a very high rcspect for the liberal tradition. Indeed, in one of the last discussions I had with him, during an aeroplane flight, we discussed the changes in eastern Europe. He was in fact very happy with what was happening in castern Europe in terms of the transformation towards much greater democratisation. I will read a passage from a speech he made, at a meeting in 1976 addressing Citizens for Democracy, which is in fact the foreword of my book. He said: We must show our people it's not a choice now between the capitalist society, a corrupt, and disappearing society with all its moral infamy, it is not a choice between that and the so called comm unist societies, which so far, . . . have been characterised by what I call spiritual popery, conformism and greyness of spirit. We've got to show our people that there is a third and exciting possibility to which Australians can contribute. We've got to release the creative forces of our day to help them to build that. There could be no greater message to all of us than that. It is because of this vision of Manning Clark that we are all very sad about his death. I am sure, though, that his spirit will live in Australia for many centuries, and I send my sympathies to Dymphna and his family.

19,Mr HAWKE,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I inform the House that the Minister for Community Services and Health, Mr Howe, left Australia on 23 May on Government business overseas and will return on 17 June. In his absence the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Scrvices, Mr Staples, is the Acting Minister. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Humphreys, is en route from Crete and will be absent from Question Time today. Questions normally addressed to Mr Humphreys should be directed to Mr Staples. The Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, Mr Simmons, is attending an Australian tourism exchange meeting in Melbourne and will also be absent from Question Time today. Questions which would normally be addressed to Mr Simmons should be directed to the portfolio Minister, Mrs Kelly. NA NA",25
20,Dr HEWSON,POLITICAL ADVERTISING,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I preface my question by advising the House that I have today received advice directly from the Federal Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Burdekin, which he has prodecadent vided at my request, in regard to the Government's Bill dealing with political disclosures and an advertising ban. Mr Burdekin strengthens his previous advice to the Government that this Bill contravenes basic rights, saying: the proposed ban is so radically inconsistent with the right to freedom of expression and information as to constitute or authorise 'destruction of rights' and therefore to be impermissible under Article 5. That is article 5 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I ask the Prime Minister: in the light of this clear and forthright advice from the Human Rights Commissioner which shows the Bill to be defective, will he now withdraw the Bill and reintroduce fair and equitable disclosure legislation which both sides of the Parliament can support?",25
21,Mr HAWKE,POLITICAL ADVERTISING,"We are quite aware of the problems on the other side of the House. We have none on this side. The Government is still discussing the matter with Mr Burdekin. On the question of Australia's international obligations, the Government has received from the Office of International Law in the Attorney General's Department advice that the proposed ban on electronic advertising is not in conflict with our obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Attorney-General and, through him, the Government have accepted this advice and are satisfied that the Bill is consistent with Australia's international obligations. The Leader of the Opposition says that he has the advice from Mr Burdekin. I table both that advice and the advice from the Office of International Law in the Attorney General's Department to which I have referred.",26
22,Dr HEWSON,POLITICAL ADVERTISING,I seek leave to table the advice I have received today.,26
23,Mr SPEAKER,POLITICAL ADVERTISING,I think the Prime Minister has said that he would table the same advice. NA,26
24,Mr MARTIN,CONSUMPTION TAX,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Mr MCGauran interjecting,26
25,Mr SPEAKER,CONSUMPTION TAX,Order! The honourable member for Gippsland!,26
26,Mr MARTIN,CONSUMPTION TAX,Has the Treasurer's attention been drawn to a proposal that State governments levy broad based taxes on goods and services? What are the implications for national economic management of such a proposal? What are the Government's intentions in this matter?,26
27,Mr KEATING,CONSUMPTION TAX,"The first implication for national economic management of such a proposal is that it would be inflationary; the second is that it would lead to higher levels of government expenditure; and the third probably is that we would see the haphazard application of taxes which would change the incidence of taxation from one State to another. That is why the Government, amongst other reasons, has said no to a consumption tax. But that is also why inexplicably not just State governments of a conservative persuasion but also the conservative party itself, the Liberal-National Party coalition itself, supports it. As at this time, we have no details of this proposal, and the Leader of the Opposition had this to say on the weekend: We have to be prepared to explain the substance of our position and tell people )Vhere we want to take them. I think there are lessons in this campaignthat is Greiner'sand in other campaigns that when you try to make major changes, you spell it out and you spell it out clearly. It was next said by the journalist, Paul Kelly: The question for Dr Hewson is how the Federal Liberals sell their radical agenda on a sustained basis when it involves far more upheaval than Mr Greiner has caused. In other words, his complaint against the campaign of Greiner was that it was not rabid enough. However, on the subject of explanations and telling people, of the Leader of the Opposition explaining his position, we on this side of the House would like to know the answers to these questions: what rate is the consumption tax that he wishes to apply going to be? What goods is it going to cover? Will it cover food, clothing, medicine, medical services, dental services, haircuts, bus and taxi fares, building materials, et cetera? What tax treatment will there be for the commodities covered by excises, such as petrol, tobacco, beer and spirits? What are the details of the compensation package? Will such a proposition be taxing current savings when they are spent? Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition, when he is explaining all these .things which he says he is going to tell everybody about, could explain these tax imposts while he is abolishing the capital gains tax, which he again confirmed in the last week, thereby handing back billions of dollars of accrued but as yet untaxed capital gains, and at the same time explain to us how he will get a zero-Mr Atkinson- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order relating to standing ordcr 145 and relevance. The Treasurer is asking questions of the Opposition that obviously cannot be answercd at the moment. Government members-Ha, hal",26
28,Mr SPEAKER,CONSUMPTION TAX,Order! Members on my right will cease interjecting. The member for Isaacs has raised a point of order on standing order 145. Mr Atkinson-Those questions cannot be answered in the context of Question Time. The matters raised by the Treasurer are not relevant to his position as a Minister and therefore he should be ruled out of order.,27
29,Mr SPEAKER,CONSUMPTION TAX,Order! The Treasurer is answering the question. The Treasurer will come back to the question.,27
30,Mr KEATING,CONSUMPTION TAX,"Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition can give an explanation of how a zero inflation rate will be achieved while levying a 15 per cent tax on all goods-that is, a 15 per cent increase in the price level; details of how the health and education vouchers will work and how people will be protected; how a private social security payment system will work; indeed, how $3,OOOm-worth of outlays will be cut and where the incidence will be. Mr Atkinson- Mr Speaker, I raise a further point of order relating to standing order 145. You asked the Treasurer to come back to the question and he is continuing with the same answer. Mr Speaker, I ask you to rule him out of order.",27
31,Mr SPEAKER,CONSUMPTION TAX,Order! The Treasurer is answering the question. Has the Treasurer completed his answer?,27
32,Mr KEATING,CONSUMPTION TAX,"No, Mr Speaker. For . these rca sons the Government will not have a bar of a consumption tax', and we look forward to this explanation. I finish my remarks on this point. The journalist said: Dr Hcwson announced yesterday that the Federal Liberals had changed 'in a fundamental sense our Federal campaign techniques'. That was followed by a three-word sentence which said: This is news. That was from Paul Kelly. News indeed! If there is a less radical alternative in the mind of the Leader of the Oppositionwhich he says his conservative colleagues in New South Wales failed to presenthe might tell us firstly what the radical alternative is in its detail so that at least we, along with the public, will have a chance to make a judgment about the veracity of his claims and his capacity to construct a policy.",27
33,Mr SPEAKER,CONSUMPTION TAX,Order! I understand that the Prime Minister has granted leave for the tabling of a document by the Leader of the Opposition. NA,27
34,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"My question is again directed to the Prime Minister. Is it a fact that Senator Richardson, Senator Loosley and Mr Hogg have all admitted that the continuing Labor leadership feud has damaged the Prime Minister's capacity to govern Australia? Were the wild gyrations in the currency yesterday in response to speculation about the Treasurer's future further evidence of instability? When will the Prime Minister accept that to resolve the leadership issue once and for all he must get rid of his incompetent Treasurer and disloyal deputy?",27
35,Mr HAWKE,PRIME MINISTER,"I am afraid that those opposite will have to put up, as they have since 1983, with the most deadly combination in post-war politics-Hawke and Keating. NA",27
36,Mr HULLS,CONSUMPTION TAX,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister inform the House of the implications of a consumption tax for rural areas of Australia?,28
37,Mr HAWKE,CONSUMPTION TAX,"I can say that without doubt a broad-based consumption tax would have a dramatic impact on rural Australia. A 15 per cent tax on all goods would be a devastating blow to the bush; one can put it as simply as that. In the middle of a rural crisis, the coalitionincluding, to its great discredit, the National Party of Australia-would increase farmers' costs through higher inflation, higher wages and higher interest rates. In those circumstances, it is no wonder at all, no surprise, that rural Australia has disowned the National Party. What is worse is that the Leader of the Opposition, as the Treasurer has said, cannot explain how this tax would work. As the Treasurer pointed out, the Leader of the Opposition said on the weekend: When you try to make major change, you spell it out and you spell it out clearly. It is very interesting to note, however, that when the Leader of the Opposition had his chance in Cairns last week to spell out clearly the treatment of the freight component under the consumption tax, the man who was going to spell it out clearly and in detail replied: Well, it just depends on how the freight component is treated in your accounts. See, in principle the tax is a levy, but in a business sense there would be a rebate on various stages of the production process. Now I'd have to look at the specific case to give you a more detailed answer, I'm sorry. 'I am sorry', he said. So the Leader of the Opposition should be sorry. I would say that certainly Mr Greiner is very sorry. The Leader of the Opposition has failed his own test. He said, 'You had to spell it out clearly and in detail'. When he is given the opportunity of answering what was a very important question as far as rural Australia is concerned-what is the impact of this; what is the impact of it on the freight component-Mr MCGauran-Welcome back, Laurie. Have you got the numbers yet?",28
38,Mr SPEAKER,CONSUMPTION TAX,Order! The honourable member for Gippsland!,28
39,Mr HAWKE,CONSUMPTION TAX,"That is something that he shares with every member on this side of the House-they will all come back. We cannot say the same for honourable members opposite. The Leader of the Opposition has failed his own test. He said, 'You have t<;> spell it out clearly'. But when a very simple question is put to him about the impact of a consumption tax on the freight component-Mr MCGaw'an inteljecting",28
40,Mr SPEAKER,CONSUMPTION TAX,The honourable member for Gippsland!,28
41,Mr HAWKE,CONSUMPTION TAX,He simply says that he does not know-he does not know the answer.,28
42,Mr SPEAKER,CONSUMPTION TAX,Order! The honourable member for Bennelong will cease interjecting.,28
43,Mr HOWARD,CONSUMPTION TAX,I was not. I was talking to the Minister.,28
44,Mr SPEAKER,CONSUMPTION TAX,"The honourable member for Bennelong will cease interjecting across the chamber. If the honourable member wants to have a meeting outside, I might facilitate that.",28
45,Mr HAWKE,CONSUMPTION TAX,"All I can say is that on this side of the House we are waiting with great pleasure for the Leader of the Opposition to spell out, in all the gory details, what he is proposing. When we hear that we will be able to say not only to rural Australia, as was contained in this question, but to every Australian in this country, 'Here is another example of the politics of privilege'. The coalition will impose a tax on all ordinary Australians for what purpose? It will do so not because it has any concern about decent economic management but so that it can fund the handing back of billions of dollars to the most privileged minority in this country. NA",28
46,Mr REITH,WHOLESALE SALES TAX SYSTEM,"My question without notice is to the Prime Minister, who has just expressed his implacable opposition to a goods and services tax as it affects ordinary Australians. I therefore ask the Prime Minister: will he explain to the House his rationale for the wholesale sales tax system which, through its cascading effect, ensures an effective tax rate on food at 3.3 per cent, on housing at 7.4 per cent, on furnishings and appliances at 8.5 per cent and, if one is talking about country Australia, on transport at 8.1 per cent? For g06d measure, he might just tell us whether he is a shrinking violet or just a common or garden variety type of hypocrite.",28
47,Mr SPEAKER,WHOLESALE SALES TAX SYSTEM,Order! I might remind honourable members on both sides of the chamber that that type of language does not help the debate.,29
48,Mr HAWKE,WHOLESALE SALES TAX SYSTEM,"Will you just give me a few moments, Mr Speaker, to recover from that devastating attack! Mr Downer-You don't mind Keating's language!",29
49,Mr SPEAKER,WHOLESALE SALES TAX SYSTEM,Order! I warn the honourable member for Mayo.,29
50,Mr HAWKE,WHOLESALE SALES TAX SYSTEM,"The simple answer to the question that has been put by the shadow Treasurer is this: the reason that those opposite are proposing the broad based consumption tax is not to reduce the tax burden upon the citizens of this country in terms of getting from them a lower revenue in respect of the goods which they purchase. They are proposing that they will have a broad-based consumption tax which will have a larger impact-not a reduced impact-on all the services and the goods which the honourable member referred to. Unfortunately, when we go to the next point and ask, 'Why are you doing this to raise more revenue and why are you doing it in an inequitable way so that it means a pensioner will pay the same money amount as the millionaire'-in other words, that it will be a regressive tax which has a significantly greater burden on the poor and the underprivileged in this country-the answer is a very simple one. They are going to impose a greater burden on the poor, the underprivileged, the least able to help themselves in this country for the base and demeaning reason that they will take it out of the pockets of the least privileged to shove it back by the billions into the pockets of the most privileged in this country. If those opposite think that in 1993 that is a good basis on which to go to the electorate, all I can say from this side of the House is, 'Good luck to you. We hope and pray that you will stick to your guns. We are looking forward to that election when you think you can persuade the overwhelming majority of Australians that it makes sense to take money from the poor, the underprivileged, the low and middle income people of this country, to shove billions of dollars into the pockets of the rich'. We relish and look forward greatly to that election. If those opposite go on that basis, they will get wiped as they deserve to get wiped. NA",29

53,Mrs DARLING,TRAINING GUARANTEE SCHEME,"I refer to debates in this House on the Minister's reforms in the areas of employment, education and training, including the issue of who pays. In this context, will the Minister inform the House whether the training guarantee will result in an increased commitment to expenditure for training by enterprises?",29

Therefore, I want to share with the House and the people of Australia some recent evidence which has been collected by no less an authoritative source than the Australian Bureau of Statistics in relation to its training expenditure survey. It covers the September quarter of 1990, which was three months to six months after the introduction of the training guarantee. It demonstrates quite unambiguously that training expenditure has increased in the important areas where we wanted to achieve that result. It does belie very clearly the allegation coming from the Opposition that this is in fact a tax because, to the extent that employers spend more on training-at least one per cent this year and 11/2 per cent next yearthey will make no contribution at all to the Government. It is only in those circumstances, which we hope will be exceedingly rare, where an employer decides quite deliberately not to make that expenditure that there is any obligation on them to pay a levy to the Government. It is clear from the Bureau that the average level of training expenditure for all private sector employers increased in that September quarter, compared with the September quarter 12 months earlier, from 1.7 per cent to 2.2 per cent. In relation to the group of employers who are covered by the training guarantee, those with a payroll in excess of $200,000, that increase was from 1.9 per cent to 2.4 per cent. Most importantly, the numbers in the target area-those who arc spending nothing on training-decreased from 58 per cent to 42 per cent, and those who were not spending the one per cent minimum decreased from nearly three-quarters to just over a half. Notwithstanding the horrific claims made· by the Opposition about what a dreadful imposition this would be and what an horrific piece of unwanted intervention this was, we have seen that the Australian corporate sector employers generally have responded, as indeed they should have, to improve the expenditure on training. Employers in Australia understand-this is something which the Opposition would find totally beyond its comprehension-that if they want to remain in business and want to be competitive in an increasingly exposed Australian economy, it will be necessary for them to improve the skills not only of their current work force, but of those whom they recruit to their ranks over the years ahead. This is a very gratifying result. If I can be brave enough to make another prophecy, I expect that when the Bureau measures what happens in the September quarter just ahead of us, the results of which will not be known until sometime next year, we will see an even greater increase and, therefore, an even greater response on the part of corporate Australia to this important measure, based as it is on improving the skill level of the Australian work force. NA",29
55,Mr LLOYD,TREASURER,"I direct my question to the Treasurer. Is a constant climate of leadership speculation conducive to good economic management? What has the Treasurer done to promote good economic management by reducing leadership speculation and, in particular, by stopping his supporters from destabilising the Prime Minister? When will the Treasurer promote good economic management by having the eourage to challenge the Prime Minister openly instead of undermining him behind his back? In short, will the Treasurer put up or shut up?",30
56,Mr KEATING,TREASURER,"What a terribly original question! The gyrations in the exchange rate, which the Leader of the Opposition referred to earlier, were I think only some basis points in the exchange rate. I think I am able to say that on this side of the House leadership has never interrupted the flow of economic decisions which have come from this Government since 1983, but they have on the other side of the House. I have said on the public record, and I am happy to say again, that this issue will be an issue of relevance on our side of politics only when the Prime Minister deigns it to be. On the Opposition's side of politics, it has been the on and off show between the honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable member for Bennelong, then the honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable member for Bennelong's adviser. There is going to be a lot more leadership speculation on that side of politics as people understand before the next election-as the Prime Minister said-what the Opposition is trying to sell in this radical alternative of taxing people on everything they use while at the same time shifting billions of dollars of tax liabilities under capital gains back to a small proportion of the population and not protecting the weak and the poor through Medicare and a decent social security system. When we try all this hard tackmuch harder than anything Mr Greiner ever proposed-then we will find that the leadcrship speculation on the Opposition side of the House gets back to the normal ferment that we on this side of the House have come to expect from it. EUROPEAN COMMUNITY: FARM NA",30
57,Mr HARRY WOODS,SUPPORT PRICE PACKAGE,I direct my question to the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development. Can he inform honourable members of the implications for Australia of the European Community's farm support pricc package for 1991-92?,31
58,Dr BLEWETT,SUPPORT PRICE PACKAGE,"I thank the honourable member for Page for his question and note that the Government welcomes the fact that the European Community, after its usual fairly prolonged period of internal negotiations, has finally agreed an agricultural budget for 1991-92. However, we have to note that the proposals which have been agreed do not really constitute a serious or a substantive step towards agricultural reform within the European Community. We regard that as a pity. We had seen the formulation of these price proposals as an opportunity for the European Community to set guidelines and parameters for the reform of the common agricultural policy itself and then to blend its reform procedures into the context of the Uruguay Round negotiations. It seems to me that the European Community has missed the opportunity to institute serious reform. In fact, when one looks at the price proposals, one sees that the European Community has diluted its original modest proposals for price cuts and production restraints. In so far as the European Community takes any steps at all towards reform, of course, those steps are to be welcomed and encouraged, but we have to be careful not to overstate the extent of what the Europeans have done. I notice that one observer has said that the price fixing package was a minimum starting point as far as European credibility was concerned. The problem that the European Community faces with the common agricultural policy is structural, not cyclical. It is not just a temporary problem it has this year with the budget. These problems are manifest now in huge stock levels-especially for beef and dairy produce-in declining farm incomes, in environmental degradation, and in the distortion of world agricultural trade. It is in the European Community'S own interests, as well as the interests of all other agricultural exporters and all involved in world trade, that the European Community address these issues. We look forward to the expansion and refinement of the European Community Commission paper on reform of the common agricultural policy. In this case we will be looking for some real detail, particularly on price cuts and production controls. We also call on the European on Community to take up the bigger challenge of initiating agricultural reform in the context of the whole Uruguay Round. While I am on this point-I notice that the Leader of the National Party of Australia is not with us, being absent overseas on parliamentary business-let me say that I welcome his raising with Chancellor Kohl in Crete the issues of the price proposals and also the general issues of the common agricultural policy. We very much need that bipartisan support in order to persuade the Europeans to shift their position because, unless they shift their position, it will be very difficult to bring the Uruguay Round talks to a successful conclusion. NA",31
59,Mr REITH,ECONOMY,"I ask the Prime Minister whether he still confidently asserts that the Australian economy is in a recovery now, given particularly that company profits for the March quarter fell 29 per cent, that bankruptcies rose 53 per cent in the March quarter, and that the latest male unemployment rate of 10.3 per cent is the highest since the Great Depression?",31
60,Mr HAWKE,ECONOMY,"Let me refer to that part of the honourable member's question which goes to company profits. The decline in company profits in the March quarter obviously reflects the impact of the recession and, to some extent, the effects of the Gulf crisis. The loss of fall profits from petroleum in the March quarter was the dominant contributor to the fall in mining and wholesale profits. There is no doubt that company profits will rebound once the economy begins to recover later this year. Lower net interest payments are alrcady cushioning the downward trend in profits. The future prospects for company profits will be assisted by lower inflation, by lower interest rates, by micro-economic reform and by the wage restraint delivered by this Government. The share of profits in gross national product will be maintained at the high levels achieved by this Government. They had, of course, totally collapsed previously under the policies of our predecessors. It is only under the policies of this Government, which has seen the preparedness of the trade union movement to accept a reduction in wages share and a shift to profits, that we have seen the levels of profit reach those sorts of levels which in the last three years have seen investment come to a record levcl of gross domestic product. As to the broader aspect of the honourable member's question, J remain confident that in the second half of this calendar year and through 1992 we will see an economic recovery taking place. This is because we have put in place the right policy settings. Let me remind the honourable gentleman opposite that official interest rates have been cut by 7 112 percentage points since early 1990. I suppose that even the shadow Treasurer has a sufficient understanding of economic forces to understand that a reduction of 7lj2 percentage points in interest rates must have a beneficial effect. Wages growth is being held in check by the accord framework. We have a situation where the automatic fiscal stabilisers are operating, while the structural integrity of the Budget will remain intact. In addition to those factors, we expect business to begin rebuilding stocks. We expect to see the housing industry move into its cyclical upswing. As the honourwindable member would know, there is a high level of pent-up demand at present and it is the case that the Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry expects a 13 per cent increase in housing starts in the coming year. Obviously the indicators are mixed but, when one takes all those fundamental factors into account, we on this side of the House in government believe and hopeas distinct perhaps from those on the other side of the House-that in fact-Air Reith inteljecting",31
61,Mr HAWKE,ECONOMY,"No, I am making the distinction. We believe that there will be recovery. In addition to believing, we hope that there will be recovery. I doubt whether honourable members opposite share that hope. NA",32
62,Mr COURTICE,FRASER ISLAND,"My question is directed to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. Could she inform the House what action the Federal Government is taking to nominate Fraser Island for inclusion in the World Heritage List now that the Queensland Government's commission of inquiry has recommended that this be done?",32
63,Mrs KELLY,FRASER ISLAND,"J thank the honourable member for his question and for his continuing interest in environmental matters. It is amazing whom one can convert; I think that question will ruin him in his el ectorate! I thank the honourable member for his question. I also welcome the report of the inquiry into the future of Fraser Island. which was conducted over a 12-month period by Tony Fitzgerald, QC. The report consists of several volumes and [ have not had time to fully analyse it; however, for many years the Commonwealth has said to the Queensland Government that it would be very pleased to consider a request for World Heritage nomination of Fraser Island and the Great Sandy Region. We have recently received a letter from the Queensland Premier and I look forward to having discussions with the Queensland Government on proceedter ing towards that nomination. It is very doubtful whether we will have time actually to nominate this year, beable cause nominations have to be in by the October deadline, but we will need to discuss the details with Queensland. It also extremely important that when we proceed with nomination-and I say when rather than if-we have a management regime in place. I am particularly pleased that we have received some bipartisan support for this. I notice that the Leader of the Liberal Party in Queensland, Denver Beanland, supports World Heritage listing of Fraser Island, so the honourable member Hinkler is in very good company there. However, the National Party continues with its ehainsaw mentality. The National Party shadow Minister for environment and heritage in Queensland, aMI' Elliott, said in a recent press release, presumably after he had read and digested all the details of the report, that the National Party was totally opposed to World Heribrokers tage listing, stating that it was massive overkill of what was needed to protect Fraser Island. After the detailed inquiry by Tony Fitz15 gerald, this Government will consider the recommendations that have been ularly made. We will not respond in an ad hoc way-as the National Party has been ests doing, and even continues to do in this Parliament-but rather will regard the port very seriously. We look forward to the free market. detailed discussions with the Queensland Government on the World Heritage nomlutely ination of Fraser Island. NA",32
64,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,WOOL,"Will the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy explain to the House why he directed the Australian Wool Corporation, against its wishes, to release 100,000 bales of greasy wool from the wool stockpile onto the auction market? Will he further explain why he would not allow the Australian Wool Corporation to release the - lent amount of wool from its value added wool stockpile, which the industry strategically placed throughout the world to cafor such shortfalls as the market is currently experiencing? !VIr KERIN-First of all, the honourgentleman has his facts wrong. I took 1 the decision to release 100,000 bales of wool from the stockpile after six days of is being constantly enjoined to do so by the Australian Wool Corporation. Some parts of the question are right. We had told othcr people that we were going to freeze the stockpile, and that was a decision that we all arrivcd at through the Interim Wool Industry Policy Council, because, as we entcred into the phase of selling under the 700c umbrella, we thought that, to maintain confIdence, it was essential that we for hold the stockpile frozen. On the advice of the brokers and other people in the industry, we were working on the idea that there would be rosterings of about 140,000 bales a week. It became obvious that the price was lifting and lifting. This was mainly due to the fact that the rosterings were well below what the had said they would be and there was some suspicion that some people were holding back wool because there is now a 25 per cent tax, whereas there will be a pcr cent tax after I July. It was agreed all by evcryone in the industry-and particput to me very strongly by the Wool Corporation-that it was not in the interof the industry to have a price spike at this time and thcn to have a drop in rethe price on 1 July when we enter into Given that the industry has an absovital concern in this matter, I ran the suggestion across the Wool Council of Australia and also the International Wool Textile Organisation. The private treaty merchants, the brokers, the Corporation, the Wool Council and the International Wool Textile Organisation all said that in the circumstances it was appropriate and sensible to do so. On the understanding that there was ncar total support from the industry, that is what 1 did, because I equivathought thcy were right. DEFENCE FORCE PERSONNEL: NA",33
65,Mr BEVIS,HOME LOANS,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. Is the Minister aware that Australian Defence Force members who joined the Services before May 1985 and who served in the Gulf are eligible for a war service loan, whilst those who joined after 1985 are not? Does the Minister intend to make any changes to ensure that all members receive a similar benefit? MI' Beale-Yes or no?",34
66,Mr SPEAKER,HOME LOANS,Order! The member for Bruce will cease interjecting.,34
67,Mr BILNEY,HOME LOANS,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Having visited his electorate recently, I know of his commitment to the welfare of service members. The war service loan to which the honourable member refers was awarded to members with active service under the provisions of the defence service homes scheme administered by my colleague the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who unfortunately is not here today. That scheme was closed in May 1985, when Cabinet made a decision to introduce a new retention based home loan assistance scheme with a six-year qualifying period. That scheme, the Australian Defence Force home loan assistance scheme, came into effect on 15 May this year. The new scheme offers service personnel access to a $40,000 loan, compared with the $25,000 under the previous scheme, with a subsidy equal to 40 per cent of the average monthly interest payments. It is different from the defence service home scheme, with different intentions and different benefits. When it was designedand basically it is a peacetime schemeit was decided not to build in the equivalent of a war service loan. Because we are in a transitional stage between the two schemes, some members who served in the Gulf were eligible for the war service loan and some were not. The Government has taken the view that it would be inequitable if members serving alongside each other in this conflict were accorded benefits of significantly ferent magnitude simply because they belonged to different home loan schemes. Consequently, the Government very recently decided that Australian Defence Force members who joined the services after May 1985 and who served in the Gulf will be entitled to a 16-year period of subsidy under the new defence home loan assistance scheme regardless of how long they have served. That period has been carefully calculated so that the benefits accorded to serving members under either scheme are approximately equal. I commend those changes to honourable members. I am pleased that we have been able to rectify this anomaly. NA NA",34
68,Mr ANDERSON,INSPECTION SERVICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Resources. How does the Minister justify his so-called independent inquiry into the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) when he gives the consultant just four weeks to complete his task? How does the Minister justify the fact and the timing of the 3.8 per cent increase in meat inspection charges which were announced just one day after the inaugural meeting of the meat inspection charging review, whose terms of reference include an evaluation of the effectiveness of current charging arrangements for meat inspection? Finally, is it not fact that the administrative costs of AQIS have dClubled in the last three years?",34
69,Mr GRIFFITHS,INSPECTION SERVICE,"There is some detail here, and I think it is appropriate to go to the detail. That is what was requested, and I am happy to do that. The honourable member asked a series of questions. The first issue goes to the appointment of a consultant. In that context, as with other inquiries, I have never taken the view that paralysis of analysis is the way to go. In the industry there is a sense of urgency about reforms-I think much needed reforms-and I think there is some force to that view. I have acted quite consistently with that. I might say that Ernst and Young, the organisation that has been retained-its dif- appointment has been welcomed by the industry; the honourable member is out of kilter with those he purports to represent in this context-has an international reputation in regard to these sorts of reviews. While there are different viewssome argue that more time should be allowed for review of these issues-I think the burden of opinion right across all those organisations that draw on AQIS's expertise would be that my view about the potential for paralysis of analysis is an appropriate one. In my view, it is an important consideration that if those people are being paid good fees and clearly have the resources available to them to conduct a review in a specific time frame, we ought to embrace the sense of urgency the industry has indicated. Given that the honourable member has canvassed ad nauseam in this chamber the issue of the AQIS revised charges for 1991-92, I would have thought he would have properly informed himself on some of the figures. Where we have for the 1991-92 year a clear reduction in real terms of 4 per cent in total AQIS costs, I would have thought that that should be a matter of congratulation rather than condemnation. I might say in that context that one would go back a long way in the history of this Federation to find similar indications of public sector organisations being able to achieve those types of results. It is not the occasion here to canvass the extent of the reforms already embraced by AQIS, but they are considerable. That is not to say that there is not considerable room for further improvement, and the processes we have embarked upon are. directed towards that end. I know that the honourable member in the context of the New South Wales abattoirs dispute, which was about the introduction of 100 per cent cost recovery, attempted to bring about a destruction of the national scheme of meat inspection. That is what was being pursued by some of the renegade elements in the industry. The honourable member is only a young bloke; he is only a young bull in the National Party, but some of the old bulls, particularly the one sitting next to him, might advise him of some of the recommendations arising out of the royal commission inquiring into the meat substitution scandal. Mr MCGauran-Sixty-three inspectors and no abattoirs.",34
70,Mr GRIFFITHS,INSPECTION SERVICE,"I will come to that in a moment. What they indicated quite clearly was that the national and uniform inspection service was a condition precedent to having a system of integrity in our meat inspection system in this country. In effect, it was a condition precedent to ensuring that one of our largest export industries was properly monitored and properly supervised. I might say that no-one in the industry has defended the occasional renegade. People in the industry who have some standing and authority have indicated to me that the actions of some of those abattoir owners, and one in particular, were the actions of cowboys and renegadesand the actions of a fool, as someone else also put to me. If the honourable member wants to align himself with those people, well and good. As to the interjection of the honourable member for Gippsland and his allegation about 63 inspectors being based in areas where there are no abattoirs, I make the point that all those inspectors put in a full day's work.",35
71,Mr LLOYD,INSPECTION SERVICE,That's laughable.,35
72,Mr GRIFFITHS,INSPECTION SERVICE,They are all employed full time as meat inspectors. Mr MCGauran-Can you list the abattoirs they inspect?,35
73,Mr GRIFFITHS,INSPECTION SERVICE,"They travel at the instance of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to appropriate abattoirs. Mr MCGauran-No, it is not working. Sorry, we can't swallow it.",35
74,Mr SPEAKER,INSPECTION SERVICE,Order! I ask the honourable member for Gippsland to cease interjecting.,35
75,Mr GRIFFITHS,INSPECTION SERVICE,"I make a further point that it is in the nature of the industry that if someone wants to open an abattoir in, for example, Tennant Creek, that persol). has an entitlement to require Commonwealth inspectors to be located in that area. One of the challenges for the Service is how to distribute across a large continent-Mr MCGauran-Sit down. You are only a young Minister.",35
76,Mr SPEAKER,INSPECTION SERVICE,Order! The honourable member for Gippsland will cease interjecting or I will deal with him.,36
77,Mr GRIFFITHS,INSPECTION SERVICE,"Let me say that, if one has a considered view, one has every entitlement to put that considered view to the review process that is currently under way.

79,Mrs CROSIO,POSTAL RATES,I ask the Minister for Land Transport whether the Australian Postal Corporation has deferred its application for an increase in the basic postage rate?,36
80,Mr ROBERT BROWN,POSTAL RATES,"I appreciate the question from the honourable member for Prospect. In fact, that is precisely what Australia Post has done: The intention was that the increase of 2c in the cost of a standard letter was to be introduced from the start of September. As a result of those outstanding inflation results, Australia Post at board and management level has decided to defer that increase. I think there are two important elements of that decision. The first element is that it reflects very favourably on the success the Government has had in being able to contain the inflation rate. It is a positive example of the way in which that lower inflation rate is flowing on to consumers. I know the honourable member for Prospect was particularly concerned that examples of that flow on be identified and, if possible, quantified as well. In terms of the concern indicated by the honourable member for Prospect, the quantifiable benefit of that delay of four months in increasing the cost of a standard letter for Australian mail users is about $15m. There is a flow on in the first place from that reduced inflation rate. The other thing it does is to indicate the success the Government has had in relation to government business enterprises and in giving the boards and management of those enterprises a commercial responsibility. Quite clearly, in this particular case, it is also tempered by a social response on the part of people such as Maurice Williams, the Chairman, Rae Taylor, the Managing Director, and all those people on the Board and in the management of Australia Post who have been able to provide a social edge to commercial decisions. I think it is particularly important for us to understand that Australia Post has been able to continue to provide services in a commercial way and to be subject to normal commercial imperatives-to do that in a competitive way and to maintain its edge in a market, even in those areas where there is significant competition, quite apart from those services which are reserved to it. It is also significant, in considering the success of Australia Post, for us to realise that, if Australia Post had been in the process since 1975 of increasing the cost of, say, a standard letter at the same rate as the consumer price index (CPI), then from 1 January next year, when the cost of a standard letter will be 45c, it would otherwise have been about 70c. That represents a reduction of about 35 per cent in real terms in the cost of posting a standard letter. That reflects great credit on Australia Post. It reflects great credit as well on the approach this Government has taken towards the sorts of responsibilities. it has chosen to give government business enterprises. I also want to express my appreciation to Professor Alan Fells, the Chairman of the Prices Surveillance Authority, for his contribution to the consideration of this matter. I know that the Prices Surveillance Authority was in the process of considering that increase proposed from 1 September. It will now continue to give consideration to the increase proposed from 1 January next year. The last point I wish to make is that when that 2c increase in the cost of a standard letter occurs from 1 January it will represent an increase of 4.7 per cent in the cost of a standard letter. That will compare with an estimated increase of 5.5 per cent in the consumer price index since the last increase. Australia Post has able to contain the cost of a standard journed. letter significantly below the CPI since 1975 and, quite clearly, continues to do so. As I have indicated to the honourable member for Prospect, the constituents in western Sydney-those people about whom she is particularly concerned-and their fellow Australians will benefit to the extent of $15m as a result of the lower inflation rate and that decision by Australia Post.",36

83,Mr HAWKE,AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL,"by leave-Today is the thirtieth anthc niversary of the foundation of Amnesty Earlier today I had the repleasure, with the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), of addressing a public meeting in the Great Hall to celebrate this event. I rise now to place on the record of this Parliament the appreciation of my for Amnesty's tireless work Discloover the past three decades. Since its inception in 1961, Amnesty International has been one of the most consistent, compassionate and effective voices in defence of human rights around world. I am therefore particularly to note that the first Parliamentary Group of Amnesty International was here in Australia. That the group has the strong support of all parties rep63 resented in the Parliament is a tribute to Amnesty's well-earned reputation for inand impartiality. The leaders all the major parties are patrons and of members of parliament are Amnesty International has had a remarkable degree of success. Amnesty tohas over one million members, Road subscribers and regular donors in more than 150 countries and territories around the world. In 1977 the organisation was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace in recognition of its superb record in gaining worldwide support to assist the victims of human rights abuse-at the last count, more than 42,000 of them. This success should not lead us to underestimate the continuing extent of human rights problems globally. For example, prisoners of conscience are thought to be held in nearly half the countries of the world and in 50 countries political prisoners can still be held without charge or trial. In 1989, torture and ill treatment of prisoners were reported in 96 countries. Extrajudicial executions were reported in more than 40 countries and 'disappearances' in more than 20 countries. So, much remains to be done. The Australian Government remains firmly committed to doing whatever it can to promote respect for human rights, both in Australia and around the world, in accordance with the principles enshrined in the declarations, covenants and conventions of the United Nations. In recent years Australia has taken a leading role at the United Nations to develop major new international human rights instruments, such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Second Optional Protocol Against the Death Pcnalty, both of which we ratified last year. Australia is also active in making representations directly to foreign governments about allegations of human rights abuse, wherever they occur. In 1989-90, for example, Australian Government Ministers and officials made direct representations to 443 different groups or individuals in 87 different countries. These representations have not always been welcome. But they have been necessary, and in not a few cases they have been successful. Indeed, I am confident that Australia's unflagging work on human rights issues, both bilaterally and multilaterally, has gained us a great deal of international respect and credibility. This work has become a significant element of our foreign policy. The Government has also been concerned to rectify domestic human rights problems. The question of Aboriginal deaths in custody, for example, has attracted adverse attention both domestically and internationally, ineluding from organisations such as Amnesty International. The final report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, tabled earlier this month by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner), found, to put it simply, that so many Aborigines die in custody because they are in custody far too often. While the Royal Commission's report on aspects of the legal and corrective services systems in Australia gives much cause for concern, the report also recommends wide-ranging actions to tackle all aspects of Aboriginal disadvantage. The Government is committed to ensuring a coordinated and comprehensive national response to the Royal Commission's final report. I have written to all Premiers and Chief Ministers on the matter and I am confident that the necessary cooperation will be forthcoming. Mr Deputy Speaker, Amnesty International has been held in very high regard in this country since its foundation. I am sure Australians and Australian governments will continue to support it for as long as human rights abuses continue to occur, whereyer they occur.",37
84,Dr HEWSON,AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL,"by leave-The Federal Opposition is pleased to join in supporting wholeheartedly the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Thirty years ago today a London lawyer, Peter Berenson, launched a newspaper appeal highlighting the fate of those whom he called the forgotten prisoners. The candle of conscience he lit that day rapidly spread its light around the world through the work of the organisation which we salute today-Amnesty International. From those humble beginnings, Amnesty International has grown in size and in influence. It now has over one million members, subscribers and regular donors in over 150 countries and it maintains more than 4,000 voluntary groups in 70 countries. Amnesty International has over 30,000 members and supporters in Australia, nearly two-thirds of the members and senators of this Parliament being numbered among them. What makes Amnesty International such an outstanding international organisation is not its size or its growth over the past 30 years. What distinguishes it is what it stands for and how it works. Today we salute Amnesty International for its many achievements. First, we applaud it for its effectiveness in an area of work that is inherently difficult and sometimes hazardous. Since 1961 Amnesty International has adopted or investigated more than 42,000 cases, of which 38,000 cases are now closed. Whether it be through its representations to individual governments, or through its urgent action network, or through its medical action program, or through its general publicity work, Amnesty International is an organisation that has pursued its high ideals with commitment and courage. It has comforted political prisoners and embarrassed their gaolers in a way that no other private organisation has. The ideals which drive Amnesty International-namely, to secure the immediate and unconditional release of all prisoners of conscience, to ensure fair and prompt trials for all political prisoncrs, and to demand an end to all torture and executions-are ideals that demand persistence and hard, unrelenting work in the face of the inhumanity of one human being to another. Amnesty International has put in the necessary hard work over many years. Its achievements are ones of which it can be proud. I have been very conscious of human rights issues in my meetings with international leaders, particularly those in our region. For example, in September last year in Beijing I expressed the Opposition's human rights concerns directly to the leaders of the People's Republic of China. The Federal Opposition has also explored the possibility of new mechanisms to encourage and monitor respect for human rights in the Asia-Pacific region. In December last year we proposed the formation of a new informal consultative body for that purpose. Wc cnvisaged that membership of that body could come from regional governmcnts and nongovernment organisations such as Amnesty International. Second, we salute Amnesty International today for the way it has achieved what it has. Amnestv was established on the basis of strict impartiality and independence. For 30 years it has lived up to both the spirit and the letter of that undertaking. Its professionalism is reflected in the quality of its reporting into human rights violations worldwide. That professionalism is enhanced by the fact that Amnesty has never sought or received money from governments-it rises or falls on donations from its members and others. The fact that its activities, influence and rcputation continue to grow is the best indication of its effectiveness and of its high standards. Third, we salute Amnesty today for the product of its work. Its aim as an organisation has not bccn to accumulate financial gains, nor to build a network of political powcr. Its real achievement lies in the freedom it has won for ordinary men and women unjustly imprisoned or sentenced to death. Today thousands of these mcn and women owe their freedom, and often their very livcs, to the work of Amnesty International. Most rccently we have witnessed the efiectivcness of Amncsty's work in exposing the human rights abuses committed during Iraq's brief occupation of Kuwait and in the postwar situation when the Kurdish people became the new victims of Iraqi terror, but much of its work elsewhere in the world is no less effective, cven if it is less publicised. Finally, we salute Amnesty today because it is important that we publicise its work at a time when, r believe tragically, its activities have never been needed more. Prisoners of conscience are held in over 70 countries, torture and ill treatment of prisoners has been reported in ovcr 90 countries and extrajudicial executions arc still common and prisoners are tortured in over 90 countries as well. These are cold statistics, but what they signify is a scale of inhumanity that gives the work of Amnesty International a vital and ongoing importance. In the death rows, detention centres and political prisons where people are held because of their beliefs or their colour or their gender, the work of Amnesty International must go on. I am proud to be associated with the Prime Minister, with the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and with the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Powell, as one of the patrons of the Federal Parliamentary Group of Amnesty International Australia. Ever since it was established in 1973, the work of the group has been extremely effective in taking up the cases of prisoners of conscience or those enduring torture or facing execution. It has also been one of the most genuinely bipartisan associations in this Parliament. I congratulate the leadership of the group, and particularly the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner) as its Chairman, and the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) as its Secretary. I wish the group continuing strength and success. One of the last articles which the late Professor Manning Clark wrote concerned the work of Amnesty International. He put it very well when he said that supporting Amnesty meant 'not turning a blind eye or a deaf ear to what is going on in the world'. In congratulating Amnesty International today on its work over 30 years, the Federal Opposition pledges itself to continue to support Amnesty International in its vital work. In doing so, we recommit ourselves to the challenge which Amnesty International issued back in 1961 to men and women everywhere when it called on them to light a candle and not to ignore the darkness. With that commitment firmly in mind, the Federal Opposition is proud to support the remarks of the Prime Minister in this House today. NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",38
85,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AGRICULTURE," Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The need for the Government to address the real problems facing Australian agriculture. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number oj members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their pfaces",40
86,Mr LLOYD,AGRICULTURE,"This Government has deliberately avoided the hard economic decisions necessary to maintain farm viability and profitability in this country, and in fact, by its lack of action, has added to the current and deepening rural depression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the Government to address the real problems facing Australian agriculture. Rural Australia is in depression. It is the worse since the 1930s. Unfortunately, worse is still to come. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has indicated that farm incomes fell 20 per cent last year, a further 59 per cent this year and that there is a further 30 per cent fall to come next year. For wool growers basically it will mean negative incomes. This depression in rural Australia is already far worse than the 1982 recession. If one looks at unemployment-and we have the real figures on unemployment for Australia because of those unpublished figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics-the real unemployment figure in Australia is over 19 per cent, and that is even higher in many regional areas of Australia. In 1982 the drought was a significant feature of that rural recession. Now we already have a worse situation than in 1982, yet the impact of drought is still to be felt. Hopefully, there is still timethere certainly has been some rain in some areas-to overcome that spectre of drought. But, if it does come, then we will have great problems confronting our grazing and grain industries. The viability of thousands of our farmers is at risk. Their future productivity is also at risk, because farmers-to their credit-have for many years had an annual productivity increase of twice the national average. That is why they form one of our most efficient industries and are among the most efficient farmers in the world. However, if they have no money to invest, they cannot continue with that productivity. For example, there were fewer tractors sold last year than in any year since the Second World War. Without cash flow, the essential soil conservation and land care activities on farms for sustainable agriculture will be impossible. For regional communities there is the spectre of a downward spiral: fewer farm families in the area, less spending in the towns, fewer town businesses and fewer government and community services following that reduction in the population. There is this real spectre of a rural depopulation in certain regional areas of Australia, particularly if the drought continues. What has been the Government's response to all of this? It says that nothing can be done because it is all the fault of the corrupt world agricultural trade, of those foreign countries of the European Community and of the United States, and of commodity price cycles. We acknowledge that these external factors are significant; in fact the coalition parties have been very supportive, on a bipartisan basis, of the Government's actions in the Uruguay Round, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and for fairer trade for agriculture. We have also been more positive than the Government with some of the initiatives of a bilateral nature, for example, wool credit to Russia. The two coalition parties have had parliamentary trade groups go to the People's Republic of China. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and others have been to Taiwan, developing trade. We have maintained contact with South Africa and with the Middle East; and particularly with the problems of live sheep and Saudi Arabia we have made positive, ""bipartisan suggestions to the Government-Mr Reith-Which were not taken up.",40
87,Mr LLOYD,AGRICULTURE,"They were not taken up. We have initiated the wheat mission to the United States. So we have made these positive proposals to assist agriculture in Australia and to assist our farmers with their export problems. But from the Government's point of view, beyond the GATT it has no answers, it has no action and it has no hope for the future of our farmers. There is no future harvest for Australia's farmers with this Labor Government, but there is with the coalition parties. We have a well documented policy and it is a policy that has been sustained, not only by us but by the National Farmers Federation and by the Business Council of Australia, and the basic factor in that policy is that the majority of the problems facing Australian farmers and their future profitability and viability come not from external sources, such as corrupt world trade, but from domestic cost problems. I repeat that: the problems are domestic cost problems. ",41
88,Mr LLOYD,AGRICULTURE,"The figure is 60 per cent, as has been indicated by a number of people. Those domestic cost problems are caused by government policy, by this Government's policy, and therefore they can be changed and have to be changed by government policy. The net result is that Australian farmers-for that matter, not only farmers but others who are in business in this country-have far higher costs than do their competitors, and that reduces their profitability and their viability. Not only is the Government not addressing this urgent need for positive action to get costs down in Australia; it is going about trying to confuse the issue in rural Australia by incorrectly and unfairly claiming that the Government's economic policies alfd the coalition's policies are much the same. That is absolute rubbish, and in this terrible situation facing agriculture it should be ashamed to be even trying to present such a confusing and incorrect situation to these people. This difference between the coalition's policy and the Labor Government's policy-and it is a great difference, as I said-is not unique to agriculture, because it applies to the whole cost structure of doing business in this country. But it has greater application to agriculture because more than anyone else our farmers have to face world competition-world competition where those costs are lower and also where there is a greater degree of corruption in trade. Labor has exposed agriculture to the cold blast of world competition. It has reduced tariffs and other forms of assistance and has done so unilaterally, while at the same time the real cost problem facing all Australians-that high cost structure of our domestic industry caused by Labor's mates, the unions and the unionjsed industries-has been exempted; and that is the area where these costs are created. The coalition, as part of its package of policies, will also reduce tariffs-but not unilaterally, because to do so would just mean that we would be bankrupting the people, whether they are farmers or business people. But it is a part of the broad package of labour market and tax reform which will be done at the same time, with no mates and no exceptions. For example, in the recent March statement, when the Labor Government indicated that it would be bringing agriculture and, for that matter, most of manufacturing tariffs down to 5 per cent by 1996, there were different levels of tariff reduction for the motor vehicle and the textile, clothing and footwear industries. They would not, even by the year 2000, be down to the same level but would still be considerably higher. We have indicated, through the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), the shadow Minister for industry, that the same levels of tariff will apply to those industries by the year 2000 as to every other industry in Australia. I know that in this difficult time for many of our farmers it is hard for them to accept, but it is true that tariffs add more to farmers' costs than they assist farmers. Therefore, it is an advantage for that to happen, but it has to happen in unison with those broader economic policies, so that viability is maintained. The honourable member for Mallee mentioned by interjection earlier that about 60 per cent or more of the costs to farmers-or, if you like, the basis of their viability-comes from these government imposed domestic costs. From that it can be seen that labour market reform is the biggest single item. I think those costs have been estimated by the Business Council of Australia at about $40 billion. The centralised Australian Council of Trade Unions dominated wage fixing system, with its inflexibility of working practices and with the nil productivity gains over the last few years, has meant that the real labour costs that all our farmers have to face are 25 to 40 per cent higher than those of our competitors. That is where the reform has to happen and where it will not be brought in by Labor. Let us look, for example, at the transport of wheat: it is more expensive to ship wheat from Australia to New Zealand than for the United States to ship its wheat to New Zealand. The MCColl recommendations on reform for wheat transport internally in Australia were never completely implemented because Labor wanted to shield its own mates in the railways unions from full competition. Let us look at coastal shipping. It is cheaper for sugar to come from Thailand to many parts of Australia than it is to bring that sugar around the coast from Queensland. We have the most expensive, inefficient and unreliable waterfront in the world. There are fruit growers in my area-and I represent the major fresh fruit exporting area of Australia-who will no longer export through the wharves of Melbourne because it is not worth the risk. Unless they can air freight their produce, they are out of exports altogether. Labor's 'deal' of so-called reform on the waterfront will add another $15m to the $200m of inefficiency imposed on our farmers. In New Zealand, as a result of real reform, the average dairy farmer is $3,500 better off, whereas our farmers no«r are slipping further and further behind their New Zealand counterparts-I think to the extent of 30 or 40 per cent-with regard to the waterfront. I tum to the abattoirs: when the meat workers are not on strike-which is not usually the case in Victoria-meat processing here costs twice as much as it does in the United States. Once again, we have the special mates-Wally Curran and the Premier of Victoria: they are untouchable and they are unworkable. As for meat inspection costs, we have 400 surplus meat inspectors and the cost of inspection-as was pointed out in this House by the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) earlier today-is several times that of our competitor countries. Let us also look at New Zealand. New Zealand fish inspection costs have been reduced by 72 per cent, while for our fish exporters they have increased dramatically. Abattoirs in New Zealand are now on two shifts a day, as is mostly the case in the United States. I go on to the next part of our policyeconomic policy. This Government has relied on high interest rates, and that is the biggest variable farm cost that farmers have to face. We have the highest real interest rates of anywhere in the world. Farm debt in 1986, at $8 billion, was bad enough; it is now $12 billion. The farm sector in Australia is $12 billion in the red with. the highest real interest rates the world, and together with that we have an inappropriate exchange rate, which is the biggest single factor in the increase processed food imports into this country. With regard to tax reform, we will be replacing the capital gains tax with a speculative gains tax. That is particularly applicable to farmers because it is the most capital intensive industry in this country. The goods and services tax (GST) is the most fundamental tax reform we can make to help our farmers and exporters and business people generally. It will remove $1 billion in export taxes which our farmers now pay. It will reducc input costs, particularly fuel costs, in those country areas. The National Farmers Federation has calculated that a GST is worth several thousand dollars a year to the average farmer in Australia, and that is pretty significant when many of them this year .basically will be on a negative income. We also have a policy of fairer trade. The high cost structure of this Government, its one-sided tariff arrangements and its changed import procedures have meant that there is not a fair basis between our producers of farm products and imports at the present time. We are committed to a return to the policies of the previous coalition: the 55-day cash security arrangement; better food labelling standards; and developing country preferences, where no longer needed, should be removed. In the welfare area of agriculture, we do support the big lift in rural adjustment-and I do commend the Government for that and for rural counsellingbut it has to put more money into part A to maintain farm viability. It can take it from part C, which is just putting people off the farm. There is a need for some extreme drought assistance and there is a need-in connection with which we have put pressure on the Government-with regard to family allowances, Austudy, isolated children and family farm transfers. The biggest single thing that the Government can do immediately is to give resource security to our forest industry, which can provide employment and can in provide $6 billion to $7 billion of investment in regional Australia, and that will do something to turn around that terrible in trade deficit. This Government has made hard decisions against agriculture; it is about time it made some hard decisions for agriculture.",41
89,Mr KERIN,AGRICULTURE,"I welcome again the opportunity to speak on this matter of public importance. It is a bit of a change not to have to listen to the usual tired liturgy from the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), one of the best random phrase generators we have ever seen in this Parliament-the usual style In matters of public importance. Of course, this matter arises today after the New South Wales election. We might just look at the swing to the Australian Labor Party in the country seats: Barwon, the seat of the Leader of the National Party in that State, 11 per cent; Ballina, a swing to the Labor Party; Bathurst, 8.5 per cent; Broken Hill, 14.6 per cent; Coffs Harbour, 14.7 per cent; Dubbo, 6.7 per cent; Lachlan, the seat of the Deputy Leader of the National Party, 8.8 per cent; Lismore, 5 per cent; Maitland, 8.6 per cent; Murrumbidgee 12.7 per cent; Myall Lakes-I do not have the percentage; Northern Tablelands, 7.8 per cent; a swing in Oxley; Port Stephens, 12.3 per cent; Wagga, 5.5 per cent; and Clarence, where there was a 4.1 per cent swing.",43
90,Mr LLOYD,AGRICULTURE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. We did not lose one of those seats to Labor.",44
91,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AGRICULTURE,There is no point of order.,44
92,Mr KERIN,AGRICULTURE,"We could talk about the Liberal Party. It has just lost the City of Brisbane to the Labor Party; it could not win the Nundah by-election; and in New South Wales, the super-confident Liberal Party would be lucky to form a government. So that is why this matter is on today instead of the usual tired liturgy. But I am quite happy to address the question raised by the honourable gentleman. I will go through some of the points because I have a pretty good speech to make that will tell everyone what this Government has done in terms of real moves for the farm sector. Honourable members talk about interest rates, inflation rates and the exchange rate. The Government is actually doing something about all these things. Interest rates, for example, have come down by 7.5 percentage points. We are told that the coalition has a policy agreed to by the Business Council of Australia. Of course, the Business Council did not really complain all that much about some of the reasons for the high rise in interest rates. With the internationalisation of the Australian economy, overseas borrowings by the banks went from $1.7 billion in 1980 to something like $65.4 billion in 1990, as the good old business sector got on with the job with massive asset revaluation and asset trading. Throughout this time, whereas the Government has been taking tough economic measures in the interests of internationalising the Australian economy and making it more competitive internally, the Opposition has been saying more and more while feasting on some of the pain caused by this internationalisation and the increasing competitiveness of the Australian economy. The Opposition parties did nothing about it when they were in government. They talk about the waterfront. What did they do about it when they were in government? Nothing! What did they do about shipping? They made the shipping problem even worse. What did they do about textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF)? The Phillip Lynch plan was hopeless. The Liberal Party of Australia stands over its coalition partner on textiles, clothing and footwear. Now we hear that the Opposition would bring down the tariff rates on TCF and passenger motor vehicles to the same rate as the Government is doing for other industries. It would simply wipe those industries out. Let the Opposition have its fantasies; what has the Government done? Australia's fuel costs are the third lowest in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) nations and chemical and fertilisers are at world prices. At the behest of the National Farmers Federation and all the economic rationalists the Opposition relies on, the farm machinery industry was just about wiped out. The Opposition talks about wages. The Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) has just brought out a publication entitled Competitiveness: the policy environment, which shows that in terms of average hourly wages, the only two countries in the OECD that now have lower hourly wages than Australia are Portugal and Greece. The ones ahead of Australia are: Norway, West Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Finland, Holland, Denmark, Belgium, Austria, Italy, France, the United States of America, Japan and Britain. And the Opposition wants to bring wages down further! The Opposition is also saying that labour market reform will bring cost savings of $40 billion. How can the Opposition explain taking $40 billion off wage and salary earners? The Opposition will simply wreck the domestic economy. How will wage deregulation allow a saving of $40 billion in wages unless it is taken off wage and salary earners? What will that do to the economy? Honourable members opposite would, in the middle of a recession, still cut money from Government spending. It is quite obvious from comments made by the honourable member opposite who preceded me that he still does not understand the relationship between interest rates and the exchange rate. A lot of the Opposition's argument is pure fantasy. The Australian agricultural sector is well recognised by this Government as being critically important to the economic well-being of Australians in both regional and metropolitan areas. In addressing this matter of public importance, it is important that we understand firstly what the real problems facing Australian agriculture are. The Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Lloyd) says that he understands overseas prices and all the rest of it. Opposition members have been very good on the international front; there are no two ways about it. But when one looks at the impact of interest rates, inflation and the exchange rate on the farm-cash operating surplus, the income, of Australia's farmers and compares that with the prices they are receiving, one finds they are as nothing. One cannot really say that some of these costs are the real problem. Sure, there should be more attention to costs off-farm, but as I said earlier the Government is actually doing something about it instead of talking about it. Unless we get some idea of just what the real problems are, rather than the fantasies, any policy response by a government is doomed to be reactive, ad hoc and contradictory. I think it is a matter of some rcgret and it is probably a matter of public importance that the Opposition's stance on the major commodity and sectoral issues have been and are reactive, ad hoc and contradictory. Let me run through some of the structural reforms the Government has put in while I have held the primary industries . and energy portfolio. In the past eight years no area of agricultural or commodity policy has remained untouched and no issue of structural importance has continued unchanged. We have seen the introduction of the national soil conservation program. The Opposition picked up the results of the study on soil in 1978, but did nothing about it. The Government established the Murray-Darling Basin Commission and Ministerial Council, whereas the Opposition parties did nothing about the Murray-Darling Basin. The Government established the Cairns Group of traders, but all the Opposition parties ever did about it when they were in government was abuse Europe-adopting buffalo tactics. There was an overhaul of fisheries management and the establishment of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority. When I took over this portfolio little was being done about fisheries management. This Government reformed the statutory marketing authorities. Take, for example, the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation, which was engaged in an ongoing brawl between the processors and the producers, but the Opposition parties did nothing about that. The Government has revitalised and expanded rural research and development, and that is now by far the largest spending part of my portfolio. The Government has reformed the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, and that reform is ongoing. Anyonc can get access to the cost of that service. The Govcrnment will continue to reform that service. The development of rural and provincial affairs is a mainstream portfolio concern. The Government has developed a coherent drought policy; all that is holding the Government back in this respect are the States, but the Government has replaced the previous arrangements so viciously rorted by the National Party in Queensland. The Government has devcloped a systematic and pro-active regime for dealing with the threat of exotic animal diseases, all of which was in a complete shambles under the Opposition parties when in government, and has enhanced animal welfare issues. One can go through this matter point by point, but in short the Government has put in place policies that deal with the essential issues of the preservation and enhancement of our land and water resources, and research and development activities which guarantee productivity gains into the future. The Government has ensured that our marketing authorities are in touch, efficient and accountable. For example, the Government set up the Australian Horticultural Corporation, whereas the Opposition, which talks about the enormous potential of horticulture, did not do a damn thing about it and did not even have agricultural attaches or representatives in countries such as Japan or Great Britain. The Government had to make those appointments. The Government has been coordinating and buttressing the efforts of free-trading nations in the current General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) round through the establishment of the Cairns Group. As I said, all the Opposition parties ever did was abuse the world. The term of this Government has been characterised by integrity in policy development and consistency in policy implementation, which have been orientated towards getting the structural elements right. This matter of public importance really demonstrates the rampant schizophrenia which characterises the Opposition on this issue. The Deputy Leader of the National Party says that the Government must address the real problems facing Australian agriculture, but he means that the rigour, honesty and integrity of the policy processes currently under way should be abandoned in favour of a massive program of support and assistance. That is what he is saying in reality. That view is not shared by members of the Liberal Party. Indeed, the view of the Leader of the Liberal Party (Dr Hewson) on this is clear: . . . the last thing we should look at is short term palliatives which have the long term effect of reducing the efficiency and thus effectiveness of the industries concerned. I make it clear that the Government rejects both the 'gumboot full of money' approach of the National Party and the dream world of the imagination of the Liberal Party. The Government recognises that adjusting to unforeseen and unprecedented circumstances creates real social difficulties and problems for individuals. The Government recognises that the current rural downturn raises real problems for producers to adjust their production plans and to modify their production levels. As a result of that inflexibility in the short term, there are considerable efficiency costs. The Government's policies and responses over the past eighteen months have been directed towards addressing these real concerns. That is why the Government has undertaken to provide an additional half a billion dollars to the agricultural sector. That is why those funds have been rigorously directed to those most in need. But the Government's policies have not stopped at the farm gate; rather, the Government has been intent on making improvements across the whole economy. The National Party and the Liberal Party talk about waterfront reform as if waterfront reform was the only issue of importance to the rural sector. It is important, which is indisputable, but let noone kid himself that there have not been substantial gains over past years. For example, stevedoring costs at Australia's 19 grain terminals are down by an average of 70 per cent. At National Terminals (Australia), where a new enterprise agreement is already in place, labour costs have fallen by 34 per cent. In Cairns, where people are still critical, port costs have been reduced by 60 per cent. In midMarch 400 people went out of the waterfront, and 600 people retired without the so-called golden handshake. The Government is ahead of the three-year program that it has set itself, and is well ahead of the program this year of replacing some 500 people with younger workers. As 1 said, no-one should doubt that waterfront reform is important, but equally a fair-minded observer would acknowledge that in the areas where the Commonwealth Government has primacy the process is on track and reforms will be achieved on time. Again, the Government will be relying on the States and all the systems that lead to the waterfront to bring about reform just as quickly; it is not just the wharfies who are involved. But, of course, attacks are always made on the unions, the mates and individual workers. I would never accuse the Opposition of being a fair-minded observer because on the substantive issues it is madly silent. For example, when asked, 'Is the coalition absolutely united on the point that the wool market must now set prices?' the Leader of the Opposition answered, 'Well, we haven't predetermined a position on all the options'. When asked, 'Should the Government approve a minimum guaranteed price scheme for wheat?' the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) answered, 'I support a variation of the base price'. God knows what that means. And it goes on. The Leader of the National Party has said that what he really supports is framework assistance for wool and has advocated a transitional advance, whatever that is. Really, Mr Deputy Speaker, to paraphrase Winston Churchill, the coalition is nothing more than a clique inside a faction shrouded in humbug on any issue of substance. It gets worse. The Liberals claim that they want inflation down to nil per cent.",44
93,Unknown,AGRICULTURE,Opposition members interjecting,47
94,Mr KERIN,AGRICULTURE,"We have a row of chooks here. The Liberals claim that they want an independent Reserve Bank with a charter directed towards the elimination of inflation. Let us get it clear: the Liberal Party wants to use monetary policy in order to throttle inflation out of the system-that is, it wants to have interest rates maintained at a continuously high level in order to achieve an unrealistic goal. The Nationals, of course, want interest rates to come down. The Liberals would accept, as the logical consequence of their policies, a dollar at levels appreciably higher than otherwise would have been the case. So do the Nationals. However, the Nationals simultaneously want the dollar to come down. The Liberals say that government expenditure has to be cut. I do not think they are adopting Sir William Coles's $6 billion yet. The Nationals also want government spending to be cut. But if I read the papers in the country areas right, the Nationals also want us to increase Federal road funding; take a leading role with the States to provide national, fast and cost-efficient rail freight services; provide appropriate incentives through the tax system for export industries; abolish all sales tax; abolish indexation of excise; extend the diesel fuel excise rebate to all fuel; rebate fuel excise levied on the transport of commodities; introduce an underwriting scheme for the wheat industry; guarantee the future viability of the Australian sugar industry; reinstate Commonwealth financial involvement in funding for drought aid at the old level; limit export inspection charges to 50 per cent of actual cost; reinstate the automatic in-out provisions of tax averaging; reinstate the tax incentive element of the income equalisation deposits scheme; enable full tax write-off for mains electricity connection; abolish the capital gains tax; abolish the assets test for people retiring on or from farms; ease the assets test and fringe benefits tax; restore untimed local telephone calls; and so it goes on. It is the politics of the wild cargo cult. ",47
95,Mr KERIN,AGRICULTURE,"The honourable member says, 'Hear, hear!' It sounds beaut. But we cannot do that and cut government spending at the same time. We cannot do that and have a policy that the Liberal Party is advancing on interest rates. We cannot do that and use the monetary policy that is being threatened. We cannot do that with a goods and services tax.",47
96,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AGRICULTURE,Order! The Minister's time has expired.,47
97,Mr ANDREW,AGRICULTURE," I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate on the matter of public importance which was proposed by the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd). The Weekend Australian magazine is invariably in demand in the Andrew house. One has to queue up to get a look at it, principally because my teenage children are as keen to thumb through it for the odd article on a pop star as I was this weekend to discover precisely what was being written about the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). I would have to say that I thumbed through the' magazine with a degrce of envy because the publicity which the Minister has achieved is something that we would all seek. The Minister probably thought as he read the article, 'This is not bad for a chook killer'. It is true-the publicity that he got was good. It was something of an insight to read what the Minister had to say to the Weekend Australian interviewer. At one point the Minister said to the interviewer, 'You know, I used to have to kill 1,300 chickens a week pre-Christmas. It put me off chickens for life'. He said: Turkeys and chickens arc a bit dopeyhe did not mind that so muchbut I never liked chopping the hcads off ducks. They would look up at you and thcy are nice things. Well, on behalf of the rural producers Australia, I ask the Minister how he feels ductive. about chopping the heads off farmers. I have attended meetings at which Austrafore lian farmers have been utterly reasonable in their dealings with the Minister. They have heard him in silence. They tempered their feelings about the difficulties they were facing financially with the sort of reasonableness that we have come to expect from them. Having done that, they have looked up at him and, figuratively speaking, had their heads chopped. off. I am not being derogatory of the ister personally. I have no doubt, to quote him once again, that he is worried about what is happening to rural Australia. As he has said, the difficult decisions that has had to make have caused him to churn and churn. I am not unsympathetic in at the heart. terms of the decisions which he has had to make. But we stand herc speaking for rural Australia because nothing is happening. Decisions have been made but no action has been taken. If the figures quoted by the honourable member for Murray were not bad enough, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has indicated to us that the rural constituency, so ably represented on this side of the House, faces a further fall of 40 per cent this year, in not only productivity but also income, with worse to come. And those figures were quoted prior to the all too real prospect of a drought. What did the Minister do? Given an opportunity to come into this House and tell us what he proposes to do to aid rural Australia, he merely evaded the question. In fact, he opened his remarks with nothing more than a tirade of cheap political point scoring generated by what he saw as his perception of the New South Wales poll. He then went on to belittle Australia's business sector. He gave us a history lesson of what happened 10 years ago. He focused on characters who would scarcely be known to the emerging generation of voting Australians. He accused us of seeking to reduce wages, which is arrant nonsuch sense. All that we on this side of the House seek to do is give people the caof pacity to earn more by being more proThe Minister spoke for five minutes behe even got'inside the farm gate. He said that the Government recognises the present problems facing rural Australia. that He indicated that in the Weekend jvfagazine article. Perhaps the Government does. But if this is the case, why is it doing nothing about those problems. As the honourable member for Murray said, we acknowledge that there has been Minan expansion in relocation assistance scheme funding and that rural counsellors have been appointed. We would not even challenge his figure of half a billion dolhe lars. But what the Minister is doing is addressing the problem at the edges, not This weekend the United Farmers and Stockowners of South Australia Incorporated conducted a survey of its constituency and, I might add, of mine. It discovered that 1,055 farmers in rural South Australia have been refused carryon finance. Without taking into account the impact of the impending drought, the implication for South Australian farmers is that their export income alone will be down $91m. This sort of figure can be reflected right around Australia. The Minister said that little has been done to address Australia's fundamental rural problems because essentially they are insurmountable. But he went on to say that the Opposition has not been a fair minded observer of what is happening in rural Australia. I have seldom had to sit here and listen to such blatant misrepresentation of what the Opposition is about. What did the Minister get out of us over the wheat debate? He got support, whether he deserved it or not-support that cost us political support in our own electorates. What did he get out of us over the wool debate? He got support, whether he deserved it or not-support that cost us political credibility in our own electorates. What did he get out of us over the tariff debate? We have not walked away from that. That is not an easy argument to sell in electorates such as that represented by the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) or National Party electorates such as my own. But we have consistently sold it and not opted for the cheap political point of which he has blatantly accused us seeking to make. What would he have us do with the assets test on Austudy? It would have been much easier for us to have supported the Australian Democrats and thrown the Government into chaos. But we chose the responsible course. And what do we get by way of gratitude? We get nothing at all. Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask you to project yourself two years ahead when the present Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is standing in my shoes on the Opposition back bench and when we are proposing some of the changes that this country needs in industrial relations that will affect his constituency. Will he have the same measure of guts and determination to support what the then Government will be doing? He might at least have conceded that he has been supported by us, if not the Australian Democrats, . when he is doing what is right. To quote briefly from the Weekend Australian magazine, Rick Farley said: The biggest bitch we've got with the Government-and not just Kerin-is that the rapid pace of adjustment imposed on agriculture hasn't been imposed equally on other sectors. That is· precisely what we are saying. It has been too easy for the Government to target agriculture. What has it done about industrial relations? What has it done about the waterfront? What has it actually done about taxation reform? Mrs Bailey-Nothing.",48
98,Mr ANDREW,AGRICULTURE,"Not only has it done nothing; it has also walked away from the opportunities it had for reform in those areas. As if that were not enough, what is the Government proposing to do to assist rural Australians in one simple area where it could legislate tomorrow? What is it proposing to do about Austudy? All we have asked, in a responsible gesture to support the Government, is that it recognise the problems in rural Australia. And do what? Introduce hardship provisions into the Austudy legislation-hardship provisions that already exist. What has it done? The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) says, 'I'll bring in a review'. We cannot wait for a review. We need hardship provisions and we need them now. They need not be expensive. They would be a tangible expression of support from this otherwise unmoved Government and a recognition of what is happening to rural Australia. That is not too much to ask. The Government says the problems are insurmountable. We have not pretended that we could sell more wool, but we would be a bit imaginative about the way we treated the stockpile in encouraging other people to invest in it. We have not pretended that we could solve the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade problems inherent in our wheat marketing, but, by hell, we would be prepared to be a bit more imaginative about the way we got our wheat from the farm to the wharf and across the wharf. We would introduce at least the level of reform that has occurred in New Zealand, instead of having the apathy on the waterfront that we see today. It seems to me that we have had nothing but rhetoric from the Australian Labor Party for rural Australia: talk about curve, talk about bringing home the bacon, talk about being on track. My farmers have had enough of it. Even this week we had Mr Carr talking about the light on the hill. My farmers currently believe that when the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy say that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, it is probably a train.",49
99,Mr COURTICE,AGRICULTURE,"Hinkler) (4.53 p.m.)This is about the fifth time the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and I have debated the Opposition on this issue; I am more than pleased to do it again today. It is interesting that the start of a two-week session, when we would have thought that the hair-shirt brigade in the Liberal Party of Australia, the New Right, would have bcen leading a charge on one of their fanciful notions, they have not, they havc sent the B team in. Last Saturday the Colonel Custer of the Liberal Party, Nick Greiner, charged off to Little Big Horn and suffered the same result as George Custer: he was scalped. Consequently, today we are debating this issue instead of some of the international issues that I would have expected the Liberal Party to debate. That does not underestimate the importance of the rural sector. As I said, we have gone over the same issues in a number of debates since February this year. On the criticism that the Government has not done enough for the rural sector, I point out that the Ministcr for Primary Industries and Encrgy announced that the current level of the rural adjustment scheme (RAS) will be increased from $64m to $160m in 1991-92. Commonwealth funding could be increased up to $240m in the following financial year, if the need arises. Commonwcalth funding allocations for 1991-1992 for the thrce parts of the RAS will be as follows: part A, $61.5m; part B and debt reconstruction with interest subsidy (DRIS), $27.2m; and part C, up to $57.5m. Diagnostic and administrative funds will be $14m. The new Commonwealth contributions to RAS will be provided if the States match the part Band DRIS components, meaning total RAS the J- funding of up to $187m in 1991-92 and $267m in 1992-93. As well as new rural cducation access program grants and a number of other measures, those are the long term plans that have been put into place. We have always been of the view that the three sections of RAS-A, Band C-are the way by which we can target those farmers most in need. There is no doubt, because of the massive drop in commodity prices, that there will be some farmers who have no choice but to leave the industry. We need to help them leave with dignity and, either at through RAS or through rural counselling, I believe that that will happen. However, it seems that, in the debate on the rural sector, it is opportunistic and politically advantageous at times for the Opposition to trade on the emotions of farmers, who are obviously doing it tough out there, to try to score political points. I think a little consistency should be the case. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), said that Opposition members had to wear some pressure when it came to making the correct and tough decisions and, in some cases, supporting the Government. That is what government is all about. While the Opposition does have the luxury of being an opposition and being negative most of the time, I think its problem would be much less if it were able to get all its members to sell the true story. In the industry statement we announced tariff cuts of some $400m which will benefit agriculture across the board over the next fcw ycars. I think that is a magnificent decision. The cost of that has been loss of jobs in our constituencies on this side of the House. We did not shirk that at all. They were decisions that needed to be made. They are decisions that the National Farmers Federation supports. Ultimately, it is in the long term interests of this country to get tariffs down because that is one of the greatest problems that the rural sector has had to bear. It is a legacy of the MCEwenism days of the former Country Party. Wholesale sales tax exemptions have been broadened too, and I should like to read a comment from the Cairns Post of 10 April, under the heading 'Cane growers welcome agricultural exemptions': Cane growers may save close to $2m each year in new sales tax exemptions for agriculture depending on the level of sugar industry spending in a depressed rural economy. Australian Cane growers chairman Harry Bonanno said . . . that the revised exemptions would encourage canegrowers to proceed with repairs and replacements in those areas where savings are now available. It is no coincidence that one of the largest tomato growers and cane farmers in my electorate came into see me last Friday. He was pleased to tell me that he had just found out about the benefits to him from the broadening of exemptions on wholesale tax in buying tyres. These are meaningful, long term decisions. There is no way that any short term decisions can be taken that are going to ease the commodity price depression that has affected most of our rural sector, but it does not help to talk down our rural sector. Over the last 12 months we have seen an inclination by banks not to play a fair part. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has met with the banking industry and pressure has been applied to the banks, and rightly so, by people on both sides of the House. When we watch the news at night and see rural crisis rallies and people saying that the rural sector is falling apart, it is no wonder that bank managers who live in yuppie suburbs make decisions that are detrimental to farmers. Nevertheless, interest rates have come down by some 71J2 per cent over the past 12 months, and that has been achieved through maintaining the right policy mix. There are three arms of policy: wages policy, monetary policy and fiscal policy. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy made very clear in his speech that in the bush one hears that the National Party has two tunes. First of all, it says that it wants tighter fiscal policy and that we should move away from a monetary policy, but when National Party members get out into their own constituencies they want subsidies for everything; they want more money to be spent. When they are held to account on these comments, particularly the Abbott and Costello of politics in Queensland, Senator Boswell and Senator O'Chee, they do not like it. If they cannot actually tell the truth out there, they cannot expect us to sit back and not respond. I acknowledge that there has been bipartisan support from the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) and also from the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) when we went to the United States of America, which was appreciated. We achieved something, and that is good. But it is unfortunate that when some of these other bozos get back home they take the easy way out because they are worried about their preselection. After seeing the second safest seat in New South Wales, the seat of Tamworth, fall to an independent, there is no doubt that the Klu Klux Klan in the bush-the League of Rights-will be putting pressure on many people in the rural constituencies. Unfortunately, because of that, there is a tendency for people such as Senator Boswell to have two different stories-'-a good story down here but a different one back home. When it comes to tariffs, the same thing applies. Back home in Queensland the National Party says that it is against a reduction in tariffs. Yet its Federal counterpart-rightly so-says it wants to move towards a reduction in tariffs across the board by the year 2000. I have defended the right to free trade many times and have been criticised by the National Party in Queensland, even though the Federal Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) said that he would not move to stop the importation of bananas because it is not in our interest to do so. He is correct. But, again, it is unfortunate that for some short term advantage his own Party in Queensland seeks to go the other way. We have had an attack on the trade union movement and organised labour. There still seems to be this philosophical hatred of organised labour from the other side of the House. It is interesting that a prominent National Party member in Qucensland, the President of the Burnett Queensland Grain Growers Association, when talking about his industry, stated: The industry must make the freeloaders pay, because the QGGA members are sick and tired of contributing all the funds while other people sit back and let them pay while the freeloaders get all the benefits for nothing. I tend to think he would support my proposition for compulsory membership of unions and associations. I used that in a speech last week against an advocate of the H.R. Nicholls Society in this House. But when we come to the real issues in the bush, the issue that is going to be fought in the next election is a goods and services tax. There would be an imposition on farmers of a 15 per cent tax across the board on food and horticultural products. There would be 15 per cent fewer food products sold in the domestic market because that will go in tax. The distributors in the market will be tax collectors for the Government, taking I 5 per cent of the purchasing power from the Amended report relating to the program of business Pursuant to sessional order 28D, the Selection and times to be allotted for consideration of committee business on Thursday, 30 May 1991.

103,Mr FIFE,AYES NOES,"Rume) (5.15 p.m.}-The Government has just used its numbers to declare 15 Bills urgent Bills. In effect, it has applied the guillotine for the House to consider 15 Bills in about 21h days of sitting. I think that needs to be borne in mind. Indeed, it is roughly two days of sitting, because there is little of today left and tomorrow there will be some part of the day taken up with a disallowance motion. So the Government is again reducing the amount of time available for Bills to be discussed and considered by this House. Let me indicate to the House, because I am sure that all honourable members on both sides are unaware, that there is a package of seven Bills to be dealt with under the heading of telecommunications. They are all very complex and some of them are very detailed. They must be dealt with by 10.40 a.m. tomorrow. Keeping in mind that the Rouse does not meet tomorrow until 10 a.m., a very small amount of time has been allocated for those Bills. Other Bills to be dealt with by way of guillotine before Thursday evening include the Customs Amendment Bill 1991, the Export Control Amendment Bill 1991, the National Food Authority Bill 1991, the Veterans' En ti tie men ts (Rewri te) Transition Bill 1991, the National Health Amendment Bill 1991, the Australian National University Bill 1991 and the University of Canberra Amendment Bill 1991-all very important Bills, some of them dealing with education and some with customs. The one Bill that I have not mentioned, of course, a very complex and controversial Bill, is the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991. The Government is aware that the Opposition is in favour of, and will support, fair and equitable disclosure of political donations, but we will not support the banning of political broadcasts, which, the Human Rights Commissioner has advised the Government, clearly constitutes a breach of our obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and would damage-I emphasise 'would damage' - Australia's international standing. We have asked the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to divide that Bill, to withdraw it from Parliament and to reintroduce it, if the Government so wishes, in two separate measures so that the Opposition will have an opportunity to give bipartisan support to fair and equitable disclosure of political donations and also to indicate very clearly to the House, to the Government and to the people of Australia our opposition to the proposed ban on political broadcasts. I would like to take up with the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) the fact that this Bill is actually included in the guilposition lotine motion at this stage. I have spoken privately with the Leader of the House and I have asked whether this Bill could be stood over until next week so that it can be dealt with on Tuesday next. The Bill has still not gone to the Opposition party room. It is a very complex measure. It has been under consideration since it was introduced into this House, but we have not been able to process it through our executive and through the party room. As I indicate our opposition to the timetable proposed by the Government, I again ask the Leader of the House whether he will defer this particular measure until Tuesday. In effect, I am asking for one day's delay in the process.",56
104,Mr BEAZLEY,AYES NOES,"in reply-We have had this debate on a number of occasions over the last week or so and most of the points that have been raised by the Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife), have been raised by him before. I have made references to the fact that we are sitting for a very long period of time this year. Indeed, in the middle of the year and towards the end of the year there will be very little time at all between sittings. This House is establishing a very high level of productivity, and that ought not to be a matter that honourable members sneer at. Indeed, to this point of time in this session we have passed 69 Bills. Twenty-nine Bills will be introduced this week and about 48 will be introduced this week and next week. The total number of Bills for this session will be 117. Bills are not being shoved through as the honourable member says; they have a deal of debate associated with them, both inside party rooms and elsewhere. The Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill, to which the honourable member referred most specifically in his speech here-the Bill relating to political advertising and donations declarations-has been before this place now for a fortnight. The issues surrounding it have been around for a great deal longer than that. Earlier in the week, the Manager of OpBusiness put to me that we should delay this Bill. Because I ought to, and do, try to accommodate him, we have pushed the Bill back from consideration today, as originally intended, to consideration on Thursday. Given the fact that the Opposition has had the Bill for a couple of weeks before now, the Opposition has had some time to work on the issues. Mr MCGauran-That is big of you.",57
105,Mr BEAZLEY,AYES NOES,"We do not operate in this place on the gratitude or otherwise of the honourable member for Gippsland; we operate on the basis that we are obliged to govern the country and also to provide in Parliament a reasonable forum for debate. As I pointed out in previous remarks here, the reason there is often less time these days to consider legislation is the unprecedented amount of time this Government makes available to private members for consideration of issues that are directly of concern to them. I do not notice any members of the Opposition, let alone members of the Government, failing to take advantage of the new opportunities that we have created for them. If it really is the wish of honourable members that we go back essentially to what we did under our Government in earlier years and under those opposite for centuries-leaving the Parliament as a forum simply to debate government matters-we can always go back to that. In the absence of what I think would be a retrograde step, the guillotine is likely. I will take on board what the Manager of Opposition Business has said about the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill to see whether I can accommodate him, as we have been able to accommodate him on a couple of days this week, but I am not sure that that will be possible.

106,Mr SMITH,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"The debate on the Telecommunications Bill and cognate Bills has, unfortunately, been guillotined. Whilst I do not want to enter into a debate on that matter, 1 will say that the amendments that have been circulated in my name take that as the first point. The Telecommunications Bill is very important because of its impact on Australia. It will touch nearly every home, given that we have about 98 per cent penetration of telephone systems in this country. Therefore, this Bill represents a very major change. It proposes to undertake a new regulatory regime and a merger of OTC Ltd with Telecom Australia. It would have been very helpful if this Parliament could have considered, at least in committee stage clause by clause, as appropriate, the amendments that we might have wanted to bring forward. Tomorrow, in the committee stage of this debate, I will attempt to introduce amendments. However, as those amendments will be able only to be incorporated in Hansard there will be no debate on them, but there will, of course, be the opportunity for detailed debate in the Senate. I want to canvass broadly the issues and some of the concerns of the coalition and the position that we intend to take in regard to the Bills. Our broad theme is that we believe these Bills present an opportunity to build a new Australia in terms of telecommunications. We are talking about connecting up to the world. It is not just about communications in Australia; it is about the broader opportunities that will accrue to this nation if we have a truly competitive communications network. To take Professor Porter's point, we must develop domestic market competition before we can attempt to enter into international market competition. When we look at the opportunities in telecommunications, in the Pacific region particularly, we see that there are opportunities for Australia. Indeed, therc have been some marked successes in recent times by OTC and Telecom. So Australians can do it. One of the underlying reasons for the telecommunications re·form that started with Senator Evans back in 1988 and has been continued with the subsequent 1989 Australian Telecommunications Corporation Act and this Bill is that it will provide a flexible regulatory regime to enable telecommunications carriers, whether they be publicly owned or privately owned-my own views tend obviously towards privately owned carriers-to take part in that growth in global comm unications. Clearly, the reports have indicated that there arc inefficiencies in government owned monopolies. Telecom is the second largest employer in Australia-it is a billion dollar a year industry-and makes the single largest contribution to gross domestic product of any commercial enterprise. The power bestowed upon the telecommunications unions within the monopoly is quite immense. That is another reason why I think there ought to be changes with regard to the structure of telecommunications. There are changes sweeping the world in the area of telecommunications. Copper wire is being replaced by fibre optics, analogue is moving to digital, to mobile and to personal communication networks. In time we will see personal numbers; our home telephones will be replaced by phones which will be strapped onto our belts, so that in a sense we will have our own identification numbers. That will be a dramatic change. One of the Austel reports tells us that by the mid-1990s, 60 per cent of telecommunications calls bctween people will be made on mobile telephones. There is a great change taking place. However, that does not mean that the existing basic telephone service will disappear; of course, it will not. But the growth potential in this area is certainly immense. Indeed, the telecommunications business is expected to represent 20 per cent of gross domestic product by the year 20 IS-which will be in my lifetime, although I cannot say whether it will be in the lifetime of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley). Australia's wealth in the twenty-first century will be generated by intellectual property and information based industries. Unless there is change, Australia will miss the opportunities now cmerging in world telecommunications trade. That is the point that I made at the beginning of my speech. There is clear evidence that having Telecom as the domestic operator, OTC as the international operator and Aussat as the satellite system is structurally outmoded. All three enterprises are in public ownership and separately managed. All are government monopolies, with the attendant restrictions on borrowings imposed by government. All are supposed to operate in niche areas. All are subject to a myriad of regulations and non-commercial objectives and, of course, to political whim. The realisation worldwide, but only belatedly realised here in Canberra, is that the market, not government, provides the disciplines required for significant gains in efficiency and productivity. There is no argument that change must come, despite resistance from those whose lives are comfortably protected behind the sheltered walls of the monopoly. The central economic issue facing Australia in the 1990s is one of how we pay for the investment needed to maintain adequate growth and living standards. We cannot continue to rely on high rates of borrowings from overseas. We have to increase our rate of domestic savings from both the public and the private sectors. We have to make the money that we spend on investment produce more. This means increasing the efficiency of investment in both the public and private sectors. In the telecommunications arena there is broad agreement amongst policy makers that what we seek is a progressive, innovative, ,adventurous but realistic policy; building on our lazy telecommunications assets a competitive framework for the year 2000 and beyond. The disagreement is about the structure that will achieve this goal. I hasten to add that no-one is saying that we have not done well in the past. What we are saying is that we can do better. In the brief period that I have held this shadow portfolio, my experience has been that the Telecom people I have dealt with, and indeed the OTC and Aussat people I have dealt with, are excellent. Many of them are very committed Australians-committed to delivering the very best service. But they have to work within the structure we provide for them. This debate is about changing that structure. Those people will still be there; they will still be giving of their very best, I am sure. The question we need to ask is: does the structure meet the needs of the future? Last October I said that the Australian Labor Party decision was a step in the right direction taken in the worse possible way and that an inferior market structure would be created. The ALP's arguments then for the structure were shallow and basically inconsistent. In my view, they remain so. It claimed a queue of possible new entrants and hoped for a high price for Aussat by giving it a second cellular mobile telephone service licence and denying a third CMTS licence, as recom-· mended by Austel. Yet at the same time, the Government created megacom which, as a consequence, has required gigantic juggling efforts to make it possible for a new entrant to be taken on. We wait to see how the interconnect arrangements are determined, with the initial determination coming from Austel, and I will have a little more to say about that later. Austel recognised the potential problem of 'price followship' with a David and Goliath duopoly when it recommended three new CMTS licences. Now bound to 'get up' the competition as quickly as possible, the Government must deny the competition the third licence would provide. Right now the choice of the No. 2 carrier-the duopolist-is crucial. If the wrong duopolist is chosen, as it was in some people's minds in the United Kingdom, we will be stuck with it. Already the structure chosen is in trouble. It is clear that there are probably only two competing consortia. There may be more; one would hope so. How long will the promised third mobile licence be delayed? Will regional mobile licences be issued rather than a national one? What of the pay television proposal of the Minister for Transport and Communications, which he took to Cabinet and which was defeated? Is he going to take it back again? Is seven years too long for a duopoly? These are questions that need to be answered. Can we see even five years into the future and look at what is happening in the mobile sector, as I have already outlined? What does the Bill do? There are two primary Bills in this package. The first is the Telecommunications Bill. The other Bill of interest is the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Bill. The other Bills are fee raising Bills. The Telecommunications Bill is an attempt to package up a very complex area into a legiSlative framework. The Bill is trying achieve these broad aims: to provide a framework for fostering genuine sustainable network competition and to provide flexibility as to how this might be achieved; to provide a framework for competition among all service providers, whether they be carriers or not, while at the same time being consistent with the desire to foster network competition; to introduce a new concept of universal service obligation to provide f01' and meet the social objectives of equalising the cost of delivery of communications services and also providing to residential consumers the option of untimed local calls in a way that is more secure by having a legislative base, is efficient, and in a manner that is transparent; to provide for a licensing system for telecommunications carriers, with wide discretion to the Minister to determine the conditions of such licences-and I have some queries about the licences; to enhance the role of Austel, the communications regulator, but also to provide for greater public input; to give to the dominant carrier and future carriers certain exclusive rights and powers over networks and changes by way of a national code, access to and use of land, and certain immunities from State and Territory laws. Finally, the legislation aims to provide for competition in the network, which is the central thrust of the Bill. It does this by licence, which establishes rules for access and an interconnection regime between carriers. It establishes a complex set of rules to make agreements between 7arriers transparent. In setting the fee for mterconnect-the key part of the proposal in terms of the decision by a second carrier to proceed-the expectation is that it will tip the seesaw in favour of the new carrier to enable it to 'get up' quickly to become an effective competitor to the now dominant carrier. If it proceeds to spend something in the vicinity of $3.- billion to roll out a national network-which will be a requirement of the licence, we understand-it expects within a period of about seven years to have 25 per cent of the national market. So it is an exceptionally large investment that we are talking about and it is a dramatic change. The broader issue of competition and the fostering of future competitors is recognised by the full resale of excess capacity in the system. ReseUers are effectively the nursery of future competitors. We recognise that this is a significant change from the previo-s legislation and it will make Australia one of the leaders in this field. Indeed, the process of having an exposure draft enabled the legislation to take up some of the points we raised, which has meant that we are able to support this primary Bill. In that sense, the people in the Minister's Department are to be congratulated for the work they have more done in what is an exceptionally complex field. This brief speech will not enable me to go into that in some detail. It is a complex area, and it is packaged in a way that is almost incomprehensible to many, but it is better than it would have been if the exposure draft had been the final Bill. This just shows the advantage of time being taken to consult widely. In my view, the legislation would have been further enhanced if the Parliament had been given far greater time, which is the initial point I made. In an attempt to deliver the transparency of telecommunications castings, a regime described as unbundling is established. This will enable Austel to require the dominant carrier to identify its costs in the determination of the provision of basic carriage services. This concept of basic carriage services-the building blocks, if you like-will enable other telecommunications serVIce providers, for example, value added service providers, to construct their services from an equal base. There are provisions for the safeguard of service provider competition and also limitations on the exercise of market power by carriers with regard to their dominant position. How well does the Bill achieve its purpose? Although the primary Bill, the Telecommunications Bill, is widely regarded as a step forward in the achievement of a more open and competitive system, there are certain matters of concern that are encapsulated in my second reading amendment. The duopoly structure chosen by the Government does not meet the intent of full micro-economic reform in the telecommunications package the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) promised on 8 November. The lack of clarity in the legislation-for example, the definitions of basic carriage services, the boundaries of the network and what is resale-could significantly limit competition, and down the track I am sure it is going to provide a field day for lawyers. The question of whether or not Centrex, for example, is a basic carriage service needs to be made clear. Much of the detailed work is yet to be done. We know little of the licence conditions, the fee for interconnection, the national code to protect the environment and so on, which will be subject to regulation. With regard to the national code to protect the environment, the Minister will notice that the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), the shadow Minister for the environment, will be speaking in this debate. He will go further in detailing these matters. The powers of the Minister are formidable. Austel, the regulator, remains an arm of government, in contrast to countries such as the United Kingdom and Canada, which have moved regulation right away from government. One has to ask whether or not Austel has become just a facilitator of the Minister's wishes. I think we need to look more closely at that issue. In other words, the Bill cleverly appears to satisfy everyone's broad interests, which is why it has general support, albeit often limited to 'We can live with it' phrases, but in reality is full of compromises which defer the problems sure to appear down the track. I want to identify the fact that we are going to have problems and that it will not be all plain sailing. The question of ministerial discretions is a matter of some concern. The Minister has power to give general directions to Austel as to how it is to perform its functions. Such directions are to be published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette and are not disallowable instruments. The instances where directions are disallowable by Parliament are essentially the same as in the 1989 Bill-for example, permits, licences, consumer equipment, and cabling and technical standards. We note that an authorised person is either the Minister or a person authorised by the Minister. We will perhaps be looking to an amendment in that regard. It is in the licensing conditions and interconnect arrangements where the Minister has wide-ranging and largely unspecified powers. We note that the absolute discretion of the Minister to grant or refuse an application, and that no reason need be given for decisions, may make personal rights, liberties or obligations unduly dependent on non-reviewable decisions. Thus the Minister's powers in relation to licensing may not be subject to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act, the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act or the Freedom of Information Act. The Minister is empowered to make a written agreement with a carrier about the exercise of the Minister's power which may provide that the Commonwealth will pay a specified amount to the carrier if it contravenes the agreement. There will be amendments with regard to those matters. I turn now to boundaries of the network. This decision is nothing but a sop to the Telecom unions. Until 1993 the boundary between where a carrier network ends and the customer network begins will be the first telephone socket or the first main distribution frame on a property. The Minister has made reference to the property boundary after 1993'. Both 'boundaries are, in my vicw, not the optimum ones. I think the barge board, as with the electricity industry, would be a far bettcr place for it to be. Given that the Minister may have a different view from what Cabinet finally imposed upon him, that might be the sensible outcome with regard to that matter. Consumer interests are not well served in the Bill. Procedures and accountability to both residential and business consumers are weak and almost voluntary. We would seek to amend in Austel's general functions the protection of consumers, ensuring that the provisions of the Act are carried out with due regard to the public interest. In Austcl's reports to the Ministcr a new requirement that a carrier's performance is judged against best world practice with performance indicators will be required, a condition of the licence to include quality of service, and also to require Austel to prcpare a report in respect of proposed licence conditions. We also believe it would be appropriate to increase the maximum penalty from $5m to $10m, given the size of this industry. In relation to timed calls, a business is not defined as an eligible customer for the choice of timed or untimed calls, and we wonder whether or not that matter also needs to be considered, given that one is talking about an options regime rather than a mandatory regime. On the question of the environment, on which the honourable member for Pcarce will elaborate, regulations may exempt carriers from State and Territory laws. However, a national code is yet to be determined and is subject to disallowance by Parliament and is binding on the carriers. This is a major change and basically the total exemptions that Telecom has enjoyed until now will be lessened in a sense: things such as office buildings will now be subject to local planning and State laws, but within the national code there will still be a broad national approach to the institution of infrastructures, such as masts on mountains and so on. However, that matter needs to be made clearer and, of course, we need to know what is goirtg to be in the draft national code. That, of course, is not attached to the Bill by way of schedule, and perhaps it ought to be. In relation to the universal service levy the question should be asked: how much would the levy really amount to for each of the carriers and how much would the arrangement tilt the playing field? We note that there is no Government contribution to the fund and that the Minister for Finance can siphon off any money in the fund. The whole process is laborious and, as it is all in arrears, will it cxacerbate the funding requirements of the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (AOTC)? Perhaps the Minister for Transport and Communications will be able to answer that question later. In relation to the sale of customer cquipment which has no permit, concern has been expressed by the industry, which strongly opposes this, but it is supported by another area of the industry, which makes the point that, as buyers have the option to connect non-approved customer premises equipment into a private network which is not interconnected, it allows them to seek leading edge technology. The other major Bill is the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Bill and, whilst we do not oppose the primary Bill-that is the Telecommunications Bill-we do oppose the Bill which effccts the merger of OTC with Telecom. It establishes a giant corporation to pit against the new entrant, linked to the debt ridden Aussat. It is the David and Goliath structure we have always said was inferior and not designed to establish quickly and efficiently the new entrant. Moreover, it is to continue in public ownership, to continue to be denied capital by government and to be deprived of future private equity. It is fundamental that AOTC's capital structure be in good order at the commencement of its operation so that it can, firstly, meet its universal service obligations, and, secondly, be in good ordcr for privatisation. Indeed, the shadow Minister for privatisation, the honourable membcr for Bruce (Mr Bcale), will be claborating on qucstion of capital structurc-which is an service. absolute fundamental-and the absurdity of the merger fce. These points are taken up in the second reading amendment that has just been circulated in my name. honourable member for Bruce will go into some detail about those matters. So the question is: is this the organisauntil tion that is going to takc us into the twenty-first century-one deprived of capital needcd to cngage in new technolachieved ogies now availablc and on the horizon? It is also expccted to pay a merger fee OTC of about $1 billion. It will be a giant-but a giant with one hand tied behind its back. Dctails of the structure are undcr consideration by the interim and workable? board, which is due to rcport in late Junc or July. The merger is not a step forward. It was at the time strongly opposcd by OTC, and one awaits to see how the new poration accommodates the varying interwealth, ests. At the time it was also strongly opposed by academics, lawyers and writeffect, ers in the communications arena, by jourcmployees nalists and by many of the Ministers in this Parliament. Indeed, the Dcputy Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was one of the leaders in what was an amazing series leaks and countcrIcaks in the Australian Financial Review, the likc of which had not been scen in this city for many years. Our policy of August 1990 is well known. The first priority in teleof communications is to achieve full and fective competition. Wc indicatc now necessity for privatising AOTC, given the date. Governmcnt's incapacity to provide adequate levels of support, and our broader agenda for a privatisation program for public enterprise. Wc will take into acness count the capacity of the equity markets to absorb a telecommunications privatisAustel ation program and recognise the strategic importance of the company. Neither the timetable, the amount of any initial vate equity raising nor the methodology can be determined in detail at this point. mcnt. In any decision, we would be mindful of the impact it would have on the broader capital raisings in the marketplace and, particular, on those telecommunications the carriers who have recently commenced In relation to other matters of concern, on the question of the price capping arrangements, the Minister, subject to disThe allowance by Parliament, may determine price cap and other price control arrangements. Those now in place will remain 1992. The Minister has announced new arrangements for after then. Once a the fully competitive market has been the price capping arrangements will be repealed. The concern is that an for independent audit of Telecom has not been carried out to establish a base and the level of rate of return that should be applied. Who will certify that as correct It is not a public authority. We note that, despite the fact that the Corporation is not to be taken as a public authority and therefore is not entitled to any imCormunity or privilege of the CommonHenry VIn provisions mean th-t the provisions of the primary Act can, 111 be amended by regulation. AOTC will be subject to State and Territory environment protection legislation but the former organisation and former'dircctor and employees are not.

This could cause hardship, for cxample where damage becomes apparent some time after the actual breach statutory duty. An aggrieved person efmay be left without a defendant if the the casc were brought after the succession The broader decisions outside the Bill arc also matters of concern. A real weakof the reform package is Austel's lack of independence from the government. is a division of the government; an arm of the Minister. In other countries, the kcy to rcform has been moving manpriagement away from government and moving the regulator away from governAuste!'s functions and powers include the economic and technical regulation of in the telecommunications industry and the promotion of competition in that industry; indeed, we will watch with interest. to see how it pursues that particular function. Almost alJ of Austel's functions are subject to ministerial direction in clause 50. Is Austel the mere facilitator and government the real regulator? Austel's charter is pro-competitive. Of concern is its independence and reporting requirements to Parliament. We commit ourselves to the support of Austel in its competitive charter. We would ensure full and complete reporting to Parliament. We would also want to see established a set of performance indicators based on world best practii::e, against which carriers would be tested each year in Austel's report to Parliament, as I have already said. In relation to interconnection, as with other matters in the Bill, decisions about interconnect prices are made outside the Act. The interconnect price is to be set by Austel and it is expected that it will favour the second carrier. This is needed to facilitate real competition as quickly as possible, as now the tilt is heavily in favour of Telecom. As a principle, we would not want the tilt, which might favour the second carrier, to last too long. It is primarily a matter of negotiation between the parties. To provide for competition in the network-the central thrust of the Bill-the licence establishes rules for access and an interconnection regime between carriers. The fee for interconnect is the most vital element in consideration of a potential second carrier's decision to proceed. The price of the interconnect is on the basis of a directly attributable incremental cost and the Minister will, subject to disallowance by Parliament, set the principles that are to be used by the carriers when deciding what charges will be payable for access to a network. Access disputes between carriers may be settled by arbitration by Auste!. The question is: on what base will the incremental costs be determined? Surely they will not be based on Telecom's historical costs! They must be based on the most efficient technology in order to mati vate both carriers to produce an internationally competitive communications infrastructure based on the most efficient technology. Overseas examples of interconnect rates range from 3c per minute in New Zealand to 5.5c per minute in the United Kingdom. What might Telecom be recommending? In relation to licence provisions, the current liccnce proposal is for the Ministcr to grant two general telecommunications licences and three public mobile licences. A decision for the third is vet to be dccided. The Minister has wide discretionary powers to grant and determine conditions of licences, including the conditions not listed or foreseen in the present Bill. The kinds of conditions that may be imposed are the term of a licencc, industry devclopment, foreign ownership and control, and others that are listed. There is, however, no eopy of the licence and I ask that the Minister attach a draft licence, or table it in the House, and I will move an amendment to that effect. The Minister's powers include, for example, that he or she may defer, for as long as he or she deems appropriate, consideration of a liccnce application. We would seek to amend and limit the absolute discretion of the Minister to refuse to give reasons in the granting or refusal of a licence application and to make the right to challenge an instrument made under conditions of licences a disallowable instrument. Before imposing or varying a condition of a licence the Minister must obtain the consent of the licence holder; that is in clause 67. This fixes the term of the duopoly. The Minister must also consult with the carrier before changing a licence condition. Further, the Minister must also enter into a written agreement with the carrier about the way the Minister's licensing power is exercised; that is in clause 70. A written agreement may, however, provide that the Commonwealth will pay a specified amount to the carrier if the Commonwealth contravenes the agreement; that is in clause 70 (3). This is the central element. What these clauses do is create tclcthe duopoly and fix it in place until 1997. We are fundamentally opposed to that proposal and our amendments will reflect this fact. We do not believe that to legisJate in advance to pay compensation is a matter that ought to be in the legislation in the way that it is. As I said, this section is clcarly designed to entrench the duopoly. The agreement is not available prior to the Bill becoming law. As with the interconnect price and final licence details, the agreement is a central issue which is determined outside the legislative framework. The Opposition, as a stated and general principle, seeks a competitive telecommunications service and industry. By definition, a duopoly is an inferior market structure. Any purchasers of Aussat and applicants for carrier licences should proceed on notice that we believe a variation to the duopoly is on our agenda. The proposed guarantee by licence and agreement of a continuing duopoly to 1997 may be varied by us in government. We stress, however, that detailed consultation with the second carrier would take place before any variation of the duopoly period and that there would be no unilateral negation by legislation of contractual rights. We are fundamentally opposed, however, to saying that we would pay compensation. I have mentioned the matter of the third mobile licence and industry policy. The question of the duopoly, I think, is central to the whole argument. I make it quite clear that, in the event of a variation, we would in effect be saying to second carriers, 'We would give you notice and we would discuss it with you', but we would not feel compelled to pay compensation in the event of any change to the duopoly period. We will expressly be moving for the deletion of the relevant clauses and also the clauses entrenching the term of the licence. I think that is a fundamental difference we have with the Government and it is the fundamcntal approach that we take in trying to establish a more competitive structure for telecommunications. The other point I wanted to make was about future Australian equity. Our policy of August 1990 states that we will treat the telecommunications industry as an industry of strategic national importance [or the purposes of foreign investment guidelines and each licence application will be subjeet to a case by case examination. By signalling that the industry is of strategic importance, particularly the core network, we are indicating that we believe that an element of Australian control is important. This may be achieved by the use o[ the golden share concept, once privatised, by imposing conditions in the memorandum and articles of association. We note that the Labor Party has a requirement that within five years the second carrier must sell down to 50 per cent Australian equity. There is a fundamental difference of approach because we arc saying we believe that the AOTC will be subject to privatisation. Some of the matters with regard to regulatory changes are also important. I ha vc already mentioned the matter of mobile phones. I make the point again that we support Austel's proposal far ncw competitors to Telecom's mobile net and the third mobile licence will be the nursery of the future third competitor. The rapid growth of wireless mobile radio communications will have a major impact on telecommunications and we should take every means to facilitate its growth. There are indications that there are band clearance problems-I have not yet satisfied myself that they do exist-and they will exacerbate the issue of a third national licence. We indicate that our view is that the issue of a third licence is a matter of priority and is recognition of the developing technology in this arena and the demand for the service. It may take the form of a national licence or several regional licences. (Extension 0/ time granted) I have spoken about the limitation of the absolute discretion, the duopoly and the mobile licence. I now want to speak about industry policy. Industry policy is to be a subject for the licence. There were no details about the industry policy at all in the Minister's second reading speech. Industry arrangements clearly have not been finalised by the Government. However, a key selection criterion for the Aussat sale and second carrier licence is that bidders demonstrate how they propose to assist the development of Australian industry. An industry development plan will be included in the carrier's licence conditions. We do not know how far the Government will tilt the field towards Australian industry. It has, as the March industry statement indicates, shifted in direction to follow more closely the coalition's approach to industry policy. The current industry development arrangements in the telecommunications industry and, to a lesser extent, the partnerships in development proposals are not an appropriate apprQach to a long term industry plan. It is clear that the industry is a strategic one with a great growth potential. The Government's position should be made clear. It will be a matter of urgent priority to determine an approach to this matter. Some in the telecommunications industry believe that a voluntary commitment is the answer, but all seek certainty and stability and a sectoral industry plan that promotes growth, innovation and export potential. I would certainly endorse those sentiments. The question of how one does this will be a matter that will challenge, I am sure, the Minister's Department, the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce and others and, indeed, the industry. But the industry should be on notice that it is going to be required to be positive in its attitude with us in government, and I am sure the Minister will be requiring much the same. Finally, I will comment on how times have changed. In September last year, the Labor Party was rubbing its hands with glee over the prospects of the megadollars it was going to receive from privatisation. Indeed, Senator Richardson calculated $1 billion over two years for the payment by Telecom for OTC, $600m over two years for extra telecommunications licencesthat is allowing for Aussat's debt which is $700m, 'which the Government has already indicated it is going to absorb-and $900m for three mobile telephone licences, one of which the Government has said it will not release anyway. At that stage, Senator Richardson was calculating how much from all the privatisations could be spent on public infrastructure. The Prime Minister at that stage was screaming from the rooftops, 'Public ownership forever'. He said: What we're about here is adherence to the . . . goal of advancing the interests of ordinary Australians, and in the instance of Telecom, to do that by ensuring as far as you can see into the future, the continued public ownership of a fully operated telecommunications facility. But we have heard that song before. What did the Prime Minister say with regard to Qantas Airways Ltd, Australian Airlines and the Commonwealth Bank? That brings me back to that very fundamental point about the capital structure. We must be very careful, even though we will be voting against this Bill, that we do not put in place this new corporation with a capital structure that is inadequate. It will mean that we will not be able to take advantages of the opportunities in the domestic market and the international market and our telecommunications facilities will be run down. Indeed, the issue of capital, details of which were released last week in a letter from Telecom, ought to give every Australian great concern. The accounts are detailed and, without the opportunity for detailed examination and advice, one should be careful about taking it all on face value. In any event, clearly a problem is emerging. To try to grab the cash, the merger fee, and not to make adequate provision for future private equity would, in my view, cripple this company before it starts. If that were the case, it would not meet the stated intention of achieving greater competition in Australia's telecommunications industry. I have raised other issues, such as the Jindalee defence contract. I have not received any details about that. If there are open-ended clauses that may, in future, involve claims for compensation against the new company. All of those issues need to be spelt out quite clearly. In my view, it needs to be done pUblicly. In this whole process I am concerned that the licence conditions, the agreement, the national environmental code-so much of what is vital in this area-are being done beyond the legislation. I would like to see that a more transparent process because we are dealing with public assets. If that is done, then we inspire confidence in the community. Given the size of the investby ment one is talking about, to do it in way that is arm's length from the Parliato ment, from the scrutiny of the people, in my view is an exercise that is fraught with potential for difficulties. If something should happen to the current Ministcr, who will pick it up and sort it all out? We are putting a heck of a lot of discrethis tion, power and authority in the hands one person. Whilst I have every confiHowever, dence that this Minister will exercise judiciously, we want to be sure that the system and the structure that we are ting in place will mean that all future Ministers, whoever they might be, will not put themselves in any invidious posivisory tions. These are complex and detailed issues. We have not had a chance to talk about cadastral separation, BCS, CMTS and the other acronyms I have been trying come to grips with in this area. Certainly it is a complex area, and I now move formally the first of my two second ing amendments: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to gi ve the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) condemns the Government's failure low reasonable time for consideration the measure; and (2) condemns the Government for choosing structural arrangements communications which do not satisfy requirements for full micro-economic form, noting that the Bill: (a) lacks clarity in important areas; (b) leaves significant detail for nation by regulation; and (c) fails to provide for a sufficient of independence from Government Austel; all of which factors have the potential compromise further the developmcnt truly competitive telecommunications scctor required to deliver the promised bcnefits to consumers and to the Australian economy at large"". Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs as Sullivan)-Is the amcndment seconded? Mr Beale-I sccond the amendment.",59
107,Mr SMITH,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Given that I am speaking indulgcnce, I conclude by thanking the a Minister for allowing me the extra time make what I regard as important points.  fact, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) should have insisted that the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), the shadow Minister for portfolio, speak for as long as he did of in delivering his second reading speech. I commence my contribution it by thanking a number of people. I have now had the privilege of being involved, putin a small way, with both the 1988 reforms and the 1991 reforms. The Minister has seen fit to establish a ministerial adcommittee on telecommunications reform which I have been pleased to chair. I would like to pay tribute to the members of that committee: Mick Musumeci, all Adam Smith, Bob Mounic, Wally Rothto well, Robert Bastian, Dick Butier, Alex Gosman and David Large. Indeed, it was a pleasure to have worked with people readwho had such widely disparate backgrounds but who on difficult and key issues displayed a surprising degree of unanimity. As far as Caucus is concerned, I had the pleasure of working with Senator Chris to alSchacht and the honourable member for of Robertson (Mr Walker), and I would like to thank them. In particular, I would like to acknowledge the contribution made by in telePaddy Costanzo from the Minister's office the to these reforms. Indeed, I would like to rethank the Department of Transport and Communications for its hard work in framing this legislation. I am not noted determias a flatterer of the Department, but I believe it has done an outstanding job in degree getting such a detailed package of Bills to for Parliament in record time while still allowing for a wide degree of public consulto tation, which the shadow Minister has of the acknowledged in his speech. I think one should also thank the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) because one of the important moves he made was to appoint a shadow Minister who is now interested in his portfolio area, keen to make a contribution and certainly willing to listen to the people who knock on his door. It would have been nice to say that we had a bipartisan approach on these reforms, but we do not; however, there are surprising areas of common interest. Firstly, the Opposition's policy approach is that one can provide competition or micro-economic reform by privatisation. Mr Beale-That is not what our policy says. Our policy says that you establish a competitive framework first and then you privatise.  shadow Minister for pointing that key aspect out to me. Indeed, what sort of framework is that? I think the Opposition is in a cleft stick if it wants to have the most competitive model because that model is predicated on structural separation, which means minimising the money one gets from the public carriers; and one then has the difficulty of raising money on the capital markets of Australia. Another difficulty is in trying to define how to implement national interest objectives that ought to go with a strategic industry like communications. It is not only important for the cconomy; it is also important for ordinary Australians. I think this is where the grcat benefit of the Beazley approach has been. Had anyone said to me prior to the last election that I would support fully the Minister's proposals-now known as the Beazley plan-I would have said that they had rocks in their head. I think it is a tribute to the Minister and his staff that, given the charter for transport and communications, they have been able to take the Australian Labor Party so far down the road with them in reform, which reform was, I suppose, essentially resisted by a number of people, such as myself. What has the Minister done? In competition it would be very easy to ensure that the business communitv of Australia is the big winner while ordinary Australians miss out on the benefits of access to communications services, whether they are in urban or in rural areas. The framework of these telecommunications Bills provides that the existing competition is now extended so that all people will face declining priees in real terms. The shadow Minister referred to the sheltered monopoly; the only sheltered monopoly was OTC Ltd, because it was part of an international cartel. One of the ironies about opening up this end to end competition is that the one area in which dominance may be first met is the international area, not the domestic area. Telecom certainly was not a sheltered monopoly. The only areas not subject to competition were cellular phones and the network. The telecommunications Bills open up competition in the network. As I said, it is important to ensure that all Australians have access to communications, and I think the price capping approach by the Minister is exceptionally important. It means that ordinary Australians-the pensioners in my electorate and the battlers in rural electorates-will face communications prices declining in real terms. We have that underlying guarantee in the Bill for all Australians. The area where the Opposition continually underestimates the difficulty of the task is in actually gctting up a second robust competitor. The Opposition is always happy to point to overseas experience, but overseas experience shows that it can be exceptionally difficult to get that second competitor up and running. That is what this Bill does: it tilts the field in certain areas to ensure that not only do we have a very large publicly owned carrier but also that we will develop a very large-by Australian company standards-second competitor as quickly as we can. The Bill does not provide for some cheap, off-the-shelf technology company which only wants to compete on price. That may drive prices down, but people will suffer in the longer term because we would not develop, in the words of honourable members opposite, the world's best practice in terms of network design and engineering. I believe the framework is provided in this Bill to do that. Some deprecatory remarks were made about the network termination point. Here again there are differences between the Government and the Opposition. The Government is prepared to make changes that are sensible in consumer terms, provided there are real benefits in economic terms, rather than just rushing in and suggesting that we ought to have change for the sake of change. Another very important area is universal service. Firstly, we are providing ongoing money, if you like, to ensure that everyone has access to the phone. We have a very high penetration rate; as the shadow Minister mentioned, it is in the 90 percentile range. However, in my view, this disguises areas where ordinary people do not have access to services. People might say that it really does not matter whether someone has a telephone or not but, Madam Deputy Speaker, you would be interested to learn that a number of studies have been done which show the importance to women of having networks and being able to use the telephone in order to reinforce those networks. More importantly, so much of our information technology will be delivered by the medium of the telephone; if it is great now, it will be greater in the future, particularly as we can look forward to the integrated services digital network eventually coming to ordinary households and, as the shadow Minister indicated, the introduction of personal communications networks. It is important that ordinary Australians not be priced out of this area. So it is very important that we do not think in shallow terms of universal service being the penetration rate per household. We should ensure that all Australians have access at reasonable prices to universal service. I am pleased that the Minister has indicated on radio that he will be writing to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to ensure that the definition of 'universal services' will be relevant to today's needs. I happen to agree with some of the comments that the shadow Minister has made about industry policy. I think the person who has articulated the case most on industry policy to date is the Minister for Transport and Communications. He clearly sees the exciting potential that this area of communications has, not only for developing jobs but also for export growth. It is one of the few industries where Australia is well placed in terms of its reputation to date to build for the future and to maximise. I have seen different estimates of what is likely to be the position by 1997 and by the year 2000. The estimates for exports range from $2 billion to $10 billion. I suggest that we are limited only by our imagination and the capacity of management in the publicly owned carrier, the private carrier and industry to realise those objectives. I think judgments can be made in this area. When we look back, we ought to say, 'To what extent did we harness the opportunities and to what extent did we let them go?'. It is entirely appropriate that we should not have a closed mind on industry policy. We ought to be able to take advantage of any innovative approach that a potential bidder may want to offer. The shadow Minister mentioned the capital structure. There are a couple of issues that I think are quite difficult and we cannot be very precise about them at the moment. I suppose a feature of the reforms is that the Minister, having embarked on this process, has put his foot firmly down on the accelerator and at no time has taken it off. If you like, we are seeing some things dealt with in a piecemeal way. For example, we have before us a package of legislation without an industry policy. The interconnect arrangements are very important. It is very important that these arrangements do two things, which are not mutually exclusive. First, they should ensure that the second competitor does get a good start in rolling out the network. Secondly, they should ensure that there is an incentive for competitors to roll out the network. So, clearly, if everything is tilted towards the second competitor, one of the things that may be at risk is the network roll out. A vital and critical element of the Government's reform package is that we have a robust second competitor that is rolling out the network to beat the 1997 duopoly deadline. Incidentally, a criticism has been made that this is the worse structure. I thought I had mentioned some of the difficulties that relate to the alternative point of view and the narrowness of trying to set up the most competitive plane. This structure is going to be very competitive and it will meet national interest objectives. One of the most important decisions of the Government-and I congratulate the Minister on this-is the commitment to a review of the industry. This is an industry that changes so fast. I think some of the concerns about uncertainty that were mentioned by the shadow Minister will be taken up in the review. I hope that this will be a very wide and sweeping review of all aspects of the industry. I hope that it will look at not just the way in which competition is working but at how consumerism is working, how industry policy is working and how Austel is working. It would be even better, of course, if this review were independent and outside of the Government. I am sure that the Government would benefit from any conclusions that such a review made. I also want to raise the question of retrenchments. Unfortunately, there is currently a climate within Telecom-OTe in which people are really concerned about their jobs. I think the reality is that a small number of jobs are at risk. But future changes-and they will be quite dramatic-can be managed through natural attrition. I certainly hope that we will see that situation resolved. I make a plea to the Opposition that it try to understand the uncertainty that TelecomOTe is going through at the moment. The situation is not helped by the fact that there is no identified chief executive. It is ironic in terms of opposition to the merger Bill that Telecom-OTe is going to be the dominant provider of services for some time. The more that we hamstring Telecom-OTe, the more we render ineffective or second rate the services that they are attempting to deliver, whether those services are to ordinary customers or to major customers. I think it is important that the Government look at the merger date and perhaps bring it forward. We are certainly solving all of the difficult issues about providing a decent start up for the second competitor. I think it is unnecessary to delay and to do so certainly will not give the new organisation the go that it deserves. A lot of people have pointed to the critical role that Telecom-OTe will and can take in realising export opportunities. It is rather ironic that the current legislation that this legislation replaces puts no specific injunction on either OTe or Telecom to be out there in the export market. It is to their credit that they are participating in this market. Although they got in rather late, they are doing rather well. In terms of the capital structure of the organisation, one of the things that we put at risk by not getting it right is realising the export opportunities that exist not only in isolation for the carriers but for the wider industry. The carriers have an ability to use an Australian industry that is reaching world competitive standards and is able to stand up to stiff international competition. I think it is fair to say that the capital structure issue is one of the areas of great failure of the 1988 reform process. We were supposed to provide government business enterprises with certainty of financial planning. We were supposed to give them a corporate plan approach, a knowledge of adequacy of borrowings and an adequacy of injection of capital. This is certainly one area that I am concerned about. I know that the trade unions are concerned about it. I am heartened to see that the shadow Minister equally shares our concerns on this issue. It is not only important that we get the . ratios of capital to debt right, it is not only right that we deal in a reasonable way with the merger fee and some other issues that are involved in the capital structure, but also what is of absolute critical importance is that we have an understanding in terms of the time frame of adequate financial planning. No other corporation has to work on such short financial planning tranches as do OTC and Telecom. This is clearly unacceptable in such a dynamic and strategic industry. To say that we will go back to the 1988 reform process and make it work is not an adequate way of dealing with the problem. I am very pleased about the Bill as far as consumers are concerned. Consumer protection has been considerably strengthened in respect of Austel. I believe that the public inquiry process that is contained in the Bill is a great plus. I know that the consumer groups are particularly pleased about it. The creation of a registrar of investigations is also an important milestone. The requirement that Austel report on these issues to the Minister will make a difference. If I have a criticism to make of Austcl, it is that it has approached its competitivc role too strongly and perhaps underperformed in the consumer area. Thesc changes will mean that Austel will nced to take a more balanced approach. One has to give credit to Austel for the tremendous job that it. has done in respect of this reform process. In the couple of minutes that I havc left, can I as a Labor member of this Parliament representing the electorate of Chifley say-and I do not often say it, but I am pleased to do so-that I belicve these reforms are Labor heartland reforms. We are talking about changing an industry for the better in the national interest. We are talking about providing what I think is important to the trade union movement, that is, jobs that are going to go on and on, not jobs that are at risk. We are going to be providing growth for our economy in a variety of ways. We are going to be putting this complete industry up in lights and letting it go, reaping our reward in export markets. If Labor is not about jobs, if it is not about developing a clever country, if it is not about exports and if it is not about enriching people through their ability to use communications and information, I do not know what is. I think that the traditionalists ought to be pleased about this legislation. Furthermore, this legislation is very strong on consumer protection. I certainly am keen to see an additional member on the Austel board, pcrhaps someone with stronger consumer credentials. We are ensuring that ordinary tclephone consumers are being protccted and are facing real declining priccs. This is what the stuff of Labor government is all about. I must say that r am vcry pleased to have played a smaJl rolc in it all. I am very grateful for the generous rcmarks the Minister made in his second reading speech. I commend thesc Bills to the House.",68
108,Unknown,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I regret that the suspension of the sitting for dinner has intervened because I wanted to say somcthing in the presence of the  about the remarks he made from 6 o'clock this evening. Firstly, at the conclusion of his speech he observed that he was happy to have played a small role in the development of the legislation we are considering here today. Mr Speaker, you should know that my officc is next to the office of the honourable member for Chifley. Judging by the number of people who have callcd on him to discuss telecommunications matters over the past year or so, it is my impression that he has playcd significantly more than a small role in the development of this legislation. As my fricnd and colleague the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) has said, certainly with the first set of Bills we are looking at, which relate to the establishment of a new framework for telecommunications, although we have some reservations about certain aspects we are generally in agreement with the direction the Government is taking, albeit rather slowly. The honourable member for Chiflcy made some observations about our proposals for telecommunications, which he said would minimise, in terms of the privatisation process, the dollars that would be raised by the sale of public carricrs. With that observation we agree. It is true that if competition is established before the privatisation process takes place it will inevitably cause fewer dollars to be raised for the taxpayer than if one sells off as part of either a monopoly or a duopoly. The implication in what the honourable member for Chitley was saying is that the Government is more interested in the dollars for privatisation than it is in the benefits that in our view would How to consumers through lower prices and better services. The Australian Bureau of Statistics annual national accounts capital stock figures from J 988-90 were released on 23 May 1991. They show that the rate of return on capital by industry for private trading enterprises in the transport, storage and communications sector is 15 per cent, but in the public trading enterprises for transport, storage and communication the rate of return is only 3.9 per cent. It is this difference in returns to the owners that we think justifies in a competitive framework our policy of privatisation. The package before us is really presented in two parts. The first creates a more competitive framework for telecommunications in Australia. As 1 said, with certain reservations about what the Government is proposing there, it is not a framework with which we find ourselves in disagreement. The second part of the package, the merger of Telecom Australia and OTC Ltd, is a proposal with which we do not agree and which we will oppose. One of the bases on which I make my comments tonight is that, although the balance sheet of the current OTC is in reasonable shape, that of Telecom is not. It might be worthwhile to quote some of the things that are said about Telecom at present. I refer to a news release by the Managing Director of Telecom and also to a news release from the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association. The Managing Director of Telecom said: Australia risks becoming a small and mediocre player in telecommunications services . . . He made that comment in the context of Telecom's ability to compete, which rests largely on the construction of its balance sheet. The implication was that its balance sheet was not in proper shape. The Secretary of the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association in a press release on 21 May 1991, under the heading 'Government policy out to wreck Teleeom', said: Australians must be wondering whether by accident or design the Labor Government isn't out to wreck Telecom, one of our few profitable international businesses. Not only is Telecom being driven to bankruptcy, it is being told it can't use new mobile phone technology because the competitor is not ready. The Secretary goes on to say that, in the context of allowing Telecom to compete adequately in this new market the Government has established by the first set of Bills, Telecom is not going to be able to compete adequately. T think it is fair to reiterate the Opposition's telecommunications policy. I extract several items from a recent news release from my friend and colleague the shadow Minister for privatisation which sets out in detail the kind of framework we would like to see ill order for Australia to have an open, vibrant, competitive and effective telecommunications industry. It sets out the decisions the coalition has made: I. The first priority in telecommunications is to achieve full and effective competition. 2. Within that framework of full and effective competition in telecommunications, a Liberal and National Party Government will proceed with the privatisation of Telecom. 3. The timing, pace and conditions of the privatisation of Telecom . . . will be determined having regard to all relevant circumstances and the capital market's ability to provide the funds required. It goes on to enunciate several other key factors that we regard as important with the privatisation of Telecom. Because the guillotine is operating on this series of Bills tonight and tomorrow, it may not be possible for the shadow Minister to move the amendment to the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Bill 1991 that we want to see voted on. Therefore, I take advantage of my speaking opportunity to put on record that amendment so that people can see, in the event that the guillotine prevents the shadow Minister from moving it, what we would like as an amendment to that Bill. The amendment to the motion for the second reading moved by the honourable member for Bass reads: That all words after That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'the House declines to give the BilI a second reading, as it is of the opinion that the Government should be condemned for: (l) its failure to allow reasonable time for consideration of this measure; and (2) adopting a structure for the Corporation which: (a) will not meet the stated intention of achieving greater competition in Australia's telecommunications industry; (b) does not make adequate provision for the capital requirements of the Corporation; (c) provides for an unjustified 'merger and (d) does not make adequate provision for future private equity'. That brings me to the whole question of Telecom's current financial position. I draw attention to the fact that today, by extraordinary coincidence, Telecom announced that from 3 July the cost of a local telephone call will rise by 2c to 24c. It is important to understand that the relevance of the timing of that announcement is a further indication that Telecom's balance sheet is not appropriate for its operation as a commercial enterprise in a competitive environment and is certainly not adequate in terms of its suitability for privatisation. Further, not only do we have this announcement today that the cost of a local telephone call will rise, but we have on the record information from Telecom that it has approached the Government with a view to a further loan of $300m in the current financial year. We are all aware of the fact that the Government intends to extract from Telecom a billion dollar merger fee as the price that Telecom would have to pay for legislation enforcing it to merge with OTe. It is well known that Telecom has a very satisfactory cash flow, but I point out to the House that that cash flow is, for the most part, absorbed in the extraordinary capital expenditure program which is necessary to maintain Telecom up to good world practice in a constantly vibrant and changing telecommunications industry. By way of illustration about the position of Telecom's balance sheet, I would like to take two of the measures which are used from time to time in order to compare the financial position pf various telecommunications companies. The first of these is the interest cover: that is, the profit before interest and income tax expense divided by the total interest. This is not riveting stuff in terms of political debate, but these are details essential to an understanding of the· financial situation in which Telecom finds itself. I will indicate the interest cover comfee'; parisons with other major world telecommunications companies. Telecom Australia is 2.0; Telecom New Zealand is 3.2, very much better; Bell South, which we understand is to be one of the companies bidding to be the alternative competitor for Telecom, is 4.2; Cable and British Telecom is 6.6; and Cable and Wireless from the United Kingdom is 7.4. It can be seen that Telecom's interest cover is dangerously low compared with most of the other major telecommunications companies around the world. The other measure to which I refer is the debt ratio comparisons: that is, the total debt plus financial leases, divided by the total debt plus financial leases plus equity. Telecom's high percentage figure is 53 per cent; Bell South, to which I referred, is 39 per cent; British Telecom is 36 per cent; Telecom New Zealand is 32 per cent; and Cable and Wireless from the UK is 23 per cent. Those figures have been compared so that they can be measured against Standard and Poor's benchmarks for rating. When those figures are compared it can be seen that Telecom as it stands would be given a rating by Standard and Poor's-one of the world's major rating organisations-of BBB, whereas most of the other companies to which I referred, particularly British Telecom and Bell South, have AA ratings. At the moment Telecom has an AA rating but it has that only by virtue of the fact that there is a perception that Telecom's debt is guaranteed by the Government. Telecom's debt ratio and interest cover are completely inadequate for a company seeking to compete in an ongoing and busy telecommunications environment. There has to be a change in the debt equity ratio on the balance sheet of Telecom. The Government has already set the pace on this. As part of Telecom's initial equity, last year the Government moved $1,088m from debt to equity. Page 65 of Telecom's 1990 annual report states: The second repayment to be made in 1990-91 shown . . . An amount of $1,088 million was converted from Australian Government Loans Capital in 1989-90. Paragraph 27 states: An amount of $1,088 million was converted Capital from Australian Government Loans to form the Corporation's initial capital. The Government has already shown the way on what needs to happen to Telecom's balance sheet. I will briefly tell Minister for Transport and Communicahistory tions (Mr Beazley), who is at the table, what he needs to do in order to get Telelegislation com's balance sheet into shapc. Not only should he do what he wants to do, which is to compete in the telecommunications industry, but he should also do what we industry. want him to do, which is to get Telecom's balancc sheet in shape so that Telecom can be sold to the private sector. If Governmcnt converts the total debt owed over there. to it by Telecom of $2.7 billion, the ratio on interest cover will change from 2.0 to 3.1 and the ratio on debt will change from 53 per cent down to 37 per cent. Government converts the outstanding debt owed to it by Telecom to equity in Telethought com, it will bring Telecom into line with many of its overseas competitors and will almost certainly, as it stands alone, give it its much sought after Standard Poors AA rating. It is quite clear that the Government has to take action to resolve the question of Telecom's balance sheet. That is we have included it in the amendment we have moved to this particular Bill. The coalition parties make it quite clear in terms of competition that we reserve the right to vary the duopoly before the expiry date of 1997. We also reserve the right to privatise Telecom at the time we believe appropriate competition is established. We are pleased to see that the Government now proposes to open up the communications market somewhat. We would prefer the Government to establish a market where there could be more competition rather than the limited duopoly competition that the Government has proposed. Under the coalition Government, we will open up the teleis communications market so that there can to be more participants. We will expose telecommunications to competition, make sure that Telecom is a viable commercial operation and then transfer the ownership to of Telecom to the private sector.",72
109,Mr SPEAKER,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,I call the honourable member for Heffron.,75
110,Mr BRERETON,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"It is with a keen sense of that I rise to support what must be one of the most important pieces of of recent times, the Telecommunications Bill 1991. This BilI and its companion legislation enshrine a new era of competition in the telecommunications Mr Beale-Laurie, I thought you had come over from the New South Wales the Parliament. Heffron is the seat you had",75
111,Mr SPEAKER,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Order! If the member for Bruce continues to be indiscreet, I will If the remove him from the House.",75
112,Mr BRERETON,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I would have that those sitting opposite would be very quiet about the results of the it elections in New South Wales last weekend rather than seeking to interject toand night. I want to emphasise to the House that the Bill represents a radical break with a past dominated by entrenched monopoly and rigid demarcation. The hithwhy erto monppolistic structure of the Australian telecommunications industry left us with a set of carriers whose performance on a world scale was good, but never great. In such a dynamic industry-indeed, such a cut-throat industry-the 'near enough is good enough' attitude could no longer be allowed to prevail. As abundant as the opportunities are in the field of world telecommunications, at each turn await competitors of equivalent merit; with incremental differences, the competitive edge provided by a fluid market economy can make all the difference, and it will here. Of course, our ideologically blinkered opponents would have us believe-they have said so again and again-that the performance of Australia's state-owned communications carriers has been disastrous, if for no other reason than that they are publicly owned. Yet in Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand we see compelling evidence of Australia's capacity to export our technology and know-how. As the Asia-Pacific region continues with its rapid progress, further and much greater opportunities await our major carriers. Whether these are grasped or not will ultimately depend upon the ability of Australian carriers to reach the vanguard of service and the vanguard of technology. The competitive strength provided by an increasingly deregulated domestic market could make all the difference between winning or losing in this most demanding field. As well as efficiency, the key to success on the world stage will, of course, be size. Size means a greater capacity to engage in research and development, and it is R&D which will keep a carrier ahead in the ever changing world of communications. Size also means diversity and an ability to provide the range of services demanded by a modern carrier. In providing those services, there is no room for duplication or unnecessary internal competition. Focus on objectives, the capacity to change and a service ethos will be vitally important. The new competitive domestic regime will ensure Australian carriers meet these very exacting standards. By keeping Telecom Australia in public hands and merging it with OTC Ltd, while at the very same time introducing domestic competition, the Government has delivered both the market and the institutional structures which are crucial to success. It has done so without engaging in the kind of public sector emasculation which so delights our political opponents. In the merged OTC and Telecom organisation, we will see an institution with the requisite size to engage in both R&D and community service obligations (CSOs). At the same time, with the birth of a new competitor, we can be comfortable in the knowledge that service standards will be significantly greater than has ever been the case in the past. For good measure, we will see in the form of an expanded Austel the sort of institution which will help channel the benefits of the new market structure in the direction of the long-suffering consumers. Speaking very personally, no other aim in this total reform process is more important to me than this one. Overseas experience has shown that, where network competition is introduced, the real price of telecommunications services to business and households inexorably declines. Certainly we can expect to see substantial and lasting price reductions on the major inter-city subscriber trunk dialling routes. In the area of customer service, the added competition will improve standards and foster the onset of the new technology that we need so much. All of these improvements will be delivered without threatening the unique yet fundamental social obligations of a service provider. The right to untimed local telephone calls will be enshrined, as will the provision of public pay phones. Phone charges will be subject to a price capping formula set well below the consumer price index, a formula which will necessitate ongoing productivity improvements if profitability is to be maintained. Community service obligations, which are at the moment a discretionary function of Telecom, will be guaranteed through legislation and will be overseen in this process by Austel. This will have the effect of putting on a more secure footing the essential service provided to rural and regional users, plus disadvantaged pensioners and invalids. As a consequence, any attempt to revoke these essential services-the sort of suggestion that we have seen from the Opposition, a suggestion driven by market ideologieswould require counter-legislation, legislation which would guarantee electoral suicide to its sponsors. In selecting a competitor for the merged Telecom-OTC organisation, the Government has also been careful to deliver maximum benefit to the community. In keeping with this philosophy, the Government has specified that one of the selection criteria for the Aussat Pty Ltd sale will be guaranteed benefits to Australian industry. Any successful bidder will therefore be required to seck out Australian participation in its services and in its value added activities. With the successful bidder likely to be a foreign entity, the infusion of new expertise and new technology will be of direct benefit to Australian industry. Inevitably this will assist Australia's quest to become a significant international communications centre. With the CSO safeguards contained in this enabling legislation, the Government has aimed to ensure that there are only winners under the new regime. From its own viewpoint, it has not been an exercise in maximising revenue from the Aussat sale. If it had been, we would never have seen the introduction of the proposed three mobile telephone licences or the concluded community service obligations and price capping formulae which are all part of the legislation. Rather, by allowing network competition, the Government has shown that it is not averse to the service improvements accompanying the end of a monopoly structure. At the same time, it has shown that, by preserving a large state enterprise, it has a unique concern for the social importance of the communication providers. The competition will benefit the consumer through price reduction, through technology enhancement and through service improvements. Its purpose will not b- to top up government coffers. There w1l1 be a competitive structure limited to two main players for five years-and then, of course, an open playing field. This will allow the chosen competitor to establish itself as a genuine alternative to the main player. It wi-l .also prevent overservicing, predatory pncmg and the confusion that could result from a sudden change from monopoly to free market to all. In its strengthening of Austel's regulatory and arbitral functions, the Government has revealed its determination to ensure that competition works, and works well, in the consumer's interest. Unlike our opponents, the Government has the maturity to recognise that competition chaos does not accord with the common good. Our policies are not dictated by any right-wing think tanks or any conservative models imported from overseas. On the contrary, what this Government has come up with is a uniquely Australian structure, for Australia's unique circumstances. It is a mixture of competition and social concern that our opponents could never have contemplated. Their virulent and irrational hatred of state enterprise would have seen them sell Telecom to the highest foreign bidder without guaranteeing any provision of community service obligations. Perhaps it is a reflection of their intellectual inferiority complex, but it appears that the only solutions thcy can ever offer are those which seem to emanate from the self-serving think-tanks or from the ideological big brothers they have in the United States and the United Kingdom. Fortunately for all Australians, the Hawke Government is able to think for itself and, for that reason, was able to deliver competition along with social guarantees. Ten, 20, 50, 100 years from today, the benefits of foresight shown by this Government will be enjoyed by all Australians. In the Asia-Pacific region, where the demand for telecommunications services, of course, is expected to grow by $130 billion in the course of the next five years, the thirst for Australian technology and expertise will demand a great application and will expand at an enormous rate. Thanks to these reforms, Australia will be in a position to capitalise on this expanding market. The benefits of decisions taken in this country by a government committed to the national interest will, therefore, translate not just into benefits for Australians but into benefits for the people of the entire region. It is for all these reasons that I strongly commend the legislation to the House.",75
113,Mr CHANEY,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"In speaking to the Telecommunications Bill and cognate Bills, I do not wish to deal with the sorts of issues that have been dealt with by the honourablc member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), who has just resumed his seat. The time available to debate the legislation is short. I simply wish to focus on some of the aspects of the legislation-two of the Bills in particular-which impact on environmental concerns. The Minister at the table, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), might well think that some of the comments I wish to make would be more properly made at the committee stage of the debate but, since I doubt that we will have that stagc, I want to use this opportunity to draw attention to the issues of principle which I think are raised and to seek from the Government some response to those points, which will enable the Opposition to give the matters further consideration before the legislation is dealt with in the Senate. The fact that my points are in some way relevant to the second reading debate is, however, borne out by the Minister's second reading speech. The Minister referred in that speech to the question of powers and immunities and pointed out: the general carriers will continue to have Telecom's existing powers in relation to land. This is considered essential to carrier activities and to allow the second carrier to roll out its network. The Minister continued: Telecom's total immunity from suit under the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Act 1989, has been removed but Austel has been given the power to limit the carriers' tort liability. I would say in passing that the Opposition welcomes the removal of that total immunity. I think that immunity should be given only where it is absolutely essential. There is no reason why governments or corporations should operate free from the law of the land that binds all other citizens. But, of course, the Opposition accepts that carriers of this sort need some additional powers. The. question is where one draws the line. The Minister went on to point out: Telecom's exemption from State and Territory law has been replaced by a more focused and balanced regime. I emphasise that I am quoting the Minister here. He continued: Essentially, the regulations will be able to specify that certain network related activities are exempt from State and Territory laws, and a carrier will be able to engage in those activities, despite any State or Territory law. This will be balanced by a National Code of Practice for carriers, to be discussed by the States and Territories, which will impose parallel obligations on the carriers to the extent that this is warranted. I think that I should welcome the general direction in which the legislation is taking liability, namely, it is imposing more liability than has applied in the past. I simply wish to get some guidance from the Government as to why it has taken that particular course in a number of situations and why it could not further improve the position which the citizen will have to deal with. I put that inquiry in the context of a government which has been very ready to trumpet its virtues in the field of the environment in particular. I think the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) is on record as saying that she and the Government support the application of the toughest pollution standards. I think that in those circumstances it is appropriate that the Parliament should very carefully examine any legislation that potentially provides exemption from pollution standards which are applied to other citizens and to corporations by the laws of the States, which have the primary constitutional responsibility in this area. The sections to which the Minister referred in his speech are contained in part 7 of the Bill. Under the heading 'Carriers' Powers and Immunities' there is a series of clauses, from clause 116 through to clause 123. Again, it is welcome that law does not in this case simply exclude the laws of a State or Territory unless otherwise provided. The Minister may call that, with respect to the government instrumentalities legislation which Government brought down some time but which it has since withdrawn, the Opposition objected to the proposition that there should be a general exemption 116 would apply? from the application of State laws, with the State law being applied only if it specifically brought back in. We think the pattern in this Bill, which provides for an exemption rather than the general non-application of laws, is appropriate. When one looks at clause 116, one finds a very broad potential exemption indeed. That provides: The regulations may provide that specified riers may engage in specified exempt activities: (a) despite specified laws of a State or Territory; or (b) despite any law of a State or Territory. Indeed, we have under this clause a power, by regulation, to exempt in a very broad sense, from any law at all, the corporaland, tions which will be operating under this group of Bills. That is the first issue which I would wish to raise with the Governand so on. ment and to which I would ask for some response. Why is the regulation making power in that clause as broad as it is? think it would be possible to limit that some way and to make it a little clearer as to just what sorts of exemptions are proposed. In the view of the Opposition-I put this as a preliminary view because I think it is wise to get some response on it-it would be desirable for the regulation making power to be structured or delineMinister ated by giving a broad generic description of the types of matters which could erly be considered as exempt activities, rather than simply having a total freedom to exempt from the operation of any law. That is not unreasonable because the nature of the laws from which exemption is being sought is to some extent indithat cated in the subsequent clauses of the in which there are limitations on what a national code may provide. It would seem to me, at least as a starting point, that we the should not have an exemption provision which is any wider than the subjects which are covered in the national code in clause re11 7. I simply put that on the record as the first inquiry of the Opposition. Why the is it that we have this unlimited power ago to exempt? Why can the Government not provide for some delineation, some classification, of the laws to which clause The second concern which I raise with was the Government is that it is provided in that clause 117 that the national code which can be put in place is to have the status of a disallowable instrument for the purposes of the Acts Interpretation Act. To give some explanation of that in this debate-the national code is a provision whereby the Minister can set out a code carwhich provides for the technical, design, safety, environmental or other standards with which carriers must comply in connection with their exempt activities. It goes on to provide that it may impose requirements or prohibitions on carriers in relation to the development or use of or the erection, maintenance or use of buildings or other structures in connection with the carriers' exempt activities, There is some parliamentary control with respect to clause 117. We have a I situation where the Commonwealth can, in by regulation, exempt the corporations from the application of a whole series of laws. It can provide in its place a national code of conduct. Whilst that national code is subject to parliamentary disallowance under the express terms of the clause, there are limitations on the capacity of the Parliament to amend. Again, I ask the and the Government to consider, and to respond to the Opposition, propwhy we should have only that limited power to disallow when, in fact, the provisions could be extremely important provisions going to the conduct of large scale operations. They stand in the place of laws which in some cases are the laws are passed by this Parliament. I ask Bill, the Government to explain why the Parliament's role is limited to one of disallowance. Would it be possible to extend the rights of this Parliament with respect to its dealing with that code? The third point of concern that I raise with the Government is that the obligations to comply with the national code do not seem to be enforced in any serious way. There do not appear to me to be any serious provisions relating to compliance with the code, or rather to non-compliance with the code. I have not been able to find any application of monetary penalties or any provisions for judicial review for acting beyond power, any provisions for civil liability or, indeed, anything else. It may be that somewhere in this massive piece of legislation or somewhere else in the Commonwealth law there is a provision upon which we could rely. At the moment I again seek an answer from the Government as to what measures ensure compliance with this code if it is introduced. Clause 121 provides that Austel may limit carriers' tort liability with respect to supplying basic carriage services. This is not so much a matter of environmental concern. I raise this point in the absence of the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), who is not able to be'in Parliament today. That clause provides that Austel may determine the maximum amount recoverable in tort in relation to an act done or an omission made in relation to the supply of a specific basic carriage service. That again seems to be an extraordinarily broad power and would seem, at least in theory, to give Austel the capacity to put contemptuously low limits on the penalties which could be obtained from somebody who is damaged owing to a carrier's negligent or, indeed, even wilful omission. That seems to me to be an extent of protection which potentially goes beyond what is reasonable. If I might remain with this Bill for a moment, I understand that there is in existence-I have a copy of it-what is described as a memorandum of understanding between the Australian Telecommunications Corporation and the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories concerning the application of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. This document was entered into in 1989. As I understand, it represents an understanding between the exempt body, namely, the Australian Telecommunications Corporation, and the Department of the Environment on when the Commonwealth's normal laws relating to environmental control will be applied, in particular, when the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act will apply. That memorandum has been in place since 1989. It sets out clearly that in most cases the Telecommunications Corporation accepted that it would be subject to the normal provisions of the law. It is, in fact, a much more embracive document than I expected. When I read it I was somewhat surprised by the extent to which it involved the existing corporation's meeting the normal responsibilities of that Commonwealth law. The sort of things that were exempted were the erection of temporary or siting of transportable buildings, the acquisition of non-residential buildings and the acquisition of sites for, or construction of, buildings for residential purposes. The last exemption that I mention is where any change in function is not likely to affect the surrounding environment. Internal modifications are exempted. When we go on we find that most of what I might call the broad acre or external activities of the Corporation under the existing memorandum of understanding are subject to the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. In those circumstances, it seems unnecessary for this legislation to provide an exemption of the breadth that has been granted. It seems to me that that memorandum of understanding represents a pretty reasonable approach to achieving a balance between the commercial requirements of the Telecommunications Corporation and the environmental concerns, which are the concerns of the Opposition and, I am sure, of the Government. The further question that I put to the Government is: why is it that the sort of provisions which are contained in this memorandum of understanding cannot be incorporated by way of amendment into this legislation? It appears that whilst many of the areas which it is proposed should be covered by the national code are standards which would require frequent changing and which are appropriately there to be dealt with by the regulations, the section on project assessment is really about processes and is not subject to the need for regular change. As this is a major exemption from the Act and a foot in the door to possible further exemptions from the Act, and with the suggestion that the national code should be separated into a code on technical standards and a code on safety standards, which might be dealt with in the way that the Bill presently provides, it should be possible to have the code on environmental assessment procedures included as a schedule to the Act. I was somewhat diffident about making that suggestion until I saw this memorandum which seems to me to be a perfectly sensible document. I would not necessarily wish to adopt it all, because I have not had a chance to examine it in detail or discuss it with people who are familiar with its workings. It clearly demonstrates that there is an available document which sets out at present what is seen to be a proper balance. I do think that wherever possible this Parliament should proceed by way of legislation rather than by way of regulation. In the few minutes which remain to me I would like to quickly address some similar issues which arise with respect to the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Bill 1991. In clause 33 of the Bill we find what I regard as a somewhat puzzling exemption. Clause 33 provides: AOTe is not subject, under a law of a State - r Territory relating to the protection .of the ronment, to any requirement, oblIgatIon, lIabilIty, penalty or disability in respect of any act or omission by a former tclecommumcatlOns corporation or by a pcrson who was a director or employee of such a corporation. That sits oddly with the explanatory notes on the legislation, which suggest that the exemptions are being narrowed. Clause 33 appears to provide protect-on from existing civil liabilities. I find that strange; it does not seem to me to· be within the scheme of thought which the Act is putting forward. Again, this is a matter on which I would seek some explanation from the Government. I ask: why should people be absolved from responsibility for things done after the succession date if, but for the change of the nature of the legal form, liability would have existed? There is a possibility that significant injustice could be done. There may well be cases of liability arising under the existing law w.hich are hidden; the damage that has been suffered is not yet known, and therefore the right of action or the knowledge that one has the right of action may not yet have accrued. I think there is a significant risk that an injustice could be done. We do not know, of course, because we do not know the facts, but it seems to me as a matter of possibility that injustice could be done if clause 33 remains as it is. I would have thought that the Opposition, and indeed the whole Parliament, would gladly embrace those provisions of these Bills which broaden the responsibilities of these corporations to meet the normal law of the land. Where, however, there is what appears to be a new exemption being introduced, it seems to me that that is a matter to be queried and explained. I seek that explanation so that the Senate, in carrying out its proper review function, will be able to examine that in a sensible way. Similar comments apply to the exemption in clause 32, which exempts the application of certain laws of a State or Territory to buildings or structures where they were in use before the succession date. I think the same principles arise. If --VI­ there was an existing liability applying to one of these corporations, to merely have this change extinguish the existing legal right seems to me to be quite improper, and I doubt that that is the intention of the Government. It may be that in its response the Government will be able to say that I have in some way misunderstood those clauses, in which case the Opposition will be no longer concerned with them. I raise those as matters in the framework of legislation which is very substantial, very important and which raises great issues of both principle and politics and in which there is perhaps often the tendency to overlook what are important tcchnical questions. It does seem to me that the very welcome move towards a more accountable set of corporations-",78
114,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,82
115,Mr OKEEFE,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I rise to support the Telecommunications Bill and cognate Bills and, in doing so, I make the point that a process which was commenced within the Government in 1987 of reviewing the operations of the government business enterprises (GBEs), which subsequently led to a review of the operations of Telecom Australia and an opening up to competition of some of the aspects of Telecom's operations at the time, particularly the small business systems and other business related services provided by Telecom, I think gave a window into something which came to be accepted by the Government and me as the real opportunity that lies before us with this legislation. For many years in this country we have accepted that the operation of telecommunications as a government monopoly was the only way that this industry could progress. From the operation of those changes in 1987, we saw that in fact Telecom was capable of responding to competition, and the community-including the business community and the general consumer community-was looking for increased performance. The Minister at the table, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), has correctly foreseen this. In fact, he made the point, in a statement released in November last year about the micro-economic reform progress in telecommunications, that the ultimate objective of the Government is to improve telecommunications services and to reduce costs to consumcrs, both residential and business. But, more importantly, I think it had become evident to the Minister and other members of the Government that enhanced commercial freedom in telecommunications in Australia has opened up the way for the winning of major contracts in the Pacific area and a number of other contracts in other parts of the world, including Vietnam, Saudi Arabia and the Asia-Pacific basin, which the Minister outlined in his speech at the time. The process that the Government has been through leading up to the introduction of this legislation has been a painful one, in that the first step, I guess, was to question within ourselves a number of assumptions that had operated for so long and to look at the ways in which change might occur. Then it took to the national conference of the Australian Labor Partv (ALP) and its constituent bodies proposals for the opening up of telecommunications policy-a process which was a long and difficult one and which took a lot of consultation and discussion within the Labor Party. However, I draw attention to the difference between our Party and the Libcral Party of Australia. I cannot help but point out the fact that this has been a very rcal case of understanding the way the Labor Party and its processes are policy driven. People in the Party were prepared to debate those issues and consider them. The media and the business communityeverybody-took the Labor Party's processes very seriously and scrutinised intensely every single step, every single word, every sentence. Everything that was portrayed in media comment led to people rushing to Canberra to put a point of view and to make sure that they were heard within the Labor Party and within the Government. I happened to notice that at the last national conference of the Liberal Party a decision was made to sell a whole Jot of government business enterprises were it to come into power. That decision-a vcry major decision to pri vatise government business in Australia-was taken with very little fanfare and with very little attention by the media or anybody, because basically nobody takes the Opposition's policy process seriously. It is a valid analysis to look at the way an absolute privatisation policy, of which nobody takes much notice, can be adopted and to compare that to the process that the Labor Party went through of scrutinising every single step and every single sentence in a very limited direction. The major decisions that were taken, and which the Minister for Transport and Communications and members of the Government have since moved to give effect to and which arc incorporated in this legislation, are fundamental changes for this industry in Australia. The formation of the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (AOTC) represents a merging of Telecom and the Overseas Telecommunications Corporation, as we have known them until now. That in itself is a very major step in bringing together both our domestic telecommunications industry and its overseas arm with an international focus rather than a competitive domestic focus versus a competitive international focus. Within the Government we had reason to believc that a number of significant opportunities for cxport and advaneemcnt in world telecommunications were lost because thcse two corporations were competing against each other and withholding from each othcr commercially sensitive information that may have helpcd, rather than cooperating and working togcther. The formation of the AOTC will in fact bring together a much more cooperative and penetrating approach towards winning business in world markets, and that is the big opportunity that is available in telecommunications in the future. I should make the point-it is a very basic point-that because o[ all the media coverage and the debate about last year's ALP national conference, two key words seemed to appear constantly: one was 'privatisation' and the other was 'Telecom'. Tn my view, there is still a public perception that in [act what the Government decided to do was to sell Telecom. Obviously, nothing could be further from the truth. What has been decided has been that Tel-eom and OTC will be kept in full pubhe owner-hip, merged together as the new AustralIan and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation and will operate .as a wholly publicly owned enterpnse. . That places the Government's position III very stark contrast to the position of those on the opposite side of the House who are publicly committed to selling Telecom and OTC to the private sector. I do not mind foreshadowing in this discussion tonight that I believe one of the two key issues to be considered by the general public at the next Federal election will be whether they want to see Telecom and OTC sold to the private sector. I can guarantee that when it comes to the crunch and many of the National Party's rural constituents start to focus seriously on its policy of selling Telecom and OTC to the private sector-meaning that the cost of telephone calls in country areas, which in the past have been grossly subsidised by the community service obligations required of Telecom by the Government, will be up for grabs in the privatisation bag-my friends in the National Party who sit beside me here will have to do some serious thinking about their position versus that of the gung ho Liberals. Mr Bilney-They will be petrified.",82
116,Mr OKEEFE,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Of course they will be petrified, as the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel says. When we add that telephone bill from the private supplier to the other ingredient that came up so starkly at the New South Wales election on Saturday, the issue of the consumption tax, or the goods and services tax, it is my prediction that our friends from the National Party will be a long way from the front of the ruck when it comes to carrying this ball forward during the next Federal election. A subject that is very dear to my interests in this matter is industry policy. I welcomed very much, in the second reading speech by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) on the introduction of this omnibus legislation, the very clear commitment to the maintenance and development of Australia's domestic telecommunications industry. None of us in the Government resiles from the fact that Telecom, while it has been the monopoly provider, and OTC to the extent that it has been involved, have been very active in fostering the development of the domestic Australian telecommunications industry. We provide in that field both high level employment opportunities and high level products that by Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development standards are at the forefront in the world. At the same time, we acknowledge that, while the operation may have been very successful in engineering standards, it has not been as responsive to consumers and customers as it should have been and, therefore, it became necessary to consider the introduction of competition to provide that edge for the customer. While the decision to sell the satellite, Aussat, as the prime base for the new competitor and to allow full service competition against Telecom may have caused nervousness and considerable discontent in the early stages of the debate, it is now coming through to me from people in the new AOTC that they feel they can meet the game. They are starting to think in terms of the new opportunities that will be opened up in world markets. In my own electorate officc we have had a major falling off in complaints about customerrelated matters from these operations since that edge of competition has been introduced. I have no doubt that many members of the Parliament; who are particularly sensitive to their constituents and the issues they raise, will also have realised that the game has been lifted at the consumer end since the reforms of 1987, and this will continue to be the case. This legislation opens up for us a new era in telecommunications in Australia. It happens to be one of the industries where we have given a priority to education. The training effort in the industry has been very strong. We have been very conscious of value adding so that the equipment and the expertise is at the top end of the market. There have been major international players in the industrycompanies such as Ericssons, Alcatel and STC Australia-who have been prepared to invest and develop in Australia because it has been a leading edge part of the world. None of us should forget that, as the developed Australian-speaking country in the Asia-Pacific Basin, we provide an excellent opportunity for an enhanced telecommunications industry which can focus on the global market both in a competitive sense and in a cooperative sense. I think many of these directions are the right ones. It has taken a considerable amount of discussion and debate within the Government, within the ALP, with the trade unions and with the consumer movement to reach this point. I commend the Minister for his incorporation of consumer interest in the brief for Austel. It is the first time that consumers of telephone services and other telecommunications services have actually been given a place, a focus, where their interests must be directly heard and listened to. I commend the Minister for his ongoing commitment to ensuring that competition does not mean that the players in the field will simply buy in the cheapest imported products in order to keep their prices down. The guarantee is there in the legislation and the commitment is there in the Government's requirement that the major players both implement and develop the Government's industry policy as it relates to telecommunications. Finally, we come to this issue as one of the two major focuses of the next Federal election. The Government has made a specific decision to keep Telecom and OTC in full public ownership; to merge them so that they work with one another in the new Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation instead of competing against each other at the margins. Set against that is the very clear and specific policy commitment of the Opposition-one of the few it has actually made-that it intends to sell these enterprises. Our National Party colleagues in particular are very sensitive to the fact that their constituents understand well that there has been a major cross-subsidy over many decades to rural users of these communications systems. Their constituents more than any have much to lose from a telecommunications system which has been sold off to the private sector and prices its policies on a straight user-pays approach: he who makes a profit gets the serviee; he who does not loses it. Our country colleagues know very well that that is what they are going to be dealing with. I predict that that issue of the privatisation of Telecom, along with the consumption tax question, will be at the core of the next Federal election. I wind up by saying that I support the legislation. I was surprised that the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) who spoke before me went to such detail in his technical analysis and questioning of the components of the legislation. It may well be that the environmental issues and other technical issues he raised may warrant some consideration, but I think the Opposition is starting to understand that its privatisation policy is not one that it can portray too pUblicly. In my view the House tonight has seen the start of that very process because instead of gctting up at the dispatch box and pulling this legislation to pieces on the basis of its philosophical position, tacking the Government for keeping Telecom and OTC in full public ownership and taking on the very issues which it claims to be so opposed to, the Opposition went to a very technical analysis of a very technical picce of legislation. All that signals to me IS that the Opposition knows very well that this debate will be a limp one on its side of the House; whether it is a limp debate or a real one, Government members welcome it because it is one they will win.",83
117,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I rise tonight in the debate on the Telecommunications Bill and cognate Bills to deal with a few areas which concern me and other honourable members on this side of the House. So far the entire telecommunications debate has been loaded with ironies and contradictions. What the Labor Government found so repugnant in 1983 has now been embraced as essential to its microeconomic reform program; that is deregulation of the telecommunicatio-s system. Unfortunately, but perhaps typical1y, the Government has botched its reform package, and Australians now face a powerful duopoly situation embracing extraordinary ministerial powers, a lack of administrative appeal process and negative services aspe-ts. To coin a phrase, duopoly rhymes WIth monopoly. Merging Telecom Australia with OTC Ltd and linking the sale of the $500m debt-ridden Aussat Pty Ltd to the second carrier and disallowing further entrants until 1997 will create an inferior market structure that will benefit only the duopolists. As is often the case in duopolistic situations, the organisations collude in price fellowship. On the basis of worldwide experience of duopolistic competition, it would seem certain that the advantages of competition are unlikely to fol1ow through to the consumer from the model proposed by this Government. A reliable and cost effective telecommunications system should be the right of all Australians just as education is the right of all Australians. Such a situation can only come about through the at- imposition of community service obligations, which are commonly referred to as CSOs. I am certain that the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), who is to follow me in this debate, will certainly highlight some of the needs of rural and remote Australia. I hope he and many of his colleagues will address that area because it certainly worries me. Community service obligations' are a government requirement which directs government enterprises to undertake certain functional activities, which are not necessarily commercially viable in their own right. Telecom's CSO obligation requires the supply of a standard telephone service throughout Australia on an equitable basis. Of the three Government telecommunications carriers-Telecom, OTC and Aussat-only Telecom is formally required to discharge CSOs. Telecom's obligation ceases with the supply of a standard telephone service, making CSOs less relevant in the future. As technology advances, rural and regional Australia will require access to many telecommunications facilities over and above that fixed telephone network. Here my analogy of education as a need and communication as an equally important need is particularly relevant. The quality of communications has vital influence on the lives of isolated people, and access to communication networks can help alleviate isolation, particularly in the area of educational program and material. I assure honourable members on the other side of the House that right now many of these people in remote and rural Australia feel very isolated and quite often discriminated against, particularly by some of the policies of this Government. CSOs should have as their objective equal access to high quality communication at equal cost to all Australians regardless of geographic location to ensure availability of all present and future enhanced services. The provision of a standard telephone service does not comply with this objective. In fact, OTC and Aussat should have CSOs imposed, as does Telecom, so that in isolated areas, for example, teaching and educational programs could be beamed via satellite into family homes and small isolated schools in the remote areas of Australia. We should not bypass the opportunity we now have to address the area of distance education, and the need to service those many communities and small schools-oneteacher schools in so many instancesthrough the medium of Telecom, OTC· and Aussat. If we fail to do that, we will fail in our duty as legislators for the future generations of Australians. Current CSO arrangements are purely internal to Telecom; that is, subject to Telecom's own internal priorities and political whims. Therefore, the location of a new exchange or the provision of additional services depends entirely on Telecom's internal managerial priorities. This is simply not good enough. Obviously direct and specific appropriation must be made in the Budget to ensure that CSOs are being met. The announcement of the Government's telecommunications reform package prompted the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to give an undertaking that local calls would stay untimed for residences. I inform the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), who is at the table, that timed local calls are in existence in rural Australia and that many communities in my electorate have no such thing as untimed local calls. To take one example out of the many in my electorate of Maranoa, the residents of the community of Eulo cannot make a telephone call to their neighbours one, two, or three kilometres away without a charge of 22c for every three minutes of that call. I can give numerous examples of towns and communities in my electorate that do not have untimed local calls. This is obviously grossly inequitable and makes a mockery of reports that suggest the Prime Minister will guarantee un'timed local calls for all Australians. It is often elaimed that city Australia subsidises rural Australia in the area of telecommunications; however, I believe this example shows that this is not necessarily true. The mode of thinking which relates outback Australia to the costly provision of telecommunications is fast becoming outdated. Rapid technological changes within the telecommunications industry have meant that distance is less of a factor in relation to the costs of providing telecommunications services. When costings are done on the current revenue base, the importance of incoming telephone calls is often overlooked. Telecom currently defines a telephone call initiated in a city area to a receiver in a rural or regional area as revenue from a city user. If it were not for the receiver of that telephone call in rural and remote Australia, there would in fact be no revenue generated. So it is important that we make the qualification that we need to think very clearly about the revenue base in rural and remote Australia. A call initiated in a city to rural and remote Australia needs to be considered. The Telecommunications Bill provides extraordinary powers to the Minister of the day while completely bypassing the consumer. The Minister has the power to set and vary the conditions of licences to be issued by Austel. Austel, although charged with the general function of protecting consumers, is under little obligation from what is proposed to do so. Austel must consult with consumers where it is 'appropriate and practical to' do so'. I would say that that is not a commitment that would ever be really taken seriously. However, no formal consultation machinery is proposed. The reform package proposes a deterioration in services with regard to network termination. Network termination, the point to which the carriers are responsible for wiring, will remain at the wall telephone sockct until 1993. From July 1993 the termination point could well be the property boundary. Ml' LloydWhich would be very expensive. Ml' BRUCE SCOTT-As the honourable member for Murray, the Acting Leader of the National Party of Australia, says, it is going to be very expensive. Obviously, the further the termination point is from the telephone, the more complex and costly telephone servicing will be Cor users. This will particularly impact on rural and remote Australia. From the property boundary, consumers will have to employ a carrier or a private technician to complete the telephone line to the wall socket and handset. I can flag right now to the House the difficulties that this implies for rural and remote communities in respect of service, connection and repairs. Rural and remote Australia will feel let down on this issue. We are running short of time and there is a great deal more that I would like to talk about. However, before I conclude I would like to say something about the service industry and infrastructure. Briefly, throughout the 1980s services outpaced export of goods and, by 1988, 20 per cent of the world trade was in the export of services. Presently, Australia accounts for just 2 per cent of the world telecommunication equipment market. In 1988-89 telecommunications and audiovisual equipment export earnings totalled less than $163m of our total export earnings of $34.5 billion. These figures are a result of an undersupply of information technology professionals that threatens to hold back growth when the economy stalis to recover. For example, the average annual growth in completions in computing from higher education was only 7 per cent, about half the growth rate of employment in that industry. Competition in the telecommunications area is in the interests of all Australians as it will drive prices towards cost. I hope that the Government and the Minister who is responsible for this area will look very elosely at the community service obligations that apply to rural and remote Australia. More particularly, I hope that they will look at the community service obligation that I believe we have in the area of distance education. This is an area that we can be good at and that we can sell to the rest of the world in order to generate export income. I believe that we will be on a winner if we can sell equipment, services and technology which will enable distance education to be beamed via a telecommunications network. I would like the Minister to consider very carefully the needs of rural and remote Australians. So many of these people right across Australia deserve consideration in respect of this Bill. Ml' SNOWDON (Northern Territory) (9.25 p.m.)-First of all, I would like to comment briefly in support of what was said by the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe). I will not elaborate on what he said, except to say that his comments in relation to the Opposition's proposals for the privatisation of telecommunications in this country were spot on. Perhaps I will have an opportunity to come back to that at some later stage. In many respects, what the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) had to say was praiseworthy. However, I think he is deluded if he thinks that under a privatised Telecom, as is proposed by the coalition parties, there would be any added value in the context of service to remote Australians. In fact, I would suggest to the honourable member that he discuss in some detail with the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) what the implications would be for the people in his electorate if the Opposition were to pursue the proposals which it has put forward. In particular-and I would suggest that the honourable member think about thisin the context of community service obligations it is hardly smart, I would have thought, to have CSOs coming off budget, particularly in an environment, as the Opposition would propose, where there is not only a fully deregulated telecommunications industry but a privatised telecommunications industry along with a proposition that it would cut $3 billion off government expenditure. If the honourable member believes sincerely that that would advance the interests of the people of remote Australia, I think he is wrong. I would suggest that the honourable member give that some thought because, as the honourable member for Burke said, that will be an issue at the next Federal election. It is an issue with which the honourable member will have to deal. The honourable member should go around his electorate, as I do in my electorate of the Northern Territory, and discuss with people the issue of telecommunications. If he does so he will find that the one thing they do not want is a privatised telecommunications system. So I would suggest that he give that some further thought. Perhaps he might use his influence or the influence of the National Party of Australia in the party room to dissuade the front bench of the coalition from pursuing that objective. The time available for debate is reasonably short this evening. At the outset, I would like to commend the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley)-I am not crawling-for the work that he has done in developing this package of legislation. I would also like to commend the work that has been done by the Caucus transport and communications subcommittee headed by the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price). That subcommittee, in consultation with the Minister, discussed issues of great importance not only to the Caucus but also to people in the wider community who had concerns in the initial stages of the framing of this legislation. I would like to place on record my belief that if it had not been for the goodwill of the Minister for Transport and Communications we would not have seen the result that is before the House tonight. Those Australians who look at this package of legislation and observe what is in it will say that there has been a major victory for the Australian community. The reforms are designed with the dual purpose of, first, gaining maximum economic leverage from the rapid changes in the telecommunications industry in Australia and, secondly, ensuring that our telecommunications system fulfils its current and expected future critical social role as a provider of information and a connector of people's lives. As someone from a remote area, that latter purpose is extremely important. This legislation follows in the footsteps of the decisions made, as we all know, at the Australian Labor Party special national conference last year, a conference which laid the philosophical foundations for the way this Government has approached telecommunications reform. We do not believe that public monopoly for monopoly's sake has any merit. However, we do believe that public ownership in telecommunications is important and must be safeguarded. Despite what the Opposition would have us believe, public ownership does not imply commercial weakness. As the recent economic history of Australia shows, poor management can be attributed to those both in the public and private sectors. I think we are all aware of the failures in the private sector over the last 18 months to two years-hardly the result of this Government's polides but, more importantly, the result of mismanagement by people in those companies. The important issue is that company managements are well served by their shareholders-in this case, the Federal Government. Telecom's shareholders, the Federal Government, must provide the Corporation with an appropriate structure in which to undertake commercial functions and also to fulfil the other goals we set the Corporation, such as universal service. I see continued public ownership of Telecom-OTC as a strength of the Australian telecommunications system. Telecommunications infrastructure is an important national asset that is the key to the building of a strong and vibrant economy and society in the years ahead. There is absolutely no sense, strategically speaking, in selling this to the highest bidder and thereby losing control of the further development of the national telecommunications system. The key to a strong telecommunications system is a strong major player: in our case, the soon to be merged Telecom-OTC. Australia is a small country in the global telecommunications system, and our best opportunity to develop an internationally competitive industry is on the back of a strong and competitive company. In these decisions we have laid the groundwork for ensuring that Telecom-OTC fulfils this goal. It must be remembered that, while in market terms we are small, we have great expertise in particular areas, including service to remote areas, which I will address later. As I have said, the key to strengthening Australian telecommunications lies in strengthening Telecom-OTe. I believe that by exposing the company to competitive pressures we will strengthen it further by making it more responsive to customer needs. In this legislative package we have learned from the way other nations have reformed telecommunications. In my view, the wholesale flogging off of national telecommunications assets, as happened in New Zealand, is a recipe for weakening the strength and equity of the telecommunications system. As the Opposition fails to realise, in a small country like Australia we cannot have our cake and eat it too in this respect. We cannot build a strong national telecommunications carrier which, we hope, wil- - ook internationally for mark-t opportumtIes and at the same time sell It off. It is just not on. What is more to the point, the sale of Telecom-OTC would put excessive demands on Australian domestic capital markets and lead inevitably to a diminution of the ability of the carrier to be Australian owned. The decision to maintain a publicly owned TelecomOTC in a competitive environment provided this Government with a challenge to ensure that the social importance of telecommunications is given due recognition. There is no doubt that the complex technological basis of modern society means that access to telecommunications is a key issue for the maintenance of a socially just Australia. To give an example, Ann Moyal, a researcher associated with the Centre for International Research on Communication and Information Technologies, has produced research to show that telecommunications policy is a central issue for women in Australia. In an article in 1989, she said: A telecommunications policy that lowers the social equity of its people on industrial and economic grounds may forfeit Australia's reputation as a telecommunications leader, widen the political gender gap and impoverish the character of women's communication and its part in our evolving information society. I believe the legislation before the House meets this challenge, and it does so by maintaining the merged Telecom-OTC in public ownership. The Government has the power to influence the industry, as a shareholder of the incumbent carrier as well as the industry regulator. The Government has already determined that the merged Telecom-OTC will be the universal service carrier, meaning that TelecomOTC will be responsible for meeting the legislation's requirement that universal service be met, including pay phones. The independent industry regulator, Austel, will have responsibility to ensure that Telecom-OTC meets this responsibility. The Australian and Overseas Telecomm unications Corporation Bill enables the Minister to set price control arrangements for the merged carrier. The Government has already determined that these price caps will be 5.5 per cent below the consumer price index, meaning that there will be real price falls in future years. This will ensure that the benefits of competition flow to all consumers, particularly those in residential areas where the market penetration of a second carrier is expcctcd to be slow initially. The existence of these price caps will build on the real price falls which have occurred in recent years and Telecom's accord with consumer groups. Under the packagc of legislation, carriers will have prescribed carrier obligations, or PCOs, which will ensure specific objectives are met; for example, that the purchaser of Aussat provides capacity for remote commercial television services, homestead and community broadcasting satellite services, defence purposes, CAA and other national interest obligations. Austel's powers will be widened to enable it to pursue consumer complaints and undertake public hearings. I might also say that the telecommunications legislation has been prepared in a very open fashion, with an exposure draft being circulated before the tabling of the Bills in the House. Consumer groups had a very active role in the translation of the exposure draft into the Bills we see today. Of particular interest to me, as I have said previously in response to the speech by the honourable member for Maranoa, is the issue of telecommunications in remote areas. In July of last year I was fortunate enough to speak at a conference on communications in rural and remote Australia held in Broome in Western Australia. At that confercnce I made the observation that the Govcrnment's microeconomic reform agenda does not diminish its commitment to providing universal service. As I mentioncd earlier, the commitment to universal service remains in this legislation. It is important to consider why universal service is so vital. Telecommunications overcomes the tyranny of distance. For the many remote communities in the Northern Territory and elsewhere in Australia, particularly northern Australia, the telephone is an essential part of life. New technologies, such as faxes and computer data links, have revolutionised the way in which people Jiving in these communities have access to the outside world. We are seeing for the first time the abilities of remote Australians to actively participate in our society. I think that needs to be stressed. Many of my constituents, living on remote pastoral properties or in Aboriginal communities, can phone or fax my office, or your office, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I can provide them, as you can, with information at the push of a few buttons. It is of dramatic importance. People do not understand how important that is. These people are participating in democracy, and such participation was barely conceivable a short time ago. I will give an illustration of this. Some years ago I spent 21h to three years living in a small community in the north-west of' South Australia. That community had no telephone. It had an irrcgular air service-once a week or every 10 days if we were lucky. It used the Hying doctor radio. It had open communications: everyone in South Australia, the Northern Territory or Western Australia on the same frequency could hear what was said. It was 800 kilometres on a dirt road from Alice Springs. This was before the road from the Stuart Highway to Ayers Rock was bituminised. It took two days to drive there. This is a community where between 30 and 40 different government agencies had a need to do business with the people. This meant, of course, not only that it was time consuming for people to travel in from Alice Springs to the community, or vice versa, but also that at times important communication was never made. So decisions which affected these communities were often made without their input. To me, what the telephone has done-and this is one community in the north-west of South Australia; a range of communities in South Australia have been put on this program-is to dramatically change this community by the Telecom remote and rural area program. That community now has a telephone system. The people there can now use a fax machine. They can now communicate with other people. They no longer have to drive for two days or fly to discuss business with people. Not only is that important to the community, but I would suggest that over time there is a direct saving to the taxpayer. Anyone who believes that in the short term the cost outweighs the long term benefits of these services is, in my view, understating the savings and does not understand the benefits of these services to remote area communities. I know that there are some people who would argue this. That is why I think it is extremely important to point out, when the honourable member for Maranoa and others argue that we should put community service obligations on budget, that they fail to understand either the mechanics of the budgetary processes or the way in which we need to ensure that these communities are serviced appropriately by telecommunications systems. I would suggest again to the honourable member for Bass that if his view about privati sing telecommunications and further deregulating this industry means that we do not provide CSOs in the appropriate way, he ought to think again. Further, those people can now more readily participate in the mainstream economy. For example, particularly with the marketing of cattle, people use the telecommunications system in a way which means they no longer have to take their cattle to market. It is important that we understand these benefits. I believe that people who live in the cities often do not understand why it is important to have telecommunications supplied in an appropriate way to people in remote areas. I do not believe they understand the true savings to the Australian community of having these telecommunications provided. All this has been possible largely through Telecom's RRAP program in recent years. Through RRAP, it has developed expertise in technologies which will serve it well for many years. It is an acknowledged world leader in many aspects of remote area telecommunications systems. The digital radio concentrator system (DRCS) used throughout remote Australia is an excellent example of the appropriate application of technology in Australia. The honourable member for Maranoa discussed the use of satellite communications. I agree with him, but I think there is a great deal of benefit to be gained from . exploiting satellites in remote area telecommunications and communications generally. There is a unique project being developed in the Tanami area north-west of Alice Springs where a group of Aboriginal communities are getting financial assistance from government but also providing substantial funds themselves to provide their own communications network. It is on the RRAP program. I had the fortunate experience of being involved in a test transmission using Sydney, Lajamanu, which is a community about 600 kilometres north west of Alice Springs, and Yuendumu, another community about 300 kilometres north west of Alice Springs, on a link-up having a conference call. This is an enormous advantage, and one can only speculate on what life might be like for these communities some years down the track when they have the ability to communicate with other people in that way. There will be immense savings in time and it will ensure that they have the appropriate input into decision making processes as well as being up to date in getting information from other sources. The telecommunications legislation package that is before the House is going to be a boon to the Australian community. It will advance the Government's micro-economic reform agenda in a way which I do not believe the Opposition or many people in our community thought possible some years ago. I again commend the legislation to the House.",85
118,Mr DOWNER,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Mayo) (9.43 p.m.)The honourable member for Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) made some rather nice points towards the end of his speech about the need for telecommunications services to be provided to remote communities. I to say at the outset of my remarks on this side of the House would; support his sentiments and, regardless I suspect of the complexion of government in Australia, there will always be a commitment to ensuring that those services are provided to remote communities around Australia. There may be an argument about different ways of doing that and whether the community service obligation should be on budget or off budget, and whether there should be cross-subsidisation or direct community-wide subsidisation through a budgetary allocation. But regardless of that, it is important that the House understands and the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) properly understands that those broader obligations would remain after the next election. One of the interesting aspects of this debate is that there is also on both sides of the House-and I think throughout the Australian community-a recognition that telecommunications should be a central part of the so-called micro-economic reform agenda. Indeed, a test of a government in Australia, which is trying to keep pace with the rest of the world community-which is really the acid test of any successful government's record in terms of economic management-is going to be whether it can achieve the right kinds of telecommunication reform. The test of the package that is being put to the House today is whether it succeeds in doing that. It should, for example, increase domestic productivity in telecommunications to the world's very best standards. It should in turn contribute-as I will explain latervery substantially to the alleviation of Australia's balance of payments problem and the stabilisation of its foreign debt. That is the objective test that this package has to be put to. We on this side of the House are saying that this particular package of legislation fails the test because it does not maximise the opportunities that are available telecommunications in this country. There are many people on the Government side of the House and in the bureaucracy who well and truly recognise that fact. It has been said that this package has, in the first place, been driven by the economic rationalist desire· for microeconomic reform, which we are enthusiastic to support, but has been held back by other considerations which are purely political, not the least of which being the concerns of the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association (A TEA), whose lobbying against the proposition of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) for telecommunications reform, which was overthrown in the Cabinet and by the caucus committee-which is, by the way, dominated by the ATEA-has led to Australia's getting a substantially poorer package of reforms than might otherwise be the case. When this whole issue of telecommunications reform is being debated in Australia, when this particular package is being assessed and when other aspects of the future of Telecom Australia and telecommunications generally are being considered, I am concerned that there is very limited public debate in Australia and that is of very poor quality. There are too many people with vested interests in this telecommunications debate who simply run scare campaigns. The scare campaigns run, for example, over the privatisation of Telecom regardless of the evidence which is there for all to see in many parts of the world, not just in Britain. Regardless of that evidence, the scare campaigns by the vested interests dominate media consideration of these issues and therefore dominate public concern. A more general concern about the process of reform in Australia is that we really have limited public debate in this country and that public debate is extraordinarily unsophisticated. It is not because we as Australians are unsophisticated; it is because the vested interest groups which always stand to lose something in the process of reform are the most listened to by the media. There is no doubt that there are some politicians who are to enamoured of the whole concept of the scare campaign and who will pick up that concern. As the shadow Minister for trade, I find the aspect that interests me most in this package is the opportunities for Australia to become an international player in telecommunications, particularly in our region. One of the ways that I judge this· package is whether it will succeed in doing that. I do not think many people would argue with the proposition that Australia could earn hundreds of millions of dollars per annum simply by being a significant regional player in telecommunications. There are two aspects of that proposition. Firstly, it has been put to me-and it seems a very rational proposition-that Australia could become, more than it is already, a regional highway for telecommunications and an alternative highway to Japan. I think that is something the Minister would be well aware of. Secondly, we ought to be able to continue to build up in this country, capitalising on some of the technological advantages that we have, regionally speaking, a telecommunications industry which could make a very significant contribution to our gross domestic product. It is worth reflecting on the status of telecommunications throughout the Asia Pacific region and particularly our part of it. In Australia, to put things in persective, we have 44.9 lines per 100 people. New Zealand has approximately the same figure. In Japan it is slightly less, but approximately the same. By comparison, a lot of countries within our region have extremely undeveloped telecommunications industries. For example, in Indonesia-remembering that the figure in Australia is nearly 45 lines per 100 people-there are 0.5 lines per 100 people; Malaysia, 7.4; the Philippines, 1.0; China, with 1.1 billion people, 0.2 lines per 100 people; and in the Indo-Chinesc countries, in particular Vietnam, the figure is something like 0.1 lines per 100 people. Those economies being very rapidly growing economies, that means that there are enormous opportunities in our region-I cannot overstate that-for the Australian telecommunications industry both as a highway for telecommunications and as a provider of telecommunications technology. Already it has to be said that we are very well placed as a country. We have very sophisticated communications in Australia comparcd with other parts of our region. I have illustrated that. Therefore we have a comparative advantage against other countries in our region. As an illustration, we have very large international traffic volumes through Australia. In terms of international traffic volU-1C, Japan has something like 319 million m1l1utes. Australia has 239 million minutes, which is not a lot less than Japan's, despite Japan's massively larger population. Singapore has 99 million minutes. Those figures, of course, are small in comparison with the major countries of Europe, the United States or, interestingly enough, even Canada, although Canada's figures are overwhelmingly dominated by traffic between Canada and the United States, which I would argue is a little artifIcial and artificially inflates its figures. The point is that whilst we are not as big in terms of international traffic as some other parts of the world, we are big and we are, therefore, a major player. We ought to be able to exploit very successfully this comparative advantage we have as a country. Let us face it, this legislation is a cobbled together compromise. When I look at it I ask myself: have the Minister and the Government really brought forward legislation which will guarantee that as a country we can successfully exploit this trading opportunity for Australia in our region? First of all, this legislation and the Government's approach to telccommunications do not give one a lot of confidence that we in Australia are going to keep ahead of technological evolution within our region or, indeed, internationally in a general sense. It is worth reflecting that even Telecom believes that our present position is an extremely precarious one. A few days ago, on 11 May, a submission from Telecom to the Department of Finance was leaked to the Australian newspaper. That submission made very interesting reading, and it is very relevant to this legislation and to the whole approach to telecommunications by the Government. The submission pointed out that Telecom was telesuffering from a severe financial squeezea liquidity squeeze was the phrase used. It pointed out that Australia was going to fall behind the international pace in network modernisation unless there was a substantial recapitalisation of Telecom. The submission said: Unless this trend in Australia's modernisation is reversed, Australian companies' ability to compete both locally and overseas will be significantly diminished and Australia will be less likely to attract overseas interests to invest and manufacture here. This is because the critical input cost of communications in Australia will not be falling in real terms at the same rate as its competitors . . . In addition, Australia's productivity will suffer the network will not be capable of supporting new products and services that are dependent on modern technologies. I Apparently the submission went on to point out that New Zealand has pulled well ahead of Australia in implementing key digitalisation technology underpinning leading edge telecommunications services. That is a very serious concern, illustrated by Telecom itself, about its capacity to compete internationally. Frankly, it may well be that this problem, this lack of capital in Telecom-I am not sure that the Minister wants this to happen but the Government may very well ensure it-is compounded in the process of the takeover of OTC Ltd. This legislation does not tell us how much Telecom will be forced to pay to the Government for the takeover of OTC, but I understand that Treasury is trying to get $1.5 billion out of Telecom for that process, which will simply lead to a further depletion of Telecom's financial capability. This money will go to the Government and will lead to a range of boasts during Question Time about what a marvellous job it is doing with the Budget, et cetera. We can predict all that, but the point is that it will further undermine the capacity of Telecom to compete internationally. I think the Minister accepts that point. I hope that in his speech at the end of this debate he will tell us that he accepts that point. It would be an honest and reasonable thing for him to do, and I know that he wants to be honest and reasonable. The fact is that he is under too much pressure, I suspect, from the Treasurer and possibly from other Ministers-the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), for example. The indications are that he will not win the day. But that is not pointed out in the legislation. We just have that critical question left wide open. This is a critical question because Telecom's finances are in a state of chaos. That is what Telecom thinks. When one looks at international comparisons, one can see what financial problems Telecom has. When one looks at the debt-equity ratio of Telecom, which is an important as guide to its capacity to compete-there is no doubting that it is extraordinarily high compared with that of its major competitors, and I am talking of competitors in terms of that regional market I discussed earlier. When one looks as companies such as Bell South or Ameritech or AT&T or British Telecom, which is getting more and more aggressive in our region, or Cable and Wireless or NTT, the Japanese company, they all have debt-equity ratios which at a glance I can tell the House are less than 51 per cent. Many of them have debt-equity ratios as low as 23 per cent in the case of Cable and Wireless, or in the low 40s. How does Telecom stand up? Telecom's debt-equity ratio is a little hard to be sure of, but it is somewhere between 50 and 65 per cent. In the first place that creates a very substantial financial problem for Telecom in terms of being able to provide ready finance in the current climate when it says it needs to do that. Secondly, it places great strain on its capacity to raise further money. The Government has said that it will not put extra money into Telecom. I think the Minister has argued in Cabinet for extra funds, extra equity, to be pumped into Telecom. I say to the Minister that he has lost that debate. That will not happen, and the budgetary exigencies are such that one can imagine that that would not happen. Actually, I am not suggesting for a minute that it should happen. However, the point is: where else is Telecom going to be able to get money from? It is subject to Loan Council ceilings. It has nQt been able to borrow more money, again because of the intervention of the Treasurer and those Loan Council ceilings and the overall c-iling for the public tor borrowing requirement. It has no other ability to raise equity. That is the critical point of my remarks tonight. To ensure that Telecom can compete successfully in this regional market the Government has to make sure that can achieve the leading edge of technolders ogy in the region, that it can go out and package get contracts in the region, that it can invest in various projects in the region. That is the only way it can be done, but it can do those things only if it has a capacity te raise capital. The Governsense ment, and surely its advisers, must know that a rational man or woman would see only too clearly that the way to raise that additional capital is through a process privatisation which ideologically-not any rational reason-has been rejected this legislation. So the one great opportuplace. nity those on the other side of the House have to make sure that this country capitalises on the enormous opportunities tage. it has in terms of regional telecommunications trade is lost because, as Telecom pointed out in its submission to the Department of Finance, it does not have the money to be able to capitalise those advantages. Every man, woman and child in Australia will suffer because of that-because of a blind, old-fashioned ideological judice that the Government struggled with privatisation in the airlines because it left with no choice in terms of funding. But Telecom, so dominated by Australia's largest trade union, the trade union that dominates the Caucus committee, the ATEA-",91
119,Mr BEAZLEY,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,It's the smallest.,95
120,Mr DOWNER,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"It has something like to 24,000 members. It does not matter; it is one of the largest. It dominates the cus committee on telecommunications. The simple point is that the Australian Labor Party has no greater aversion than that of offending the ideological prejuner dices of the ATEA. As I said, a rational person can see that we have to try to ensure that Telecom can raise capital to become internationally competitive and gain those advantages, and that opportusecnity is being denied. There will be no increase in equity from the Government. I am not arguing that there should be, but there will be none. There will be no capacity for Telecom to go out and borrow extra money, and it knows it. The whole it of this telecommunications package founfirst and foremost on that ideological rock. Consequently the Labor Party's will fail. In the context of the next election and beyond, we are prepared to take on anybody who thinks that it is ideological nonto allow private sector equity into telecommunications, but we will do that because we know that in the end that is the only way for this country to capitalise of on the advantages that it can gain from for being involved actively in the interin national telecommunications marketIf we lose that opportunity, it will be yet another sob story about how Australia threw away a comparative advan",95
121,Mr ELLIOTT,TELECOMMUNICATIONS," At the outset of my remarks on the package of reforms that has been introduced by the Government as the Teleon communications Bill and related legislation, I would like to take issue with some of the remarks of the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). What we pregot from the honourable member for Mayo was a turgid diatribe driven by idewas ology, with very little substance, little weight or import and no real attempt to deal with the issues that were confronted in the legislation, which, for the first time, sets up a competitive environment in the telecommunications field. One would have thought that at this stage the Opposition would have been able say that, while it never had the capacity to introduce significant reforms in the Cautelecommunications field, it would give this measure support. One would have expected the Opposition to say that this mcasure establishes in a transitional mana duopoly in the telecommunications ficld to enable an orderly competitive environment to be established and then the ability to move on through the next phases to achieve the sorts of objectives that we all share for our telecommunications industry to be able to compete and participate more effectively in the global telecommunications opportunities offered over the next decade and beyond. But that is not what we got. We were told that, because this legislation has set up safeguards to maintain community service obligations, the conservatives would do things differently. The Opposition says that such matters should not be incorporated in the legislation before the House. The Opposition would still look after the remote and rural area needs through Budget measures or whatever. To hear the honourable member for Mayo and the earlier National Party speaker, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), one would get the impression that they have abandoned the rural and remote areas not only in their consumption tax drive but also, very directly, in the field of telecommunications-because that is precisely what would happen under the sort of arrangement the Opposition articulates in its vague fashion. I want to talk about some of the advantages of the duopoly setting as part of achieving major micro-economic reform. We hear a lot about micro-economic reform, but the measures contained in the Bills we are debating tonight provide a very sustained way of ensuring that micro-economic reform in a key area, telecommunications, is achieved. The opportunities that are offered to our industry in our regional area, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, are immense in the telecommunications field. They will be achieved best by the merger of OTe Ltd and Telecom Australia. That was something the honourable member for Mayo did not want to deal with. He said that there would be many restrictions because there would be a publicly owned entity. We make no apologies for maintaining the publicly owned entity in the merged form of OTe and Telecom. Surely that has the very effect of setting up an arrangement so that the opportunities for export into Asia are enhanced. That is the whole idea of that aspect of this reform. Another aspect of the changing nature of the role of the government business enterprises which are contained in the duopoly arrangement, the minimisation of the costs of structural change, is also an important consideration in this transitional period when we will move from a monopoly in telecommunications to a competitive environment. The honourable member for Mayo said at one stage during his remarks that we would be taking the step of freezing out private involvement in telecommunications. Of course, what is being done is the very reverse of that. We are actually enabling the competitor to play a direct role and ensuring that the merged OTe-Telecom organisation can take advantage of the international opportunities and expertise that have been built up, as well as the domestic skills that exist in our telecommunications industry. From people on the other side such as the honourable member for Mayo we hear all too often constant nagging criticism because of union participation. There have been dramatic achievements in our telecommunications industry; the industry has served Australia well, and that has beenat least in large measure-due to the s.kills and acumen of the people who have worked in that industry. To constantly have the criticism that we had tonight from the honourable member for Mayo does not do justice to the people who provided that service throughout Australia in an efficient arid effective way. We are seeking to ensure that, because telecommunications is changing so dramatically, because the whole nature of technology will be transformed fundamentally over the next decade, we are placing our telecommunications industry in the best position to take advantage of the unique opportunities that are offered. One of the things that I am particularly pleased to see in this legislation is that we spell out the community service commitments that both the merged OTe-Telecom operation and the private competitor will have to provide. We are a separate continent and we have telecommunications needs which are different from the sorts of telecommunications that might be suitable for Britain. Special factors apply. In the diverse range of needs that apply in this. nation there are unique considerations' that g- to the needs of remote communities and areas with limited populations. Part of the process must be to ensure that those people continue to get telecommunications services and that as technology develops, particularly in the fibre optics area, we are able to take advantage of the reduction in costs that can flow with technological advance. That is a particularly important part of what is contained in the measures before us tonight. Another key feature of the Australian model for telecommunications is the way this package 'of Bills provides for direct consumer interest to be effectively protected in a legislative form. The fact that Austel's powers arc being extended to enable that to occur is welcome. It gives Austel the chance to play a much more vigorous role across the communications field and ensure that it can now redress one of the criticisms that has been levelled at Austel in the past-that it has had enough regard to the needs of consumers. The Bills provide strict provision for that. It has always been a firm intention of the Government not only to create a more competitive telecommunications environment, and therefore cfficiencies and cost savings for consumcrs, but also to ensure that the industry development potential that these changcs olrer is available for the whole community to enjoy. The Bill provides for this. This will be as much an obligation on the part of the new carrier as an obligation on the new OTC-Telecom operation. It is very important that we recognise that setting up a telecommunications competitive environment is about ensuring that the broader telecommunications industry is used for the bencfit of tralians. Bidders for the second carrier licence will be askcd to show how their proposals will lead to development of opportunities for Australian industry, ularly in areas such as export, research and development and Australian manufacture. I think that is a key area of sideration that needs to be applied across the industry. All too often the level of skills, the level of training and the level of apprentice development undertaken in the public sector communications industry are forgotten. It is important that those same considerations, those same broader industry objectives, are part and parcel of what we adopt in the new environment. That can be done. It will be done because of the safeguards that are being built in. Rad we adopted the free for all approach the Opposition advocates, we would not have had the same sorts of opportunities to have a structured and ordered process of transition to competition in telecommunications. Instead, one of the forcign owncd telecommunication companies would have come in and taken all of it. That situation would not be in Australia's interests; it would not necessarily achieve the objectives of Australian industry nor would it necessarily recognise the scope for the development of export potential. What safeguards would not Australia have in ensuring that as the objective of the foreign company? Clearly, in changing the telecommunications environment it is important to get the best industry outcomes and the lowest telecommunications prices for people in this country. By mcans of the safeguards built into the Government's legislative package we are ensuring that the industry objectives, the kcy training objectives and the key export potential objectives are able to be achieved. In the short term-basically, we are talking about a transition time with the duopoly provision applying prior to the review in 1996-this is a way of ensuring that we meet all those distinct objectives. Regarding industry development potential, whatever changcs arc adopted in teleall Auscommunications, unless there is an obligation on both players to meet industry development standards, to develop export markets and a value added capacity partIcthrough research and development and the manufacture of Australian telecommunications expertise for export to Asia, con- we will not achieve those objectives. It is all very well to talk about the opportunities in Asia, but if we set up a framework that docs not directly provide that scope and impetus, we will not achieve those objecti ves. It will not just happen as a matter of course; it will happen because we have the mechanisms in place. The merger of OTe and Telecom elearly provides the key mechanism for that opportunity to occur. By establishing the sorts of obligations we have proposed in regard to the second carrier for industry development timetables, we will achieve the same objectivcs across the spectrum. That is clearly important. The rate of change in telecommunications is phenomenal, and in telecommunications technology gencrally it is almost beyond comprehension. However, I believe that this legislation establishes a framework which will get the best of both worlds. It provides safeguards for local consumers in rural and remote communities; at the same time, it gi ves the thrust and the direction needed to ensure that we move forward and are not shackled with the inhibitions that monopoly arrangements can create. We are ensuring that we have competition and that competition is important. It is possible in this context to establish a uniquely Australian model which achieves the best objectives for this nation, rather than to adopt a model driven purely by an ideological concern which is all about the disposal of public assets and public infrastructure because that happens to be the political agenda of the New Right at this time. r have no doubt that as time goes on, and as we have seen reccntly with regard to reform packagcs and the way thcy have been dealt with in the context of the New South Wales elections, that people will come to understand that we need to do more than just talk about ideology; we need to show that it is more than just disposing of public assets. Australians want to be assured that when there are micro-economic reforms, thcse will be for the greater good of the whole Australian community. That has to be the key to it. People want to be assured that as we have opportunities to develop our potential in the Asian area, jobs for Australians will also be created as a part of that process. To do anything else simply will result in what many have said in the past: it is easier to enable that development to occur offshore. r feel that the range of Bills we are debating tonight, which provide for the duopoly arrangement and the structure of that duopoly, and in particular the merger of OTe and Telecom, which will embody a pool of expertise, are far from deserving the sorts of criticisms that we have heard from the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) but are things that most Australians could sit back and say confidently have been great achievements for Australia. Certainly, the existing arrangement has delivered telecommunications in a beneficial way to this country, and by cstablishing the new regime we are introducing the fundamental element of competition. Surely there is no greater micro-economic reform in telecommunications than the introduction of competition. We have broadened the powers of Austel to enable it to playa vigorous role across the board in the telecommunications industry in the new environment. We have spelt out in legislation the community service obligations to cnsure that there is reasonable access on an equitable basis to the new telecomm unications environment through those new arrangements. There is no clear precise way that we can demonstrate as a parliament-certainly, for the Government's part-that we are determined to ensure change; we are determined to ensure that the area of micro-economic reform is very high on our political agenda. At the same time, we are not going to enable people to come back in a few years time and say, 'What a pity we flogged off for a few pieces of silver a telecommunications industry which offered so much to Australia and which ensured that so much training was undertaken and so many skills were developed, and that the people of Australia, whether they lived in the outback or the large cities, were able to have telecommunications which were comparatively cheap, certainly very effective and which provided a very good serv.,. ice'. We will be able to ensure that reform happens by the Bills just introduced. I pay tribute to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) for the introduction of telecommunications arrangements which provide the fundamental objectives of an Australian telecommunications industry. Surely that is the key consideration: we get the best for the Australian national interest, rather than being driven by a model that might have been followed by Thatcher or somebody else. Clearly we are proposing a uniquely Australian model. As I said, we want to ensure that model delivers the best possible benefit to this country and ensures that it is developed to its true potential. The merger of OTC and Telecom will ensure that the opportunities afforded by the $130 billion potential market in telecommunications are accessed in the best way and that we receive the best possible reward from them. For those reasons, I believe that we are dealing with landmark legislation. I am proud to be part of a Government that has had the fortitude to make key changes in the area of telecommunications policy. I strongly support the Bills now before the House.",95
122,Mr NUGENT,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Aston) (10.18 p.m.)This debate encompa,sses seven Bills. I think that by any yardstick they are the most far reaching measures in telecommunications that we have attempted to introduce in this country so far.' Whether we agree or disagree with the Bills, I would like to place on record my objection to the fact that they have been introduced and debated in very short order. They are very complex Bills and there is a great deal of detail to get across. Just trying to interpret what different things do and what different parts play in terms of their interaction and looking at how they might work in the real world has been difficult because the process has been far too hurried. We are now under the constraint of the guillotine. We have not been allowed adequate time for consideration of the Bills. I would like to lodge my protest at that. We are not just talking about what will happen to Australia in communications terms, we are talking about whcrc we position the country in terms of a significant export potential as well. This legislation is being far too rushed and we have inadequate time to examine what is really dramatically important legislation. My colleague the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) has already outlined what we belicve is obviously in those Bills. He has identificd where we are going to oppose, where we are going to accept and where we are going to seek to amend, so I am not going to go over that again. I want to make six particular points. I want to talk a bit about the proposed structure, the creation of the duopoly, the retention of the lion's share of control in government hands, the community service obligations (CSOs), the principle of mobile network competition, and the effectiveness and control of Austel. First, let us look at the proposed structure. It seems to me that we have one player, the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (AOTC) , which has the core network and the means of distribution out of the core, versus another player, eventually, which will have only the distribution opportunity. That is a very imbalanced structure. Clearly, to try to providc some balance, there is an attempt at a pricing mechanism, or a tilt, to give that new player some opportunity against the giant that is already established in the field. It seems to me that, when we have a large corporation and many millions of transactions sprcad all over the place, it is far too easy to manipulate paper, rates, divisions, companies, bills, pricing mechanisms and so on to really make a nonsense of any control that is likely to be effected and to allow that big player, which has such a monopoly on the carriage and distribution, a head start on any other player. It is also possible for that core player, where in direct competition on part of its business, the delivery, with another player, to apply restrictions-unofficially, 9f course, but in practice-on the service! delivered or the quality of that service and de facto build a barrier that should never be thcre for the competitor. I - ave to say that Telecom has a past that Is.poor on ethics in this sort of game. !echlllcally .it has been very strong but, m terms of Its business ethics, it has been prepared to .t-ke loss leaders, indulge in predatory pncmg and all the rest of it to lock out competitors in associated fields. My belief is that we should have a corea trunk carrier, if you like; it could well be Telecom-that should be under government control because there are security and all sorts of othcr implications there. We would then want at least two other players as distributors with equal access to that core system. Of course there should be no time protection on this particular legislation because we do want to let other players into the field. At the rate - t which teleco.mmunications is developmg, five years IS far too long a period I would suggest, to lock out other player-. .1 will talk about policing arrangements WIth regard to Austel in more detail later The point I want to make is that I believth.at the ;vhole set-ul? is artificially tnved. It IS fraught With opportunities for abus-. I do not believe it will deliver the reqUIred result, unfortunately. My second point concerns the creation of the duopoly. For competition to work, we need more players. Even if this large n-w player does not play pricing games WIth the new player, both are going to have a very simple and comfortable arrangement. It makes it harder still for a future third or subsequent entrant into t-e market. We need to establish the prinCIple of open competition. Look at what happened with the airline duopoly for so 10l:1g.. If we must have a duopoly, I believe thIS IS the wrong one. Telecom and OTC merged; each is strong. And to put them together will cause this one huge imbalance. We should be splitting those two so that each can form a strong base for a new company. That is something which I believe we are going to oppose. My third point relates to government - wn-rshil?' The new big player, the AOTC, IS sUll being run by the Government. The Government owns the No. 1 player and one of the competitors, and it also controls the umpire, Austel. Governments of - ll per-uasions have. a history of owning mdustnes and runnmg enterprises fairly un-uccessfully. I think that applies to whIchever party has been in government over the years. These days companies such as Qantas Airways Ltd and Australian Airlines, and even Telecom itself at the moment, have various financial cash flow and capitalisation .type probl-ms. They have all got financIal problems and it is not a business that the Government should be in b-cause, frankly, private enterprise can do It better. To correct this I believe we need to privatise Telecom,' OTe Ltd and Aussat .and allow other players into the market III a much quicker time than these Bills anticipate. My fourth point relates to the fact that CSOs are to be apportioned between the carriers. Why? Why not have esos separately identified and let the Government have the taxpayer pick up the tab? Let us separately identify the cost of providing those sorts of services. Let us identify that t-ue cost and let t.he taxpayer pay. I becon- lIeve that compallles should not have to pick that up. My fifth point relates to the number of mobile networks. I understand that under these Bills this is to be limited to three. If we look at the telecommunications industry, we will see that the truth of the matter is that in four or five years' time communication is going to be person to person, not point to point. The honourable member for Bass will basically have one telephone number. He will not have a number in his office in Parliament House, a number in his office in his electorate, a number at home and all the rest - f it. He will have one mobile phone that IS used all around the place, as will each one of us. If we like, it can be tattooed on our foreheads, or some such marvellous high-tech arrangement will be put in place. We will have the one number we will not be going point to point. Therefore, we are going to have a total revolution, in very short order in telecommunications. It seems to' me therefore, that, if we are to have that onmultipurpose telephone number per person, then the networks are the critical feature for delivering that sort of service, particularly in a competitive environment. The issue of the availability of the airwaves is a major issue. It needs to be resolved-obviously there are some problems there-and not avoided or simply postponed. This Bill will limit our ability to compete, not only at home but also abroad, in an area in which Australia should at least be a leader in the region. Quite honestly, must the Government always be holding us back in this competitive environment? There are restrictions everywhere. What is the Government frightened of? Why cannot free enterprise get out there and bc allowed to have that access and try to sell it to the Asia-Pacific rim? My sixth and final area of concern relates to Austel itself. I have two concerns: its ability to deliver on its charter and its political control. Historically, Austel has not bcen particularly effective in carrying out its charter, even under previous arrangements. It has had resource problems, expertise problems and enforcement issues. Historicallv, Telecom has driven a coach and hors-s through great areas of Austel's responsibilities. Any assurances that the head of Telecom gives usually mean, in my experience, exactly the opposite. I speak as one who, before he came. to this place, was involved in this industry and was trying to compete, allegedly on a fair market, with Telecom. There was no doubt about it-it broke the rules most days of the week. This legislation attempts to plug some of those historic deficiencies. Even if it does manage to identify where the rules are broken, the penalty that it can impose-$5m-is peanuts in the game that we are talking about. The game of communications is going to deal in tens of billions of dollars. A player that can get away with murder in this game will find a penalty of that size quite trivial. This is totally inadequate when we look at the numbers involved in the total communications game. Perhaps the major concern about Austel is its lack of independence. It is going to report to the Minister. There is obviously the possibility of political interference and direction, especially for mates, when it comes down to it. I would suggest to the Minister that it should administer its own charter, like some of the similar bodies in this country and also like most of its overseas equivalents. It should be made to report to the Parliament, not to an individual Minister. In conclusion, I would say that this is complex legislation. I believe it has been driven through with unseemly haste. The· Telecom-OTC link-up should be separated and privatised for delivery of services. The core operator should be national for security and other rcasons, not a big giant operator of core plus delivery against the minion of just delivery, because we cannot exercise control to make sure that that minion gets a reasonable. shot. It should not be a duopoly. The CSOs should be government funded, pure and simple. The Government has mobile networks wrong, and it has to allow more of them. Austel has no teeth. It will be ineffective, in my view, as it has been before, and it will be prone to political interference. Some aspects of the legislation, of course, deserve support: they are fundamentally a move in the right direction but do not go anywhere near far enough. We think that that principle of some competition is a good thing. Overall, I believe that the package is ineffective. Unfortunately, it will not achieve the desired result. I believe it is the worse structural option that the Government could have taken. The Bills will need to be significantly amended under a future coalition government. I believe it is yet anothcr example of the Govcrnment unfortunately failing on micro-economic reform. I register my disappointment in this place at the opportunity that has been lost to Australia if these Bills arc carried in their present form.",99
123,Mr SINCLAIR,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I want to say a few things about the Telecommunications Bill and cognate Bills. First, as somebody who has administered this field I would like to say-Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs SuIlivan)-Order! It being 10.30 p.m - I am sorry; the right honourable member may continue.",101
124,Mr KERR,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,The House has made a majority decision to apply the guillotine.,102
125,Mr SINCLAIR,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Yes; but the Government needs to make up its mind on how it is to be operated. I am quite happy to k-ep on talking. I am quite happy to; it will not be the first time. After all, the Government has not known what to do with the national economy. How can it be expected t9 run the House? I am quite happy to make a few remarks about the state of play and how the Government performs and how it should not. Can I continue and refer to the telecommunications legislation package-Mrs Crosio-I raise a point of order. The right honourable member is going against your ruling, Madam Deputy Speaker. In the words that he has just put forward, he is virtually saying that you cannot run the House. I object to that most strenuously. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER - I am very grateful to the honourable member for Prospect for her care and concern for my. position. In f-ct, I had not given a rulIng. I was seekmg some advice. It is normal to allow an honourable member to continue to speak while that advice is being sought.",102
126,Mr SINCLAIR,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I want to make a few brief points on this package. The first is that there is a common misconception that, as far as the communications around Australia are concerned, in some way we are badly served by Telecom Australia. I have a great deal of criticism of elements of Telecom, but I think people need to understand that our telephone system wor-s, tha- in fac- Telecom runs a very effiCIent-ill engllleering terms-telecommunications service. Although those of us who live in rural areas and remote and isolated areas are concerned about aspe.cts of the way in which telephone serVIces are provided, we are in fact Jar - etter off here in Australia than are people m many other countries. Those of us who have been to the United States, for example, and seen what is happening there would know that its service, deregulated is not functioning as well as it should. ' If one is going to start deregulation, one - oes not begin by setting up a duopoly mstead of the present monopoly. One starts with the services to the people. I would have preferred that in the deregulation we looked at trying to provide local 'teletricians', if I can call them that, to provide the linking of services. I would like to see so many more of the services now provided by the telecommunications authority provided by individuals working as professionals either on a subcontract or a contract basis. The second matter I would raise is that in the changes proposed people are looking for a great deal of additional service as a result of the introduction of some competition into this field. There are enormous difficulties in the package that has been presented, and the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) and others have identified some of them. . Like the previous speaker, I am concerned about the role of Austel and the nature of its independence. The fact that it has an obligation to receive references from the Minister, to make reports to the Minister, and the fact that the Minister takes decisions on those reports, seem to me to really not give that independence that Austel requires. I am concerned that, in the nature of the new amalgamated body, the Aussat co-petitor to the OTC-Telecom body is going to be one that may not give us the sOFt of links that we would prefer, certamly not the service that most people who are consumers feel they should now receive. Let me point to two areas of concern Firstly, I am concerned about the ability of private enterprise to make telephones, to produce all the add-on bits of equipment; and, secondly, I am concerned abo-t the way in which the charges to be apphed by Telecom for its infrastructure service are to be set and maintained. There are obviously real problems in getting the right sort of competitor for Telecom-OTC. I am worried that the way in which the Aussat build-on is to function is going to inevitably lead to what I would see as significant overseas investment in this field, and I am interested to know to what degree that is going to mean that we really are not going to be able to see the control of this vital communications link in Australian hands for the future. r think I should also refer to some of the difficulties that I see as far as the community service obligations (CSOs) are concerned. I do not know that under this present changed arrangement the people in remote and isolated areas will continue to receive the level of service that they, like all other Australians, should expect. I believe that there are problems in the nature of the services now operating, particularly under the digital radio links and if, as a result of this new so-called competitor-the duopoly that is to existthere is any reduction in the service in those remote and isolated areas, through this CSO concept, that will concern me. Indeed, it can only be said that the enormous variation between Telecom's costing and the costing by the Government in this area demonstrates some of the problems in trying to ensure not only that the service is maintained but also that adequate funds are provided for the maintenance of those CSOs. There are many aspects of the legislation that I feel could have been better handled. I do not like the package. As I say, I would rather see deregulation begin at the small end. I believe that the nature of the controls of this duopoly will still maintain many of the worse elements of the present monopoly, without the guarantees of the quality of service that that monopoly now gives. If that is so, we are going to have the worse of all possible worlds. One thing that people should remember is that in the last few years there has been a great deal of criticism about Aussat. Indeed, one of the reasons why the present package has emerged in its present light is as a result of the financial difficulbulk-bill ties of Aussat. I would say that people need to remember the way in which the Government changed the nature and character of the obligations of Aussat from that which existed when it was first set up under the legislation which I introduced into this House. At that time the membership of Aussat and the character and nature of its future use were designed to be directed far more towards the requirement of the private sector, towards the demands of industry, and it was not to be controlled through the shareholding which Telecom was given. It was certainly to be allowed far greater regulatory freedom than in fact has been the case. I believe that the Aussat failure is as much a product of the way in which Telecom has in fact controlled its functions, and the Government has accepted that Telecom dictates. In reality, this legislation is a sop to the Telecom unions. I regret that that should be so. I believe that instead of having one body controlled by them we will have two, and I doubt whether, as far as the services available to the public are concerned, we are going to be any better off.

Debate (on motion by Mrs Crosio) adjourned. NA Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Health Costs and Doctors' Fees",102
127,Mr KERR,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to speak briefly regarding a survey of health costs and doctors' fees which I conducted in my electorate and which was prepared following a number of requests for information from my constituents regarding which doctors would bulk-bill and how much other doctors charged. Essentially it arose because over a period a number of people in my electorate who, for example, have recently. become pensioners have turned to me and said that their own doctor, for example, does not pensioners and asked which doctors' practices that I knew of did so. Until I conducted my survey the only answer I could give them was that I did not know. So in order to overcome this lack of knowledge on my part, and on behalf of the members of my electorate, I did conduct an extensive survey. To explain briefly how the survey was conducted, the doctors' surgeries were telephoned on 26 and 29 April 1991 and asked about their standard consultation fee, discounts for cash, and whether they bulk billed pensioners and health care card holders. The surgeries were telephoned again between 15 and 17 May to verify the earlier information. A third check was conducted by writing to every doctor and hand delivering an extract of the information I intended to publish regarding that practice. Doctors were invited to correct any details, and all changes suggested have been incorporated. Charges are as quotcd Rechecked by lettcr to Suburb Name Phone Battery Point Dr S. Atkins Dr I.

129,Mr KERR,DENISON ELECTORATE,"I shall refer to the key findings of the survey. The survey related to 42 practices made up of approximately 100 medical practitioners. Of that number, only one commercial practice in my electorate bulk billed, although a practice conducted on a public basis, the Hobart Women's Medical Health Service, where female sessional doctors provide services, also bulk billed. The irony of the survey is that the practice that bulk bills is lished in the suburb of Sandy Bay, which is one of the more affluent of our suburbs, and those in the less well-to-do suburbs have to contend with the non-availability of bulk billing services. Nonetheless, there were some very encouraging signs in relation to the responsibility of the medical profession. Over half of the practices surveyed bulk billed pensioners or health care card holders, and one-fifth of the doctors surveyed had lower fees for such patients. Almost all doctors indicated that they would give special consideration to people in hardship. If I could make one final point in relation to the table, asterisks against the names of certain practices relate to instances where doctors rang my office later saying that they did not want the information included, that it was incorrect, but declined to provide any corrections to me or to say where or in what manner the information was incorrect. I stand by the fact that all fees and information quoted were double checked by telephone on two occasions and that all practices were given a clear opportunity by letter to clarify any matters where they contended that an error might have crept in.",108
130,Mr SPEAKER,DENISON ELECTORATE,Order! The honourable member's time has expired! Perth: Old Swan Brewery,108
131,Mr FILING,DENISON ELECTORATE,"I rise this evening to address a subject of much controversy in Perth, and that is the issue of the fate of the dilapidated remains of the old Swan brewery in Mounts Bay Road.",108
132,Mr CADMAN,DENISON ELECTORATE,I thought you were going to talk about the former Premier.,108
133,Mr FILING,DENISON ELECTORATE,"This issue does touch upon WA Inc., and I will come to that in a second. I want to lay to rest some of the myths associated with the site, several of which the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) touched upon during his speech in the grievance debate on 18 April 1991. The old Swan brewery is of considerable embarrassment to the State Labor estab- Government of Western Australia. The Government has betrayed not only one of its most supportive constituencies in the past-that is, the Aboriginal constituency in Western Australia-but has also ignored the wishes of the vast majority of people of Western Australia in seeking to turn the site in the first instance into a glorified yuppie haven on one of the most attractive parts of the Swan River foreshore. Firstly, I rebut the argument of the honourable member for Perth, who supported the retention of the building because of its significance in the history of the development of Perth. I agree that the destruction of buildings of historical significance should be opposed. However, the significance of the old Swan brewery building is not at issue in the debate over the retention of that building on the site. For example, in his speech, the honourable member stated that the original building was built in 1897. That may well be true, but there is evidence that little of the original structure now exists within the shell of the present remains. In fact, much of the present edifice was constructed during the 1920s and 1930s. In considering the argument of the honourable member for Perth, I am reminded of today's valedictory for Professor Manning Clark and the apparent remorse shown by Professor Manning Clark for commencing his great history of Australia by stating that civilisation in Australia started around the time of the arrival of the first fleet. In his speech, the honourable member for Perth talked of 160 years of Western Australian history. He described the old Swan brewery as being a central focus on the Swan River for more than 90 years. That fails to take into account even the history of the site in the years between the commencement of European settlcment and the construction of the original building in 1897. In fact, there is considerablc significance in the history of that site's usage prior to the construction of the old Swan brewery buildings, a matter of fact that is conveniently ignored by the State Labor Government and, of course, the honourable member for Perth in his speech. The old Swan brewery returned to prominence in the news in Western Australia in 1985 as a result of the WA Inc. deal between the State Government and now fugitive Yosse Goldberg. The purchase of the brewery was made by the State Government allegedly in order to ensure that there was no development on the site. In fact, former Premier, Brian Burke, stated, 'We aim to save the site from development'. Unfortunately for the people of Western Australia, the feeling of security that that statement may have engendered, evaporated in April 1986, when the State Labor Government announced its intention to develop the site. Now, after a long and contentious struggle over the development of the site and a successful action in the High Court of Australia by the fringe dwellers of Perth, the remains stand as silent testimony to the betrayal of the people of Western Australia by its State Labor Government. In considering the issue of the old Swan Brewery buildings, it is now time to knock the buildings down and vest the land in the Kings Park Trust, as is proposed by the State Opposition. The vast majority of Western Australians support this proposal to turn the area of the site into parkland and allow that very beautiful part of the Swan River foreshore to be uscd by all the people of Western Australia as parkland. In closing my address, I will mention one or two quotations from people who have supported the redevelopment of the site into parkland in the past few years. In particular, in 1988 Sir Ernest Lee-Steere stated: It would be unbelievable that the ugly building should be preserved. Sir Paul Hasluck said: I am writing to express support for your objective of a parkland development of the old Brewery site on Mount's Bay Road and my opposition to any proposal to use the buildings as a tavern and brasserie. I also do not regard the buildings worthy of preservation either for architectural merit or historical interest.",108
134,Mr SPEAKER,DENISON ELECTORATE,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Sydney Waste Disposal,109
135,Mrs CROSIO,DENISON ELECTORATE,"Prospect) (10.49 p.m.)I risc tonight to bring to the attention of this Parliament moves made by the previous Greiner Government to wash its hands of any responsibility for the disposal of household waste of Sydney residents, thereby threatening the effective management of garbage disposal in our city of Sydney. At a press conference on 26 March, the then New South Wales Minister for the Environment announced plans to cancel the establishment of a landfill waste depot at Londonderry, which was to handle Sydney's waste after 1995, and to put the responsibility of waste disposal management into the hands of individual councils and private enterprise. The decision to do this, as well as to disband, in June, the Waste Management Authority (WA), which had been set up in 197 I to develop an effective garbage disposal system for Sydney, was made without any consultation with local government authorities or with the Waste Management Authority, and will undoubtedly plunge Sydney into a garbage disposal crisis. The Waste Management Authority is to be split into the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) and Wastecorp. The EPA will be responsible for recycling and waste minimisation, and Wastecorp will become a new division of the Water Board, handling existing facilities while the Government's long term options are investigated. The disbandment of the Waste Management Authority effectively will mean that no organisation will have both the technical expertise and the coordinating authority to ensure that Sydncy's waste needs are handled in a manner both environmentally responsible and economical. To provide this House with a bit of background information on this matter, in 1970, when one million tonnes of garbage had to be disposed of by Sydney councils, the government of the day, as a result of a public inquiry, established the Waste Management Authority as a specialist authority to assist local government with this difficult task. I served on the Waste Management Authority Board for five years in my capacity as representative of a local government authority. I stepped down from that position when I became a State member of parliament in 1981, but other local government represcntatives on the Authority were not so lucky. In 1989 the State Minister for Environment sacked the local government representatives from the Board. Now, after Sydney's garbage quantities have quadrupled to four million tonnes, the Minister wants to wash the State Government's hands of the garbage problem by giving it back to local councils. Understandably, the Local Government Association (LGA) is not impressed and believes that the New South Wales Environment Minister's decision to opt out of joint State-local government responsibilities for waste disposal has left suburban councils and their communities without adequate means to handle Sydney's growing garbage mountain. The State Government has suggested to councils that small regional tips would be adequate to meet future waste disposal requirements in Sydney but, according to the Local Government Association, such a proposal glosses over difficulties in identifying and developing waste disposal facilities. The LGA belicves, and rightly so, that there is a clear need for a coordinating body comprising local and State government representatives to have overall responsibility for wastc disposal and materials recycling throughout New South Wales. Although the State Government has suggested that the quantity of garbage can be cut in half by recycling and composting, it has plans neithcr for dealing with the problem in the meantime nor for disposal of the remaining 50 per cent of the garbage in the future. Local councils must now consider acquiring land to re-establish local tips and consulting private enterprise to help with the garbage disposal problem. Once private enterprise becomcs involved, the cost of garbage disposal will soar. Anybody who saw the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Four Corners program on 29 April will be aware of the problems associated with private enterprise managing waste disposal. According to that program, an American company, Waste Management Incorporatcd, is fast becoming Australia's largest garbage manager, under the name of Pacific Waste Management (PWM). In seven years of operation in Australia, PWM has bought established companies and has won dozens of council waste collection contracts in every State except Western Australia. PWM was made the custodian of Brisbane's garbage by its former Lord Mayor, Sallyanne Atkinson. It is suspected that the relationship between PWM and the Brisbane City Council was one factor that may have added to the cause of Ms Atkinson's recent electoral defeat. Obviously many Brisbane people did not share Ms Atkinson's view of how the city's waste should be handled, and no wonder. PWM's parent company in Chicago sports a long list of civil and criminal fines for environmental brcaches and has been accused of price fixing, market rigging and monopolistic behaviour. Is this really what we want for Sydney? With the cancellation of a new tip at Londonderry, Sydney's rubbish will have to be delivered to the existing landfill at Eastern Creek. It is expected that this will be filled by 1995, and local councils will then have to be prepared to take over fully the responsibility for waste disposal. Clearly local councils would appreciate some guidance from the State Government and would like to discuss these changes fully with Government represen,tatives. Unfortunately the LGNs approaches to the then Minister for Environment met with the cold shoulder, and the Association was told that nothing would be discussed until after the State election. The issue of waste disposal is not going to go away. It is time for the New South Wales State Government to address the problem of garbage disposal and to discuss avenues and alternatives to the current situation with local government representatives. On 25 May the people of New South Wales recorded their objections to many situations, and this was but one of them. Business of the House of Representatives",109
136,Mr CADMAN,DENISON ELECTORATE,"Mitchell) (10.54 p.m.)It is delightful to hear a former Minister of aNew South Wales government propose a return to day labour and the jobs for the boys that were so typical of the Wran Government. The waste of taxpayers' money that went on during that period is legend. Mrs Crosio- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the Waste Management Authority was established by the Askin Government in 1971.",111
137,Mr SPEAKER,DENISON ELECTORATE,Order! There is no point of order.,111
138,Mr CADMAN,DENISON ELECTORATE,"It was continued on a day labour basis by the Australian Labor Party, much to the cost of the people of New South Wales. I want to say a few words tonight about the way in which the Government is managing the affairs of the House. I remember when the Australian Labor Party came to office that Mick Young was regarded as a 'boots-and-all' operator as Leader of the House. He took certain acts to deny access to the chamber by members of the House. He shortened the adjournment debate; he got rid of notices of motion and successfully limited discussion for a period of two years. However, to give him credit, Mick Young was not a great user of the guillotine. For the last two years, under the current Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), I have found an increasing tendency to rattle through huge numbers of Bills at this stage of the session. It seems that the Government is incapable of issuing instructions to the Public Service to have the important Bills delivered to the Cabinet on time so that they can be introduced into the Parliament in an orderly manner and in a way in which they can be thoroughly debated. At the commencement of each session, we waste days talking about trivial matters which are not of significance when compared with the issues that are raised later in a sitting period by the Government and by Government legislation. In what may be the last two weeks of this sitting period of the House, we are dealing with massive changes to telecommunications under real sti'icture. It is most regrettable that the Government thinks that, by having these matters dealt with on a non-broadcast day-all the contentious issues in the House of Representatives are dealt with on non-broadcast days-Mr Snowdon-We were being broadcast.",111
139,Mr CADMAN,DENISON ELECTORATE,"Yes, but it was a nontelevision day. Television days are devoted to this House when no contentious matters are before us. I guarantee that flowing into next week when this House is not to be televised there will be the legislation concerning the declaration of donations to political parties and the ban on advertising that the Government is proposing. The Government will do everything it can to steer clear of needless publicity to these damaging decisions that it is making. The Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) has a Bill before the Parliament-a massive piece of legislation-and refuses to have it debated properly, at length and in detail as the public of Australia should demand. The Minister has relentlessly blamed the Senate for his poor management of the House. He has said, 'I have to impose the guillotine because the Senate has given a deadline as to the time by which it will accept legislation'. That is just a nonsense. The Minister is not prepared to manage the House. He is not prepared to issue instructions to departments and to have the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) say to his Ministers that legislation which is important and which is necessary for the progress of the Parliament should be delivered for Cabinet decision at an early stage, so th<;tt the Cabinet decision can be made and proper debate can take place. That is a process adopted by previous governments and it should be copied by the current Government. It is not fair on any member of this chamber, whether in government or opposition, to have to consider matters such as the telecommunications legislation or advertising and the declaration of donations in the manner in which they have been forced to do. We can sit around for days at the beginning of the session debating pig slaughter levy legislation and charges to this group or to that group. Honourable members rise to the occasion and make the appropriate speeches and do the proper preparation. Members of this Parliament want to exercise their democratic right and they want to speak on important issues. That process is being denied by the Government.",111

142,Mr KEATING,PAPERS,"The answer honourable member's question lows: The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that the sales tax provision to which Mr Tuckey has referred would not provide an exemption for ammunition acquired for the destruction of sheep. However, there is a provision that exempts goods used to dispose of waste products. The Commissioner said that ammunition used by farmers to destroy sheep of no commercial value would be exempt from salcs tax under this provision. Amalgamation of Tertiary Institutions (Question No. 549) Dr Kemp asked the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, upon notice, on 12 February J 991: (1) How many meetings were there of the Joint Planning Committee referred to on page 3 of the third report of the Higher Education Council to the National Board of Employment, Education and Training on the Operation of Section 14 of the Higizer Education Funding Act 1988 and the Higher Education Contribution Scheme with each State and Territory in 1990. (2) Were proposals for amalgamations of Victorian tertiary institutions discussed at meetings of this Committee with the State of Victoria; if so, what conclusions resulted from those discussions. (3) Did the Commonwealth indicate in the course of these discussions (a) its preferred for amalgamations, (b) that funding to Victorian tertiary institutions would be reduced, (c) that future funding may be less than would otherwise be the case or (d) that funding allocations in general or for growth in student numbers and capital works would be withheld if amalgamaNA Sheep tions did not occur or if its preferred options were not followed. (4) Could J be provided with the agreed record of decisions for meetings of the Committee with the State of Victoria. Mr BaldlVin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: ' (1) Two Joint Planning Committee meetings were held with each State and Territory in 1990 apart from Western Australia (five) and the Northern Territory (three). (2) Progress with the amalgamation of Victorian higher education institutions was discussed at both Joint Planning Committee meetings with to the Victoria in 1990. These discussions are meetings IS as fol- of officials conducted for the purpose of advising Ministers. The proceedings therefore are not publicly available. (3) Commonwealth policy is that it supports amalgamations agreed by the institutions and which are supported by the State Government. Commonwealth policy has been and continues to be that amalgamating institutions will be accorded priority in the allocation of growth, capital funds and monies from the Reserve Fund to assist in the restructuring process. Discussions with Victorian officials are conducted within that policy context. (4) As for (2) and (3) above. A copy of a news release issued by the Victorian Minister for Education in the light of advice from officials is at Attachment A. Attachment A NA NA November 12, 1990 NA NA The Education Minister, Mr Barry Pullen, today announced guidelines on the future structural and resource arrangements for higher education in Victoria. The guidelines have been agreed to by the State and Federal Governments following a meeting  Minister for Higher Education and Employment   that any future amalgamations of higher education institutions should be based on strengthening the five existing ,universities. Both governments agreed that resource allocations to the higher education sector should focus on achieving this goal and take into account the needs of Victoria's growth corridors. ""It. is !-portant that Victoria has five strong UllIversltIes able to meet the growing demand generally for student places in higher education,""  ""We also need to plan so that we are ablc to meet the needs of the growing number of students who will be coming from the three metropolitan growth corridors in the north, the south  capital program for 1993 was due to be releascd in early December and that he was encouraged in his discussions with Mr Baldwin that there would be support for facilities in growth areas.  said that in any future amalgamatio-s of higher education institutions, campuses close to existing uni versities should become part of those universities.  sentatives of higher education institutions to brief them on the outcome of the meeting. -.r Pull-n also announced the setting up of a Jomt project between the State and Fcderal Governments on improving links betwecn the T AFE sector and universities.  work already being done by the State Training Board in Victoria to boost the number of T AFE students gaining access to higher education.

Australian National University (Question No. 618) Dr Kemp asked the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, upon notice, on 6 March 1991: (1) Has the Government stated that amalgamations of tertiary institutions will be voluntary. (2) Does the Australian National University (ANU) and its Council oppose the recommendations of Professor Chubb, partlcularly those relating to the separation of the Institute of Advanced Studies from the ANU's faculties and the amalgamation of those faculties with the University of Canberra. (3) If the ANU and its Council oppose .the recommendations and amalgamatIOns of tertIary institutions are to be voluntary, will the amalgamation of the ANU's faculties with those of the University of Canberra proceed.

In preparing this statement, I have consulted with representatives of the parties directly concerned-the Australian National University (ANU), the University of Canberra, and the Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA)-as well as others with a legitimate interest in the issues involved, including the Government of the Australian Capital Territory. I wish to record my appreciation to thosc people and organisations who made a positive and constructive contribution to debatc on these Issues. [ also wish to record my sincere thanks to Sir Ninian Stephen and members of the Review Committee, as well as the Chair of the Higher Education Council, Professor [an Chubb. Before going onto the main body of this statement, J should briefly explain why the Government sought Professor Chubb's advice on. the implications of the Stcphen Report for higher education provision in the ACT. The Government aeeepts the kcy recommendation of the Stephen Committee that the Institute of Advanced Studies (lAS) should become a resource for the Australian higher education system as a whole, and that all institutions in the system should come to see themselves as ""stakeholders"" in the Institute. Given this, it is appropriate to ask whether it makes sense for the Institute of Advanced Studies to retain its existing relationship with the Faculties of the ANU. Furthermore, it has become clear that better arrangements must be made to secure a co-ordinated 0: (b) and complementary effort to strengthen higher education provision in the ACT. Attention needs to be given to the persistent problems, particularly unproductive' duplication and destructive competition in course provision, that continue to pervade the relationship between the ANU and the University of Canberra. These problems are exemplified by the disappointing progress made by the ACT School of Engineering which was intended to ensure a more co-ordinated and effective use of the resources and strengths of all three higher education institutions in the ACT, together with the Canberra College of T AFE. The rest of this statement addresses the two broad issues raised by the Stephen Report and Professor Chubb's advice. NA Historically, the lAS was established to provide a strong research capacity for Australia's higher education system at a time when this scarcely existed in Australia's universities. Since then, situation has changed dramatically, with the emergence of centres of research strength throughout the country. In more recent times, governments have sought to enhance the quality and quantity of research by embracing the concepts of selectivity and concentration in the funding of higher education research, with increased emphasis on allocating research funds on a competitive basis through peer approval mechanisms. This is reflected in the establishment of Special Research Centres, Key Centres of Teaching and Research and most recently, Co-operative Research Centres, as well as in the 140 percent real increase in Australian Research Council (ARC) funding since 1988 to $217 million in 1991. The lAS has, to date, remained outside the competitive, peer-review, processes. Given this changing scene, and given its very large share of direct higher education research funding (with a base grant of approximately $130 million in 1990), it is clearly appropriate to define more clearly the Institute's future role. The Government accepts Recommendation 1 of the Stephen Report, which identifies the three key functions for the Institute as ""to be a major performer of research, to provide research education and training at the higher levels and to be a resource for the higher education research system and the Australian research system as a whole."" Having accepted this recommendation, the Government has decided to implement an institutional and funding framework conducive to the Institute fulfilling this redefined mission. While deciding not to proceed with the recommendations from Professor Chubb to formally separate the Institute from the Faculties at the ANU, the Government believes this proposal has inherent logic and would contribute to the development of the Institute as a national higher education research resource. However, in order to give effect to this latter objective, the Government has decided to implement the arrangements outlined below - methods to assess performance related to the Strengthened accountability mechanisms The Government notes the view of the Stephen Committee that ""all the funds of the Institute should be open to competitive allocation"" and that ""no component of the Institute should see itself as having a permanent entitlement to support"" (page 29). The Stephen Report also argues that it is not clear that the ""bulk of the Institute's research is . . . distinctively long term and high risk-particularly when compared with project research funded by the ARC and NH&MRC"" (page 19). In light of this, and given the increased competition for research funding in Australia's higher education system, the Government believes that it is unacceptable to continue to fund the Instithis tute on the present basis, with essentially no linkage of funding to assessments of performance. However the Government does acknowledge the Institute's distinctive role in strategic research, the defining characteristics of which were, according to the Stephen Report, ""scale, synergy, strategic management and orientation towards research which links the goals of understanding and use"" (page 20). The measures I am announcing will enhance the achievement of these obj ectives. The Government has decided to implement the following specific measures - The present Research Schools will be funded as Strategic Research Centres each with a distinctive mission. These mission statements will be developed by the Centres and their advisory boards, and coordinated by the Consultative Council of the Institute. For the Government's purposes, these statements will relate to the broad focus of each Centre's activities, not individual projects - the Stephen Report documents the nature and benefit to Australia of strategic research ""which combines a search for fundamental understanding and of meeting pressing societal needs at the same time"" (page 19). This view, and the Government's approach, is also consistent with the ANU Act, which states that a function of the ANU is to ""encourage . . . research and study, both generally and in relation to subjects of national importance to Australia"". It is also consistent with the intention of the Government of the day when establishing the Institute, that ""its research, whether in basic or applied fields, should contribute to Australia's development and to the solution of its problems"" (Sir John Crawford, 1968) - total funding for the Institute will be determined as the aggregation of funding for each individual Centre mission of each Centre are to be developed by the ARC in conjunction with the Institute and funding of each Centre will be subject to five-yearly review. That review period is seen as appropriate, given the stage of development already reached by Institute Schools. The review of the Strategic Centres will be carried out under the auspices of the ARC drawing on a panel of peers of Australian and overseas researchers expert in the relevant fields. Centres that are found not to be performing will have their funding withdrawn over time and the monies reallocated competitively through the ARC - within rolling tricnnial funding arrangements, the Government has already taken funding decisions to 1993. In the context of thcsc arrangcments (and subject to other decisions announced below), I would expect to maintain the Institute's funding in real terms at least until the first five-ycar review, subject to an ARC evaluation of progress in implementing this framework during 1994 - five per cent of the 1992 Institute budget, rising to twelve per cent over the ncxt scven years will be set aside for collaborative proposals developed jointly with other Australian universities. The ARC will be responsible for ensuring that the funds are applicd for this purpose. This decision aims to remedy the deficiency identified in the Stephen Report that ""the State universities perceive the Institute as aloof, not interested in or appreciative of their research efforts and achievements, and privileged in its access to scarce resources"" (page 30). It also commented that ""as research strengths in the State universities have developed, the Institute has largely remaincd separate from the Australian academic research system"" (page 21) - as also recommended by the Stephen Report, a proportion of the total Institute funds will be determined on the basis of postgraduate student load, subject to annual review on the basis of performance in meeting load targets. John Curtin School of Medical Research (JCSMR) From the total level of resources available to the Institute, the Government will transfer funding responsibilities for the John Curtin School of Medical Research, (less the relocation of some activities within the Institute as recommended by the Stephen Report) to the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH&MRC). The NH&MRC has experience over many ycars in block funding large strategic research institutes through peer review processes. Commenting on the JCSMR, Stephen draws attention to his Committee's concern over ""the persistence of a set of particular problems identified in two successive decennial reviews and (which are) obviously still largely present in 1990"" (page 48). While much good work continues to be carried out at JCSMR, the Stephen Report pointed out that when the situation deteriorates to a particular level, ""neither successive Directors nor the University administration (are) able to correct the problems"" (page 48). The Stephen Report went on to recommend changes in organisational (as well as funding) arrangements. These will be discussed with relevant parties. There is a clear understanding on the part of the NH&MRC that transferred funds would be dedicated to the John Curtin School for at least five years and would become the base against which future funding would be determined through the peer review mechanism. In my consultations with staff, some concerns were raised about staff conditions and the nature of research to be funded by the NH&MRC. r have spoken to the Minister for Community Services and Hcalth, who has agreed to talk to staff about their concerns. Management Structures Management structures should be consistent with Recommendations 2, 3, and 4 of the Stephen Report and J urge the Council of the ANU to implement these subject to the following qualifIcations - the objective of the Consultative Council as recommended by Stephen (R3), is to provide broadly based advice on the Institute's research strategies. While strongly supporting this objective, I consider that the composition proposed is insufficiently representative of the wider community. To redress this, I suggest that the two proposed nominees of the Consultative Council from the Australian Academies should be replaced by up to three members represcnting business, unions and the wider community. In coming to this view, it is not the intention to undervalue the contributions that could be made by the inclusion of active researchers; ample opportunity will be afforded this sector. However, the' wider society generally and the world of work in particular has useful perspectives to offer but no formal avenue to do so - it would seem appropriate for the NH&MRC to be represented on the Consultative Council in view of the interest it will have in the broad area of biological research still to be carried on within the Institute - with respect to the advisory bodies at School level (R4), the comments in the Stephen Report about the importance of other universities being equal partners in the enterprise, are endorsed and I consider that significant representation on the advisory bodies from universities outside the ACT would encourage this sense of ownership. Over and above the role of the advisory bodies, the importance of the Director of each School having the ultimate responsibility for determining appropriate research programs and achieving performance targets should be stressed. Postgraduate Load Funding In order to give effect to the Stephen recommcndation endorsed above, it will be necessary to establish an appropriate target figure for postgraduate load pertaining to Australian students. Load figures used in the Stephen report included overseas fee-paying students as well as load associatcd with a program which has since been transferred to the Faculties. The determination of an appropriate target load for Australian postgraduate students will be taken up in the 1991 profiles round. Failure to attain the agreed target would, as proposed by Stephen, be treated in the same way as under-performance elsewhere in the system, in terms of funding implications. In determining an appropriate proportion of the budget to be allocated on the basis of target load, I believe that the Institute will need to offer incentives for students to come to Canberra, so the net cost per student will be greater. I share the concern expressed in the Stephen Report that the ""lack of mobility of Australian students is a serious problem"", and that it is a ""particularly Australian phenomenon which undoubtedly leads to a lesser outcome in terms of education and training"" (page 40). The Stephen Report also draws attention to ""limited potential of the local catchment which, given the tendency of Australian students not to relocate, means that graduate students are difficult to recruit"" (page 40). This problem, including as it relates to undergraduate students, was also identified by Professor Chubb in his advice and it serves to re-emphasise that the Institute will have to make offers attractive to students or it will not meet ANU-agreed targets. To address this system-wide problem, I have asked the National Board of Employment, Education and Training to review the method of distributing Australian Postgraduate Awards as recommended by Stephen (R8a). Staff Appointment Policy I fully support the Stephen Report Recommendations 6 and 7 as integral to the better management of the Institute and I would urge the council of the ANU to consider favourably their implementation. I support also the development of joint appointments between the Institute on the one hand and the Faculties or the University of Canberra on the other. Such arrangements will have two-way benefits: Institute stafr will gain invaluable teaching experience while staff of the Faculties and the University of Canberra will gain from their association with major research programs. Activities External to Canberra Stephen stated that ""an important feature of the Institute's role as a national resource must be that such activities should not be restricted to Canberra"" (page 31). This will, in part, flow automatically from the collaborative links that will be formed with other institutions. I believe, however, that the Institute should play a bigger rok in the general debate of matters of importance to Australia. The ANU has the specific brief within its current Act to research subjects of national importance to Australia. If this is not to become merely an ""academic"" exercise, I belicve that the Institute should develop a program for taking debate about issues ""of national importance to Australia"" out to the Australian community. In other words, I believe that the Institute, as a taxpayer-funded, Commonwealth institution has a special task to reach out to the community as a whole and not just to other academics. This could be by way of conferences in different State Capitals, through the use of the electronic media or through appropriate publications. NA NA It is my view that the provision of higher education in the ACT should be seen in the context that the largest single group of students in either the ANU or the University of Canberra is from the local region. It is true that the two, in different proportions, enrol studcnts from elsewhere in NSW, particularly from Sydncy-as do all nonmetropolitan institutions in NSW-and from interstate and overseas. The reluctance of Australian students to travel away to study therefore puts a special onus on Australian institutions that is less common overseas: within practical limits, they must cater for the diverse range of educational needs normally found in the community. This obligation is reinforced by local pressures and expectations. The institutions in the ACT are in this position. I welcome the initiative proposed recently by the ANU for closer collaboration with the University of Canberra. Previous collaborative attempts have been unsuccessful, however, and I believe that a more structured cnvironment of cooperation is necessary to achieve the dcsired objective. Clearly collaboration would be best achieved by a fully integrated amalgamation of the two institutions, an option that has been rejected by the ANU. An alternative approach, which was suggested by some members of the ANU community during my consultations, would be a fcderated model of amalgamation with progress to full integration over time. I invite the Councils of the ANU and the University of Canberra to consider such a model; it is of course a matter for the institutions to determine the particular form of federation to be adopted should they wish to pursue the option. In the absence of a federated structure, I have decided that the following administrative arrangements will apply - the Commonwealth will continue to liaise with the A.C.T. authorities through the Joint Planning committee process - the Commonwealth will assume that, for practical purposes, there is a one-line budget for higher education in the ACT - base grants will be separately identified for the Institute, the ANU Faculties and the University of Canberra based on previous profiles discussions - the profiles of the two institutions will be negotiated jointly with the two institutions - the Department will make final recommendations for the distribution of the ACT grant after the joint profile round. It is my view that in the absence of a federated model of structured cooperation these administrative arrangements will encourage the institutions to preserve their strengths while allowing the orderly development (and retention) of opportunities for students-ensuring the breadth and depth of opportunity is retained. NA The development of the Graduate School is largely an internal matter, although it has my strong support. J will therefore support and encourage the development of the Graduate School as a vehicle ""to reach out to the Faculties and to other institutions"" (Stephen Report page 41). In particular, I support Stephen's contention that the Graduate School could ""play a bridging role between the two parts of the University"", and I expect that the profile negotiations will be able to monitor this development. I support Stephen (RSb) that the institute should contribute to the funding of a number of University-wide postgraduate scholarships to foster this development. I endorse the comment in both the Stephen Report and Professor Chubb's advice that staff from the University of Canberra should be involved in the Graduate School. In particular, I endorse the suggestion in the Stephen Report that ""a group spanning the two institutions should be formed to work out the details of involvement of the staff of the University of Canberra"" (page 42). The position of ADFA was raised with Professor Chubb during the discussions he held prior to submitting his advice. In response, he recommended that consideration be given to ADFA participation in the Graduate School. While this is largely a matter for the institutions concerned, I will raise this matter with my colleague the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel should that be necessary. NA The decisions I have announced in this Statement should substantially improve the framework for higher education provision in the ACT, as well as enhance the role of the Institute of Advanced Studies as a national research resource. I have asked officers of the Department together with the Chairs of the Higher Education Council and the Australian Research Council, to meet with officers of the institutions to clarify the processes to apply to the Institute funding and the profile negotiations. 27 March 1991 Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (Question No. 619) Dr Kemp asked the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, upon notice, on 6 March 1991: (1) Has the Government stated that amalgamations of tertiary institutions will be voluntary; if so, would amalgamation between two tertiary institutions proceed if one institution had concluded that the amalgamation would not meet its educational and social objectives. (2) Has the Government assured the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) that if it declines to proceed with an amalgamation to form the Victorian University of Technology because such an amalgamation would not meet its educational and social objectives, it will not be required or compelled to do so; if so, in each instance of such an assurance, (a) when, (b) by whom and (c) to whom was it made and (d) what was the nature of the assurance. (3) Has the Government made any statement to the RMIT to the effect that if it declines to proceed with an amalgamation to form the Victorian University of Technology because such an amalgamation would not meet its educational and social objectives, it will nonetheless be required or compelled to do so; if so, in each instance of such a statement being madC, (a) when, (b) by whom and (c) to whom was the statement made and (d) what was the nature of the statement. (4) Has the Government made any statement to the RMIT to the effect that it (a) may receive more funding than would otherwise be the case if it agrees to enter into an amalgamation or (b) would receive less funding if it opposes or rejects entering an amalgamation; if so, in each instance of such a statement being made, (i) when, (ii) by whom and (iii) to whom was the statement made, (iv) what was the nature of the statement and (v) what sum was involved. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. However, higher education institutions in the States are established under State legislation. Ultimately, therefore, the decision as to whether an amalgamation is to proceed is for the relevant State Government. (2) The Commonwealth cannot and will not compel the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology to proceed with amalgamation with the Victorian University of Technology as it does not have the legislative authority to do so. (3) See (2) above. (4) The Victorian Government and RMIT have been informed that resource decisions announced in the most recent triennial funding statement were conditional on the merger of RMIT with Footscray Institute of Technology and Western Institute proceeding, and that such decisions would need to be reviewed in the event of the merger not going ahead. University of Melbourne (Question No. 621) Dr Kemp asked the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, upon notice, on 6 March 1991: (1) Was the determination of institutional overfunding and underfunding for the Relative Funding Model undertaken on the basis of profile submissions made by the institutions rather than on data provided by the institutions in their statistical returns. (2) Was there a major discrepancy between data provided by the University of Melbourne in its 1991-93 profile submission and its 1990 statistical return; if so, did this discrepancy result in a significant overstatement of the number of students undertaking education at the University of Melbourne and consequently an understatement in the number of students doing other courses at that institution. (3) Has his attention been drawn to the report on ""Base funding adjustments required to bring Victorian higher education institutions within the funding band defined by the Commonwealth Relative Funding Model"" prepared by the Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission which discusses the implications of an overstatement in the number of University of Melbourne students undertaking education. (4) Was the extent to which the University of Melbourne was found to be underfunded under the Relative Funding Model understated as a result of the discrepancy referred to in part (2). (5) Has the Government been informed by the (a) University of Melbourne or (b) Victorian PostSecondary Education Commission of the discrepancy and its implication for the application of the Relative Funding Model to the University; if so, on each occasion the Government was informed (i) by whom was the Government informed, (ii) whom in the Government was informed, (iii) when was it informed and (iv) what was the nature of the statement made. (6) If the Government has been informed of the discrepancy, has it accepted a set of adjusted figures for the University of Melbourne tendered either by the University or the Victorian PostSecondary Education Commission; if so, has it adjusted its calculations for the University under the Relative Funding Model; if not, why not. (7) With respect to the statement at paragraph 3.10 on page 12 of ""Higher education funding for the 1991-93 triennium"" that some institutions submitted revisions to their profile data for the purposes of determining the Relative Funding Model, was the University of Melbourne one of those institutions; if not, and if the Government was alerted to the error in the University's profile data, why was the University of Melbourne not one of the institutions included in the reference cited from ""Higher education funding for the 1991-93 triennium"". (8) What other institutions submitted revisions of the type referred to at paragraph 3.10 on page 12 of ""Higher education funding for the 1991-93 triennium"" and on what dates were the submissions received. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. However, the profile data must be consistent with data provided in the Higher Education Student Data Collection. (2) The University of Melbourne has advised DEET that there is a discrepancy between the data provided in the profiles collection and the Student Data Collection arising from problems with the discipline classification of student load at the former Melbourne College of Advanced Education. As at 29 January 1991, when the University submitted its final profile for the 1991-93 triennium, the University had not resolved problems of classification of student load by discipline. (3) No, I have not seen the particular document referred to, however both my Department and I were aware of VPSEC's concern about this issue. (4) Not known, as the discrepancy has yet to be fully resolved. (5) At the time of the profiles discussions with the University of Melbourne on 24 September 1990, VPSEC informed DEET that it believed there was a discrepancy between the profiles and Student Data Collection for the University. On 17 October 1990, the University of Melbourne indicated by letter to DEET that it was checking the data. A revised profile data collection was provided to DEET on 9 November 1990. However, on 29 January 1991, the University submitted its final profile data for the 1991-93 triennium to DEET with a note indicating that it had not yet resolved the discipline classification problems. The matter was also raised with me by the Victorian Minister of Education on 30 November 1990. (6) Because of the uncertainties about the structural arrangements in higher education in Victoria, most Victorian institutions (including the University of Melbournc) were not included in the final run of the relative funding model, the results of which were published in Higher Education Funding for the 1991-93 Triennium. When the arrangements have been clarified the relative funding model will be applied to the profiles of the ncw institutions. (7) All institutions were aware that the relative funding model would be applied to the 1990 profiles data which were submitted to DEET in July 1990. As noted in paragraph 3.10 of Higher Education Funding for the 1991-93 Triennium some institutions subm ittcd revisions to their profile data which wcre uscd in the final analysis. The University of Melbourne was not one of these. The University's reviscd data set was received too late to check its validity and, more importantly, a change at such a late stagc would have invalidated relative funding adjustments already agrced across the higher education system. In any case, most Victorian institutions were excluded for the reasons indicated previously. (8) The institutions which submitted revisions to their profile data for the purposes of the relative funding model and the dates that their revisions werc received are set out below. Univcrsity of New 8 August 1990 England University of 21 September Technology, Sydney 1990 Ballarat University 20 September College 1990 Deakin University (a) 8 October La Trobe University (a) 14 September Monash University (a) 12 October Phillip Institute of September Technology (a) 1990 Flinders University 25 September University of Adelaide 25 September University of South 25 September Australia 1990 (a) Not included in final model run because of uncertainties about future institutional arrangements. Ms Perla Oloes (Question No. 622) Mr Lavarch asked the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 7 March 1991: (1) Has his attention been drawn to allegations by Mr Antonio Landicho that residency status granted to Ms Perla Oloes was induced by fraudulent misrepresentation by Ms Oloes. (2) Was Ms Oloes granted resident status on the basis of being sponsored as a fiancee by Mr Landicho and then undertaking a ceremony of marriage. (3) Has the marriage between Mr Landicho and Ms Oloes been annulled by the Family Court on grounds of bigamy on the part of Ms Oloes. (4) Has Mr Landicho supplied his Department with evidence of the annulment and documentary evidence of Ms Oloes' existing marriage. (5) Can a grant of residency be revoked if misrepresentation of the facts leading to the grant can be established. (6) Is his Department investigating the case; if so, (a) have Mr Landicho and Ms Oloes been interviewed by investigating officers and (b) are inquiries being madc of authorities in the Philippines to ascertain if Ms Oloes has misrepresented her marital status. (7) Will a decision be made on Ms Oloes' status; if so, when. Mr Hand-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Ms Oloes was sponsored as a fianeee by Mr Landicho. She arrived in Australia under the fianeee rules, married in accordance with the terms of entry and acquired resident status based upon her marriage to Mr Landieho. (3) Yes. (4) Yes. 1990 (5) There is provision in the Migration Aet for people who misreprcsent themselves in their ap1990 plication for visas to bccomc illegal entrants, liable to deportation, regardless of whether they have 1990 been granted resident status. However, such misrepresentation has to be clearly provcn to have occurred in connection with'the application for a visa or entry permit. 1990 (6) Yes. The Department is investigating the ease and on one occasion a joint DepartmentalAFP operation was conducted to locate and in1990 terview Ms Oloes. (a) Mr Landicho, in addition to corresponding by lctter had personal contact with relevant ofTiccrs of the Department concerning this matter. Ms Oloes has since been contacted through her solicitor and will be intcrvicwed when clarification of her marital status is received from the Philippines. (b) Yes. (7) A decision on Ms Oloes' status will be made when ,a legal opinion clarifying whether there was any impediment to her marrying Mr Landicho is received from the Filipino authorities.

149,Mr BEAZLEY,MOVING FORWARD,"The answer to the honourable member's question, based on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, is as follows: Yes, the ABC as with other media organisations may be held in contcmpt of a Royal Commission appointed by a State government. If a fine for such a contcmpt was imposed, (a) the ABC would pay the imposed flne (b) the funds available for the ABC to pay the fme would come from its Legal and Administrative Services Department budget, which forms part of the total ABC appropriation. Petroleum Taxes (Question No. 707) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 11 April 1991: (1) What taxes are levied for each litre of petrol from the exploration stage t() its sale at the bowser. (2) In what way do the taxes referred to in part (I) differ according to type of oil.",124
150,Mr GRIFFITHS,MOVING FORWARD,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Commonwealth Government revenue from taxes on petroleum is derived from two sources: (a) from Res'burce Rent Tax, excise and royalties on production of the crude oil; and (b) from excises on petrolcum products, including petrol. The States impose royalties on oil production from onshore areas and in the case of Barrow Island, offshore Western Australia, a resource rent royalty. All States except Queensland impose a franchise fee on retail sales of petrol and diesel. The fee varies between the States. The taxes levied on crude oil prior to its conversion into petrol are paid by producers, not consumers. If there were no taxes on production of crude oil, refiners of petrol and other petroleum products would still have to pay the market price for oil in refining those products. That market price is not boosted by the production taxes on oil. The tax on petrol, in the form of an excise currently set at 25.767 cents per litre, is levied on ex-refinery production and imported petrol. The excise rate is linked to variations in the Consumer Price Index and adjusted twice yearly each February and August. ,(2) The excise rate on petrol docs not vary WIth dIfferent types of oil used in its production. The application of taxes on oil production is explained in the booklet ""Petroleum Production Taxation"", a copy of which is forwarded to your office and is available from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. Civil Aviation Authority Aircraft (Question No. 708) Mr Cobb asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviatian Support, upon notice, on 11 April 1991 : Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the claim at page 63 in the March-April issue of 'Australian Flying' that the Civil Aviation Authority swapped a Fokker F28 for a used HS125, a deal arranged through Sir Peter Abeles' - acific Aviation Ply Ltd; if so, did the deal occur; If so, what are the details.",125
151,Mr B,MOVING FORWARD,"az-cy-The Minister for Shipping and Avlatlon Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: The article printed in the March/April issue of 'Australian Flying' mistakenly refers to the release of a Fokker F28 and the acquisition of a HS125 as a ""clean swap"". The contract established' in June 1987 by the t--n D-partment of Aviation involved the acquisItIOn In December 1987 of a used, low time HS 125!700B from Ansctt Transport Industries (Operations) Pty Ltd (A TI) accompanied by a range of support items and services and the subsequent disposal of an F28 to ATI. The aircraft rollover program included provisioning for equipment upgradc in the HS125, scheduled and un-c-eduled maIntenance, spare parts, technical traInIng and materials to support the introductIon of the aircraft into service. .The contract was formed following a world-lde .tender competition which included a RegIstratIon of Interest phase in late 1985 and a public tender phase which was advertised in December 1986. Th- bid by ATI, with British Aerospace as an aSsocIate, ranked ahead of the rest on financial and economic grounds. The offer also contained significant technical and operational advantages. The contract with ATI was signed in June 1987 and - overed a period of 41 months to provide ongOIng support arrangements. Of particular importance is that the contract was est.a-lished as a result of an open tender competitIOn and rcpresented the best commercial and financial outcome from prevailing market conditions at the time. The cash surplus of US $38,000 was credited to Consolidated Revenue. ABC: The Home Show (Question No. 710) Mr Ewen Cameron asked the Minister for Transport and Communications upon notice, on 15 April 1991: ' Further to his answer to question No. 406 (Ha,!sard, 21 December 1990, page 4998) concernmg the ABC television program ""The Home Show"" (a) what sum was paid to the ABC by (i) Famous ArtIsts International, (ii) the Housing Industry Association (HIA), (iii) Law Foundation Productions Pty Ltd and (iv) the Department of Indu.stry, Technology and Commerce, (b) can SubSIdIes endanger the independence of the ABC, (c) has Mr L Grovcs of the HIA complained that th- HIA had not received value for the money it paId the ABC and (d) has the ABC received any other comp1flints concerning the program.",125
152,Mr BEAZLEY,MOVING FORWARD,"The answer to the honourable member's question, based on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, is as follows: (a) (i) The sum paid to the ABC by Famous Artists International was $246,300. (ii) the ABC did not receive any money direct from the Housing Industry Association (HIA), (iii) the sum paid to the ABC by Law Foundation Productions Pty Ltd was $50,000, (iv) the sum paid to the ABC by the Department of Industry Technology and Commerce was $185,000. (b) The ABC's Editorial and Program Practises (1989) ensures that with programs such as ""The Home Show"", final editorial control always remains with the ABC. (c) The complaints by Mr L. Groves of the HIA underline the fact that the editorial integrity of the program was protected by the ABC. Mr Groves' complaint is based on his desire to obtain air time for specific products manufactured or sold by his members. He was clearly told that this was not to be available within the program and that the program's editorial content would be dictated by the producers and not by any of the funders. The ABC's editorial control was exercised to ensure the integrity of the content. In fact, the Housing Industry Association did not pay the ABC any money. It paid money to the co-producer, Famous Artists International, who paid part of that money to the ABC as a production fee. (d) The ABC is not aware of any other similar complaints against the program. Brazilian Citrus Concentrate (Question No. 711)  Small Business and Customs, upon notice, on 15 April 1991: Will the vessel Hay/eng arrive in Australia with a cargo of 2250 tonnes of Brazilian citrus concentrate; if so, (a) are 2250 tonnes of citrus concentrate equivalent to 29 000 tonnes of fresh oranges, (b) will the concentrate be (i) delivered to customers or (ii) placed in bond stores in Melbourne, Sydney and Mildura, (c) is Fruit Mark Pty Ltd (i) the importing agent for the concentrate and (ii) part of the New Zealand Apple and Pear Board and (d) will the shipment (i) subvert the findings of the anti-dumping inquiry, (ii) take advantage of the Government's intention to remove sales tax exemptions on the use of Australian juice and (iii) further damage the viability of the Australian citrus industry. Mr Beddall-The answer honourable member's question lows: In relation to parts (a) to (c) of the question, the Australian Customs Service (Customs) is unable to confirm or deny any details of importations by a particular importer; to do so would be a breach of confidence and contrary to the provisions of the Customs Administration Act. In relation to part (d), on 24 April, Customs reached a preliminary finding on the application from the orange fruit growers for anti-dumping measures on frozen concentrated orange juice from Brazil. Customs found that these goods from Brazil were not dumped. Australia imports a major proportion of its requirement. I understand that at this time of year the quantities of local oranges available for processing into frozen concentrated orange juice are very small and imports are higher than at other times of the year.

(2) How many of those compensated were commissioned officers. Mr Bilney-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Due to the fact that Defence Force compensation records were not computerised until 1987, and then only prospectively, to answer this question would require a manual search in each Defence Regional Ofllee to ascertain whether claims were submitted by the 1580 survivors of the collision. I am not prepared to allocate the substantial manpower resources needed for this task. (2) See (1) above. Cooperative Research Centres (Question No. 750) Mr MCGauran asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 7 May 1991: (1) What sum will be spent on support for the establishment of cooperative research centres in (a) 1990-91 and (b) 1991-92.

(7) Was the use of existing grants revicw bodies elsewhere in Government departments to make recommendations concerning cooperative research centres examined.",128
160,Mr HAWKE,MOVING FORWARD,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) (a) and (b) As indicated in the Guidelines for Applicants $4M has been allocated in 199091 and $15M in 1991-92 for funding successful Cooperative Research Centres. The contracts for first round Centres are currently being negotiated, and it is expected that the first fifteen Centres will receive funds early next financial year. It is anticipated that the full $19M available to the Program for the next financial year will be paid in 1991-92 to these fifteen successful first round Centres, and to those Centres selected in the second round. (2) (a) and (b) Letters of offer have been sent to the fifteen successful Centres. Each Centre is currently drawing up detailed budgets and schedules of activities and putting in place their internal participant agreements. Completion of these Centre Agreements is necessary prior to the signing of the agreement with the Commonwealth which is expected to take place in the next few months, and will determine the value of the Government's contributions and those of the participants. (3) Several participants in the Centres have indicated that they will contribute cash towards the activities of the Centres. (4) The schedule to the Commonwealth Agreement will provide the agreed performance indicators for the Centre, which cover similar areas to the criteria used to select the Centres. Major reviews will be held 1 or 2 years before the end of the funding period determined in the Commonwealth Agreement. The review will be based on the agreed performance indicators. (5) Yes, Centres do have a definite life span of 5 to 7 years and this will be specified in the Commonwealth Agreement with each Centre. Following the major review of the Centre's operations by the Cooperative Research Centres Committee, funding support may be renewed. [t is intended that the Centres should become a major and enduring element in the research infrastructure. (6) The Cooperative Research Centres Program is required to respond to the needs of a wide range of sectors of the economy, as well as Lo social and environmental needs. The intention of the Program is to bring together scientists and engineers of excellence from the Government; academic and private sectors, and so draws together education as well as industry interests. Given the broad coordination role of my department, the Program is well placed in the Office of the Chief Scientist to meet its objectives. (7) Other grants review bodies were considered for the administration of the CRC scheme. However the existing grant giving bodies have particular arcas of responsibility, such as either university or industry research funding. The Cooperative Research Centres Program is designed to bring together participants from all sections of the research community including higher education, CSIRO, other Government research laboratories and the private sector. Establishing a separatc body to make recommendations concerning the CI{C Program, which drew upon all of these sectors, was considered as being essential to the success of the Program. National Science and Technology Centre (Question No. 760) Mr MCGauran asked the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, upon notice, on 7 May 1991: (1) Will the National Science and Technology Centre become self-funding; if so, over what period will it achieve independence from funding by appropriations; if not, was it ever the stated intention of the Centre to become self-funding. (2) What ratio of external earnings to appropriations does the Centre require to operate (a) in 1990-91 and (b) in the medium to long term. (3) What impact would the (a) reduction or (b) withdrawal of funding through appropriations have on the Centre. (4) Could higher entry fees offset a reduction or withdrawal of funding or would it be nccessary to reduce the Centrc's activities. (5) What is the entry fee to the Centre. (6) Will the entry fec he increased while there is continuing support for the Centre through appropriation. Mr Simmons-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. In 1990-91, revenuc accounted for 61% of the Centre's running costs. (2) The ratio will depcnd upon the amount of revenue the Centre can raise. If this falls there will be a corresponding fall in the ratio of external earnings to appropriations. The Centre is continually examining further ways of raising revenue. (3) Withdrawal or reduction of appropriation support could mean that the Centre would not be able to fulfil its national charter unless thcre were an increase in revenue. (4) See answcrs to questions 3 and 6. (5) $6.00 adult; $3.00 child/concession; $18.00 family; discount of 20% for groups of 20 or more (excluding school groups).
