2,The SPEAKER,MR IAN HARRIS,"On behalf of all members, I would like to offer very special congratulations to the Clerk of the House of Representatives. As most members will be aware, yesterday in the Queen's Birthday Honours Mr Ian Harris was appointed as an officer in the Order of Australia, General Division. On behalf of everyone, I congratulate him. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",17
3,Mr HOWARD,MR IAN HARRIS," Mr Speaker, I join you in extending my personal congratulations, and those of the government, to Mr Harris, who does his job with great skill. He has the versal respect of this parliament and it is a thoroughly well-deserved honour. NA",17

5,Mr HOWARD,NEW SOUTH WALES FLOOD,"I seek the indulgence of the House to briefly mention three matters. I know that all Australians would have been particularly touched and saddened by the tragic level crossing accident at Kerang in Victoria. As a nation we are used to traffic accidents. They are a daily occurrence, sadly enough, but this was a particularly devastating one. The personal stories of those whose lives were suddenly taken from their loved ones did touch the hearts of a nation and particularly the community surrounding Kerang in Victoria. Our love and our sympathy go out to those left bereaved by this terrible accident. The Commonwealth government has offered all the assistance it can provide in relation to investigations to establish the cause of the accident. Officers of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau are already assisting their Victorian colleagues. As always, the grimmest tasks in terrible accidents fall to the police and the ambulance officers. Those in the community who take it upon themselves on far too regular a basis to attack police and to call them all sorts of things should remember how terrible the job of police is in dragging mangled bodies from cars and, in this case, from a train. To them, to the ambulance officers and to all the other community services I express my personal admiuniration and thanks and those, I know, of the entire parliament. Whilst I am in this vein, I know I speak on behalf of the House in paying tribute to the remarkable stoicism and courage of the people of the Hunter region of New South Wales and of the Central Coast. We are all aware of the severe flooding and violent storms that sadly have claimed nine lives-including, in an absolutely heart breaking accident on the old Pacific Highway, five members of one family in the most brutal and sudden of all accidents with the subsidence of that road. I had the opportunity yesterday of visiting the Hunter region in company with my colleague the member for Paterson. I met the member for Hunter, the Mayor of Newcastle, Mr John  Blackmore. Again I can only say how tremendously impressed I was, as I know everybody has been, with the work of the SES, the police, the ambulance services and the other local civic officials. Teams of SES people had come from all over Australia, including some teams from Victoria and one from Broken Hill. Once again, the great Australian spirit of cooperation in adversity to get things done and achieve a common purpose was very much in evidence. I know that part of New South Wales extremely well. They are great people-the people of the Hunter and the people of the Central Coast of New South Wales-and I pay tribute to their stoicism, their matter-ofMurray fact way of dealing with adversity, and the calm way in which they accepted the requests of the authorities. Mercifully, the damage to property and the loss of life was less than was feared at one stage, and that is a great tribute to the calmness of the people and the wonderful advice that they had received from the SES. This has been an occasion when all levels of government have worked together very closely. I spoke to the New South Wales Premier at length on Saturday and offered him any additional assistance of which New South Wales might stand in need over the disaster relief arrangements that are in operamourning. tion. I also announced, as is the case in all like circumstances, additional Commonwealth assistance where serious injury is tained or a residence is rendered uninhabitable or unliveable for a period of 48 hours. This has been a great example of cooperation in adversity and I pay tribute to those involved. There is one other matter I want to mention. Perhaps the Acting Leader of the Opposition might respond to the first two issues and then I could address the other.",17
6,Ms GILLARD,NEW SOUTH WALES FLOOD,"On indulgence, I too seek to make a contribution on behalf of the Labor Party and most particularly on behalf of Kevin Rudd, who today is attending the state funeral of Tom Burns, a Labor legend. I would like to extend the Labor Party's condolences for the terrible tragedies which have affected the communities of Kerang in the north-west of Victoria, of Newcastle and of the Central Coast of New South Wales. As a Victorian, I was struck particularly hard by the news that on 7 June 2007 tragedy had struck the community of Kerang when a truck collided with a V/Line train making its regular journey from Swan Hill through the Valley to Melbourne. It is, of course, the worse rail disaster in Victoria in over 50 years. Nearby farmers, locals and passers-by did what they could at the time to help those in the crash, assisting the truck driver from his cabin and helping those who stumbled out of the rubble in a daze to see a shocking sight of twisted metal and a ripped-open carriage. Then came the personal stories of those who had lost loved ones, those who had been injured and those who had survived just out of sheer luck-who were meant to be on that train but, for whatever reason, did not make the train that day. Every death hits hard and many in Victoria and beyond are Our hearts have been especially touched in all of this tragedy by the story of the sus- MCMonnies family, who must deal with the loss of their father, Geoff, a long-time local of Robinvale, and a daughter, 17-year-old Rose; whilst the youngest of four, Sharice, 15, was seriously injured in the crash and admitted to the Royal Children's Hospital. It is stories like those that bring this tragedy home. I know that every member of this parliament would be mourning the loss of life in the Kerang rail disaster. Our hearts have also been touched by the havoc wreaked on the people and the communities of Newcastle, the Hunter, the New South Wales Central Coast and even parts of Sydney in recent days. On the weekend I had the opportunity to speak to my colleagues Sharon Grierson, the member for Newcastle, Jill Hall, the member for Shortland, and Joel Fitzgibbon, the member for Hunter. Indeed, Sharon Grierson is not with us in parliament today; she is back home in her electorate assisting locals. When I spoke to her on the weekend, she told me of personally rescuing her elderly parents, who were sitting on their kitchen table in a house that had waist-high water. I am sure that Sharon's story is just one of tens of thousands that could be told of what has gone on with this tragedy. Businesses have been ruined and homes have been trashed. Tragically, no fewer than 10 lives have been lost. I join with the Prime Minister in particularly mentioning the loss of life of Roslyn Bragg, her children Jasmine and Madison, her nephew Travis and her partner, Adam Holt, who did what we do every day-they got into a car and strapped themselves in-only to have that car literally swallowed up by the road. On behalf of the opposition, I offer our thoughts and our prayers for the families of those who have lost their lives and many who have had their homes and businesses destroyed. If there is one bright light in all of this tragedy, it is the work of the emergency services personnel-the SES, volunteers and others who have put themselves out to help community members around them. That is true in Kerang and it is true in New South Wales. I associate myself with the Prime Minister's remarks about the special role played by our police when disaster strikes. Both my mother and father served as police officers and the words of the Prime Minister do ring true. We owe a special debt of gratitude to the police, who so often have to look after all of us in these sorts of difficult circumstances. The work of each-the police, the emergency services personnel and the volunteers-make us all very proud. The uplifting spirit and tenacity of the Australian people are always apparent in moments of great disaster and tragedy. Once again, it is inspiring to see Australians working together as mates to pull each other through. NA NA NA",18
7,Mr HOWARD,PARKER,"On indulgence, I know that all members of the House will be aware of the recent return to Australia of the remains of two Australian soldiers killed in the Vietnam War in the 1960s. The funeral service for Lance Corporal Richard Parker is currently taking place in Canberra and is being attended by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, representing the government; and the funeral for Private Peter Gillson will be held in Melbourne on Friday of this week. This is an extraordinary story of commitment by mates of those who served in Vietnam coupled with a determination to fulfil the obligation that all men and women who fight in our armed services feel towards the recovery and, where appropriate, the repatriation of the remains of those who have died in battle. On 18 November 1965, during Operation Hump, the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, encountered a well-dug-in Vietcong force. After a savage fight, 1RAR was forced to withdraw, leaving these two brave diggers on the battlefield. The story of the search for Lance Corporal Parker and Private Gillson is one of great mateship, perseverance and sacrifice in the best of the ANZAC tradition. A remarkable and quite selfless Australian, Jim Bourke, and his dedicated Vietnam veteran team from Operation Aussies Home persisted tirelessly with their inquiries, their research and their advocacy to compile insights and evidence beyond historical material and official records. That perseverance ultimately led to the recovery of their fallen countrymen. The search, I am pleased to say, also saw great cooperation between the Australian and Vietnamese governments. I record the gratitude of the Australian government to the Vietnamese government for its assistance. I want to thank, on behalf of the government and the House, Operation Aussies Home, the ADF, the Department of Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, our Ambassador to Vietnam, Bill Tweddell, and the Defence Attache, Captain John Griffith, for their dedicated pursuit of the remains of our missing countrymen. Four Australian servicemen are still missing in Vietnam. We are doing all that reasonably can be done to fully account for their remains. That is of great importance to their families, those who served with them, the broader defence family and all of the people of Australia. The repatriation of the remains of Lance Corporal Parker and Private Peter Gillson, attended with appropriate solemnity and dignity in a very proper Australian way, brings to an end the search that has been conducted for so long for them. We hope that in the fullness of time a search for the remains of the other four who are still missing can be brought to a similar conclusion. But it is important that we again record our great respect for those who served their country in Vietnam, indeed for those who serve their country in any theatre of battle, and also at a like this we think of those thousands of Australians who are risking their lives in many battlefields at present in our name, on our behalf and for the values that we all hold dear. I again express on behalf of the government and the House sincere condolences to the families of Lance Corporal Parker and Private Gillson. The repatriation ceremonies and the funerals this week, although very sad events, will be of immense importance to them and will be of immense comfort and solace to people who have waited so long to be reunited with the remains of their loved ones. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",19
8,Ms GILLARD,PARKER,"Once again on indulgence, I associate the Labor Party with the Prime Minister's remarks. Of course this nation always mourns its dead lost in battle, lost in defence of the nation, wherever they have served. We are here to mark the passing of Lance Corporal Richard Parker and Private Peter Gillson and the return of their remains to this country. I understand that the member for Bendigo, Steve Gibbons, and Graham Edwards were in attendance when the remains were brought back home. As the Prime Minister has indicated, Richard Parker and Peter Gillson were both of A Company, 1st Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment, and they were both killed on 8 November 1965. These men, whose remains were recovered in the most recent operation, were killed in a fierce battle. Their comrades were unable to recover the bodies as a result of the intensity of enemy fire. But in a tireless effort since that time, Mr Jim Bourke, a Vietnam veteran himself, established Operation Aussies Home to bring closure by finding and returning the bodies of those missing from the Vietnam War. He did this together with his fellow veterans Gordon time Petersen, who was Parker's acting platoon commander; Trevor Hagan, his acting platoon sergeant during the battle; and Clive Williams, who was Gillson's platoon commander. In what can only be described as an extraordinary extension of duty and loyalty, Jim Bourke and his mates led an investigation of the possible burial locations in 2005 for Lance Corporal Richard Parker and Private Peter Gillson. With help from Vietnamese authorities and veterans, the burial sites of these two soldiers were established earlier this year. I acknowledge the Australian government's financial assistance and also its diplomatic assistance to Operation Aussies Home. I refer in particular to the Ambassador to Vietnam, Bill Tweddell, and Defence Attache Captain John Griffith. We also acknowledge the Vietnamese government, Vietnamese veterans and local people who facilitated the recovery and the handover of the remains. The information provided by Vietnamese veterans of the battle and by locals was crucial to the discovery of the remains, as was the information provided by Australian veterans of the battle. Our gratitude goes to Jim Bourke and his team at Operation Aussies Home, but I also specifically acknowledge and pay tribute to the families of the two men whose remains were recovered. These include Private Gillson's widow, Lorraine Easton, and her sons Robert and Craig, and Lance Corporal Parker's former partner, Wendy Mudford. On another matter, I also join with the Prime Minister in congratulating the Clerk, Ian Harris, on the good news from yesterday. Ian serves this parliament; he serves every member within it. The opposition relies on his services and advice, as does the government. It is a difficult job and one that does not bring day-today recognition, so it is rific for the parliament to be able to mark this moment. Thank you very much, Ian. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Fuel Prices",20
9,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his Treasurer's statement on 11 December 1996 that the government would abandon petrol prices surveillance because it would reduce regulation, promote competition and ‘put downward pressure on petrol prices to the benefit of consumers'. Can the Prime Minister confirm that the government abandoned prices surveillance of petrol on 1 August 1998? Prime Minister, after 11 years, when will the Treasurer's downwards pressure on petrol prices kick in?",21
10,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am certainly aware of the remarks of the Treasurer and, as so often happens, the member for Lalor has misquoted my colleague. The Treasurer, of course, can speak for himself, and very well, in relation to those matters. While people are being reminded of matters could I remind the member for Lalor of the remarks of the member for Rankin on this subject. The member for Rankin wrote a very good article on this subject in which he pointed out that, in effect, those who sought to pretend that the price of petrol in Australia was determined by other than world market forces were deluding themselves. Employment",21
11,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Would the Prime Minister update the House on how many jobs have been created in Australia over the past year? Prime Minister, what is the reason for this jobs growth? Are there any risks to this growth?",21
12,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for terBass for his question. He asked me to inform the parliament, which I happily do, of how many jobs have been created in Australia over the last year. I can inform the member for Bass that, since May 2006, no fewer than 309,900 jobs have been created in Australia. I am also pleased to tell him that no fewer than 359,000 jobs, of which 94 per cent have been full time, have been created since the major amendments to the government's workplace legislation which came into operation on 27 March last year. The member for Bass also asks me why there has been such spectacular growth in jobs. There has been spectacular growth in jobs in this country because we now have a government and a labour market that are employment friendly. We have a labour market that actually encourages people to take on more staff. We have a labour market which particularly encourages small business to take on more staff. In relation to a threat of higher unemployment, the greatest threat of higher unemployment contained in Labor's policy is the promise to bring back the dreaded unfair dismissal laws. Those unfair dismissal laws, for more than a decade, discouraged small business in Australia from taking on people. Everyone knows that what used to happen was that frivolous claims were made; small business was encouraged to pay $30,000 or $40,000 ‘go away money' to somebody who had made a frivolous claim. They paid the money and then got back to their business, but they got back to their business vowing never again to take a risk about employing more staff than they thought they might need. That atmosphere has changed completely, and I would have thought that the Labor Party would try to be friendly to small business, that they would stand up to the union bosses and say, ‘Look, we'll have to go along with certain things, but don't you people understand that bringing back the unfair dismissal laws is going to stifle job growth in the small business sector?' But they did not have the courage to do that. This is not just a piece of mere fantasy on my part. The Sensis business index of small and medium enterprises released on 6 May has very positive results on SME employment. The key message from that report is that, of those small businesses that have reported changes in their business arrangements following the introduction of workplace relations changes, no fewer than one in five-that is, 20 per cent of the 1.9 million small businesses in Australia-have reported taking on new workers as a result of the changes that we have made and that Labor opposes. No less than 20 per cent of the total of small and medium businesses in Australia are saying, ‘We are employing more people because of the Howard government's workplace changes.' All of that will come to a shuddering halt if the Labor Party wins the next election and is able to introduce its policies. So I say to the member for Bass: yes, we do have a 33-year low in unemployment-a fact that union bosses might want to keep not only from Australians but from the world, but we might deal with that in another context-and one of the major reasons that unemployment is so low in Australia at the moment is that small business once again has the climate and the courage to take on more staff. That is a great thing for the workers of Australia and it is a great thing for small business. It will be a terrible thing if Labor gets the opportunity to bring all that to a halt. Workplace Relations",21
13,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the government have a target for the percentage of the Australian workforce to be covered by Australian workplace agreements? Specifically, does the government have a plan to use the federal-state healthcare funding agreements to force the offering of Australian workplace agreements to Australia's 250,000 nurses?",22
14,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am not aware of that. I do not have a target and I am informed by both my Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and my Minister for Health and Ageing that there is no such target. Economy,22
15,Mr BROADBENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Treasurer, would you inform the House of recently released economic data? Are there any threats to the Australian economy?",22
16,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for MCMillan for his question. I can inform the House that since the House rose, the week before last, we have had two very good pieces of economic news. The first was that unemployment has fallen to 4.2 per cent in Australia, the lowest rate since November 1974, and the second was that the national accounts showed that economic growth had accelerated and grown 1.6 per cent in the March quarter to be 3.8 per cent higher than a year ago. I am sure all members of the House will welcome that news. Even ex-members of the House welcomed that news. I saw Labor hero Paul Keating come out on Lateline. I knew the accounts must have been good because Paul Keating came out of retirement to claim credit for them! After 11 years, it was all his good work. He not only had some advice for the government; he had someMr Hatton interjecting",22
17,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He had lots of advice, as the member for Blaxland reminds me. He had some advice for the Labor Party. I have made the point over and over again in this House that you do not become an economic conservative just because a focus group tells you that is what the public wants to hear and that you do not become an economic conservative just because you cut an advertisement to that effect. Politics is about substance; not about focus group and poll driven advertising agencies. That is the way I make the point. I must say Mr Keating made the point in a far more colourful way. He said: The Labor Party is not going to profit from having these proven unsuccessful people around who are frightened of their own shadow and won't get out of bed in the morning unless they've had a focus group report to tell them which side of bed to get out. Of course, we know he was speaking about none other than the member for Lilley, who, Mr Keating says, cannot get out of bed in the morning until the focus group says the left or the right. Half the time, he tries to get out on both sides of the bed in the morning. With an economy which has grown at 1.6 per cent in the March quarter, with unemployment low at 4.2 per cent, you cannot afford to make errors and mistakes. This is now a supercharged economy. It is like a Formula One racing car. It is highly calibrated. If a driver in this highly calibrated Formula One racing car takes a bend at six inches or six centimetres too wide, he is going to have a crash. This is not the time to be experimenting with the L-plate drivers of the Australian Labor Party. This is a time when you need experience. This is not a time to go back to union control in the labour market because all of that could unsettle this economy. Now more than ever, in a highly calibrated economy, you need strong economic management-the economic management of the coalition. Workplace Relations",23
18,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is for the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, is it not a fact that in early May the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations circulated a request for tender to economic research consultancies for economic modelling? Will the Prime Minister confirm that the tender documentation requests modelling based on Australian workplace agreement it is coverage increasing from ‘around five per cent of all employees to 20 per cent of all employees'? Prime Minister, does this document not reveal your government's plan to force 1.5 million Australians onto Australian workplace agreements?",23
19,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The answer is no. Workplace Relations,23
20,Mr HARDGRAVE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of recent criticisms of Australia's labour market in international fora? Is the Prime Minister aware of the motivation for these attacks? What is the Prime Minister's response?,23
21,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Moreton for his question. He asks me whether I am aware of criticism of Australia's labour market policies in international fora. The answer is yes, I am, but more seriously than that, I am aware of the fact that a person holding a very prominent public position in Australia-namely, the presidency of the Australian Council of Trade Unions-has broken one of the unwritten laws of Australian political combat; that is, that no matter how strongly you feel about something, you do not blacken the name of your own country overseas to score a domestic political point. That is what Sharan Burrow does. However I might disagree with Sharan Burrow, it is all right for her to try to argue the case against us here in Australia, but to go overseas and blacken the name of her own country in order to score a domestic political point is, in my view, breaking an unwritten law of Australian political combat. Not only did she blacken the name of Australia, but also she encouraged the blackening of Australia's name. On 5 June, the Australian said Ms Burrow was: ... lobbying furiously by telephone from Melbourne to Geneva over the past week to have Australia included on the ILO's list of 25 lombia's expense. They murder trade unionists in Colombia. Colombia is a foul, authoritarian country. For the President of the ACTU to be part of a process that replaces a country with an appalling human rights record and-no matter what she might think of me or our government, or any prominent official-to use an international forum to blacken the name of her own country is to break one of the unwritten laws of Australian political combat. Not only was the ACTU engaged in that exercise; it was also engaged in the exercise of trying to suppress knowledge of how successful this country has been in reducing unemployment. I would have thought that if there was one thing that the ILO would be interested in, it would be how low unemployment is in Australia. I would have thought that the one great human dividend of labour market policy would be to give a job to as many people who wanted one as was humanly possible. I would have thought that that exceeded anything else-that it was more important than any ideology and that how many people you had in work was more important than whether it was this or that ideology. But it is not when it comes to the ACTU and its mates in the Australian Labor Party. What they were doing was trying to suppress data about our unemployment level. The employer delegate reported that the union representatives actually tried to prevent data on unemployment being made known to the ILO. There is a very telling article by Peter Anderson in the Australian newspaper this morning, in which he reports having been at a meeting where the union delegates tried to stop news of the low unemployment being admitted into the debate before the committee. Mr Anderson states that he went back to his hotel room and said: ‘Thank heavens for CNN. I flick on CNN and I see at Cothat Australia has a 33-year low in unemployment.' So-no thanks to the ACTU, no thanks to Sharan Burrow and no thanks to their friends in the Australian Labor Partyit has taken the reach of CNN to bring home to international people just how successful this country has been in reducing unemployment. I simply say that it is one thing to attack me; it is one thing to attack the government. By all means, have open season on us here in Australia. But, when you go overseas, do not blacken the name of your own country in order to score a domestic political point. Workplace Relations",24
22,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister. I again refer to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations request for tender for economic modelling issued in early May and presented to economic consultancies. Prime Minister, doesn't this document reveal your government's plan to force Australians off awards and onto Australian workplace agreements to achieve ‘award coverage dropping from 19 per cent to 10 per cent'?",25
23,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"With the greatest of respect to the Acting Leader of the Opposition, it does not prove anything of the kind. Can I say that I note with enormous interest that the Acting Leader of the Opposition is taking advantage of the absence of the Leader of the Opposition to reinforce her visceral hatred of AWAs. I notice that she is taking advantageMr Albanese interjecting",25
24,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Confected laughter from the member for Grayndler proves my point. We all know that on a scale of 10, when it comes to hatred of AWAs, the member for Lalor is at about 10½ or 11. And every time there is a tiny little bit of light, a tiny opening of the door on some possible, little, teenyweeny bit of preservation of AWAs, she comes in and says: ‘No. Lock, stock and barrel, they're going.' I say to she who hates AWAs: no. You have been engaged in too many Labor Party conspiracies. You misread that document. It does not prove anything of the kind. State Governments: Economic Management",25
25,Mr VASTA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer inform the House of the fiscal outcomes of recent state government budgets? What do the growing deficits and debt levels at state government level say about economic management?,25
26,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Bonner for his question. I think I can say without a shadow of doubt that he is the greatest member for Bonner that this House has ever seen. It is probably known in this House that the Commonwealth in its most recent budget balanced the budget, cut tax and further reduced debt. In fact, the Commonwealth is now building a net asset position. Now that we have had all of the states except for New South Wales deliver their budgets, we can say that collectively the Labor states have left their budgets in deficit, have increased tax and are building up debt-the very reverse of what the Commonwealth is doing. For example, Queensland will increase its vehicle registration duties from 1 January 2008; Western Australia announced increases in water, electricity, public transport and motor vehicle registration costs; South Australia announced increases in compulsory third party premiums, motor vehicle registrations and water; and Victoria announced increased taxes on poker machines and that it would abolish its petrol subsidy by 0.429c a litre. Ms King interjecting",25
27,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I want members of the House-and the member for Ballarat, who is interjecting, in particular-to focus on this. A moment ago Labor was complaining about the price of petrol. I point out to the Labor Party that the Victorian Labor government withdrew a petrol subsidy in its recent budget. And the Tasmanian government did the same thing. It withdrew a subsidy of 1.95c per litre on petrol and 1.99c per litre on diesel. So it would be very interesting to know whether the Labor Party has criticised any of the state governments that have recently withdrawn petrol subsidies and put prices up as a consequence. If any of them have, they can speak now or forever hold their peace. They have held their peace. In addition to that",25
28,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The priest normally gives you longer than that!,26
29,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Yes. Government member interjecting,26
30,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, you do not get a second chance at that one. A lot of marriages would fail if you had two chances to speak! Not only has Labor increased all those taxes but the Labor states are not balancing their budgets as a whole. They are budgeting for deficits of 0.3 per cent of GDP and-get a load of this-as a whole, building up debt over the next three years by $58 billion. Over the next forward estimates, the Commonwealth will save $50 billion and the states will borrow $58 billion. This is the difference between Liberal federal government and state Labor government. With state Labor government, you get increased taxes, budget deficits and a build-up of debt. With the coalition federal government, you get tax cuts, balanced budgets and a reduction of debt. If you want the Labor way to spread from the states to the Commonwealth, you have a great opportunity. You have Mr Rudd and his focus group driven advisers and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition or you could have real economic management in the coalition government. Workplace Relations",26
31,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister. I refer again to his government's request for tender for economic modelling. Prime Minister, doesn't this document reveal your government's plan to force Work Choices on 100 per cent of working Australians-up from 85 per centmeaning that 1.5 million employees such as nurses and firefighters will be at risk under your extreme industrial relations laws?",26
32,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me take the deputy leader very quietly through this. I ask her to listen very quietly. Let me just point out to her that it does not prove anything of the kind. What our policy demonstrates is that people can have choice. The difference between us and the Labor Party is that, if the Labor Party wins the election, collective agreements will rule the day. They will completely remove the option of AWAs. What we are witnessingMs Macklin interjecting",26
33,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"is the member for Lalor, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, grabbing hold of the unexpected opportunity of speaking for the Labor Party-and she has taken every question and directed all of them to me. What she is really doing is saying to the worldMs Macklin interjecting",26
34,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Jagajaga is warned!,26
35,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"that, as far as she is concerned, there will be absolutely no backsliding on AWAs. Gary Gray-you all know who Gary Gray is; certainly the former Prime Minister does-may be going around the mining companies in Western AustraliaMr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order with regard to standing order 104. It is a very specific question.",26
36,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member will resume his seat. The Prime Minister was asked a fairly lengthy question. He is certainly in order. I call the Prime Minister.,26
37,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"People like Gary Gray and others may be going around saying, ‘There is a way through on this, comrade,' but while the leader is away in Brisbane the acting leader is taking every opportunity to nail her colours to the anti-AWA mast. She speaks for the Australian Labor Party, she speaks for Greg Combet and she speaks for Sharan Burrow. Every question she asks is a further illustration of her visceral hatred of AWAs.

This question specifically referred to the extension of Work Choices",26

39,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Fraser will resume his seat. The Prime Minister was asked a question on AWAs. The Prime Minister is answering the question, and the Prime Minister is certainly in order.

40,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the House will resume his seat. I have already ruled on that point of order. The Prime Minister is in order. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a further point of order. Is it in order for the Acting Leader of the Opposition to constantly hold up a document and point to it? Perhaps she should table it for us.",27

42,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I resume the invitation I extended to the Acting Leader of the Opposition. Instead of reinforcing her visceral dislike of AWAs, perhaps she ought to go to Western Australia and to other parts of this country and explain to people who are thousands of dollars a year better off under AWAs why she wants to destroy their living standards. Perhaps she could explain to the many tens of thousandsMr Swan- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. It was about nurses and firefighters.",27

45,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the Deputy Prime Minister inform the House how coalition policies are driving employment growth in regional areas and, in particular, how are they driving growth in my electorate of Maranoa? Mr Crean interjecting",27
46,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am pleased that the member for Hotham is looking forward to it. I thank the member for Maranoa for his question. He would be aware that since the coalition government has been in office unemployment in the electorate of Maranoa has fallen from 6.3 per cent to 3.4 per cent. It is actually lower than the national average of 4.2 per cent, so in the electorate of Maranoa they are leading the way. It is as a result of coalition government policies that that has indeed taken place. The overall national level of unemployment at 4.2 per cent is a 33-year low within the Australian economy and something that should be celebrated by all Australians, particularly all those Australians that have got jobs now who did not have them back then. They are the people that have been forgotten by the President of the ACTU, Sharan Burrow, in trying to conceal these fantastic statistics about the Australian economy. On Sunday I was in the electorate of Maranoa with the member when we announced one of the projects that will continue to strengthen and grow employment opportunities in central-western Queensland. We were at Longreach at the airport where the Qantas Founders Museum has just taken delivery of the 707 that is an historic aircraft in Austraployment lian aviation history. At the same time we announced a grant of $6.6 million to the Longreach Shire Council for the upgrade of the airport so that tourism can be further veloped off the back of great opportunities like the Qantas Founders Museum-the Longreach Shire Council that today still exists but which Premier Beattie wants to do away with. We will continue to support local government in Queensland as they make their way forward, developing job-creating opportunities in the future, even if the Queensland Labor government wants to make them extinct. I give full credit to the Mayor of Longreach, Pat Tanks, for the way he is leading his council in the fight against forced amalgamations in Queensland and we will continue to support them. That is just one of the ways we have been trying to assist the development of employment opportunities in regional Australia, in supporting programs like the Sustainable Regions Program. We believe we can continue to drive unemployment down in Australia. We believe we can continue to put the downward pressure on unemployment to find more jobs and make a more flexible labour market. We know there is one side of politics that does not believe that. I was interested to read a transcript of the Leader of the Opposition on the John Laws program on 26 April. Mind you, it was a transcript that is not available on his website; we had to go looking a little bit further-it has been airbrushed off the website. He was talking about unemployment levels and the fact that if Chinese demand slowed he said it would lead to more normal levels of economic activity. He went on to say, ‘And if that happens you start to return to more normal levels of economic activity, more normal levels of employment and unemployment-well, normal in the sense that it will be higher levels of unemand lower levels of employment.' This is the Leader of the Opposition on air with John Laws talking about what he thinks are more normal levels of unemployment de- and more normal levels of employment. Now we know that the Australian Labor Party led by the member for Griffith believes that more normal levels of unemployment are probably going to go back up to 11 per cent where they used to be. Is that their description of more normal levels of unemployment? It is not ours. We want to normalise levels of unemployment at 4.2 per cent or lower. That is what the coalition government believes in. We do not believe in seeing unemployment going higher; we want to continue to work in the Australian economy to force unemployment down. We know that the Leader of the Opposition is comfortable and happy to see unemployment normalised at a higher level. Capital Gains Tax",27
47,Mr WINDSOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer and relates to the government's statement last Friday on compensation for those who have given up groundwater entitlements for the public good in the six valleys across New South Wales. Could the minister clarify the contradictory announcements, one from the minister and the other from the member for Gwydir, in terms of the triggering of a capital gains event and how capital gains taxation will apply to the compensation payments both pre and post the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions?",28
48,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Firstly, I begin by thanking the member for New England but saying how disappointed I am that he has been playing political games on this issue. This is an issue of great importance to those Australians, those farmers, who are affected by take the opportunity to thank the member for Gwydir for the assistance that he has provided to those farmers and the direction that he has offered to the government. There was no contradictory statement issued last week. What there was was a clever, tricky political situation conjured up by the honourable member. Mr Crean interjecting",29
49,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is an unfortunate development because,29
50,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Hotham is warned!,29
51,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"the government have offered considerable assistance to these farmers who are in need and we have been working with the irrigators to make sure that we provide for an equitable outcome. Capital gains tax does not apply to an asset such as a statutory licence where the licence was issued before 20 September 1985. Even where a pre-CGT licence is replaced by another statutory licence, that replacement licence is not subject to CGT when it is eventually disposed of. In the case of the Namoi Valley irrigators, many groundwater licence holders have received replacement licences. Where the licence holder receives cash as well, the cash is not subject to CGT because it relates to the disposal of a pre-CGT licence. The result of my announcement of 8 June 2007 is that the acquisition date of the original licence is rolled over to the replacement licence and so any gain on the replacement licence will be disregarded. Coming to licence holders who acquired their original licence after the CGT date in 1985, a rollover occurs when they are provided with a replacement groundwater licence. This means that the disposal of the original licence is disregarded for CGT purposes and it is only when the replacement licence is disposed of that CGT may be payit. I able. Importantly, the CGT rules apply by taking the acquisition date and the cost of the original licence into account when the replacement licence is disposed of. If cash is also offered to the licence holder in conjunction with the replacement licence, the announcement I made on 8 June 2007 indicates the replacement of the original licence with the new licence will still be eligible for rollover. The cash, however, will be subject to CGT in the year it is offered. The amount of the cash capital gain is determined after prorating the cash to the value of the replacement licence. The cash capital gain may be eligible for the CGT 50 per cent discount provided the original licence had been held for at least 12 months prior to its replacement. This is a technical issue. The member asked for a technical response. I am happy to provide him with any further response that he may require. But I do say to all those irrigators who are nervous about the loss of their water rights that they can be assured that the Howard government are providing them with assistance. We offered $25 million more to those farmers. People should not be playing political games with these issues; they should be looking to the leadership being provided by the former Deputy Prime Minister, the member for Gwydir, who has brought very ably the interests of those irrihave gators to my attention and the attention of the Prime Minister and the cabinet. I can provide them with an assurance that we will continue to provide them with the best outcome possible.",29
52,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. What is the significance of the first ever Australia-Japan Foreign and Defence Ministerial Consultation? Is the minister aware of any policies that may pose a threat to this important bilateral relationship?,30
53,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question and for his interest. The defence minister and I were in Tokyo last week for two-plus-twoMr Tanner interjecting,30
54,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"that is, the foreign and defence ministers on both sides-talks with the Japanese government. This is a round of discussions which followed the conclusion of the Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation between Japan and Australia by our Prime Minister and Prime Minister Abe of Japan. That was signed in March. These are the only talks of this kind that Australia has with any country, with the exception of the United States and the United Kingdom. As far as Japan is concerned, it only has twoplus-two talks with the United States and Australia. It is an opportunity for us to work through with the leadership of Japan not only issues such as North Korea, counterterrorism and counterproliferation but also, and very importantly for Australia, the South Pacific and developments in South-East Asia. Fifty years ago, Black Jack MCEwen, the leader of the then Country Party, now the National Party, negotiated the historic commerce agreement. Fifty years later Prime Minister Howard and Prime Minister Abe concluded a security cooperation declaration demonstrating a substantial step forward, yet again, in one of the most important of all bilateral relationships. It does demonstrate a point that we have made in all our years in government, and that is that one of Japan the keys to Australian diplomacy in promoting our national interest-that is what we do on this side of the House-is to build strong bilateral relationships with key countries: the United States, Indonesia, China, Japan and India. That is, if I may say so, one of the core strategies of an Australian foreign policy. The honourable member asks whether this approach is threatened in any way. The opposition's approach is somewhat different. I noted in the Australian Financial Review this weekend an interview by Geoffrey Barker with the member for Barton about foreign policy. I wondered at first why the member for Barton would be interviewed but I discovered on reading the article that he is the spokesman for foreign affairs. The member for Barton said that he would take a completely different approach. He said he opposed the coalition's embrace of predominantly bilateral foreign relations in favour of a shift to what he described as a ‘liberal multilateralist agenda'. All of these great things that we have been doing bilaterally with the key countries in the region apparentlyMr Tanner interjecting",30
55,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Melbourne is warned!,30
56,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"are of little importance compared to the so-called ‘liberal multilateralist agenda'. The opposition wants to downgrade the American alliance-apparently these key bilateral relationships are not so important anymore-and instead wants to play some sort of parlour game with a hotchpotch of like-minded international activists. This kind of hazy lazy commitment to liberal multilateralism is of course very popular with the Labor Party. But on this side of the House we are guided by a different principle; we are guided by the principle of promoting Australia's national interest. Actually, on side of the House we are on Australia's side; and on that side of the House you are liberal multilateralists, apparently. That is yet another reason why staying with the stability and certainty of the coalition government is the wise thing to do. Liberal Party",30
57,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that the Australian Public Service Commission's ministerial conversations event held in the Great Hall on 12 August 2005, which featured the Prime Minister, cost taxpayers $60,000 for two hours, including venue hire? How much did the Liberal Party pay for the hire of Kirribilli House for a similar period from the $8,250 per head charged?",31
58,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I cannot confirm the cost of the Public Service Commission event to which the member refers without getting advice, but I will get that advice and I will be chamber. happy to provide it to him. In relation to the event at Kirribilli House, as I have indicated previously, all of the additional costs, which were in the order of $5,100, were paid by the Liberal Party.",31

61,Mr CAMERON THOMPSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister inform the House of how employees can be well represented in negotiations to improve their pay and conditions? Are there any alternative policies that would reduce this freedom?,31
62,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Blair for the question and note that, in 1996, the unemployment rate in Blair was 9.4 per this cent; today it is 5 per cent-nearly halved. That is a great outcome for the people of Blair. This government has enshrined in law the right of employees to be represented by a trade union, and of course during employment negotiations they can be represented by anyone that they want. Mr Melham interjecting",31
63,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Banks is warned.,31
64,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Importantly, we have also enshrined in law the right for someone to choose not to be a member of the union, so nobody can be bullied or forced into joining a union under our workplace relations laws. Ms Owens interjecting",31

67,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Gorton will remove himself understanding order 94(a). The member for Gorton then left the chamber.,31
68,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is a fundamental difference between the coalition and the Labor Party. It is enshrined in the Labor Party's industrial relations policy that every employer has to give a prospective employee an invitation to join the trade union movement when they apply for a job. That is Labor Party policy. It is written and enshrined in their policy that they issue an information statement to any new employee to give them an invitation to join the trade union movement. On the weekend, the Leader of the Opposition said that union bosses are just another voice. He declared on Sunday-it was classic Kev-that union bosses could ‘jump in the lake' if they had a problem with what he had to say. You can imagine Kevin Reynolds and Joe MCDonald shaking in their jackboots as Kevin Rudd says to them",31
69,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will refer to the Leader of the Opposition by his title.,32
70,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the Leader of the Opposition says, ‘I'm going to force you to jump in the lake if you don't agree with what I have to say.' They would be shaking in their boots. You would even have Joe MCDonald's braces pop up-‘No ticket, no start' and away they go. You would have thought that, at the same time as the Leader of the Opposition saying he was not going to be controlled by the union bosses, he would have stood up for one of his senators that was being knifed in the Senate. I picked up the Australian and the Age and they were a great read. In the Age Senator Linda Kirk, who has only been a Labor Senator for South Australia for a short period of time, said: The trade union vote is such that their own ... … … … If you don't have a good trade union base, it is impossible to get into a winnable position, even with branch supportin the Labor Party. Senator Kirk was disendorsed by the Labor Party because Joe de Bruyn did not like what she had to say. She says in the Australian today: Joe de Bruyn said that if I did not vote against the stem-cell legislation I could not expect support from the union for preselection. He singled me out ... I wasn't prepared to toe the union line. … … … Yes, I have lived by the union and died by the union. I went back to the Leader of the Opposition's interview on the Sunday program when he was asked about a shoppies union official, Mr Farrell, who was coming into replace Senator Kirk. He said: He's a very effective, very effective person who will actually bring a lot of experience and a lot of balance also into the ranks of the Parliamentary Labor Party ... Balance! Another union official coming into the Labor Party in the Senate to deliver balance! I thought to myself, ‘Hang on, how many senators from South Australia representing the Labor Party are former trade union officials?' Sixty per cent. This takes it up to 80 per cent. If that is balance in the way the Leader of the Opposition says he wants balance, there is no room for any dissenting voice from the trade union bosses when it comes to Labor Party preselection. We should not forget, and the Australian people will not forget. Every member of the parliamentary Labor Party is a member of the trade union movement and now they are getting rid of people of conscience and replacing them with more union bosses so that they they can get up can toe the union line. Liberal Party",32
71,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I again refer to the Liberal Party function at Kirribilli House-which included fine wine, oysters and prawns-overlooking the magnificent Sydney Harbour. Can the Prime Minister guarantee today that the total bill of $5,100 charged to the Liberal Party from the $8,250 charged per head covers the costs of all catering, alcohol, food, security, insurance, cleaning and the hire of the venue-as is required for community organisations which hire rooms in this Parliament House?",32
72,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can confirm that the figure I have given-and the precise figure is $5,186.78-includes all of the additional costs of the function. The food and beverage served at the function was purchased separately for the function; existing stock was used. There was an audiovisual cost for the function, and this was billed directly to the Liberal Party. The situation is that all of additional costsMrs Irwin interjecting",33

74,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Fowler is warned!,33
75,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Obviously any additional staff required are included in the cost, and that is a figure of $829.57. Clearly the existing staff would have been on duty and paid anyway, so that is not part of it. I know that the Labor Party find the amount involved rather low, but perhaps their lifestyle is a little more extravagant than mine. Macular Degeneration",33
76,Mr FAWCETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister advise the House of the government's decision to list Lucentis on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme? How will this listing help people at risk of going blind from macular degeneration?,33
77,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. I appreciate just how concerned he is about this issue and I am grateful for the representations he has made to me on this topic. Macular degeneration is the principal cause of blindness in this country. It affects about 130,000 Australians and every year about 17,000 new patients are diagnosed with what is called wet agerelated macular degeneration. But now there is hope for these people. A new drug, Lucentis, can arrest and, in some cases, even reverse the progress of this disease in about 80 per cent of patients. Last week the government announced that Lucentis would be listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme from 1 August. This will cost $630 not million over the forward estimates period, but it is worth it because it enables these people to continue to lead fully active lives the and to remain fully involved members of the community-people like Bill Milton, of Two Wells in the electorate of Wakefield, who has already explained to his local member just how beneficial this drug has been to him. Of course, being an outstanding local member, the member for Wakefield has passed that on to me. I would like to thank the officials of the Therapeutic Goods Administration and of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee for the expeditious way in which this matter has been handled. But I do say to everyone who has welcomed this listing that the government can only afford to put new drugs like this on the PBS because we have a strong economy. The listing of drugs like Lucentis is the social dividend of a strong economy. I say this in conclusion: if you cannot trust people to run the economy, you certainly cannot trust them to run a health system either. Liberal Party",33
78,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that attendees at the Liberal Party fundraising drinks function at Kirribilli House on Friday, 1 June 2007 were met by people wearing badges from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet?

81,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am informed that the people attending the function-it was not a Liberal Party fundraising function-were met by members of my staff wearing a badge with ‘Prime Minister's staff' on the badge. Disability Services,34
82,Mrs GASH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Would the minister update the House on the progress of the negotiations with the states and territories on a new disability agreement? Minister, how important is this agreement to Australia and to the people in Gilmore?",34
83,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Gilmore for her particular interest in this subject. She has previously had members of Anglicare try to establish a specific facility in Nowra. Through her, I thank them for the efforts they have made. She, along with most members of this House, would probably be aware that the current disability agreement between the Commonwealth, the states and the territories expires on 30 June-just on three weeks from today. She would be interested to know that the Commonwealth currently spends about $12.8 billion every year on disability services. That includes the ability support pension and other payments, support to carers through the carer allowance and carer payment, respite, and also through specific initiatives such as for the younger people in nursing homes, trying to get young people out of inappropriate care-that is, aged-care facilities-and putting them into places where they can have a better quality of life. I had a normal meeting with all of the other ministerial colleagues in Brisbane on 3 April. At that meeting I confirmed that the Commonwealth was very keen to enter into another Commonwealth state disability agreement for another five-year period. We offered the same amount, plus $400 million worth of indexation at that time. There were four parameters that we put around that new agreement. They were ensuring (1) that Indigenous Australians had access to disability services, (2) that the unmet need for supported accommodation was acknowledged and that there was a plan going forward to address it, (3) that we would have external validation of services-and I ask the House: would anyone realistically accept today, in aged care or child care, there not being external validation of those services? Yet today most state run supported accommodation for our most vulnerable in society does not have any form of external validation and we in the Commonwealth believe that that is an absolute necessity. And (4) we also require real transparency and real accountability by the states. Having put that offer on the table on 3 April I then made a separate offer, which the cabinet had authorised me to take forward, and that was that each state and territory collectively or individually come forward to the Commonwealth with a plan to meet the unmet need for supported quality accommodation places and that the Commonwealth diswould match it dollar for dollar. In other words, every dollar the state puts in the Commonwealth will match dollar for dollar. What happened at that meeting was quite disgraceful. All Labor state and territory ministers briefly stopped the meeting, adjourned outside, caucused, came back in, read from a written statement and declared the meeting closed without further discussion. I subsequently wrote to state and territory ministers again outlining the Commonwealth's generous offer of a dollar for dollar proposal to meet unmet needs. I gave them until 8 June. On 7 June I received a complete offer from the ACT, and I thank them for that. The Commonwealth is now considering that offer. I then received a letter, jointly signed by all other state and territory ministers, giving a commitment that they would consider it by 30 June and that they expect to be able to provide details of their capacity to respond. That is the most bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo, gobbledygook, you will ever get. There was no commitment of one dollar, no commitment of one place for additional supported accommodation for our most vulnerable in society. That is simply not good enough. If you think that this is just the Commonwealth government, let me read to you from a letter I received on 22 January from Minister Della Bosca, then representing all state and territory disability ministers. He states: We are asking the Commonwealth to match our investment in Australian families. We are of the view that a multi-lateral, matched funding strategy similar to that of the Young People in dential Aged Care and Older Carers Respite initiatives will make a real difference. That is exactly what the Commonwealth put on the table, and as of today not one state and only one territory-the ACT-has responded. This is not good enough for the disabled, who are the most vulnerable in our society. The Howard government will stand by these people. We ask those opposite to call on their state colleagues to start doing something positive about meeting the unmet needs of our disabilities groups in Australia. Liberal Party",34
84,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is again to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that the price charged for the Liberal Party fundraising function at Kirribilli is based on the same pricing principles that apply to community groups hiring the Great Hall here in Parliament House? Will the Prime Minister now table the full costings billed to the Liberal Party for the 1 June fundraiser at Kirribilli?,35
85,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was not a fundraiser-and you know that. Let me very simply tell you why: the amount of up to $8,000 was a fee charged to business observers for attending the federal council of the Liberal Party, which I am told is approximately the same as the top charge made for the Labor Party federal conference.",35

Will the minister inform the House of the findings of the latest Sensis small business survey? What does this survey show about the support for the government's workplace relations reforms?

FRAN BAILEY-I thank the member for Braddon for his question and for his very strong support for the 10,500 small businesses that he has in his electorate. Those small businesses understand and appreciate the value that the Howard government has delivered-a strong economy, low interest rates and a flexible workplace. That has been reflected in the latest Sensis business index, which has small business increasing their support for the Howard government by 14 per cent. That is the second highest level ever. The only level that was ever higher was when the Howard government was elected. It is no wonder that small business appreciate this. In fact, they nominated that it has been stable economic management that they have most appreciated. Obviously the opposition is not interested at all in small business.",36

93,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Lyons is warned! FRAN BAILEY-Not only did this survey indicate the very strong level of support for the Howard government-which of course has led to increased confidence by small business people to employ more people, enabling them to grow their businesses and give jobs to more people-but also it indicated a very real concern by small business about the Rudd alternative, which they know is simply doing the union bidding. They are right in their concerns. They know that the Rudd alternative",36

95,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will refer to the Leader of the Opposition by his title. FRAN BAILEY-Small business is very concerned not just about the Leader of the Opposition but about the entire policy of the opposition because it knows that every single one of those sitting opposite will do the bidding of the unions before they will ever consider the needs and aspirations of small business people. Small business understands that the opposition's alternative is to reinstate unfair dismissal and to get rid of AWAs. Small business does not want the clock wound back to the 1970s alternative. It understands that the Howard government has delivered and will continue to deliver in future.,36

97,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"On 23 May this year the member for MCMillan asked me a question about external water features in the grounds of Parliament House. The external water features were turned off as one of the measures to meet stage 3 water restrictions which were applied in December 2006 and required a reduction of 35 per cent in total water use at Parliament House. While water restrictions beyond stage 1 remain in force in the ACT, the water features should not be operated. At this stage the ACT water authority is giving consideration to moving from stage 3 to stage 4 water restrictions in July. Stage 4 water restrictions would be likely to continue for some time unless there is very good winter and spring rain this year. The water authority has indicated that combined storage levels in the ACT's dams of about 50 per cent would be necessary before water restrictions could be reduced to stage 1. Combined storage levels are now at 31 per cent. Parliament House: Energy Use",36
98,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"During the last sittings the member for Calare asked questions about energy use at Parliament House. I can advise the member for Calare that the Department of Parliamentary Services now buys 25 per cent green energy for Parliament House, of which 15 per cent is hydro power and 10 per cent is from renewable resources, such as solar and wind. Since Parliament House was opened, energy consumption has been reduced significantly. Current figures are that electricity consumption has been reduced by around 40 per cent and gas consumption by around 73 per cent. The Department of Parliamentary Services is currently developing an energy strategy that will focus on new ways of reducing energy consumption in Parliament House, but I expect that it will also consider the options increasing the proportion of energy derived from renewable resources. Questions in Writing",37
99,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"3.33 pm)Mr Speaker, I have a question to you understanding order 105(b). On 14 June 2005, two days short of two years ago, I asked the Prime Minister question No. 1673 on notice seeking to know how many National Water Initiative projects had been approved at that time. Could you write to the Prime Minister seeking reasons for the delay in answering this question? Could you also write to the relevant ministers seeking reasons for the delay in answering the 37 questions which I asked nine months ago on 12 September 2006 and the 171 questions which I asked on 14 September 2006, which remain unanswered? It may suit the convenience of the House if I provide details of these questions to the clerks rather than identify each of them now.",37

101,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I have two short questions to you. I would ask you to reflect on your last ruling. If it is in order, on both sides of the House, to refer to the Howard government, how can it be wrong to refer to the Rudd alternative, or the Rudd opposition? I also ask: where is the stormwater from Parliament House stored? I have a number of schools in my electorate that now have underground storage tanks taking the stormwater and watering their gardens and ovals. Has this been considered here?",37

I will follow up the second question he asked and get him a response. Question Time",37
103,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I have a question to you. For many years it has been customary for government members, when asking questions, to ask ministers whether there are any alternative policies, or words to that effect. I think that occurred on at least three occasions today. It has also been common when that has not been appended to a question that Speakers have ruled out of order any attempt by ministers to stray into commentary about opposition policies. Today the Acting Leader of the Opposition asked the Prime Minister a question about the government's policies and actions with respect to Work Choices. He did not respond to the detail of the question about the government but in fact responded with criticism of the opposition's policies. Several points of order were taken by opposition members and you ruled that the Prime Minister was in order. My question on this matter is whether it is no longer necessary for government members to append to their questions to ministers whether there are alternative policies-if they wish the ministers to comment on opposition policies-or whether in fact the position is that there is one rule for government members and another rule for opposition members.",37
104,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I would say to the member for Melbourne in response to the first part of his question that, as he said, for some years now, going back quite a while, questions have sometimes included the final line ‘are there any alternatives' or words to that effect. In relation to the second part of his question, the interpretation of standing order 104, in my view, has not altered. I refer him to House of Representatives Practice, which makes it quite clear what successive Speakers have ruled on the question of what is relevant. On the last point, that was rather offensive and the member for Melbourne should be careful if he starts to chair. AUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORTS Report No. 42 of 2006-07",38

109,Mr CREAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"On indulgence, Mr Speaker, before I commence could I join with others in congratulating the Clerk of the House, Ian Harris, on what is a well-deserved honour. He has been a wonderful servant of this place, and I have had the opportunity over the 17 years that I have been in it to avail myself of his assistance. So, well done, Ian, and congratulations. Today we got another reminder of how abysmally this government has failed the nation in terms of Broadband Connect-the front of the Sydney Morning Herald: ‘Australia left for dead, says net guru'. It is other wake-up call about the need to deliver real broadband to all Australians regardless of where they live, not just those tal cities, as you would well appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams. It is another indication of the government's policy failure, another example of the squandered opportunity to invest in this nation's prosperity-a government awash with money in what is arguably one of the longest resources booms in our history and it still cannot connect the whole of the nation in terms of vital access to this infrastructure. In the Sydney Morning Herald article, Professor Larry Smarr, the Director of the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology, says that Australia's internet infrastructure has not kept with international standards and that, if this is allowed to continue, we will be ‘left out' of existing and emerging business opportunities. It does not matter what grading of Australia against international standards you look at, in terms of broadband Australia is well down the list, with slow connections across all parts of Australia, even in centres within major cities, restricting businessesrestricting not only economic connectivity but social connectivity as well. This is a problem that, as bad as it is for the nation, is even worse when it comes to regional communities. Hundreds of thousands of people in businesses in those areas are still waiting to be connected-to step over the digital divide and join the 21st century. The benefit of connecting our regions is monumental for this nation. High-speed broadband is the great enabler for this country, enabling in terms of infrastructure not only for economy purposes but also for social and community purposes. It is what will connect this nation to the information superan- highway. Put simply, those regions that have access to fast-speed broadband over the internet are the ones that go ahead; those that in the capi- do not have it fall behind. We did not need the good professor today to tell us of this problem because indeed last year the Australian Local Government Association presented its latest State of the regions report, which showed the cost to this nation of failing to connect our regions. In 2006 alone, just one year, the cost of that failure to this country was $2.7 billion in forgone gross domestic product and almost 30,000 regional jobs. Regions such as Wide Bay stand to benefit from an estimated $78 million in additional revenue and 1,000 jobs. Another example is the Mackay regionover $100 million and 1,000 jobs. Gippsland up in my home state of Victoria is missing out to the tune of $170 million and 1,500 jobs. In fact, I have a table which I am prepared to present to the House which indicates the costs, broken down, throughout the whole of the country, and I seek leave to table that, Mr Deputy Speaker. Mr MCGauran-No. I haven't seen it. I don't know",39

114,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member for Hotham has the call.,40
115,Mr CREAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I think the contempt that the Deputy Leader of the National Party is showing his constituency on this very important issue is an indication as to why the regions are not connected. They are not connected because this government does not care about them. That cost, $2.7 billion-that is 30,000 jobs-is the cost for one year alone. Just imagine how much the regions have been missing out since this government has been in office! It is not, as I said, just about how businesses can take the opportunity. Just think about it: why would businesses set up in the regions if they cannot get the same speed of access to the internet as you get in the capital cities? Where is the encouragement to decentralise? Where is the encouragement to home based industries? Where is the ability for people looking for markets to access this information readily? Where is its ability to make the tenders and make the offers? That is what the regions are missing out on. But it is not just businesses. Think about it in terms of educational opportunity for young kids growing up in the regions. If they cannot get the same access to the internet as their contemporaries in the capital cities, just imagine what they are missing out on in terms of their learning opportunities. And what about entertainment, the cultural dimension, for people who make the choice to live, grow up and develop in regional communities? They cannot get the same entertainment. And what about the cultural connectivity? This is why this is such a fundamental investment that needs to be made. I note that Professor Smarr said in the article today that it was encouraging that this debate was being had in this country today. The only reason we are having the debate in this country today is that Labor has put out a plan to connect the nation-a plan that is costed, a plan that is funded, a $4.7 billion plan that will enable the rollout of a new fibre-to-the-node network across the whole of the country. It will connect, through fibre to the node, 98 per cent of Australians to high speed broadband services at a minimum speed of 12 megabits per second, a speed almost 40 times faster than most current speeds. The remaining two per centMr Ciobo-That's it!",40
116,Mr CREAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No, it is not. That is not it, and this is where the leader of the National Party has misrepresented our position: 98 per cent is all that can be done on known technology today, fibre to the node. We have committed to ensure that the other two per cent get the equivalent access through alternative technologies, and we have funded and built that into our program. The Leader of the National Party said the other day that 400,000 Australians will miss out-that is the two per cent. He has not even bothered to read the policy. But then he goes on to assert that even the 98 per cent fibre-to-the-node connection cannot be made. Well, he is wrong on that count too, because Telstra itself has said it is capable of connecting 98 per cent with fibre to the node. What it is not prepared to do, though, is what this government leaves it to do, and that is make the investment where there is market failure. The simple fact remains that, if it is left Telstra or the G9 group, they will only connect where it is economic to do so. That is the capital cities. The regions will be left behind. That is what is called market failure. That has always been the case in this country. It always will be, in my view, because of the vastness of our size and the dispersal of the population. There is market failure when it comes to telecommunications, and that is why you need a government in there in partnership with the private providers, connecting the nation-the whole of the nation: all of the regions, not just the capital cities. We have heard in this House that the government say they can do it without any public expenditure. That is what we have heard the smug Treasurer say: that their proposal to connect fibre to the node will be done without any public expenditure. But what then, I ask, has been the need for the $4 billion in public expenditure that this government has put into programs since it came to office-$4 billion ostensibly to connect the nation? They have criticised us for our $4.7 billion plan, essentially implying that you do not need any public money, when in fact they have spent $4 billion since they came to office but have failed to connect the regions at all. It has been a complete waste of money. We know they have had the money, of course, because they have sold Telstra. In fact, the only telecommunications plan the government have had has been to sell Telstra, not to connect the nation. But the simple fact remains that from all of those proceeds they have failed dismally to connect the nation. They have gone about from election to election offering more suggestions, more pork barrels, but they have not connected the nation. Professor Smarr has also said that we need a fibre network because the copper network is not fast enough. We agree. But that is what to our commitment is. We are the only party with a commitment to forge the partnership that will offer that fibre network, a network which can be continually upgraded so that the investment we make today can be built on for the future. The $4.7 billion that Labor have committed to is funded from existing government investments in telecommunications, including the $2 billion Communications Fund and through the Future Fund's 17 per cent share in Telstra, which will earn dividends and be sold down to normal levels after November 2008. I ask the House: why should the proceeds of the further sale of Telstra simply be used to go to pay off the superannuation liabilities of Commonwealth public servants? Why shouldn't there be a preparedness to use the nation's earnings on its investment to reinvest in the national interest, for all Australians? In essence, what Labor are proposing to do is to use the proceeds from the nation's past investment to reinvest in the nation's future. That is a smart way to do things. It is the Labor way to do things. It is not the way this government is going. In essence, Labor will do more with the remaining 17 per cent share of Telstra to connect the nation than the government has done by flogging off the other 83 per cent. The government's sale of Telstra has been a disgrace in terms of reinvestment back into much-needed telecommunications infrastructure in this country. They talk about the need to have a community service obligation when it comes to standard telephone services, but why not a commitment to guarantee standard access to fast broadband over the internet? They will not do it. Only Labor is prepared to make that commitment. Only Labor is prepared to address the market failure. As usual, we see the government panicking. They know that Labor's initiative has real traction. They are now trying to pretend that they really are committed to connecting the nation, but not so long ago the minister was saying, ‘No-one is complaining about broadband speeds in metropolitan Australia.' I do not know who she has been listening to; there are parts of my electorate that still not get broadband, and I know that other seats that we represent do not get it. Ms Kate Ellis interjecting",40
117,Mr CREAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Altona, of course. These are all areas in metropolitan Australia that, like regional Australia, are missing out because of the government's flawed approach. The government have no plans and no costings. They have made no commitment to roll out 12 megabits per second. Labor is the only party to have made such a commitment. On the one hand, we have the Treasurer saying that no public money needs to be committed and, on the other hand, we have other ministers telling us how they are going to find additional funds to meet regional Australia's needs. Why would we believe them now? They have been making these claims for the past 11 years and they have failed to deliver. This country needs a party that is committed to addressing the market failure and committed to ensuring that the whole of Australia is connected and that the regions are not left behind. The only party with such a plan is the Labor Party, and the sooner we have an election to give us the opportunity to implement it, the better off this country will be.",42
118,Mr MCGAURAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Gippsland-Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (3.54 pm)-The government welcome this debate on broadband and we are delighted that the opposition-although late to the discussion-has been prepared to list it as a matter of public importance. I am a little surprised, though, that there has not been the traditional focus or attention placed on the matter of public importance during question time. Invariably, the practice is that questions are asked of the Prime Minister or relevant ministers in the lead-up to a matter of public importance immediately following question do time-building expectation, creating a sense of drama and setting the scene. But there was not a single question to the government today about broadband. This issue is of such biting importance to the Labor Party that they did not ask a single question about it. I stand to be corrected, but it has been many weeks, if not months-I will go through the Hansard records-since a question was asked in this House by the Labor Party on the broadband issue. This is very much a filler. The Leader of the Opposition is not here at this moment; consequently someone has to take up the matter of public importance, and it has fallen on the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Hotham. The government have been rolling out broadband policies and programs since 2002, and it was only a few months ago that the Leader of the Opposition launched a new program which, if you look carefully, is a rehashed Beazley-the member for Brandpolicy of about four years ago. There is very little to distinguish it from the earlier version. But no matter; we welcome the Labor Party's interest. This is an issue of critical concern to all Australians-wherever they live-in economic, social and cultural terms. It goes to the heart of our international competitiveness. That is why the government have invested so much time and so much money into bringing Australia up to a high world standard. We know that a great deal more needs to be done, and there will be announcements before very much longer. In fact, I even chance my arm to say that it is likely that the government will have another major announcement before the week is out, as we further develop broadband policy and invest heavily in it. The member for Hotham was at pains to stress the Labor Party's credentials on broadband with its recently released policy. The problem is that the policy ignores regional Australia-for two reasons. The first reason is that it abolishes the regional Communications Fund established by the government-$2 billion-to pay for a policy that is city-centric. There are many areas of Australia that miss out under the Labor Party's program. A number of regional centres, such as Ballarat, will not be serviced. Traralgon will not be serviced. Wollongong, Canberra, Townsville, Burnie, Geelong and Cairns will not be serviced, and the list goes on. The Labor Party's policy is for metropolitan centres or capital cities. To help fund its policy, the Labor Party will abolish the regional Communications Fund, which was established by the government to invest directly in regional areas. We believe that where there is market failure in non-metropolitan areas the taxpayer has a responsibility and will fund it. I noticed that the member for Hotham was critical about the roughly $4 billion that we have already invested in broadband. I think that is something that should be recorded for later reference. He is critical that we have already invested so heavily in regional and rural Australia. That is because there is market failure. That will always be government's responsibility, but we do not have to invest metropolitan Australia, because the private sector wants to. Both Telstra and the group of nine telecommunications companies have taken out full-page advertisements saying that they do not need government funding and that they will invest themselves. What they want is for the regulatory regime to be right-and that is what we have to concentrate on. I have heard of suckers before, but have not heard of a whole political party committing itself to spending $4.7 billion that the private sector has offered to spend. The second reason that Labor's policy ignores regional Australia is, of course, that the plan does not work. The plan does not make sense, even leaving aside the financial considerations, which are, firstly, that the private sector has offered to pay the money and, secondly, to help pay for the plan-which they do not have to pay for in the first place-they will abolish the $2 billion regional Communications Fund and, to top it up, take the remaining $2.7 billion from the Future Fund, which is a guaranteed payment for retirees and superannuants. So they will burden future generations for their immediate political purposes and concerns. Moreover, shockingly, the Labor Party's plan is hopelessly unambitious: firstly, because it does not reach so many Australians; secondly, we do not believe that the speeds the Labor Party has set are fast enough; and, moreover, it cannot be afforded. It is the laughing stock of the telecommunications industry. A significant number of independent commentators have said the plan as outlined by the Labor Party is unaffordable. The Labor Party says it will connect broadband for $4.7 billion, although you will need another $4 billion according to Senator Conroy, the shadow minister for communications, but that will come from the private sector. So, as I understand, it is a total plan, and it is very difficult to get some consistency in its explain nations of $9 billion. We know already that, according to the telecommunications provider PIPE Networks, it would cost at least $16 billion. Telstra has said that it could cost up to $30 billion. Telecommunications analyst Market Clarity has added that the Labor Party's cost estimates lack detail required to build any sort of realistic network cost model. It is just absurd that firstly the Labor I Party would be using $4.7 billion of Australian taxpayers' funds, stored in the regional Communications Fund and in the Future Fund, to contribute towards a $9 billion program that will not even begin to achieve its objectives. But not to worry: the private sector will pay for the capital cities and the government of the day should help to a greater extent to connect broadband to nonmetropolitan, regional and rural areas. The Labor Party is just being reckless. Our proposal is in stark contrast to that of Labor. Quite frankly, the Labor Party is being economically irresponsible in abolishing a regional Communications Fund and raiding the Future Fund. The Labor Party has no answer for the real issue here, which is the regulatory regime. The government has been in discussions with both Telstra and the group of nine about addressing this issue. Neither will the government dictate the type of technology that an investor has to put its money into because these are decisions best left to the marketplace. The Labor Party's proposal has no dialogue; it has no detail. The Labor Party's policy has been exposed as being very light, shallow and thin on detail. It has been discredited because it is uncosted, untested, unworkable and undeliverable. The industry and the public want more detail in regard to the Labor Party proposal. I issue an invitation to the member for Hotham to start providing detailed costings. How would this joint venture between the government's $4.7 billion and the private sector's $4 billion actually work? Moreover, when are we going to get the details? Before the election? I doubt it. In fact, I think it is safe to say now that we are not going to hear another word in regard to this policy in providing further details. I do not believe we are going to see a single question answered. When is the Labor Party going to provide some substance to its generalised assertions? It is simply a cop-out. Despite the regulatory issues being cited by Telstra as the reasons it is yet to invest in fibre, there are no details of Labor's regulatory regime or system. Labor is afraid to release any more details. In contrast, the Howard government is committed to providing all Australians with access to high-speed broadband, regardless of where they live. Look at the things we have done in remote Australia and anywhere a broadband service is not available. We have the $163 million Australian Broadband Guarantee program. That is a guarantee that Australians can access a broadband service with a $2,750 subsidy per household. Look at what the government is doing in rural and regional Australia with the $878 million Broadband Connect program, which assists the delivery of a new high-speed national wholesale broadband network. We also have e-health and online education services in regional areas with the $113 million Clever Networks program, which is harnessing smart solutions such as interactive distance education and real-time medical diagnosis, which can save lives. The community is already benefiting from the Howard government's policies on broadband. Under the coalition government, 4.3 million Australians have gained access to broadband services and the average price paid by consumers has dropped by 64 per cent since 2000. Today, 90 per cent of Australian premises can access speeds of between two megabytes per second and eight megabytes per second and more than 50 per cent of metropolitan areas can access even faster speeds through ADSL2+ and cable broadband platforms. We can do better, much better. We are going to do better. An announcement shortly will build on the government's already huge investment in infrastructure. The Labor Party needs to realise that you do not need to waste billions of dollars of taxpayers' funds for the telecommunications industry to invest in highly commercial areas like Sydney and Melbourne. There is critical mass. That is a commercial decision and investment that the telcos are happy to make-they have told us. Telstra and G9 are both prepared to roll out a fibre broadband network in the capital cities and major regional centres without a red cent from the taxpayer. They must have seen you coming with your $4.7 billion offer and thought, ‘All of our Christmases have come at once.' Both Telstra and the G9 have run full-page advertisements recently and both advertisements highlight the folly of Labor's broadband policy. For instance, Telstra's advertisement said this: Telstra needs no money from Canberra to build a world-leading broadband network. Then, in another swipe at Labor, the group of nine telecommunications companies advertisement said this: The group of nine plan does not require taxpayer funds. It will be independently financed. So why spend $4.7 billion on something the private sector will take up for themselves? It is total recklessness. Instead, the government has an integrated strategy that will provide all Australians with access to high-speed broadband-and especially taking into account where they live, because we do not discriminate between city and rural Australians. But you need a responsible and measured approach. If you try to do this on the run or do it on the back of a serviette, which the Labor Party's policy, most kindly, can be describedMr Baldwin-Or the back of a union ticket.",42
119,Mr MCGAURAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Or the back of the union ticket-that is an even smaller space to scribble your ramblings on telecommunications. Instead, you have got to have a broadband policy that is multidimensional and keeps ahead of the game in a sector such as telecommunications. The government's incentive programs, such as HiBIS and Broadband Connect, have resulted in over a million premises gaining access to terrestrial services and over 250,000 customers taking up these subsidised services. The programs have resulted in increasing competition amongst providers, and over 1,500 exchanges have been enabled for ADSL. The Labor Party's policy is a sham: it does not work, it lacks detail, it has been ridiculed by the industry as being technically deficient, and it is financially reckless. The government, on the other hand, has the building blocks in place. We have invested heavily for many years in rural and regional areas and we will continue to do so. We will enlist the private sector to the greatest extent possible and will shortly be making announcements that provide the way forward for broadband connections in this country.",45
120,Mr WINDSOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"On indulgence, Deputy Speaker Adams, on behalf of the Independent members of the House, I would like to congratulate Ian Harris on his recent nomination. I thought both the Prime Minister and the Acting Leader of the Opposition summed up well the contribution that Ian and his colleagues have made to the well-being of this chamber. I am very pleased that the member for Hotham has raised this matter of public importance, because I think it is an issue that needs to be brought before the public once again and particularly in relation to the debate that is going on at the moment with the G9 group, the Telstra arrangements-or disarrangements and disarray with the minister's office-and a whole range of other events that are happening out there, not the least of which is the changeover from CDMA to Next G and the broad policy issues that are being confronted there. You may remember, Deputy Speaker Adams, I asked the Prime Minister a number of questions in relation to the process last week, and I might, if time permits, speak briefly about that in a moment. The issue of broadband that is before the House is a very important and complex issue. It is definitely in my view the most important piece of infrastructure that this nation is going to embrace during the early part of this century. There has been a lot of talk about $3 billion going to a railway line in inland Australia. When you look at the maths of that particular railway line-and I do not disagree with the railway line-it is talking about three trains a day between Melbourne and Brisbane, or 0.6 trains per day you are talking about 8,000-tonne trains. But if you get back to a reasonable tonnage, the tonnage that is being explored through the Ernst and Young consultancy document on small trains, it would be about three trains a day. The government is quite prepared to spend $3 billion on that sort of infrastructure. I would suggest that infrastructure that negates distance as being a disadvantage for regional Australia, as well as our city cousins, is the most important piece of infrastructure that we can invest in in this decade and most probably decades to come. I agree with the member for Hotham when he said, ‘What is wrong,'-and I do not mean to verbal him‘with investing the proceeds of the sale of Telstra in that very important piece of infrastructure?' It would deliver equity of access, and hopefully pricing, to all Australians, including those Australians in Tasmania, Deputy Speaker Adams. The member for Hotham raised a couple of other issues as well, one being market failure. The minister, who has just spoken, also talked about market failure and the role of government in relation to that failure. I would like to give an example, if I could, of a small community on the Queensland border called Yetman. Yetman is a very progressive small community. It does not have CDMA and broadband coverage to the extent that it would like. There have been a number of representations made to the minister and others and Telstra Country Wide and Telstra itself in relation to the people of Yetman and their facility. The Treasurer, when this general issue has been raised with him, retreats to the argument that competition will provide it. The minister says a similar thing, along lines that Telstra is a commercial operation and it will make commercial decisions. Where does market failure fit into these sorts of operations? The people of Yetman have been told by Telstra, and the government has not stepped into override this with any amount of money, that if they want equity of access to CDMA services-which are going to be in a short period of time superseded by Next G, and I presume it applies to Next G as welland if that community of some hundreds is prepared to find some land that is suitable for a tower, provide a road that would get to the tower, provide the tower which would be placed on that land and maintain that land as a community, Telstra Country Wide would have a look at putting an aerial or an antenna on top of the tower. I recently went to a public meeting in Yetman, and a similar situation has developed on Acacia Plateau. Acacia Plateau is in the eastern part of my electorate-again, near the Queensland border-where there is a beautiful site for a tower. But the market has failed because there are not enough users there to pay back the capital requirements for a tower in the three-year period that Telstra now says it requires in terms of its accounting procedures because it is a commercial entity. When I went to the public meeting, I did not see all the competitors competing to get this tower up. I saw one provider, who was suggesting to the community that they should do the work, which would reduce the capital costs. Therefore, at a certain figure they would look at putting up an aerial which would give them some return on investment. I did not see any government involvement. My concern about those two instances is about what happens with broadband in the future in terms of access to regional Australians. I do not have a problem with parts of the sale of Telstra-I was opposed to that sale to start with-and I do not have a problem with government investment in infrastructure into the future. Mr Ciobo interjecting",45
121,Mr WINDSOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It does not have to be sale proceeds; it can be government moneys, taxpayers' money. There is $2 billion in the Communications Fund. There were commitments given by the government on the sale of Telstra about equity of access. We would all remember Peter Corish, the President of the National Farmers Federation, when he made these comments. Barnaby Joyce, a senator from Queensland, said on those comments that there would be equity of access to broadband and basic telephone services. He said that the sale could go through and there would be future proofing for any new technology. Well, look at the shemozzle that is developing with the conversion from CDMA to Next G. Where is the future proofing in relation to the provision of that equity? On the changeover from CDMA to Next G-and I raised this with the Prime Minister last week-there is a term ‘equivalence of service' that is being bandied about. It is a bit like ‘up to scratch', which was bandied about previously in relation to the sale. I asked the Prime Minister to define what ‘equivalence of service' means. I have since found that the definition of ‘equivalence of service' between the two networks, Next G and the old CDMA, will be determined by a truck driving around for eight days assessing the reception in various locations to see whether there is equivalence of service. You would be very interested to know, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, that that truck will not be going anywhere near Tasmania, but I am told it will go to New England. Presumably they will draw some analogy from New England and transfer it to Tasmania to see whether Tasmanians have any equivalence of service. That truck will not be going to Western Australia or the Northern Territory either. You can imagine how far it will go in eight days in terms of equivalence of service. I think most of us lived through the Keating induced arrangements for analog into CDMA. I know the government has made great sway of that over time, and I have too because I thought it was badly done. But we have to make sure that with these very important pieces of infrastructure, whether for the future technology of Next G or for broadband facilities across the nation, the government plays a role, because I think that with the CDMA-Next G changeover the government has very little power through the licensing arrangements to change the timetable, irrespective of any equivalence of service. So I would like the next speaker to explain, if he would, what he understands to be equivalence of service for country and city people. (Time expired)",47
122,Mr CIOBO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I feel a little as though I am the dark rain cloud that is going to rain on the ALP parade or, perhaps, the Labor Party picnic day, because we have heard from the opposition about their big, bold plan to roll out a national broadband fibre-to-the-node network across Australia. It almost harks back to the glorious days of the seventies and the eighties during the Cold War period, when they would have stood shoulder to shoulder with their communist and socialist friends from the Eastern bloc countries, with their great plans for nation building. That is what we have heard from the ALP. But I have to say that in this day and age it is perhaps a little understandable that they get a bit excited about being able to go back to the days when the Labor Party could stand up in front of the Australian people and say, ‘Comrades, we have a plan to build our nation.' As I said, I feel a bit like that dark rain cloud that is slowly coming across to rain on their parade. And the reason why their parade should be rained upon is that it is absolutely reeking of financial irresponsibility. Let us get to the central issue of the Labor Party proposal of fibre to the node for Australia. The central issue is this: the Australian Labor Party say they are going to invest $4.7 billion of Australian taxpayers' money to build a fibre-to-the-node network across Australia, and they are going to make up the $4.7 billion by smashing and grabbing $2.7 billion from the Future Fund, money that we have quarantined and set aside to pay off debt for superannuation liabilities owed to public servants, owed to the Defence Force-owed to hard working Australians who have toiled and have a right to know that their retirement will be funded. That is why we have set up the Future Fund. We have put some $150 billion in there, and the Labor Party now say they are going to smash it and grab from it to pay for this proposal. That is how they are going to pay for approximately half their plan. The other $2 billion is coming out of consolidated revenue, out of an expending program. The concern is that the $4.7 billion that the Australian Labor Party say they are going to waste Australian taxpayers' money on is happily going to be paid for by either Telstra or by the G9. It begs the question: why would you use Australian taxpayers' money to build something when you have the private sector willing to expend the money to build it, knowing that they are going to get a commercial return? It beggars belief. Only about 20 minutes ago, the member for Hotham conceded that Telstra or the G9, irrespective of which is successful, would be providing a commercial opportunity. The opportunity would go along these lines: they would build fibre-to-the-node networks in the capital cities and, most probably, in my city on the Gold Coast as well as other regional centres, and I would hazard a guess that would include, for example, Wollongong and Newcastle, larger urban regional centres. They are prepared to build these networks at no cost to Australian taxpayers with a commercial return for those providers. The concept is really quite simple and it is a concept which this coalition government is putting forward. The proposal is: great, let the private sector go ahead and build the commercial networks where it is commercial for them to do so, without using Australian taxpayers' money; using their own money to develop a commercial return on that money. Then, where it is uncommercial, we will use Australian taxpayers' money to make it a commercial case to continue investment. That is the proposal of this coalition government. We do not spend money where it is commercial to develop a return but we do expend money to make sure that those areas where it is uncommercial are serviced in exactly the same way as metropolitan markets. That is the proposal on this side of the House. It is logical, it is financially responsible and it makes sense. It stands in stark contrast to the rubbish that is the proposal of the Australian Labor Party, a proposal that would see the expenditure of $4.7 billion for no reason other than to be able to hark back to the great Soviet days. That seems to be the only rationale that the Australian Labor Party can come up with: the opportunity to have command and control of the Australian economy and say, ‘Comrades, look at what we have done and isn't it great!' The only ones that are excited about the Australian Labor Party proposal are the Australian Labor Party. There has been a flurry of emails between members of the Australian Labor Party and some of their contacts in the Soviet Union and in China saying: ‘Look at the great things we are building in Australia. Fly over and we will show you.' No doubt that is why they are all excited over there. But the fact is that the private sector does not share that excitement. We all know in the private sector and on this side of the House that it is a ridiculous and financially irresponsible plan that does not deserve the light of day. So what are people saying about the Labor Party plan? We know that the Independent member for New England, Tony Windsor, agrees with the member for Hotham-and I really have to question why on earth that would be. I guess he has very limited knowledge, as does the member for Hotham, on this issue, so I suspect that that is the reason why they would be agreed there. Let us have a look at what the private sector says about the Labor Party plan. ABN Amro-pretty well respected in the financial markets and one of the country's leading financial houses-declared that Labor's proposal would take industry ‘back 20 years to government provision, gold plating and restricted rollout' and that it failed to ‘resolve access regulation issues but entrenches them and adds new inefficiencies'. That was the ABN Amro report from 21 March this year. That is what ABN Amro said about the Labor Party proposal. I have no doubt that the Labor Party members were saying in response to that quote, ‘Well, of course it does.' The notion of government provision, gold plating, restricted rollout-these are all the things the Labor Party stands for. No wonder you are all scratching your heads and saying, ‘Of course it does.' You fail to see problem. But I think that most other people see the problem with this. Importantly as well, let us not lose sight of the fact that the Labor Party proposal is predicated upon an $8 billion rollout cost. Knowing the Australian Labor Party's form when it comes to major projects like this, we would really have to question whether that $8 billion cost that the Labor Party has put forward is likely to be the cost at the end of the day. We know that PIPE Networks, a network infrastructure specialist, released what it termed a ‘conservative estimate' of the cost of Labor's proposal. Their conservative estimate was that it would cost approximately $15 billion to $16 billion-not $8 billion as the Australian Labor Party says, but double that. That is how much an independent provider says the Labor Party proposal will cost on a conservative estimatedouble the Labor Party proposal. So you can already see the Australian Labor Party-they will be running around saying: ‘We need to raid the Future Fund again. We need to go and get more Australian taxpayers' money to put into our marvellous Soviet network. If we do not do that, we have got a chance that it will not roll out.' That is a major concern. It would not be $8 billion as the Labor Party proposes, but $16 billion on a conservative estimate, not by this government but by PIPE Networks, a specialist provider in the area. That is what they had to say about the Australian Labor Party proposal. A telco analyst Market Clarity also slammed Labor's costings as ‘insufficient' and said that their cost estimates lacked the details required to build ‘any sort of realistic network cost model'. So we get these backof-the-envelope calculations from the Australian Labor Party that it is going to cost $8 billion. We have already got a major infrastructure supplier saying that it will cost more than double that and we have Market the Clarity questioning the cost rationale and the cost formula that the Australian Labor Party are using. That is what Market Clarity is saying in the marketplace. ABN Amro criticises it as a ridiculous proposal and one that would take industry back 20 years. So what is very clear is that not only have you got Telstra willing to invest the money, not only is the G9 willing to invest the money; you have got ABN Amro saying, ‘Please, don't do it,' and you have got PIPE Networks saying that it would cost at least $16 billion-not $8 billion-and you have got Market Clarity questioning the cost basis for determining the $8 billion. All of this adds up in a very straightspeeds. forward way to show that the Australian Labor Party broadband dream is nothing but that: an illusory dream that does not deserve the light of day.",47
123,Mr WILKIE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As a past pig farmer, I have heard squeals like those coming from the members opposite before. They remind me of pigs waiting to go to market-squealing and whining but not understanding the fate that awaits them. In this case, what is coming up for this lot opposite is the next election. Because when it comes to the need for a fast broadband service they just do not understand what Australia needs. Australia deserves better. The importance of broadband to Australia's future economic prosperity cannot be overstated. The presence of a world-class broadband network is fast becoming the litmus test of a developed country's economy. We are engaged in a race where economic progress is now measured in megabits and gigabits of data; it is a race Australia is ing-a race in which we cannot afford to fall any further behind our global competitors. Broadband is the transport infrastructure of the knowledge economy. It will open new markets for Australian business and drive our future productivity growth as our population ages. Just as highways, rail lines, ports and energy grids were the foundations of Australia's economic prosperity in the last century, a world-class broadband network will be the foundation of Australia's prosperity in this century. The statistics on Australia's current broadband performance are damning. The OECD ranked Australia 17th out of 30 countries for the take-up of entry-level broadband, the World Economic Forum ranked Australia 25th in the world in terms of available internet bandwidth and the World Bank last year ranked Australia 23rd out of 30 OECD countries for relative broadband Most damning is the fact that Telstra estimates that it rejects more than 100,000 applications for a broadband connection each year. Mr Ainslee Arnott is a resident of Kewdale. He lives no more than five minutes from the city and he has no access to broadband. He has applied for broadband many times with several internet service providers, only to be told that he lives too far away from the Ascot exchange. However, the Kewdale exchange is only 900 metres from Mr Arnott's house. He told me at the broadband forum held in Belmont last month that not one single internet service provider is able to give him a straight answer as to why he cannot get access to broadband. My office continually receives similar complaints from constituents unhappy at being unable to obtain broadband access. Adil Safdar is an engineer from Rivervale. He says he feels like a ‘football being thrown around from here to there' trying to find anlosswers as to why he and other residents in his street are unable to get broadband access. Peter Bull is a business owner from East Cannington who, despite living a mere kilometre from the Perth CBD, cannot get broadband access. He has been told he has to wait at least 10 weeks for a broadband service. What, he says, should have been a painless process has turned into an ongoing saga of phone calls and misinformation. The inability of Australians to access high-speed broadband will have dire economic consequences now and into the future. This is particularly the case in education, as around the world broadband is revolutionising the way students learn. It is only Labor that has a plan for a national fibre-to-thenode broadband network, a plan that will drive an education revolution in Australia. By providing access to the world's finest museums, libraries and institutions, high speed broadband brings the very best of educational resources into universities, schools and homes. According to a detailed survey conducted in Britain, broadband is having a marked impact on children's education. Ninety-seven per cent of children in the study reported that they used broadband internet connections to help them with their homework, and 58 per cent believed that their schoolwork would suffer without it. In remote areas of regional Australia, improved broadband services will enable students and teachers to participate in virtual classrooms while being physically separated by hundreds or thousands of kilometres. Yet it is a sorry fact that, due to this government's neglect of broadband infrastructure, our students are unnecessarily suffering and falling behind. A number of Curtin University students living in my electorate of Swan have no access to broadband. This is simply an unacceptable state of affairs for students at any university, let alone one of Australia's premier learning institutions. Yet where is the government on this issue? The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Coonan, is content to fiddle while Rome burns. Thousands of Australian families are being left in the digital Dark Ages because this government cannot get the policies in place to deliver a world-class broadband network. Only Labor's policy will open the broadband bottleneck and deliver the vital investment in broadband infrastructure Australia desperately needs. Labor gets it. We know the importance of broadband for Australia's future. Labor's plan provides the needed infrastructure while the government is still living in the Dark Ages of the past. It is time for the Prime Minister to realise that the abacus is out, that slide rules were phased out years ago and that calculators are there but not quite. It is the computer that you need.

124,Mr TICEHURST,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Dobell) (4.35 pm)For many years the Central Coast has suffered as a rural area and we have had problems with telecommunications infrastructure. However, the Australian government's $878 million Broadband Connect and the $50 million Metro Broadband Connect have been assisting people on the Central Coast to get access to broadband. The recently announced $162.5 million Australian Broadband Guarantee builds on the success of these programs. It will fill remaining broadband black spots across Australia. Broadband is, of course, offering substantial benefits to local small businesses by helping to improve productivity, save money, provide greater flexibility for workers and allow businesses to better explore the benefits of having an online presence. It is also providing families with better and faster access to a range of services from news and entertainment to education and government services. That is why, as the federal member for Dobell, one of my priorities is to assist communities, small businesses and constituents in my electorate to gain access to these services. I have been lobbying for several years to sort out the problems with these black spots. We hear Labor talking about fibre to the node as though that is the only technology available. We saw what happened when Labor were in government and they picked winners. They dumped AMPS because they are only interested in capital cities. AMPS worked in rural areas and they adopted the GSM system, which is solely based on European technology. Once you got 32 kilometres from the cell you had no mobile phones. It was only with the advent of the CDMA, which was introduced by the Howard government, that rural constituents got access mobile phones. Now, of course, Telstra has come in with the Next G, which is a wideband CDMA network, and when it is rolled out correctly, when it has run its full distance, we will find that broadband will actually be available on the Next G network. In many areas around Australia you can access broadband now on your smart phone. I have invited Senator Helen Coonan, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, to come to my electorate on a number of occasions. Some years ago, we had a round-table to discuss these issues with the providers: Telstra Country Wide, Business Central Coast, Connect IT and then local internet providers Cirrus and Central Coast Internet. These are wireless providers who have been offering wireless broadband to residents for a number of years. The Australian government is committed to bringing broadband to the Central Coast and solving black spots. For the electorate of Dobell, the benefits of the guarantee have been increased up to $2,750 per connection. This is a five-fold increase on previous commitments from the federal government. Areas such as Bateau Bay, Wyoming, Warnervale, Wyong and Tuggerah will be able to receive this subsidy for connections to new services. Some parts of the electorate, including east of Cedar Brush Creek and of Central Mangrove, were eligible for subsidies under the Broadband Connect incentive scheme. Anyone on the Central Coast who is unable to gain a reasonable level of broadband service at their principal place of residence or small business will be able to receive a subsidised broadband. It is as simple as that. The guarantee will be very similar to the Australian government's popular and highly successful $878 million Broadband Connect to program and the guarantee will continue to give eligible consumers",51

126,Mr JULL,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I present the committee's report entitled Review of the relisting of Ansar al-Sunna, JeM, LeJ, EIJ, IAA, AAA and IMU as terrorist organisations. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",52
127,Mr JULL,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I present the report of the Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security on a review of the re-listing of seven terrorist organisations. The committee first considered the listing of these organisations in 2005. The inquiry was advertised in the Australian newspaper on 18 April 2007 and information regarding the inquiry was then placed on the committee's website. No submissions were received from the public. In the absence of submissions and, given that these are second re-listings of organisations which did not raise controversial issues, the committee resolved to assess the merits of the re-listings on the papers without holding a hearing. The seven organisations covered by this review are diverse in their geographical location, ranging from the EIJ, which began in Egypt, to organisations that began in the Yemen, Lebanon, Pakistan, Iraq and Uzbekistan. The EIJ, members of which have been dispersed from Egypt, became central to the development al-Qaeda through the role of Ayman al-Zawahiri. To some extent its existence is not easily separable from that of alQaeda. As the report notes-quoting the US state department-there have been: ... no activities in Egypt after 1993 and no national acts after the disrupted attack in 1998. However, Janes believes that the EIJ leader-al-Zawahiri-‘remains a potent symbol of resistance for thousands of sympathisers across the world' and that ‘numerous cells remain at large'. Ansar al-Sunna is active in Iraq as part of the insurgency there. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Jaish-e-Mohammad are both part of the dispute over the IAK, or Indian administered Kashmir. Jaish-eMohammad is described as active, well resourced, well trained and motivated. Many of the regional organisations are, despite splintering and disagreements, connected. Asbat al-Ansar operates in southern Lebanon but has begun to support the insurgency in Iraq. The Islamic Army of Aden seeks the overthrow of the local government and the establishment of an Islamic state, and the release of prisoners from Yemeni jails. However, the statement of reason attributes little activity to it in recent times and, in 2003, its leader cooperated with authorities and received a presidential pardon. Nevertheless, many of these organisations with their separate objectives appear to have developed links. The committee concluded: ... all of these organisations have been localised groups growing out of specific grievances or particular conflicts. For most, it has been the advent of the war on terrorism that has extended their reach and their objectives – to the establishment of a regional caliphate, to providing fighters into other fields of battle, to cross funding through the al-Qa'ida network. Individual conflicts are now seen as part of a larger conflict and they appear to feed on and re-enforce each other, bringing experience and skill learned in one place to other disputes. And, with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the focus has broadened from opposition to local ‘apostate' governments to a larger enemy in the West. The committee concluded that, if this is the case, proscription could play only a limited interrole and that other approaches, such as the settlement of long standing disputes, might more effectively undermine support for the violence that has become part of these disputes. Nevertheless, each organisation met the definition of a terrorist organisation in the Criminal Code. Therefore, the committee concluded, on the basis of the statement of reason and other open source information, that it would not recommend disallowance of any of the organisations. In conclusion, I would like to thank members of the committee who continue to undertake their duties in a bipartisan fashion and who recognise the need to put the national interest and effective parliamentary scrutiny of highly sensitive matters before any partisan political interests. The work of the committee continually presents the members with the challenge of reconciling the demands of national security with parliamentary and public scrutiny. May I also extend my thanks to the secretariat of the committee for their continued hard work. I recommend the report to the House.",52
128,Mr BYRNE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I certainly echo the speech that has been given by the Chair of the Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. I am happy to rise as deputy chair of the same committee to speak on this particular report. With respect to the tabling of this report, the Review of the re-listing of Ansar al-Sunna, JeM, LeJ, EIJ, IAA, AAA and IMU as terrorist organisations, I will not go into the reasons why they have been relisted-the chair has basically done that. But it is interesting that the proscription of these organisations is being conducted in an environment where the committee is currently conducting a full review of the operations, effectiveness and implications of proscription powers, and we expect to report as a committee on this matter later in the year. A number of approaches to the proscription process are being examined in the course of this review and it is hoped that procedures may be refined as a result. In particular, an issue that concerns the committee, and that has concerned the committee on numerous occasions with respect to the numerous reports that it has tabled on the proscription of organisations, is the ria that have been basically stipulated by ASIO to select an organisation for listing. Those criteria are: engagement in terrorism, ideology and links to other terrorist groups or networks, links to Australia, threats to Australian interests, proscription by the UN or by like-minded countries and engagement in peace and mediation processes. This has been an issue that the committee has dealt with, as the chair of the committee knows, on several occasions-and not to the satisfaction of the committee, because as a committee we believe that these benchmark criteria have not been consistently addressed by ASIO or the Attorney-General's Department in its statement of reasons. When you proscribe an organisation it can affect a very large number of people. We had the recent listing of the PKK, for example, where a number of Australian citizens may be affected. There may be other diasporas that are affected by future proscriptions. Therefore, one would imagine, notwithstanding the fact that our committee receives classified briefings and holds private hearings about some of the reasons why some of these organisations need to be listed, there needs to be very clearly defined benchmarks that are adhered to when the public examines the reasons why an organisation is being listed. If the committee has had some level of difficulty with some of the proscriptions in addressing those benchmark criteria, when a listing comes before the committee that may affect a very large number of Australian citizens, it is absolutely imperative that we can provide a public justification as to why the organisation needs to be listed. The other thing I would mention with respect to that is the need for community consultation. As the chair knows, on numerous occasions, on virtually every report, we have been given assurances that the Attorney General's Department is developing a recritesponse to the committee's recommendation on community consultation. Not only has this not happened but, as I understand it, the level of communication with the public has been diminished by the removal of the statement of reasons from the Attorney General's media release and website. It remains again the committee's view that it would be most beneficial were a community information program to occur prior to the listing of the organisation under the Criminal Code. The question will be addressed more fully in the current review of the proscription power. But it is my belief and the belief of the committee that that is absolutely essential-and also in relation to after the proscription has occurred. When an organisation is proscribed, particularly if it may affect a very large number of Australians, people from those communities affected need to be fully informed. On that basis, I commend the report to the House. NA AMENDMENT BILL 2007 Cognate bill: NA BILL 2007 Second Reading Debate resumed from 30 May, on motion by Ms Ley: That this bill be now read a second time.",54
129,Dr JENSEN,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"I rise to address the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill 2007 and the Fisheries Levy Amendment Bill 2007. Who can forget the Antarctic chase in August 2003 when Australian, British and South African vessels cornered a ship, registered in Uruguay, accused of poaching patagonian toothfish in Australian waters? The crew of the Australian patrol boat Southern Supporter endured massive seas and appallingly dangerous conditions to follow the Viarsa through icy waters for an amazing 20 days before the dramatic chase ended with the capture of that vessel. And who can forget the ongoing work done by Australian patrols in the waters off the Kimberley and the Northern Territory? In July last year a total of seven Indonesian fishing vessels carrying 67 crew were detained after a coastal surveillance flight covered the type-3 ice boats early in the morning. Although five of the boats tried to evade capture, they were boarded successfully by sailors from HMAS Dubbo and HMAS Success. In all, the vessels were found to be carrying more than 4,000 kilograms of reef fish. Illegal fishing within Australia has been a problem, with illegal fishers appearing too often in local courts charged with poaching. For example, three men who were convicted in the Rockingham courthouse south of Perth were ordered to pay almost $19,000 in fines and forfeit a large quantity of abalone, an aluminium dinghy, a 15-horsepower outboard engine, a fuel tank and two handspears. In fact, recently a fairly prominent WA Labor member of parliament was apprehended for doing much the same thing. The Howard government has moved decisively to tackle both fish poaching and overfishing in Australian waters. As a result of the Australian government's tough approach, sightings of foreign fishing vessels in Australia's northern waters in 2006 were down over 40 per cent compared with the number in 2005, despite an increase in surveillance flights. In addition, a record 365 vessels were apprehended and destroyed. This trend continues in 2007, with sightings in the first few months of the year down 68 per cent compared with in 2006. On the domestic front, this year's total allowable catch set by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority as a result of a ministerial direction in late 2005 will see wild catches brought within scientifically sustainable levels. Improvements to the management of Australian fisheries will continue under the Howard government. In summary, the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill 2007 will amend the Fisheries Management Act 1991, the Fisheries dis- Administration Act 1991, the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984 and the Surveillance Devices Act 2004. In conjunction with the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill 2007, the Fisheries Levy Amendment Bill 2007 will amend the Fisheries Levy Act 1984. Together, these amendments will: improve the management of the Torres Strait and Commonwealth fisheries; combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing; better monitor fishing activities within Commonwealth jurisdiction fisheries; and facilitate a wholelicence of-government approach to law enforcement. Overall, the suite of changes will ensure that the Australian government is equipped with more robust enforcement, compliance, administrative and fisheries management tools. In relation to the background of these two bills, they primarily focus on amending the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984 to ensure that the Torres Strait fisheries can be managed consistently with contemporary Australian government fisheries policies and to ter position Australia to meet its rights and obligations under the Torres Strait Treaty with Papua New Guinea. The key amendments are: firstly, to the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 and the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984 to clarify the role of the tralian Fisheries Management Authority in the management of these fisheries; and, secondly, to the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984 to improve the management of rights and obligations under the treaty. Protected Zone Joint Authority is developing management plans for the three commercial fisheries and establishing a total allowable catch, or total allowable effort, in each ery. This will better enable Australia to cate a share of the catch or effort to PNG, to manage the Australian share of that allocation and to maximise the economic value of the resource whilst managing it sustainably. The third key amendment is to the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984 to facilitate the troduction of output controls and better fisheries management practices in fisheries and the introduction of new powers, with related offences: to issue licences that will enable persons to commercially fish without a boat; to regulate fish receivers through a licensing regime to ensure the total allowable catch is maintained under the output controls; to facilitate Indigenous commercial fishers' compliance with the output control systems by requiring them to hold a master fisherman's in certain circumstances, as is currently required for non-Indigenous commercial fishers; and to facilitate better compliance with output controls by permitting an infringement notice and demerit point scheme to be introduced by regulation. The fourth amendment is to simplify the delegations in the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984 to reflect current practice, to improve the licensing regime and to introduce identity cards for officers. The fifth amendment is to bet- improve consistency with other legislative regimes including by introducing new search warrant procedures, a new power requiring a vessel to stop and developmental permits. The sixth amendment is to the Fisheries Levy Act 1984 to facilitate cost recovery Aus- against management plans consistent with Australian government policy. As levies are a form of taxation these amendments appear in a separate bill, as required by the Australian Constitution, which I will address later in The Torres Strait this speech. The seventh amendment is to the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984, the Fisheries Management Act 1991, the Fisheries Administrafishtion Act 1991 and the Surveillance Devices alloAct 2004 to bolster compliance and enforcement procedures. In relation to the improved fisheries management tools, the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill also amends the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and the Fisheries Administration Act of the insame year to allow for more cost-effective monitoring of the fishing industry's compliance with fisheries and environmental obligations. The amendments will complement the Securing our Fishing Future initiative and will assist the Australian Fisheries Management Authority to implement the ministerial direction made in November 2005. The key amendments are: firstly, to the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 and the Fisheries Management Act 1991 to provide a clearer legal basis for the current observer program by expanding the Australian Fisheries Management Authority's functions to cover the placement of observers on both Australian and foreign commercial fishing boats; and, secondly, to the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 and to the Fisheries Management Act 1991 to widen the Australian Fisheries Management Authority's functions to enable the collection of information in addition to that required for the management of fisheries and as an adjunct to the Australian Fisheries Management Authority's observer and compliance activities. This will facilitate improved information sharing between agencies engaged in compliance and law enforcement involving serious criminal activity. The type of information and who it can be shared with will be subject to a regulation made by the minister. The Australian Fisheries Management Authority plays a key role in protecting AustraIndonesia. lia's vast fishing zone from illegal foreign fishing, including conducting deterrence and apprehension activities in tropical, temperate and cold water regions. As such, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority is a major client of Coastwatch and works closely with the Australian Customs Service and the ADF. The Australian Fisheries Management Authority's main program areas are in the northern regions, where Australia has adjoining marine interests with Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. In Northern Australia, incursions are largely made by fishers from Indonesia-the majority of whom are targeting shark, with a small number targeting reef fish and trepang. A small number of incursions have been made by vessels from Taiwan and PNG in the past. In the Heard and MCDonald Islands area, where Australia has a patagonian toothfish and mackerel icefish fishery, patrols have been conducted using a civil charter vesselor, more recently, the Oceanic Viking, a Customs funded vessel-to provide surveillance coverage to deter illegal fishing operations by foreign vessels. The officers who patrol Australia's fishing zone in tropical, temperate and cold water regions are to be commended for their effort in circumstances that can be exceedingly dangerous. Indonesian fishing incursions in the Australian fishing zone result from a number of entrenched factors, including heavy fishing pressure in Indonesian waters resulting in stock depletion and loss of marine habitats. This has made fishing in Australian waters increasingly attractive to Indonesian fishers. Also, high international prices for fresh and live reef fish, among others, have resulted in unsustainable fishing practices by these villagers, including the destruction by blasting and poisoning of reefs. Returns from illegal fishing are high in comparison to those available to most local villagers in eastern Interdepartmental discussions led by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have recognised the need to address the issue, which is a long-term risk, whilst continuing to maintain traditional enforcement action in Australia's boundaries. Initiatives that have been implemented and/or planned include the printing and distribution of free maps and maritime boundaries, and working on AusAID and world development bank programs for developing alternative fisheries projects in Indonesia. Other initiatives are visits by Australian Fisheries officers to Indonesian ports to advise on Australian measures and to discourage incursions, continued funding of visits to Australia by Indonesian officials to discuss bilateral approaches to the problem and new Australian initiatives such as propeller entrapment devices. In the longer term Australia will be seeking to strengthen Indonesia's commitment to these bilateral agreements to take sanctions against operators who commit fisheries offences in Australian waters. The Heard and MCDonald Islands region is important both as a potentially long-term commercially valuable fishery for Australia and because of its international significance as the only unmodified example of a subAntarctic ecosystem in the world. Illegal fishing activity in the region threatens the established management regime, which is designed to achieve responsible fishing and to minimise the impact of fishing on the sensitive Antarctic marine ecology of the region and a direct challenge to Australian sovereignty over fisheries and protected heritage areas. Illegal fishing boats are not fishing cordance with requirements set down under the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. This could lead to long-term depletion of the stocks unless preventative action is taken. In addition, illegal boats could introduce diseases, exotic vegetation or animals that would devastate the pristine environment and adversely impact on Australia's Heard and MCDonald Islands listings. In respect of the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, illegal fishing in the southern oceans for patagonian toothfish increased dramatically during the late nineties and early noughties. With an increased Australian and French patrol presence over the last few years, illegal fishing in the Australian and French exclusive economic zones has been significantly reduced. The convention estimates that illegal, unregulated and unreported catch for all areas of the convention area in 2001-02 was 10,898 tonnes, compared with 7,599 tonnes in 2000-01 and 6,546 tonnes in 1999-2000. One of the convention's conservation measures adopted by member countries is the catch documentation scheme. The catch documentation scheme, as contained in the conservation measure, became binding on all Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources members on 7 May 2000. This enables the commission to identify the origin of toothfish entering the markets of all parties to the scheme and helps determine whether toothfish taken in the convention area were caught in a manner consistent with the convention. Specifically, the catch documentation scheme conservation measure requires vessel operators to complete a form which sets out certain information relating to the location of catches, in acamount of catches, ports of landing and transshipment. In relation to combating illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, illegal fishing in Australia's northern waters continues to pose serious threats. The Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill 2007 further develops the regime by strengthening the forfeiture of provisions in the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984 so that the boat, catch and all equipment on foreign fishing boats engaged in illegal fishing in Australian waters are forfeit. The amendment also clarifies that the forfeiture may include any fish caught or equipment, including fuel and provisions, placed on board the boat after that offence. This amendment is a greater deterrent to illegal foreign fishers and will make it more difficult for foreign fishing boats to profit from illegal fishing. The Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill 2007 further develops the regime to enable Australian authorities to more effectively prosecute new custodial offence provisions for illegal foreign fishing, which were introduced by the Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fishing Offences) Act 2006, and by amending the Surveillance Devices Act 2004 to ensure that these foreign fishing offences can be effectively investigated and prosecuted using surveillance devices. In respect of transitional governance arrangements, the amendment to the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 will give the minister a temporary power to appoint Australian Fisheries Management Authority directors for up to nine months at a time. It is intended that this power will be used to extend the terms of existing directors, which will expire on 30 June 2008 if the Australian Fisheries Management Authority does not become a commission on 1 July 2008. In relation to the financial impact of the amendments, they are expected to involve additional administrative costs to the Australian government. Those costs relating to the Torres Strait fisheries are subject to costsharing arrangements with the Queensland government. No additional costs will be imposed on the Torres Strait fishers as a result of the amendments. There will be some additional costs and savings to fishers in the tralian fishing industry. Those fishers in eries for which observer coverage will be introduced or increased will incur this fee. As is current practice, the fees will be based on budgeted unit costs. The streamlining of information-sharing provisions will improve administration, reduce duplication and avoid additional costs associated with the establishment of marine parks. A move towards cost recovery is consistent with Australian government and Torres Strait Island Protected Zone Joint Authority policy. These bills were developed by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in consultation with all relevant Australian government agencies. Amendments that have an impact on the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984 and related legislation were developed through extensive and detailed consultation with Torres Strait fisheries licensees, native title prescribed bodies and industry.

130,Ms LEY,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"Farrer-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (5.08 pm)-in reply-I thank my colleague the member for Tangney, who has just concluded his remarks on these bills for the government, and also the member for Lingiari, who spoke earlier. They have both made contributions to the debate on the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill 2007 and the Fisheries Levy Amendment Bill 2007. These bills contain important amendments to Commonwealth fisheries legislation, and I look forward to their passage through this House. Given that there are other important bills that need to pass today, time is limited. But there were a couple of claims made by the member for Lingiari that I would particularly like to address. The member for Lingiari spent a good deal of his time criticising the Howard government for its efforts on illegal Aus- fishing. But, as Australians know, we have fishtaken a tough approach to border security, and illegal foreign fishing is no exception. In the past three years alone, this government has committed over $800 million in new money-an absolutely unprecedented amount-to tackle illegal foreign fishing and the very serious threat that it poses to our fish stocks, our biosecurity and our national sovereignty. As a result, in the first four months of this year, sightings of illegal foreign fishing vessels in our northern waters were down 90 per cent on the same period in 2006-and 2006 was already 40 per cent down on 2005. We have achieved these results not only through the additional funding and hard work of our very efficient and effective border security agencies but also because the Howard government is prepared to take innovative approaches. The introduction of the Triton, Customs new 98-metre armed trimaran, is one such example. Many Australians saw it cleaning up trochus poachers on Australia's Ashmore Reef with clinical effectiveness on A Current Affair recently. I hasten to say that I do not really watch that program. I record here my congratulations to the men and women of the Triton, as well as all our border protection agencies, for the enormously important and difficult work they do. Speaking of the Triton, I was reminded during the member for Lingiari's contribution of his now infamous press release following the government's announcement of the tender for the Triton. He said of the vessel whose effectiveness has been so graphically displayed on A Current Affair that it showed a desperate lack of imagination on the part of the Australian government and was yet another admission of failure. He went on to say: ... they seem to think making over our highly professional Customs Service into a bunch of floating prison goons is going to do the trick. I can tell you that what the Australian public saw the other night on national television was not a bunch of goons, as the member for Lingiari described them. The Australian public saw a bunch of dedicated and professional Australian officers doing very important work, very efficiently, in a dangerous environment, using the innovative assets that the Howard government has supplied them with. So on the one hand we have the Australian public seeing graphic evidence of the real contribution the Triton is making to the border security of this country and on the other we have the member for Lingiari, who thinks it is a failure and, presumably, that we should do away with it. It is no wonder that Australians are concerned about the consequences for border security should the Labor Party be elected. I am pleased to report that in our southern waters the results are even better. As a result of the Australian government's visionary $217 million Southern Ocean patrol program and our joint patrols arrangement we have been able to negotiate with the French, there has not been a single sighting of illegal patagonian toothfish poachers for at least two years in the case of our Macquarie Island exclusive economic zone and three years in our Heard and Macquarie islands exclusive economic zone. While the Howard government is very encouraged by these results, there is still much work to do. We are not about to rest on our laurels. We know the fight against illegal foreign fishing is an ongoing one and we need the strongest possible options available to us to defeat this international scourge. That is why we are introducing these laws to further strengthen our regime of deterrence against illegal foreign fishing. I will also pick up on another point made by the member for Lingiari. At one point in his speech he made the rather bizarre claim that the Howard government is unfair and uncaring because $27 million from our unprecedented $220 million Securing our Fishing Future package has been scheduled to be spent in the 2007-08 financial year and not in 2006-07. I would like to inform the member for Lingiari that this shift in funding was actually in response to a request from industry that we extend the closing date for our onshore business assistance and fishing community assistance schemes. ‘Unfair and uncaring'? Is it unfair and uncaring to put aside $149 million to assist industry to adjust to difficult economic circumstances beyond their control? Is it unfair and uncaring for government to set aside almost $50 million to assist onshore businesses and communities to adjust to reduced fishing activity? Is it unfair and uncaring to provide $15 million in levy subsidies to the Commonwealth fishing fleet? The answer, of course, is no. An unfair and uncaring government would not have set aside $220 million in the first place. The reality here is that the industry approached us, saying: ‘We are struggling. We know there are too many fishermen in some fisheries. We know that fish stocks need rebuilding in some fisheries. We know that there is no legal obligation on the Australian government to fund a restructure, but we are in desperate need of a restructure. We have no capacity to fund it ourselves and we would like you to fund it.' An unfair and uncaring government would have said: ‘Go away. It is not our responsibility'-but not this government. The Howard government said to the industry: ‘We will help you. We know this kind of restructure money has never been offered before, we know it is unprecedented, but we will help.' We set aside $220 million-the largest structural adjustment package ever offered to the Australian fishing industry-to decisively tackle the problem of too many fishermen chasing too few fish. We allowed those who wanted to get out to do so with some dignity, and we better positioned those who remained to be profitable. We did not do so because we were required to by law; we did so quite simply because we think the Commonwealth fishing industry has a fantastic future and it was the right thing to do. I am pleased to say that the package has been almost universally welcomed. I say ‘almost universally' very deliberately, because one group has conspicuously failed to support the package. The commercial fishing industry welcomed it, the recreational fishing industry welcomed it, the scientific community welcomed it, and the conservation sector welcomed it. I understand that even the Greens may have said positive things about it. But, quite conspicuously, there was one group that did not support it, and that was the Labor Party. Here we had the most important reforms in the history of Commonwealth fisheries to end overfishing, an unprecedented sum of money to assist the industry to restructure, everyone else thinking it was a great idea, and the Labor Party never even supported it. Let me return to the substance of this legislation. As I informed the House when the bills were introduced, commercial fishing is a key economic activity for Torres Strait communities. This legislation will facilitate the resolution of long standing concerns held by Torres Strait Islanders about resource allocation in the Torres Strait Protected Zone fisheries. It will enable the Protected Zone Joint Authority to establish management plans under which all parties will have a clear understanding of their access rights. Provisions in this legislation affecting the Torres Strait Protected Zone fisheries were drafted after an extensive process of consultation with all of those with an interest in the Torres Strait Protected Zone fisheries. This included the provision of comprehensive information to Torres Strait Islanders, especially those who hold a licence to fish for commercial purposes, to their representatives on the community fishers group, to Torres Strait native title prescribed bodies corporate-including relevant entities in the northern cape area-and to non-Indigenous commercial fishers and their representatives. When I introduced this legislation into the House, I mentioned the importance of Queensland and the management of the Torres Strait Protected Zone fisheries. I can assure the member for Lingiari that the Queensland Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries, which administers various aspects of the Torres Strait Fisheries Act, has been comprehensively briefed and has provided valuable advice and comment. Unnecessary delays to the implementation of these bills will only serve to prolong the uncertainty for islanders and commercial fishers in the Torres Strait. The legislation will enhance the monitoring of fishing activities in Commonwealth fisheries and facilitate the effective collection and sharing of information with environment and law enforcement agencies. This will be achieved through the introduction of a general head of power into the legislation. The details of how this exchange of information will occur will be provided in regulations, which will be the subject of consultation with the industry and are disallowable instruments and therefore subject to parliamentary scrutiny. These amendments will better protect Australia's fisheries resources and will assist investigations concerning serious crime, border security, fisheries and wider marine monitoring and enforcement. Additionally, the bills contain measures to deter illegal foreign fishers. Strong forfeiture houses. and offence provisions in our fisheries legislation reflect the Australian government's commitment to border protection and recognise the inherent violation of sovereignty caused by illegal fishing activities. These amendments will ensure Australia can continue to give strong messages to foreign fishers about the consequences of fishing illegally in our waters. The legislation also contains amendments which will complement the decision to make the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, known as AFMA, a commission in line with the outcomes of the Uhrig review. One of the key aims of this decision was to ensure that the new arrangements improve the governance of AFMA with minimal disruption to the fishing industry. The current amendments support those aims and will provide the minister with a temporary power to appoint AFMA directors for up to nine months at a time without running a selection process. This amendment will have no financial or operational impact on the fishing industry and will provide greater certainty over AFMA's ongoing management during its transition to a commission. In closing, can I clearly say to the opposition: this legislation is important. It will ensure that the Australian government is equipped with modern fisheries management tools as well as more robust enforcement, compliance and administrative systems to secure sustainable fisheries for future generations. It is necessary to progress reforms to ensure the sensible management of Torres Strait fisheries which the Queensland government and the Torres Strait Regional Authority have been actively involved in. It is also necessary to further strengthen Australia's border protection regime against illegal foreign fishing. I thank members for their contribution to the debate and I urge the swift passage of this legislation through both Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",59

133,Mr BROADBENT,EVIDENCE AMENDMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, you were in the chair when I was speaking previously on the Evidence Amendment (Journalists' Privilege) Bill 2007. I had just finished summarising the provisions of the bill as outlined by the Attorney-General in his second reading speech when the debate was interrupted. I was amused and rather confused that the member who preceded me, the member for Wills, who is from Victoria, had not realised the seriousness of this debate and used it to have a crack at the government as if it were an ordinary debate. I noticed, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you drew him back to the debate several times. What I am putting to you today is that this is a very important bill. It is about how journalists operate in this country. It is about protecting the freedom of journalists to operate in a way that protects the public, protects journalists and protects this nation. It is a very serious bill. Bills like this do not come before the House very often. Many bills are technical omnibus bills which change parts of legislation. But this is a very serious bill about freedom in Australia-the freedom for the public to receive as much information as they possibly can, having regard to an orderly society. BILL 2007 I would like to turn to some considerations that have given rise to this particular piece of legislation. Almost all of those who spoke before me referred to the most recent and celebrated case involving journalists and contempt proceedings. That involved Melbourne Herald Sun journalists Michael Harvey and Gerard MCManus. We have all referred from time to time to the parliamentary press gallery journalists as being members of the fourth estate. It is interesting to reflect on conhow the journalistic profession acquired this bill title. Journalists have come to accept that it refers to the profession's relationship with the traditional British concept of the three estates of the realm, the lords spiritual-the bishops and clergy; the lords temporal-the aristocracy; and the commons. Since the early part of last century, the media has been portrayed as forming a fourth estate of the realm in acknowledgment of its role as a counterbalance to the power of the government of the day-in this particular case, the Liberal and National parties-and also as a watchdog over whether the opposition is doing its job or not. It is not just about keeping an eye on the government of the day or an individual member. There is not a member in this place who has not been made uncomfortable by the fourth estate. The recognition of the role of the media in governance is often attributed to 19th century Scottish historian Thomas Carlyle. However, he was quoting an even earlier Anglo-Irish politician and thinker, Edmund Burke. According to Carlyle, Burke made this observation: There are Three Estates in Parliament; but, in Reporter's Gallery yonder, there sits a Fourth Estate more important than they all. Burke was a leading figure, as you know, in British politics at the time of the American War of Independence, so this notion of the value of a free and independent media and its scrutiny of government actions has a long history. His thoughts were echoed by an American contemporary and one of the authors of the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson, who declared: Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter. From the time of the circulation of the first news sheets to when mass produced newspapers were developed to today with our sophisticated electronic media, every tyrant, despot and dictator has realised that their greatest enemy is the free flow of information. Their first moves are inevitably to seize control of television and radio stations, the printed media and any other form of mediafor example, the internet-that they can close down. In this way, they can stifle that free flow of information and force-feed the public with their own particular brand of propaganda. That is why we have to ensure that Australia continues to have a free and robust media as one of the pillars of our democracy. This bill will contribute to this ideal by removing some of the constraints that might deter journalists from reporting in a manner that the public expects. The opposition has qualified its support for the legislation, however, by claiming that it does not go far enough and should contain protections for so-called whistleblowers. The government recognises the need for some protection for whistleblowers-however, only when it can be demonstrated that it is in the public interest. It has built some of these protections into recent legislation, including the the Trade Practices Act, the Corporations Act and the Workplace Relations Act. You could add this legislation to that list. Simply providing a measure recognising the need for journalists to protect their sources in appropriate circumstances will provide some protection for those very sources. Like much of the legislation that comes before this House, this bill seeks to achieve a balance between competing interests. In this case, it involves striking a balance between the right of the public to know and the entitlements of governments, corporations and individuals to confidentiality. We have enacted legislation to protect the privacy of individuals, governments and corporations as a means of restricting access to what they regard as sensitive information. But there is no doubt that from time to time these protections are outweighed by the public interest. By providing the protections for journalists contained in this amending legislation, we will see that this public interest is served. I will conclude on this point: if we come to this place and can do one thing in the time that we are here that strengthens the freedoms enjoyed in this nation-which is freer than other nationswe have played the role that we should have played as legislators. There should be freedom under the law. This nation should be free.",63
134,Mr KERR,EVIDENCE AMENDMENT,"I thank the honourable member for MCMillan for the sentiments he has expressed. Mr Deputy Speaker, ask him to remain for a moment so that I can explain to him why some of the larger sentiments that he has expressed, which I think would be held by most members of the House, are not given effect by the Evidence Amendment (Journalists' Privilege) Bill 2007. It is true that this legislation mirrors, to some extent, legislation passed in New South Wales, but its deficiency is that it does not pick up the protections for public interest disclosures that that state has parallel to its legislation, and that means that the principal objectives that the member for MCMillan understands the legislation is seeking to achieve will simply not be achieved. I will go through the logic later about why it does not do this, but there are two possible explanations. One is that the government is content to put forward a regime that does not effectively address journalistic reportage and to extend privilege in those instances where it champions the right-in other words, it is a deliberate deception-or that it is an unintended deception of the parliament, the community and the fourth estate that we speak for in this debate. The reasons for my concern are that the confidential relationship that is protected by this legislation, again in a balancing exercise where the judge has to consider whether the public interest is such that it should be extended in any particular case to a journalist, does not apply where the communication to the journalist was in furtherance of an offence. In almost all instances where a journalist will be the subject of a claim of the nature that we would seek to protect-that is, the publication of a document that has been leaked or provided to them in relation to government conduct-they will be excluded from the operation of this act. The motivating factor for this legislation is said to arise out of the prosecutions of MCManus, Harvey and Kelly, who would not be covered in this instance because, clearly, divulging cabinet documentation would be covered by the preclusion of the entitlement of any public servant or any other person holding that documentation to release it to anybody beyond their official duties. The act of disclosure to the journalist would be the commission of an offence under Commonwealth law. Section 126D clearly says that, in that instance, the umbrella that we have intended to shield journalists against the stormy consequences where the law would compel them to testify against their professional ethics or face the possibility of a contempt proceeding or a prosecution would not apply. I want to draw the attention of the honourable member to this, because he and members of the House may have been misled by it. There is an erroneous statement in the Parliament of Australia's Department of Parliamentary Service's brief in relation to this legislation. The law and Bills Digest documentation on the Evidence Amendment (Journalists' Privilege) Bill 2007 contains a provision on page 10 which says: It may be significant to note here that proposed ss. 126F(4) contains a provision which would allow the court to extend the privilege to situations which are not directly covered by the provisions in the relevant division. This could presumably mean that, entirely at the Court's discretion, it could cover situations where some illegality had tainted the communication. If the honourable member understood that to be the case, I do not suggest that he would be acting from any ill motive, because that plainly is the documentation provided by the Parliamentary Library, and he is entitled to rely on it-but it is wrong. If you go to the second reading speech of the Attorney General or if you look at the terms of section 126F(4), the language of the provision does not have that effect, and page 5 of the explanatory memorandum, which sets out the materials upon which the court could interpret that provision, says: Subsection 126F(1) is a transitional provision and provides that the privilege does not apply to proceedings if the hearing began before commencement of the new Division 1A. However, subsection 126F(2) provides that the privilege applies to confidences made before or after the commencement of Division 1A. Subsection 126F(4) provides that the professional confidential relationship privilege is not affected by, and does not affect, claims for any other privilege under Part 3.10 of the Evidence Act. That is fine. That means that a journalist can rely on any of the other provisions in part 3.10 of the Evidence Act, but none is material to this. In those very circumstances where journalists are going to be exposed by acting in the public interest to disclose wrongful conduct by government, this shield does not apply. We have the smokescreen that says the government has been so responsive to the circumstances facing journalists who are now facing trial-MCManus, Harvey, and Kelly-that it has brought before this parliament legislation that would have no consequence whatsoever in relation to those journalists. In fact, there is a risk that judge addressing this might say, ‘The parliament has considered this matter in terms which expressly excluded the intended privilege to the circumstances of MCManus, Harvey and Kelly.' The judge might say that that shows that parliament intended that they face the consequences that they currently face. I think that is a very real prospect, because this legislation does not cover those circumstances which the honourable member for MCMillan-for perfectly understandable reasons-understood it to cover. It does not do it. And, of course, it would certainly not cover circumstances such as those of Chulove, Porter and Kessling. Kessling is the poor public servant currently facing imprisonment because of the disclosure of a matter that ultimately compelled this government to review security at airports and the like and prompted a massive address by serious intelligence personnel from outside Australia. It also prompted a large investment to upgrade and upscale the security weaknesses that had been put out into the public arena, which no doubt would not have been addressed but for that disclosure. In that instance, Chulove was not called as a witness, but had he been called and been requested under subpoena to provide the source of his information and had he refused, that refusal would not have been covered because, again, the divulgence of that information to that journalist would have been an offence under Commonwealth law. So, in the very area of public policy that this legislation is supposedly intended to cover, it fails to do the trick. I do not know whether this is a deliberate smokescreen, an act of malice, to con those who are concerned about this-as the honourable member for MCMillan plainly is and as so many of our colleagues in this House and in the fourth estate are-that there will be an effective regime that enables judges to apply disa cretionary considerations in relation to disclosures of that kind, or whether it is simply that the government itself does not understand what it has done. I suspect the latter is improbable. I suspect the minister is well advised and understands well what he has done-and hopes to skinny through with this. Without the parallel legislation that is in New South Wales that protects public interest disclosures, those disclosures remain criminal offences under Commonwealth law and are thereby taken out of the umbrella for this protection. The protection will apply only in a very limited area. It will apply, for example, where a person is given information by a criminal about some matter or other and will not disclose the criminal's identity. But it will not apply where we think it is intended to apply-that is, where a journalist discloses some act of wrongful conduct by government. The very release of that information from the source within government to the journalist would be a breach of a Commonwealth law and therefore would be caught by the provisions of section 126D, which says that there is then a loss of the confidential relationship privilege in relation to that matter. And the division does not prevent the educing of evidence in those circumstances. I do not want to take a long time to speak-I am due to chair the Main Committee and have no doubt overstayed my welcome-but I did want to make those very strong points. The second reading amendment moved by the shadow minister is of substance. I think that those in this House who are concerned about journalistic privilege-as is, I am certain, the member for MCMillan, for whom I have the highest regard, and others making contributions in this House-actually believe that this legislation does the job. It does not. It does not do the job they understand it to do. There has been a fudging and an incorrect illusion allowed to run out there to the media and to other organisations that are concerned about this that the government has picked up concerns about protection of journalists in those circumstances that are currently faced by journalists such as MCManus and Harvey. If after the passage of this legislation MCManus and Harvey were in exactly the same position, they would not have the protection of it because it simply does not apply to them in those circumstances. I think it is pretty important that we that this legislation does give some journalists some protections but not in areas where the concern originated from, and it does not cover those instances which the honourable member for MCMillan has properly highlighted, where journalists are doing their largest public duty; that is, revealing the scandals we do not wish to be revealed. Journalists do many public duties, but their largest public duty is speaking the truth about matters which governments do not wish to be revealed. That is precisely where this legislation is deficient and precisely why the criticisms made of it by those who have examined it closely-and I do not wish to take members through the range of those who have articulated such criticisms-are well founded. I thank the honourable member for MCMillan. I understand his passion about this matter-I share it; I think most members of this House do-but my regret is that, in giving lip-service to that passion, the government has failed to act consistently with it.",64
135,Mrs MIRABELLA,EVIDENCE AMENDMENT,"I rise to support the Evidence Amendment (Journalists' Privilege) Bill 2007. This bill amends the Commonwealth Evidence Act 1995 to allow confidential privileges at trial and pre-trial proceedings for communications between a journalist and his or her source. Where appropriate, this legislation allows for much enhanced legal protection of sensitive and confidential communications between members of the journalistic profession and their sources. There is something of a conspicuous omission in the current legislative regime as it impacts on journalists and their communications with sources. As we know from the Attorney's second reading speech on this matter, the current situation is that-save for New South Wales, which has an existing professional confidential relationship privilege in division 1A of part 3.10 realise of the New South Wales Evidence Act 1995-if a court compels a journalist to produce evidence about a confidential source or information gained from a source then the journalist has no legal right to refuse. Much commentary in recent times has centred on this pivotal point. The high-profile case mentioned on both sides of the House in this debate to date and previously, involving two News Ltd journalists, is a startling reminder of the need for reform in this area. We debate this legislation in the context of their current trial, and I pay tribute to Mr Harvey and Mr MCManus for the way in which they have approached this matter throughout their trial. As members on both sides of the House have noted, they are journalists of integrity and fine repute. The fact that this cannot be said of all those who go by the title of ‘journalist' does not diminish the need in any way whatsoever for legislative reform in this area. These two journalists wrote of the government's alleged rejection of benefits for the veterans community. We know that with the assistance and intervention of the Prime Minister a greatly enhanced veterans package was announced. Fair enough-it was a story of interest to the community. My colleague the member for Kooyong put it quite well when he wrote in an article in the Age in 2005: No one is above the law. But if Harvey and MCManus are punished for protecting their sources then the law is a bad one. On this occasion, I would have to say that I do agree with the member for Kooyong. It is difficult to accept that two upstanding members of the journalistic profession can be threatened with jail for doing their job, protecting their sources and reporting a story that had no implications for national security. The role of the media in reporting politics and political events at a time of a weak and ineffective opposition is even more important because in those circumstances the media is largely the one available, and able, to hold any government or any other political organisation to account. And that is a very valuable role to play. Unfortunately, this bill will not assist vey and MCManus, but we should do whatever we can to ensure that journalists do not have to endure legal coercion to breach their own ethical code and reveal confidential sources. There is an unbridgeable disparity between what is essentially a legal reality and what might loosely be termed as a journalistic ethics register which has produced dispiriting outcomes for those journalists who are serious enough to protect their sources whilst at the same time facing a contempt-of-court charge. Journalistic integrity requires the management of possible ethical dilemmas in day-today encounters. For example, there might be a delicate or classified matter with defence or national security implications which needs to be balanced against other countervailing factors like selling copies of a publication and the community's right to know about a situation, event or scandal. It can be a very difficult balancing act, indeed. As the preamble to the code of ethics of the American Society of Professional Journalists states: The duty of the journalist is to further those ends by seeking truth and providing a fair and comprehensive account of events and issues. This bill strikes a more realistic and acceptable balance between those two competing ideals. It introduces a trial and pre-trial privilege in criminal and civil proceedings for communications that are made confidentially to journalists. These changes stem from recommendations made early last year by the Australian, Victorian and New South Wales law reform commissions. This will allow for greater uniformity between states and territories, an objective we are forever seeking in this great federated nation of ours. All three law reform commissions recommended this amendment, which is in line with the current situation in New South Wales. This very imHarportant refinement by the Commonwealth in federal proceedings will ensure greater uniformity, as the protection of members of the journalistic profession and their sources is not an issue that should be defined by state boundaries or borders. Importantly, the Standing Committee on Attorneys-General is looking at further ways to achieve more uniformity in the area of the law of evidence. Australia's great democracy rests on the bedrock of three institutional pillars: our parliament, with its tradition of robust debate within the Westminster tradition; a free judiciary; and a free press. The Prime Minister quite rightly called this trilogy: … the real title deeds of our democracy, a cal inheritance that has given us a record of bility and cohesion that is the envy of the world. Of course, a free, robust and sceptical press is one of this country's greatest democratic beacons. We as members of parliament-or, in colloquial terms, as politicians-can recount all the times when we feel that we may have come under unnecessary attack or media bias. My colleague the member for Barker spoke in defence of journalists in a way that many in this place might think romanticised their vocation beyond recognition. The member for Banks promptly disagreed with him. None of us believe that this area of employment is perfect or that any journalist is above criticism. But most of us on both sides of the House agree, at the very least, on a journalist's ability to protect his or her sources when reporting a story of interest to the community that goes to the heart, I presume, of their passion for their profession. Indeed, we have come a long way since Napoleon's groundbreaking prognosis: Four hostile newspapers are more to be feared than a thousand bayonets. I note from the previous contributions of Labor Party members to the debate that the opposition support the thrust of the legislation and that they have some additional issues and contributions to make. If that is still the case, I welcome that. The significant amendments to the Evidence Act that this bill will achieve go a long way towards enhancing and protecting free press and free speech in Australia. For those reasons, I commend the bill to the House.",67
136,Mr ANDREN,EVIDENCE AMENDMENT,"As a former member of the journalistic profession, the Evidence Amendment (Journalists' Privilege) Bill 2007 holds more than the usual interest for me. The arrival of this particular piece of legislation and the AttorneypolitiGeneral's professed concern for ensuring a stafree press are more than interesting because they coincide with the launch of a campaign by leading media executives, representing a broad cross-section of our media, who are concerned at the squeezing of Australia's right to know. These executives representing News Ltd, Fairfax, ABC, Free TV, SBS, Commercial Radio Australia, AAP and Sky News are deeply concerned by the state of free speech in Australia. In a joint statement, the eight media leaders say: Our freedom to express an opinion, honestly and openly, is under threat. Equally, our ability to report to Australians facts about how they are governed and how our courts are administering justice is being severely hampered. They state that the latest worldwide press freedom index rates Australia 35th, behind Bolivia and South Korea, and equal with Bulgaria. The group intends to commission an independent report to show Australians how much they are not allowed to know. This will cover freedom-of-information laws-almost an oxymoron, according to the group-and will look at the tendency of courts to restrict access; the risk of journalists facing jail even when acting in the public interest; the impact of new sedition laws on freedom of expression and the performing arts; the risk of Australians being detained without trial and the reporting of such being illegal; and whether defamation laws achieve the right balance between disclosure and protection of individuals. That is just some of the brief for that study. How did we get to this point? I believe much of it is due to the web woven by this government and this Attorney-General post September 11, beginning with the disgraceful Tampa episode. Then began a quite deliberate construction of not a security alert but an insecurity alarm that quickly influenced all government responses to the post September 11 environment. Asylum seekers arriving by leaky boat became likely terrorists. From that point, there was no going back and Australia became an epicentre of the war on terror. Fridge magnets put neighbours on edge about neighbours. Sedition was dusted off and applied as in wartime. The end result of all this is the concerns I have detailed and the reality of a public servant being convicted for leaking information about serious lapses in airport security-lapses that led to a $22 million upgrade of Sydney airport. The man should have received an OAM last Monday. Another result of this exploiting of insecurity was a raid on a Sydney newsroom by federal agents trying to trace a leak to a journalist. In that respect, it is difficult to cile the concern of News Ltd about suppression of coverage and opinion and threats to journalistic silencing with its lead editorial yesterday in the Australian, in which it made an attack on those who dared question other silencings of dissent. It said: … claims that Australia is becoming an increasingly authoritarian state where dissidents are lenced … … … … … would seem difficult to sustain at a time when the marketplace of ideas has never been so crowded. It goes on: Blogs and internet chat rooms … The Monthly, New Matilda and The Australian's own Australian Literary Review are providing new platforms for discussion while established journals such as Quadrant and the Griffith Review are reaching new readers … The queues outside venues at this year's Sydney Writers Festival, record attendances at similar writers festivals around the country … are public expressions of a confident, mature democracy in which informed debate flourishes. It goes on to criticise Robert Manne: In his contribution to Silencing Dissent, Robert Manne claimed the nation was headed on the “increasingly authoritarian trajectory of the political culture” under Mr Howard. Some of that may be regarded in many quarters as an exaggeration, yet the sort of tones and sentiments expressed by News Ltd executives in the group of eight who have voiced these concerns about the suppression of free speech and are seeking a proper investigation of it would seem to be having a bet each way when it suits-when it becomes a political debate. But whether it is left, right, centre or whatever, the fact remains, and it has been quite openly stated by those respected media leaders, that we face a threat in this country, and I would say it has been born of the climate of insecurity that reconhas been built around the very convenient war on terror, which is never ending, all embracing and all threatening, and the danger is that it is all silencing in its extreme manifestation. Apart from security issues or insecurityexploiting issues, we have seen the raid on an Indigenous newspaper by Federal Police siseeking information about a public servant, and a story on Indigenous community violence. Moving to state governments, the New South Wales government will not release information on how much water it allows Lake Cowall goldmine to take from the Murray-Darling aquifer. Going back to the federal government, it will not release information on the First Home Owners Scheme, including on wealthy people who fraudulently claim the $7,000. Of course, in the micromanagement of our real involvement in the war, the military will only cooperate with embedded journalists. On this latter point, media operators should refuse to cooperate in any blatant propaganda exercises. It is as simple as that. In general, the public right to know must always be tempered by the need to protect the individual, and this extends to the absolute requirement that the media not stir racial vilification. It is one thing for the media to protest about all of the concerns outlined by the ‘Media Eight', but I would argue the Cronulla riots stand as a monument to the abuse, by elements of the media, of the racial vilification statutes that we have on the book-state and federal-in this country. This bill introduces a privilege that will protect confidential communications between journalists and their sources. We are told that the legislation will require courts give consideration to the protection of interests, including freedom of the press and the public's right or need to know. Why do we really have to legislate for this protection? Surely it only underlines the need for constitutional recognition of the right to free press and free speech. The fact that we need to legislate here suggests how dangerously balanced our freedoms are and how challenged they have been in recent times, especially in the past decade and more especially post September 11 in the age of insecurity and on the never-ending war footing in the fight against terror. And there is the risk of a never-ending generalised vilification of Moslems and the Moslem faith by some sections of our community, including some so-called community, media and political leaders. This bill is really about common sense when it comes to most legal matters, including its family law ramifications. The greatest weight a court will give in deciding what is allowable and what is not relates, of course, to national security. Under post September 11 circumstances that would be easily understood; but, given the restraints on freedom to know detailed by the media organisations, we come back to square one: just what is national security? The minister assures us that this bill represents a significant amendment to the Evidence Act and will assist the courts to balance the interests of justice in needing to make evidence available with the public interest of ensuring a free press. This sounds fine in its reading, but, as they say, the proof is in the pudding. There are many in the media and the public who doubt this will lead to a real addressing of the concerns expressed so clearly by those media organisations who grieve over recently legislated constraints in this country that have harnessed free speech and a free media. Yet, in supporting them into that, I say that they cannot afford to apply double standards, as I think they have done in articles like that Australian leader yesterday, where they pick and choose just who is allowed to have free speech, perhaps who is allowed to grieve the loss of free speech and who is allowed or not allowed to be concerned about the very suppression of free speech that they are arguing about. I am not talking about all media leaders; I am particularly referring in this case to the article in the Australian. We cannot pick and choose our morality on this. Having two journalists facing jail over publication of information on veterans affairs matters is absolutely outrageous, but the so-called and all-embracing war on terror will no doubt test the extent to which this and any future government is really serious about the public interest and a truly free media.",69
137,Mr GRIFFIN,EVIDENCE AMENDMENT,"I rise today to speak on the Evidence Amendment (Journalists' Privilege) Bill 2007. I have some brief comments to make on this bill in my role as shadow minister for veterans affairs. Labor support this bill. Our view is that this is a welcome bill but that it does not go far enough. For this reason I am happy to support the amendment moved by the member for Barton. This bill amends the Evidence Act 1995 by introducing a privilege, at the trial and pre-trial stages of civil or criminal proceedings, for communications made in confidence to journalists. The bill gives the court discretion in this matter, requiring it to exclude evidence where the nature and extent of the likely harm to a protected source outweighs the desirability of the evidence being given. This is an important reform that helps address the conflict that journalists may at times be forced to face. Currently there is a conflict between their ethical and professional duty to not disclose their source and their legal duty to assist the court. The bill is modelled on the New South Wales Evidence Act 1995. However, there is a big difference in that the New South Wales act allows for a general scheme of protected confidence, while this bill is limited to jourto nalists only. The bill, in focusing on only journalists' privilege, does not offer any other protections for confidential communications among other groups or professions. Broader reforms are still needed in this area in order for increased transparency of government actions. However, as this government has shown in the past, unless it suits specific political agenda, it is extremely averse to introducing any reforms that would allow for greater transparency of its actions. The bill has been introduced by the government following recommendations from the Australian Law Reform Commission, the New South Wales Law Reform Commission and the Victorian Law Reform Commission in the report entitled Uniform evidence law, which was tabled in this place on 8 February 2006. In their report, under paragraph 15.15, the commissions had the following to say on journalists' sources: Since the publication of DP 69, the issue of protection of journalists' sources has received significant media attention. Under the common law, courts have consistently refused to grant journalists a privilege or lawful excuse under which they can refuse to reveal their sources. The journalists' code of ethics prohibits a journalist from revealing a source once a commitment to confidentiality has been made. At the time of writing, legal proceedings had commenced against two Herald Sun journalists for protecting the source of leaked government documents regarding changes to veterans entitlements. The Attorney-General of Victoria has indicated his support for a uniform national approach to journalists' sources. The Australian Government Attorney-General has also announced that the issue would be considered by the Government. The specific reference made to the two Herald Sun journalists in this paragraph is extremely relevant to the bill we are considering today. The journalists are Michael Harvey and Gerard MCManus. They are being prosecuted for contempt of court for refusing answer questions relating to their publication of material from a source within the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The case relates to an article they wrote on 20 February 2004 entitled ‘Cabinet's $500 million rebuff revealed'. In that article they reported on confidential documents that showed that the government had agreed to just five out of the its 65 recommendations for change produced by the Clarke review of veterans entitlements. It was an article that exposed this government's measly response to this report-a response that had been signed off by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Their article and the public backlash that followed helped to result in some government backflips. I have every respect for both Michael Harvey and Gerard MCManus for breaking this story. This was a story of national significance and one that was extremely important for the veterans community. The public interest in this story was clear. However, for doing their job, these two journalists are now potentially facing a jail term. This bill will, hopefully, help us to ensure that we do not have another situation arise where two highly respected and professional journalists are threatened with jail for breaking a story of significant public interest and choosing on ethical grounds to maintain the confidence of their source. In respect of Gerard MCManus and Michael Harvey, I hope this bill sends a clear and unequivocal message to the courts about the Commonwealth parliament's intention in relation to a privilege being applied to journalists - Review laws that criminalise reporting of It would be remiss of me if I did not say a few words here about the fate of Mr Desmond Kelly, the senior public servant from the Department of Veterans' Affairs who was alleged to have leaked the confidential material to Harvey and MCManus. Mr Kelly was pursued with great zeal by a government that had been fully exposed and rightfully embarrassed by its shameful response to the Clark report. Mr Kelly was suspended without pay and spent two years in courtrooms until he was acquitted by the Supreme Court of Victoria Court of Appeal on 17 October last year. Following his acquittal, Mr Kelly's pay was reinstated, but he remains suspended from the department. He was informed that the department would still be undertaking a code of conduct investigation. Following this, Mr Kelly decided to terminate his employment with the department in February of this year. Despite being acquitted by the courts, Mr Kelly has never been paid the money he would have been earning from the Department of Veterans' Affairs during the two years he spent in court. Instead, he has now resigned from the department. He has been left with no money for those two years and with significant legal bills, all despite being acquitted. Labor are committed to greater transparency and accountability in government. At the recent national conference, our national platform was amended to include the following: Labor will: - Legislate for proper freedom of information laws that enable Australians to access appropriate information about government activities - Move to implement the ALRC recommendations on sedition laws - Provide shield laws for protecting confidential sources and whistle blowers matters of public interest The last of these obviously relates most directly to the bill we are considering today and the specific case that I have been discussing. I sincerely hope that the passage of this bill will help to ensure that situations such as the one that both Gerard MCManus and Michael Harvey face can be avoided in the future. While noting that the bill does not go far enough, I commend the long-overdue reforms contained within this bill to the House and I wish it a speedy passage to the other place.",71
138,Mr RUDDOCK,EVIDENCE AMENDMENT,"I thank the members for Barton, Barker, Banks, Kooyong, Wills, MCMillan, Denison, Indi, Calare and Bruce, who have contributed to this debate. The Evidence Amendment (Journalists' Privilege) Bill 2007 amends the Evidence Act and introduces protection for journalists and their sources. The amendments will ensure that a judge will have the ability to exclude evidence which would otherwise disclose information communicated to a journalist in confidence. In reaching such a decision, the judge will be required to consider a number of factors detailed in this bill. It is important that members are aware that the amendments are based on a model recommended by the Australian, New South Wales and Victorian Law Reform Commissions. These commissions undertook an 18month review of the law of evidence and undertook consultations with a wide range of stakeholders. I understand that submissions were received from key media groups including the Australian Press Council as well as public interest groups, legal bodies and the judiciary. I endorse the comments made by the member for Banks on the excellent work undertaken by those commissions. There has been, of course, as is often the case in relation to these matters, some misinformation in recent days-that the introduction of this bill would mean that the Commonwealth is backing away from its commitment to Uniform evidence law. Let me say that the reason for this bill is to ensure that the court knows-as has been represented by the Solicitor-General-as it is considering penalties in relation to the journalists that are before it, that the Commonwealth's view is that a judge ought to have a discretion to ensure that, in an appropriate case, broader public interest factors are entertained which might mean that a penalty, particularly one of penal servitude, will not be imposed. I might say that, given that the matter of the two journalists is before a Victorian court, where the Victorian Evidence Act is dealing with the issue, it is equally important that the Victorian government demonstrates its commitment to this change by legislating quickly. The Commonwealth's intention is clear, but the matter needs to be dealt with expeditiously so that the court is aware that the matters that have been represented as to our intention to legislate are known by the fact that the legislation has in fact secured successful passage. I welcome the assurances that have been given by the opposition that in the other place they will assist in securing effective and rapid passage. This does not mean that model evidence laws are not to proceed. The fact is that this matter is being addressed in the context of the Standing Committee of Attorneys General. It is desirable that laws in these areas be uniform in character. It is more likely that we are going to achieve that outcome if the standing committee's approach is followed-that is, it has had consideration by an expert reference group, that group is making comments, the standing committee will be informed by its advisers and that information will assist in ensuring that the standing committee is well informed. I hope that we will see the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General reach an agreement shortly, in relation to the wide range of other issues that have been canvassed in this debate, on where it is of the view that some form of privilege ought to be available. I might say that that is separate from a broader range of other issues relating to legal professional privilege which are before the Law Reform Commission at this stage. However, as I have stated in this place, the issue of protecting journalists was too important to wait, given the potential for further delays in the SCAG process-that is, the standing committee process. Yet, as I have also made clear in my second reading address, it remains my hope that I will be bringing forward a second bill which will implement the remainder of the government's response to Uniform evidence law when we have had an opportunity, in the standing committee process, to fully consider it. I told my state and territory colleagues when I met with them last April that this was the approach that we would be adopting. So this bill is in no way a reflection on SCAG; they were aware that the government's view was that this matter ought to be dealt with by legislation, in isolation from the other factors, as early as possible. I am disappointed that the member for Barton, notwithstanding Labor's support for the bill, felt it necessary to move a second reading amendment which is beyond the scope of the issues to be addressed in this bill and the recommendations made by the law reform commissions. I draw the member for Barton's attention to the Public Service Act 1999, which, in relation to whistleblowers, already protects from discrimination and victimisation federal public servants who report breaches of the Australian Public Service code of conduct. There are also mechanisms in place for complaints to the Commonwealth Ombudsman about actions or decisions of Commonwealth agencies. In other words, if whistleblowers, in the public sector role that they are fulfilling, believe that something has been dealt with inappropriately, they have appropriate mechanisms to be able to report on those matters to the Public Service Commission or to take the matter to the Ombudsman if they believe that people have been derelict in their responsibilities as public servants. It is not a question of saying, ‘I can get a cheap headline in a newspaper one day.' The question of the conduct of officers is not such that they have a broad discretion to wake up one day and say, ‘Today, I feel like I want to be a whistleblower, and I'm going to leak a whole lot of material'-material which it may not be in the public interest to disclose in that way. I make the point that the disclosure of information is not always in the public interest. In some instances, disclosure may be an infringement of an individual's privacy. It can damage reputations. It can be prejudicial to national security. If it relates to budget issues, it would be quite irresponsible to put information of that sort out into the public arena on the basis that you think you have a cause. For that reason-because there are appropriate steps that can be taken by a public servant who is legitimately concerned about issues to explore those issues-the government will not be supporting the proposed second reading amendment. I am aware that members of the opposition have used this debate to make a wide range of claims about a wide range of other issues. In what was meant to be a bipartisan issue, it is disappointing that that has been the case, but I do not suppose that I should have been at all surprised. As mentioned earlier, I do welcome the opposition's support for the bill in principle. It is a significant amendment to evidence law, and it will provide an avenue to protect confidential communications between journalists and their sources. I commend the bill to the House.",73
139,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,EVIDENCE AMENDMENT,The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Barton has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The immediate question is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question. Question agreed to. Original question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading,75
140,Mr RUDDOCK,EVIDENCE AMENDMENT,"by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. NA (STATUTORY AGENCY) BILL 2007 Second Reading Debate resumed from 24 May, on motion by Mr Andrews: That this bill be now read a second time.",75
141,Mr BURKE,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"There are moments in this parliament when we deal with legislation of great moment and have debates that grip the nation. This is not one of those moments. The Migration Amendment (Statutory Agency) Bill 2007 contains but one clause on a simple administrative matter. It is an important clause but it has taken the government some years to bother to draft it. The bill simply formalises the isting administrative arrangements between the two main merit review tribunals for immigration cases-that is, the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal. The one clause in the bill amends the Migration Act to provide that the principal member of the Refugee Review Tribunal together with the registrars, deputy registrars and other officers of the MRT and the RRT who are employed under the Public Service Act will become a statutory agency for the purpose of the Public Service Act 1999. The bill makes the principal member of the Refugee Review Tribunal the head of this statutory agency. For quite some time the two tribunals have been gradually amalgamating their administrative arrangements in order to save money and improve efficiency. The tribunals used to operate as two quite separate and independent tribunals, but increasingly they have been integrating into a single unit. The tribunals' offices have already co-located in both Sydney and Melbourne. They share common registries and common administrative facilities, and members and staff have for some time been cross-appointed to both tribunals. The two tribunals are also prescribed as a single financial entity for the purposes of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. There is a single payroll and set of financial statements. The tribunals have also combined their case management systems. This bill formalises the existing arrangements and makes clear the legal basis on which those tribunals have been operating as a single statutory agency. One of the main legal effects of the bill is that the principal member of the RRT will have the legal authority as the agency head to employ staff and exercise Australian Public Service powers. At the moment the principal member acts on the delegated authority of Mr Andrew Metcalfe, the Secretary of the exDepartment of Immigration and Citizenship, in order to make those decisions. This bill will not change the actual work in practice but will shift the legal basis for those operations. The impetus for this change-when I say ‘impetus', it sounds like something that provides a big push and a rapid movement, although it was not-comes from some time ago, following the Review of corporate governance of statutory authorities and officeholders known as the Uhrig review. The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship acknowledged this in his second reading speech when he said: The … bill …will implement the last of a range of minor changes to the legislative framework of the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal recommended in the Uhrig report … This report was actually handed down in 2003 and, as we have plenty of time, because there is not a lot to talk about in the bill, we will take a moment to look at the chronology of how we actually got here. This bill comes from a promise back in October 2001, at the height of the election campaign, that the government would review statutory authorities because we were in a climate, as we remember, shaped by the collapse of both HIH and OneTel. The public rightly perceived that there was a lack of accountability mechanisms. In particular, there was concern at the time over the monitoring provided by the ACCC. In 2001, the promise was made of a review. In 2002, the Prime Minister finally bothered to commission former Rio Tinto and Westpac chairman John Uhrig AO to review the corporate governance of statutory authorities. His report was presented to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance and Administration in the following year, 2003. It then took until 2004, having been received in 2003, conducted in 2002 and promised in 2001, before the government decided to publicly release the report. The government truly was taking one step at a time-one year per step. At the time of the release of the review, the Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Minchin, stated that all government agencies would be assessed against the templates of the review and those assessments would all be complete by March 2006. So that was another 18 months to figure things out. In an article by Lenore Taylor in the Financial Review on 12 August 2004, the minister acknowledged: “In our last term, there were some events to cause the business community considerable anxiety, mostly centred around the ACCC, and a general sense that the ACCC and a few others had become laws unto themselves, and the ATO was being seen as not properly accountable to the government and the parliament … The quotation continues: “While the heat has gone out of some of those issues now … we think Uhrig has proposed a good and necessary strategy to ensure accountability in structures that have really built up in an ad hoc manner over the years …” Waiting for the heat to go out of the issue from 2001, we are then told that the heat has gone out in 2004. We then wait until it gets really cold in 2006 for the last progress report and we are now here in 2007 finally dealing with a one-clause amendment to legislation that came out of a review promised in the election campaign of 2001. Why have we actually even got here now? There was speculation in the Financial Review in an article by Verona Burgess on 18 May 2007. It was a very brief article but obviously there was not a tremendous amount to report on. It says: We understand the government intends to issue an overview of the whole thing in the near future, and not before time. Once the government decided to do an overview of the progress, they realised that progress has been conducted pretty much at a snail's pace on something that was always going to have bipartisan support. It was never difficult; it simply took time for the government to get around to it. We have the response now and we have legislation which puts in place what is simply prudent policy recommended a very long time ago. To bring the two agencies under one head as a single statutory agency is sensible. It allows a more logical principle than to have everything operating under delegated authority, which is the way it has been happening so far. The opposition are pleased to have an opportunity to speak to legislation that we certainly hoped we would have been speaking to many years ago. But, notwithstanding that, we are here now. It is hardly controversial, it is sensible public policy, the opposition are very pleased to be finally speaking on the legislation and we certainly hope we vote on it this year-that it is this year when the Senate votes on it and this year when it is proclaimed as legislation.",76
142,Mr RANDALL,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I concur with the member for Watson that the Migration Amendment (Statutory Agency) Bill 2007 is a very simple one-item bill which is very simply dealt with. The member has made a succinct summary of the bill. His statement to this House has covered pretty much all of the items that need to be covered in respect of this bill. I am pleased to see that it has bipartisan support and it should go through the House as soon as possible. In relation to the member for Watson's issue about when the bill will eventually get through the parliament, I understand the government has decided to have it implemented by 1 July 2007. If he were here, he would know that I believe that is the intention of the government. I will just briefly mention a few of the issues that have been raised or add to them. This bill provides for the last remaining recommendation of the Uhrig inquiry relating to the MRT and the RRT. Essentially the Migration Amendment (Statutory Agency) Bill, which we are debating today, inserts a new section in the Migration Act 1958 which will establish a single statutory agency for the purposes of the Public Service Act 1999. The proposed agency will consist of a principal member of the Refugee Review Tribunal, RRT, and the registrars, deputy registrars and other officers of both the RRT and the Migration Review Tribunal, MRT, engaged under the Public Service Act. The major change effected by the bill is that under the current statutory arrangements the Australian Public Service employees working at the tribunal are legally employed by the Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, and if the bill is passed-and we know it will be, because the opposition have said that they will support us-the APS staff will instead be employed by the principal member of the RRT. The minister stated in his second reading speech that, for practical purposes, tribunal staff will be directed by the principal member, who is the executive officer of both the tribunals, under powers delegated by the secretary. It is a sensible amalgamation because this arrangement has been in place for some time and it will give legal effect to arrangements that have been just a loose agreement until this time. We know that since 2001 both the MRT and the RRT have been working closely together both from colocation and from administrative efficiencies using the same members, resources, structures, operations and procedures. In particular, the principal member of the MRT and the RRT is, as I said, the same person, as is the registrar. The bill will not change the functions of either tribunal but will simply clarify the employment arrangements of the Australian Public Service staff working at both tribunals. To clarify for the House: the RRT is the body that reviews decisions made by DIAC to refuse or cancel protection visas to noncitizens in Australia. The tribunal also has the power, in respect of certain transitory persons, to conduct an assessment of whether a person is covered by the definition of a refugee in article 1A of the 1951 refugee convention. The RRT was established in 1993. The MRT provides a final independent merits review of visas and visa related decisions made by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship or, more typically, by officers of DIAC acting as delegates of the minister. The MRT has been operating since 1 June 1999. Decisions to deport a person, decisions refusing or cancelling visas on character grounds under section 501 et cetera are reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I think most people would know that Mr Steve Karas AO is the principal member of both tribunals. He was first appointed to this position in July 2001 and his current appointment is until 30 June 2007. I will just briefly raise a couple of issues because we are all on the same page on this. One is that, because the functioning tribunals are co-located, I have found it unsatisfactory that when I have had to make representation on behalf of some people from Western Australia there is no permanent officer located in Perth. I believe there is only one part-time officer there. When people have had to have reviews they have had to do it by teleconference, which is highly unsatisfactory given language barriers et cetera even though there might be interpreters. Also, there was a case I am aware of when one of the review officers-and I will mention his name-a Mr Thomas, was arrogant and gave very little decent support to the person for whom I had written a letter of support. So I am not necessarily happy with all the functions of the tribunal and the way they act. Obviously they are a law unto themselves, but when they receive representations from people such as me and my colleagues I think the representations are dismissed almost out of hand. So I am unhappy from that point of view. As the Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Migration, I have had a lot of issues involving both the MRT and the RRT. I would like to have a better response when I deal with these bodies because in the past it has not always been satisfactory, from my point of view. Be that as it may, this is sible instrument in this House and, as I have said and the member for Watson has said, it is supported and should pass by July this year.",77
143,Ms GAMBARO,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Petrie-Assistant Minister for Immigration and Citizenship) (6.35 pm)-I have great pleasure in summing up for the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship this evening. In doing so, I want to thank the member for Watson and the member for Canning for their contributions to the second reading debate on the Migration Amendment (Statutory Agency) Bill 2007. I agree that it is not a terribly contentious or exciting bill but, nevertheless, it is a very important one. The bill implements the last of a number of minor changes to the governance arrangements for the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal in accordance with the recommendations in the Uhrig report of 2003. It also gives effect to the administrative arrangements for the tribunals which have been in place for a very long time. I stress that this measure does not in any way affect the employment conditions or the entitlements of the Australian Public Service staff working in the tribunals. Employment responsibility for Australian Public Service staff of the tribunals is simply being transferred from the secretary of the department to the principal member of the Refugee Review Tribunal. The bill will not change the functions of the two tribunals under the Migration Act. As previous members have stated, the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal will continue to operate as separate tribunals, but for practical and efficiency purposes they will continue to share common supporting resources. A number of issues were raised in the debate by the member for Watson, one of which is that it has taken a very long time for the implementations to come into effect. That is true; there has been a long process, a senbut I just want to take the House through some of the chronological steps and perhaps the House can see why it has taken such a while. It has been a very intensive consultative process. On 27 June 2003 there was the release of the Review of the corporate governance of the statutory authority and office holders, the Uhrig review. On 12 August 2004 the Minister for Finance and Administration announced the government's response to the Uhrig review, and the response generally endorsed the governance principles and the templates developed in the report. It also announced that the minister would assess statutory authorities and other bodies with their respective portfolio and identify improvements to be made against the recommended governance principles and templates. In August 2005 we had extensive consultation with portfolio bodies and DIAC completed an assessment report of the governance arrangements of the MRT and RRT against the recommended governance principles and templates. The report recommended that some amendments needed to be made. Amendments needed to be made to the Migration Act of 1958 to provide for the purposes of the Public Service Act 1999 that the principal member and the Australian Public Service employees assisting the principal member together constitute a statutory authority and the principal member is the head of that agency. Then of course we had to make amendments to the Financial Management and Accountability Regulations of 1997 to establish a single prescribed agency in respect of the MRT and the RRT instead of having these two separate prescribed bodies and agencies. So the statement of expectation was drafted under the minister's signature. It was mindful at all times to make sure that we kept the tribunal's independence as an administrative review body and the tribunals were requested to respond with a statement of intent, which included some of the important aspects of key performance indicators agreed with the department. Also then we needed to have a statement of expectations and a statement of intent released. On 3 March 2006 the then minister for DIMIA, as it was known, issued a statement of expectations. On 11 April 2006 the tribunal responded with a statement of intent and on 1 July 2006 the recommended amendment to the Financial Management and Accountability Regulations of 1997 came into force. And here we are tonight, because on 24 May 2007 we introduced the Migration Amendment (Statutory Agency) Bill 2007. It has not been a short path but it is one that has got us to where we are this evening debating this legislation. The department has worked consistently to try and develop these templates and principles developed in the Uhrig report and since we announced those endorsements-which actually occurred in 2004-the minister's predecessor at the time, Amanda Vanstone, issued a statement of expectations for the tribunals and they responded again with a statement of intent. The most important thing is that these tribunals have been made a single prescribed agency for the purpose of the Financial Management and Accountability Act. This bill tonight implements the final change in relation to those tribunals, and all the other recommendations in relation to the tribunals have been implemented. Merging the tribunals would move beyond the scope of the recommendations and it would also involve an extensive restructuring of the Migration Act, and that is one of the reasons why the tribunals are not being merged. Previous speakers spoke about that tonight. If there is a strong business case for merging the tribunals into one tribunal that will need to be looked at in the future and any proposal regarding merging the tribunals would of course require wide consultation and would have to be managed so as not to disadvantage the merit review applicants. I support the bill tonight and I am very pleased to be speaking on behalf of the minister to the Migration Amendment (Statutory Agency) Bill 2007. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

145,Ms MACKLIN,MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND OTHER,"Jagajaga) (6.42 pm)The Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Management System and Other Measures) Bill 2007 paves the way for the introduction of the new childcare management system. First announced in the 2006 budget, the new management system will require all childcare service operators to come online and establish new electronic reporting arrangements with the Commonwealth government. The new system will be rolled out from 1 July 2007 over two years with a budget of $82.6 million. Labor supports the new Child Care Management System and we support this bill. We believe that the new system has great potential to provide more accurate and timely information about the supply of child care in Australia including usage patterns and vacancy information. The system could also improve information to parents about their benefit entitlements. Used effectively, the new management system could bring substantial benefits to the provision of child care in Australia. We remain to be convinced, however, that the government will use the capacity of the new system effectively. We are not convinced about the government's approach to this management system because of their attitude towards child care, which leaves much to be desired. Just six months ago after the Commonwealth Treasury said that parents were being too choosy and that child care was affordable, the Treasurer's budget did give belated and, we would say, insufficient recognition to the problems that many Australian families have with childcare costs. The government has taken no action on childcare access and has no plans to improve early learning and development for our children. Given these shortcomings in the government's approach to early childhood development, I move the opposition amendment: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes that: (1) child care out of pocket costs are increasing five times faster than average prices for all goods and services; (2) for the past four years, child care out of pocket costs have increased by more than 12 per cent each year; (3) as a result of these increases, child care is becoming less affordable for Australian families; (4) despite the international consensus on the benefits of early childhood education, Australia ranks last in the OECD on the percentage of GDP spent on pre-primary education; (5) there are currently 100,000 four years olds in Australia that do not attend preschool; and (6) the current Government has no policy agenda to provide preschool to all Australian four year olds”. The new Child Care Management System will significantly change the nature of the administrative relationship between childcare operators and the Commonwealth government, particularly in relation to the payment of the childcare benefit. About 96 per cent of Australian families take that childcare benefit as fee relief paid to their childcare centres. So while CCB is an entitlement for families, it is overwhelmingly paid by the government to approved childcare service operators. Currently services are paid their CCB fee relief on an advance and acquittal basis four times a year with an annual reconciliation. The new management system introduces a new payment method for CCB. Under the changes proposed in this bill, payments will now be made weekly in arrears based on a child's actual attendance in the previous week. Services will now be required to submit attendance records for each child to the Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs weekly via the internet. The department will then pay the appropriate amount of childcare benefit to services to pass on to parents as fee relief. This is a very significant change for providers. To help operators with any cash flow issues arising from the change to a payment in arrears system the government has proposed that providers will receive an enrolment advance for each child. This advance, which amounts to one week's maximum rate of childcare benefit per child, will be required to be acquitted once the child leaves that operator's care. Labor welcomes the introduction of this advance to help operators with their ongoing cash flow issues. The new system also requires all communication between childcare providers and the government to be online. It requires providers to have appropriate information and communications technology and to make sure their staff are trained in how to use it. The weekly electronic reporting of attendance might become a significant issue for some providers. The entry and exit times for each child will be required to be entered into a computer either manually or through a swipe card system where parents log every child in and out every time they pick them up or drop them off. Labor recognises that there is a lack of appropriately qualified and experienced childcare staff. The National Children's Services Workforce Study of July 2006 found: Overall, there is a projected net shortfall of staff by 2013. Long day care has an estimated shortfall of 6,490 staff by 2013, outside school hours/vacation care are projected to have a shortfall of 1,011 staff, and occasional care services have a projected shortfall of 894 staff. This study shows that the government needs to act not only on the staff shortages, starting with the development of a workforce strategy, but also on the weekly reporting requirements, which will require staff to do a lot of data entry, and this will provide an extra burden on the staff resources for all childcare providers. We certainly hope that the quality of care our children receive will not suffer as a result. We know that the minister for families has already floated the idea of using the government's new access card for this new swipe in and out of services. It is no big leap of logic to see how the government would say: ‘You might as well use the access card system to gather this information. Parents could just swipe in and out with that.' It is very possible that the government could require that parents of the almost 600,000 children in formal care who receive the childcare benefit each year use an access card every day. We know that the government last week delayed the introduction of the new access card but we also know that this delay is purely political, designed to remove this as a political difficulty before the coming election. All Australian families deserve to know before the election what plans the government have for the access card, and especially what plans they have to connect the access card to this new childcare management system. One positive for parents in the implementation of the new management system is that it will give parents better information on their benefits. One new function of the system is the provision of an online statement from Centrelink detailing childcare benefit payments made on behalf of families to their 7,320 childcare service. This should improve information available to parents. We also hope that the move to the payment in arrears system will make sure that CCB calculations are more timely, accurate and, very importantly, reduce childcare benefit overpayments. Under questioning by opposition senators during recent estimates hearings, departmental officials admitted that in the last financial year around 124,000 families were hit with an average of $309 in childcare benefit debt. That is a total of over $38 million in CCB overpayments. This is in addition to the $140 million overpayments families faced through the family tax benefit system. On this side of the House we certainly understand that family budgets are under significant pressure as a result of recent mortgage increases, spiralling credit card and household debt, rising childcare fees and, most recently, record petrol prices. We certainly support the changed payment arrangements in the new management system and hope that it is able to reduce this overpayment burden on families. On the question of what benefits the new management system will bring to childcare planning, the government has remained silent. There is concern that the current design of the management system does not provide the government and the childcare sector with the necessary information about childcare demand and does not relate this demand to current availability of places to assist future planning. We would hope to see some further information from the government about how this management system can be better used in that regard. While this bill introduces new fines for services which do not give required information to the childcare access hotline, the government has given no indication that it will use the new information it is gathering quickly and accurately to help better identify present and future needs for child care. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Human Services recently tabled its report, Balancing work and family. The report noted: Unfortunately, given the economic importance of child care provision, some Australian families are experiencing problems in accessing affordable care. The government does not seem to have listened to the findings from this House of Representatives report. We have seen the government completely abandon all planning issues in the provision of child care in Australia. It continues to deny that parents are facing any difficulties in securing a place for their child, especially one that might specifically meet their needs. Labor know that there are significant problems faced by parents. Many parents have very significant challenges in securing a place for their child. We believe that the substantial investment being made in this new management system should, in addition, be focused on gathering and analysing the information necessary to improve the planning and provision of child care in Australia. Schedule 1 of the bill introduces three new sanctions for failure of an approved childcare service to comply with conditions of continued approval to receive childcare benefit. These new sanctions relate to the new enrolment advance and can require repayment of the advance, suspension from eligibility to receive the advance and suspension from eligibility to receive childcare benefit. Schedule 2 of the bill introduces a civil penalty and infringement notice system for childcare operators. Family assistance law currently provides for criminal penalties but not civil penalties. These new sections impose, for the first time, a civil penalty system on childcare operators. With the introduction of the new civil penalty provisions, childcare operators and individuals face fines if they breach any of the obligations in these particular sections of the bill. These new civil penalties are currently limited to situations where childcare services fail to give the childcare access hotline information on the places that they have available within the required time-frame as set down by the secretary. Aiding and abetting the withholding of information also renders an individual liable. These new fines impose an initial layer of sanction upon operators who continually fail to provide information to government on their vacancies. Infringement notices are the first step followed by more substantial fines if the problems continue. Labor support an infringement regime that introduces this intermediate layer of sanction in between ‘no action' and ‘complete suspension of an operator'. We know that the suspension of an operator's approval has a major impact on families and this new fine system will provide an incentive to improve compliance by operators with the requirements under family assistance law. Schedule 3 of the bill contains a range of other miscellaneous amendments. These include the introduction of a rebuttable presumption that a child is a school child once they turn six for the purposes of family assistance law and childcare benefit. A school child who, generally, is attending outside school-hours care is only entitled to 85 per cent of the relevant childcare benefit. New provisions give the departmental secretary the power to immediately suspend a childcare service. Under current provisions, the secretary must give notice of sanction, including suspension, to providers and ask them to show cause. The new provisions allow for the immediate suspension when the operator fails to comply with Commonwealth, state or territory law relating to care-for example, if their licence is suspended by the state, Commonwealth approval is also withdrawn; the departmental secretary believes there is an imminent threat to the health or safety of a child; and, in urgent circumstances, where it is no longer appropriate for the operator to provide care-for example, if it were on contaminated land. Suspension does not result in permanent cancellation of approval to receive childcare benefit. Suspension means that an operator does not receive childcare benefit for the period of the suspension and can no longer provide fee relief to parents. New amendments also give the secretary of the department the power to inform parents who are using a childcare service that the service no longer complies with family assistance law and is being sanctioned. No such power currently exists. This information sharing is important for parents as they are not entitled to receive childcare benefit in respect of care at a suspended service. High quality and accessible child care in Australia is of fundamental importance to Australian families. Labor has argued strongly for many years that the government has the responsibility to support families with the costs of caring for their children yet, time and time again, Australian families have been told by this government that there is no problem. As I said before, Treasury has said that families have been too choosy. The Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs claims that families are spending less of their household income on child care. Families know that they are paying more and more for their childcare costs. At the same time, we have had the Prime Minister telling families that they have never had it so good. This is yet another demonstration of just how out of touch this government has become. Families child know how costly child care is, even if the government does not. Childcare costs are rising five times faster than the average cost of all other goods and services. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, out-ofpocket childcare costs for families in the last four years have increased by 12.7 per cent, then 12 per cent, then another 12 per cent and then, finally in the last year, 13 per cent. Independent analysis by Saul Eslake from the ANZ Bank, undertaken for the Taskforce on Care Costs, shows that child care affordability has declined by 50 per cent in the last five years. This year, after denying there is any problem-and as we have seen so many times from this government-and just five minutes before the election, the government decided to give families a one-off bonus increase. Families know that they have carried very heavy costs for the last four years. Labor welcome the increase as a belated recognition of the challenges that families face, but we continue to be concerned that the government has failed to provide the ongoing relief that families really need. We are worried that what will happen is what happened four years ago: the bonus will quickly be overtaken by increased costs. It does seem that the minister is also concerned. He was reported on Saturday as saying that if any service operator did the wrong thing by increasing their fees to completely absorb this increase in childcare benefit the government ‘was not going to be a casual bystander'. We certainly hope the minister stands true to his word. I ask that he, when he comes into this House and is summing up this legislation, detail if he has been made aware of any operators increasing their fees in this way and also inform the House of what action his government will take so that it is not just a ‘casual bystander'. I must say one area where the government most certainly is a casual bystander is early childhood education. The government is doing absolutely nothing for the 100,000 Australian four-year-olds who do not attend preschool. Under this government, Australia spends the least in the OECD on preprimary education. Our spending is just 0.1 per cent of GDP, compared to the OECD average of 0.5 per cent. The government's whole approach to early childhood is a mess: no coherent policy agenda whatsoever and no clear directions. If anything, it is all about just passing the buck and saying that it is the state governments' responsibility. We have heard, though, that the federal Minister for Education, Science and Training does think that early education is important. She says that she wants all four-year-olds to have a preschool education. But, on the other hand, in the same government we have got the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs saying child care has nothing to do with early education. In his view, all he is responsible for is providing care. By contrast, the government refuses to recognise what the opposition are putting forward. Labor have put forward fresh policy ideas showing a new direction for early childhood education. The Leader of the Opposition understands the importance of early childhood education and knows, as every parent knows, how critical it is to provide the best future for Australia's children. Labor have committed to providing all four-yearolds in Australia-that is, each and every one of them-with 15 hours of early learning a week for up to 40 weeks a year. We will provide $450 million each year in new Commonwealth spending to make sure that this occurs and we will also guarantee that this service expansion does not increase fees for parents. Most importantly, we understandunlike the minister for families-that early education and care should be integrated across all service types. We know, as parents know, that you do not stop learning when you are in a place that the government calls child care. Our children are always ready to learn. Labor believe that early childhood programs are an opportunity for the foundational growth that all Australian children should have. Our views are backed by yet another study, one published just last month by Professor Robert Lynch, Chair of the Department of Economics at Washington College in the United States, and called Enriching Children, Enriching the Nation. I want to finish by quoting him: ... investment in early childhood education, even when its benefits are not fully accounted for, effective public policy strategy for generating wealth and achieving a multitude of social and economic development objectives. A nationwide commitment to high-quality early childhood education would cost a significant amount of money upfront, but it would have a substantial pay off in the future as such a program would ultimately reduce costs for remedial and special education, criminal justice, and child welfare, and it would increase income earned and taxes paid. Labor support these findings. Unfortunately for Australian children, the Howard government does not.",81
146,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND OTHER,Mr Quick)Is the amendment seconded? Ms George-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,86
147,Mr FAWCETT,MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND OTHER,"I rise to address the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Management System and Other Measures) Bill 2007 as tabled by the minister. As the opposition has outlined, this bill is predominantly meant to make amendments to family assistance law for the purposes of a new online childcare management system. There are a number of reasons for this system and there are a number of benefits that will flow from it. Today I wish to talk through some of the measures that are in this bill, some of the context that has led to this bill and some of the people who have been involved in developing it. This Child Care Management System will standardise and simplify childcare benefit administration and reduce the time taken for payments. In particular, it will increase the timeliness of information which is provided to the government and parents. This is important for a range of purposes including calculating the amount of benefit that is to be paid to parents and also for planning, to understand in the short term where vacancies are in different childcare centres around the country and in the long term for local govis an ernment authorities, who determine where centres can be built, to get a feel for the supply and demand factors that are actually taking place. Amendments are also made to the absence provisions, the provisions relating to the way the hours of care are calculated for childcare benefits, and to the part-time percentage rate component of childcare benefits. Further amendments will introduce three new sanctions for the failure of a childcare service to comply with the conditions of continued approval. There is also a civil penalty and infringement notice system introduced in this bill. Finally, there are some amendments that deal with information-gathering powers and the location of records and further amendments that will reduce the overpayment of childcare benefits. That is of considerable importance to families in my electorate of Wakefield. I would like to address the context of why this bill is being introduced and, in particular, why child care is important. I had the privilege last year of participating in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Human Services inquiry into balancing work and family, whose report was tabled in this House on 7 December last year. One of the things that came out of that, in terms of balancing work and family, was that there is a great multitude of factors and that no two individual families face identical circumstances. One of the themes that occurred time and again in the submissions supplied to the committee-and in fact a whole chapter has been dedicated to it in the report-was choice and flexibility in child care. Some two-thirds of the submissions received made comment on child care, particularly its accessibility and affordability and its impact on the ability of parents, especially women and single parents, to participate in the workforce. In 2005 the Australian Bureau of Statistics found that in any given school week some 35 per cent of Australian children aged zero to four received formal child care and some 38 per cent received informal care. Those numbers vary a little with age and location, but gives a very strong sense that the amount of child care has a strong influence on people's ability to work, particularly when it comes to long day care, family day care, outside school hours care, occasional care and vacation care. The percentage of long day care, family day care, outside school hours care and vacation care that is work related ranges from 88 per cent-which is the lowest amount for family day care-through to 97 per cent for outside school hours care. Long day care is around 90 per cent. So there is a very strong correlation between accessing those types of day care and people's ability to be involved in the workforce. The costs reflect a number of local characteristics of supply and demand as well as state requirements, which may influence fees through things like staffing ratios, licensing, wages and whether additional services are charged for things like nappies and meals. Those costs vary greatly across Australia. One of the ways to reduce those costs is to have better management of the systems. As we have engaged with childcare providers there have been a number of areas where they have called for additional funding, some of which is one-off funding. As part of the context of understanding where we are at with child care, it is important to recognise the initiatives that this government has taken to make child care more affordable and accessible and a quality system for our children. For example, just this month some $4½ million in one-off equipment grants has been provided to 360 childcare services around Australia to help them replace or upgrade equipment. This childcare support program looks to support childcare centres that are primarily located in rural, remote or Indigenous communities. These can include mobile childcare services as well as multifunctional Aboriginal childcare services. I welcome that funding, which has gone to one of the mobile it childcare services that work with disadvantaged families in my electorate of Wakefield, and they do an outstanding job. It is also important to note that in this year's budget there have been some significant developments for families. Overall the Howard government will be contributing more than 50 per cent toward the vast majority of families' formal childcare costs, following the $2.1 billion in additional investment in child care in the recent budget. The Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affair's post-budget modelling found that, particularly for long day care-and remember that around 90 per cent of that is related to people using it for work-between 55 per cent and 93 per cent of the fee will be subsidised by the government as a result of the increase in childcare benefit and the improvement in the childcare tax rebate. For some low-income families that are looking to return to work and are receiving the JET childcare fee assistance, the government contributes more than 98 per cent of the cost of child care. A common example that came up through the modelling was that a working family with a combined income of around $60,000 using part-time care for one or two children had between 55 and 79 per cent of their fees subsidised, depending on the centre that they used. So the changes that this government has brought in are actually finding ways to target the aid that we need to give to the people who need it, particularly to re-enter, train for and engage in the workforce. Interestingly, the modelling supports the OECD findings that show that Australia has higher levels of subsidies supporting parents' childcare choices than comparable nations. The OECD estimates that the government contributes on average around 60 per cent of parents' childcare costs, whereas other comparable nations in the OECD were more likely to contribute about one-third. The budget also includes a number of things such as bringing forward the payment of the childcare tax rebate. That will be provided as a direct payment soon after the financial year in which the costs are incurred, and that is a significant benefit to those lies who previously did not benefit from it through their tax return. There are a number of other measures that the government has taken, such as the extra $15.4 million for the Jobs Education and Training-or JETchildcare fee assistance and the $71.3 million for the inclusion support subsidy that allows some 3,000 extra children with high needs, particularly those with a disability, to be included in child care. As we await the state government responses to the Commonwealth government's offer of matching unmet need in the area of disabilities dollar for dollar, look forward to their contribution. I welcome this budget measure to make more child care available to families with children with a disability. Overall this budget builds on the record in child care of the Howard government, which has more than doubled the funding of the previous Labor government and has massively increased the supply of places, which are now uncapped for 99 per cent of the sector. I cannot emphasise enough how important that uncapping is when I look at the community of Clare in my own electorate of Wakefield, where there was one childcare centre. Interestingly, going back to 1997, when the Hon. Judi Moylan was the minister and the Hon. Rob Lucas was the Minister for Education and Children's Services in the then Liberal South Australian government, they jointly put in half a million dollars to establish the first childcare centre in Clare, which had around 31 places. But, when I left the military and started working as a candidate, we found that the waiting list in Clare was some 90 children. Through the government's decision to uncap places, we found that the market responded and there is now a brand new childcare centre open in Clare. In fact, there are now vacancies in the childcare centres there. The feedback I have had from childcare fami- centres in Gawler, as well as around the Elizabeth area, is that there are vacancies in a number of the centres. In fact, some of the operators are saying that we should recap places, because they have concerns about their viability going forward because those places have been uncapped. I welcome the fact that we are still providing the sustainability grants to regional communities. In Kapunda, for example, another half a million dollar grant has enabled them to establish a childcare centre at the hospital and it will, over a number of years, build up the number we of children using that service until it becomes viable. So this government has doubled the amount of expenditure on child care. It has a vision to provide quality, accessible child care moving into the future. But there are some problems with it, and that is why we are looking at the Child Care Management System. The problems particularly come back to the fact that childcare services regularly exchange significant amounts of information with the government. This has been predominantly done by mail, whether it be in letters, on disks or in paper form. The usage data has been provided on a quarterly basis, and this time-lag makes it very difficult to use the information effectively for decision making and planning, whether that be at a family level or, particularly, at the government level. Things like the phone-in service to look at vacancies have certainly helped this, but this system will provide even more up-to-date data. Currently, expenditure data can be anything up to 12 or 18 months old by the time it is available for decision making, planning and budgeting. There is a heavy reliance on manual forms, particularly with the interaction between the childcare services, the Family Assistance Office and FaCSIA. That has a large impact on the efficiency of the system. The other thing that we have noticed with the manual reporting and using of forms is that there has been fraud. In my introductory remarks I noted the fact that this bill brings in a number of new compliance measures. In 2006, there were a number of audits conducted and, whilst the majority of operators do the right thing and they provide quality care for the children in our community, there are some operators throughout the system who have rorted it. They have taken advantage of the money that has been spent by the government and there have been compliance issues which we obviously need to address to make sure that taxpayers' dollars are going the purpose that is intended. Some media reports estimate that it could have been anything up to $100 million that was rorted under the previous system. There is obviously a strong incentive to implement this new system. Three options were considered by the department, but the Child Care Management System was the option chosen. It will establish an interface that will be used to report actual usage data by childcare services on a weekly basis. It will remove all the existing manual reporting processes and reduce government resources required for data validation. The advance and acquit system will be replaced by a weekly arrears payment cycle based on actual usage data. This is one of the factors that will help to reduce overpayments of families, and that is quite a crucial thing in terms of looking after people in my electorate of Wakefield. The data will be of greater detail, and it will include weekly usage and fees charged in a very close to real time environment. The administrative burden on childcare services, importantly, will also be reduced because it will reduce the need for those services to calculate the parent's childcare benefit reductions. Obviously there will be some providers who need some assistance with implementing this system, and the government will be providing assistance with software upgrades and internet connection. Some centres will have to be brought online for the very first time, and we are looking at providing funds for them to purchase computers where required. There have also been some concerns raised about whether the company will have a float, if you like, to see them through the peaks and troughs. So the system will include an enrolment amount, which will be paid to the service when they enrol a child. While that childcare service continues to provide the care, that amount will be retained to by the childcare service. When the child care ceases then that amount will be repaid. As I mentioned in respect of the operational functions, the Family Assistance Office will continue to be responsible for determining childcare eligibility, the family entitlement and interacting with families. But, in the majority of cases, it will no longer have the direct relationship with the childcare services. FaCSIA will assume that responsibility for making payments to the childcare services and monitoring compliance based on that entitlement information. This has not been done in isolation. There has been a broad range of consultation. Back in November 2006 there were a number of documents released around this proposal. They were released both on the website and by being sent out to agencies. Consultation forums were conducted in all capital cities throughout 2006. Two reference groups have also been established: the industry reference group, with childcare services from across the sector-both community based services and for-profit services-and a technical reference group, which is working with the software providers. Whilst some people have been saying about this user technology, ‘Parents will be scared off by the fact that their children are going to be clocked in and out,' in the modern day that is certainly not the case. I refer in particular to a childcare centre in Sydney, the Building Blocks Early Childhood Learning Centre. They have gone the whole nine yards. They have security devices based on biometric screening so that they can check exactly who is picking up or dropping off a child. There is monitoring to make sure that there can be no false accusations against the staff and also so there is peace of mind about what has happened if there is an incident. And the parents welcome that use of technology-the service and the security that is provided to their children. The software industry is also well and truly gearing up for this. In fact, I notice one supplier already has a product out called the Child Care Management System. It is obviously looking to market that to the sector. Feedback from the sector, through consultation, has been positive. Most have supported the development of the CCMS, particularly because they see that it will assist them in managing information and will simplify their involvement in the CCB. They have been very positive about the replacement of letters from Centrelink with the electronic messaging system. In summary, the Child Care Management System is going to be a significant investment, improving accountability and the supply of information across the childcare sector. It is going to provide the best information on childcare supply and usage. It is going to simplify and standardise the administration of childcare benefits for families. It is going to reduce the administrative burden on childcare services. Importantly, it is also going to protect the integrity of payments made in support of families using child care. I certainly support this bill. I note the comments from the opposition about early learning. The government support early learning. We recognise the importance of early learning and the invaluable role that early learning plays in setting up children for life. Whether that is best linked in a formal sense with child care is a matter for discussion. There are preschools at the moment that provide that education. They do that only for 10 or 15 hours per week. They normally do not operate during school holidays et cetera. So there is not a direct link to the requirements of day care, which has much longer hours and operates throughout the year. But there certainly is scope to see how we can get better early learning outcomes, whether through child care or even kindergartens, if they want to do that. Because of uncapped places there is nothing that preventing preschools and kindergartens from becoming approved, providing approved care and therefore being eligible to claim the full entitlement to CCB and the childcare tax rebate. So there are options that are provided by the framework that this government has put in place. I commend this bill to the House.",86
148,Ms HALL,MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND OTHER,"At the commencement of my contribution to this debate on the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Management System and Other Measures) Bill 2007 I would like to pick up a couple of issues raised by the previous speaker, the member for Wakefield. Firstly, he highlighted that there had been widespread consultation. The paper was released in November and the ability to be involved in the consultations ended in December-one month later. Widespread consultation? It was only in capital cities. resent an electorate that is not in a capital city and I know that there were providers of child care within my electorate who were very unhappy with the consultation process. I would like to point out to the honourable member for Wakefield that it was not widespread consultation; it was very limited consultation and there were many people involved in child care who were unhappy with it. I would like to put before the House the idea that the nation's most precious resource is its children. Children are the future of our nation. By investing in our children we are in actual fact investing in our nation. It is very disturbing to see that the government do not realise the true economic advantage of investing in children and child care. If they did, they would realise that it is one area where you make a maximum investment rather than holding back, because it gives an enormous return to the nation. Educate your children when they are young and you reap the benefits of that later as a nation. It is very sad that Australia ranks last among the OECD countries on the percentage of GDP that is spent on pre-primary education. Anyone who knows or understands anything about education can tell you that the time that a child learns the most is at that pre-primary school age. That is the time when children are most receptive to learning. I would have to argue that it is a missed opportunity if you scrimp in that area and do not provide the maximum learning opportunity for our young children. I re-emphasise the fact that our OECD ranking is very sad. I will talk a little more about the second reading amendment later in my contribution to the debate. The legislation that we have before us tonight provides for the implementation of the new Child Care Management System. It is a significant change to the way in which childcare operators interact with the I repgovernment. It changes from an advanceacquit system to a system of payment in arrears based on actual attendance, with services now required to submit weekly attendance records. To facilitate the introduction of this new scheme, many rules on childcare benefits have been changed, such as allowable absences, the calculation of part-time percentages and the introduction of new sanctions for failure by services to comply with the conditions. The legislation introduces civil penalties and an infringement notice scheme for childcare service operators who fail to comply with the obligations imposed by family assistance law. The penalty scheme is to commence on 1 July. Today is 12 June. Today we are debating legislation that commences on 1 July. To be quite frank with you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I find that absolutely disgraceful. This government likes to bring things into the House and rush them through at the last minute. I think that this really impacts on the ability to give due consideration to legislation. The implementation of the new scheme will cause significant changes to the administration of childcare benefits. It restructures the relationship between the government and childcare service operators. It has the potential for significant implementation difficulties. Far from what the previous speaker said about the childcare sector welcoming it and uniformly accepting it, there has been a very mixed response to this legislation. The first point I made was about the lack of consultation. That is one of the areas where there has been a very mixed response. I want to share with the House a response that I have received from a childcare provider in my electorate. This is a very reputable childcare provider; it is a private provider that operates four childcare centres. They say that the new management system will require centres to inform Centrelink and FaCSIA of children's attendance details-that is, when they arrive, when they leave and the actual hours that they are in attendance. This report has got to be done on a weekly basis. This information will have to be keyed into the system manually, and compliance will be very time-consuming, quite expensive, and it will take the centre management away from core duties. Parents will be able to access CCB made to the centre on their behalf online, but the childcare provider asks: will they be able to access information as to how they were calculated? If they do have access to this information, will they understand it? She highlights the fact that the CCB is currently paid monthly in advance and, under the new system, it will be paid weekly in arrears. You might ask what this will mean to someone like the provider of quality child care in my electorate. She points out that currently payments in advance are automatic, and adjustments and corrections are made after the claim is submitted. Under the Child Care Management System, payments will not be initiated until after the claim has been submitted. The impact on the flow of working capital in centres is enormous. Members need to think about that. The software package that this childcare centre uses is not designed to function in this way, and I would suggest that that would be the case with many centres. They will need to buy new software packages-because I am sure the government is not going to pay for them-and pay for training to utilise the software. Once again, it is throwing extra costs onto the provider, but I believe that cost will be passed on to the parents of the children attending the centres. The provider I am talking about is in Lake Macquarie, in the Hunter part of the Shortland electorate. The Hunter payment team receives 75 per cent of its CCB claims electronically, and the Hunter payment team has the highest percentage of claims of all payment teams in Australia. Here we have an area where these payments are being assessed electronically, but now the whole system has to be turned around. Even though 75 per cent of claims are submitted electronically, a significant proportion still submit manual claims-and it is much higher nationwide than it is in the Hunter. Some services do not even have computers, so again that is going to be an enormous cost to those centres. There is no allowance in the Child Care Management System for alternative submission methods, and I ask the government: how will services that do not have access to the internet be able to cope with this change? With the Child Care Management System, all attendance details will have to be entered and submitted manually. I understand, from talking to childcare providers in my electorate, that this information is then handed to not one but three government departments: FaCSIA, Centrelink and the FAO, and then it goes back to FaCSIA before the service is actually paid for. To my way of thinking that is not a streamlined service. That is not a service that will work better; it is a very convoluted service that is going to be timeconsuming, bureaucratic and full of red tape. The services have been told that there is going to be a 48-hour turnaround, but the provider that I spoke to believes that this is going to be impossible. She feels that it will be more like six to eight working days. If I look at the way the services currently operate, at the processing times and the variety of tasks that Centrelink has, I think that it is going be very difficult for them to be able to work with these other departments and turn it around in 48 hours-simply because they do not have the staff or the resources to do that. And we are talking about three departments that are in very similar situations. Under the Child Care Management System, centres will receive one week's CCB at the end of the first week. Once the data has been processed they can calculate the usage during this time, but until that happens there will be no CCB to cover the centres. The childcare provider told me that this will have an enormous financial impact on her business. It could be as great as $18,000 a week, and this is all working capital for the business each week. If the payments take up to eight days, the business could be owed between $30,000 and $35,000. I think that these are very real concerns that my constituent has put to me. I know that she is a very caring person and she really cares about the children and the parents who use her centre. She will be put in the position where she will have to reassess how she charges her parents. Currently parents pay the gap in the weekly amount; but if it turns out that this system becomes very expensive, parents will be forced to pay full fees up front and then be reimbursed once the childcare centre receives their payment. This will disadvantage parentsparticularly those parents who are on a low income. If it operates in the way that my constituent is concerned it will, the financial viability of services will be affected. The requiring of the electronic recording of all arrivals and departures and the fact that the new system will provide online access to benefits will in some ways benefit some parents. But the thing that I am really concerned about is the potential for the costs of child care to increase for parents who are already struggling to pay their childcare bills. Into variably, people have to pay for child care because both parents are forced to work due to the high cost of living under the Howard government. It would be a real concern if childcare fees were going to increase because of the cost of implementing this system. Under the Howard government, as is pointed out in the amendment moved by the shadow minister, childcare out-of-pocket costs are increasing five times faster than the average price for all goods and services. That is incredible. And we are asking struggling families to pay those increased out-of-pocket expenses. Over the last four years, childcare out-of-pocket expenses have increased by a minimum of 12 per cent, with the increase in some years being 13 per cent. The government needs to look at that issue and at the costs families are incurring. In my own state of New South Wales, the average childcare fee is $274 per week. I hear of families who look to cut the cost of their child care by each parent working a four-day week so they can cut their child care back to three days a week and make it affordable. They find that this is one way that they can try to get around it-by reducing their hours. I draw the attention of the House to the independent analysis by Saul Eslake of the ANZ Bank for the Taskforce on Care Costs. He showed that childcare affordability has declined by 50 per cent in the last five years. This is what we are asking young families to pay. I was speaking to a young person last night who is considering starting a family. This young woman said to me that the single biggest issue is the cost of child care. The other issue that she highlighted to me was the availability of places. I know that many mothers go and put their child's name on the waiting list for childcare centres immediately after having that child. My son went and put his child's name on the waiting list within weeks of the child being born because his family was in a situation where the mother needed to return to work so that they could meet their mortgage repayments. It is very sad that it has to be done at that stage. heard of instances of mothers going along and putting their name down on a waiting list for child care the moment that they find that they are pregnant. While the government may say that the issue of availability is not one that is having an impact in the community, I would have to say that there are definitely areas where availability is a big issue. The other big issue-the key issue-is affordability. The government is not addressing that issue here. It is not clear how the proposal that we have before us will operate. The proposal is quite bureaucratic; quite a lot of red tape is involved in it. There was not the level of community consultation on this proposal that I would liked to have seen. This proposal leaves providers like the quality provider in my electorate unsure about where this will take them. We on this side of the House see that it has the potential to be quite beneficial if it is implemented properly. There are questions that need to be answered by the government. It is imperative that the government makes a commitment to early childhood education and a commitment to providing universal education to all Australians under four-as the ALP has done in its policy statement. The ALP recognises the fact that 100,000 four-year-olds missing out on early childhood education is not good enough and that Australia ranking bottom of the pile in the OECD on the proportion of GDP spent on early childhood education is not good enough. The government stands condemned for that.",91
149,Mr HENRY,MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND OTHER,"The Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Management System and Other Measures) Bill 2007 is an important government initiative in meeting its commitment to Australian families and their childcare needs. These amendments to the family assistance legislation will assist in creating a I have new online based management system, the Child Care Management System, or CCMS. This system will be a significant investment in improving accountability and in the provision of information across the childcare sector. It will standardise and simplify the current, largely paper based, childcare benefit administration processes and significantly reduce the time in which payments are made to approved childcare service providers. It will also improve and enhance the management of childcare benefit entitlements for families. It will reduce the administrative burden on childcare service providers; however, it will also represent a significant change in the way service providers interact with the Australian government-a change for the better. This new system will be progressively introduced through childcare service providers from 1 July 2007 for up to a period of two years across Australia. Child care has changed dramatically in Australia over the past 20 years or so since the early 1990s, when most centres were operated by not-for-profit organisations or, in some cases, by local government organisations. Child care was most often provided by a community childcare centre which operated as not for profit and was often run by parents for parents. An example of childcare facilities available at that time includes my family's thoroughly good experience with our two daughters at the Citiplace Child Care Centre located adjacent to the Perth city railway station. This excellent centre was developed by the city of Perth, providing an excellent service with wonderful, caring staff and an excellent manager, with care and facilities second to none. Indeed, some of these highly proficient staff are still working at the centre today and maintaining their excellent level of care and support. This centre aims to provide quality care for children and a happy and secure environment. It recognises that each child has individual needs, and every endeavour is made to accommodate those needs. Its programs take into account the different developmental levels of the children, and an environment is created to allow each child to explore in their own time. Carers at the centre and families all work together to achieve the best outcomes, recognising this essential service is a great support for families and working parents. However, back then demand for places in childcare facilities was not as great because, as I am sure members on the other side of this House will appreciate, we had the highest levels of unemployment, the highest levels of inflation and mortgage interest rates over 17 per cent. It was interesting to hear the great lament by the previous speaker, the member for Shortland, about the challenges. The reality is that 11 years ago Labor had opportunities to do things for child care and parents and they did nothing. It is only since 1996 and the Howard government that things have changed a lot for the better as far as families and parents with children in child care are concerned. Now in Western Australia unemployment is less than 2.4 per cent, and lots of families in my electorate of Hasluck are in the workforce and looking for childcare places for long day care, outside school hours care, occasional care and, in some cases, in-home care, which is now much more readily available. The Howard government has been the best friend working families have ever had in ensuring positive choice for families in balancing work and family commitments by providing an increasing level of financial support to underpin these choices. I am sure that many Hasluck and Australian families will remember the Labor government years. I have already mentioned the high levels of unemployment and even higher interest rates-they were a disaster for Australian families. It should also be noted that childcare fees rose at twice the rate under the then Labor government, and, as my wife and I appreciate only too well, Labor did not provide a childcare benefit or the childcare tax rebate as the Howard government has since done. Mothers and families did not have any options under Labor on returning to work or getting support for child care. Child care was a very expensive exercise, with those who gained employment achieving very little after paying childcare fees from their weekly pay packets, in many cases leaving families questioning the value of the exercise. If we look at the Howard government's record, we see significant and progressive improvement since 1996, with spending on child care increasing threefold and with budget estimates that a further $11 billion will be spent over the next four years. The number of approved childcare places has doubled from some 300,000 in 1996 to over 615,000 in 2006. Across Australia there are over a million children now placed in child care with some 100,000 to 140,000 childcare vacancies existing across Australia, which is a great testament to the Howard government's program that ensures places are available for those who need them. Let us look at what else this government has done for families. On average, families receive over $2,000 per annum in childcare benefit, working families can claim up to $4,211 per child under the childcare tax rebate and on average families are also receiving $8,300, including supplements, in family tax benefit. We also have the non means tested maternity payment or baby bonus of $4,100 on the birth of a child. By any measure these are very significant increases in benefits and support for Australian families. The next step in locking in the gains since 1996 and ensuring the future for families is to introduce the new electronic Child Care Management System, a new computer based system designed to bring the processing of claims in enrolments into the much more efficient computer age. Currently this information transfer is undertaken by way of the post. It is both time-consuming and inefficient. In this day and age the current system is not an efficient use of time for parents, especially those parents who work and place their children in child care, or for childcare service providers. For approved childcare providers, communicating with the Family Assistance Office and Centrelink by mail is both a lengthy and costly process. Replacement with a user-friendly, integrated computer system will be greatly beneficial to all parties. The new computerised system ensures prompt turnaround as well as up-todate information on childcare placement vacancies. The Child Care Management System is also a significant investment in improving the supply of information and accountability across the childcare sector. The government has recognised the need for better management of information. In October last year my parliamentary colleague the Hon. Mal Brough MP, Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, announced that the Howard government would invest $73.2 million to develop the national Child Care Management System. It was clearly recognised that there needed to be a more efficient way to reduce the red tape and lengthy delays. The new system will bring all approved childcare providers online and at the same time will standardise and simplify childcare benefit administration, enabling the lodgement of childcare benefit data electronically. It also enable the childcare centres to focus on their role of providing quality of care rather than having to undertake the onerous administrative requirements of working out how much childcare benefit each family will receive. This national childcare computer system will provide the best information on childcare supply and usage that has ever been available across Australia for families, childcare service providers and the government. It will also provide support to the Child Care Access Hotline. The hotline provides parents with information about local services, types of services and government funded assistance. In July last year it was expanded to provide parents with childcare vacancy information. Childcare services will now have simplified online arrangements for reporting to the hotline on a weekly basis, ensuring that vacancies are listed much quicker, which is a huge benefit for the childcare centre and families wishing to use the centre. All approved childcare services will provide information online to give weekly updates on childcare usage and fees directly to the Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and to Centrelink. Families will have direct access to the Family Assistance Office about their childcare usage and childcare benefit payments made on their behalf to their childcare services provider. In the future, this information will be able to be accessed online, making it much more efficient for working parents, as they will be able to access an online monthly statement. The new system is designed to reduce the administrative burden on childcare service providers. It represents a significant change to the way in which services currently interact with government. Australian government approved childcare services and many Australian families will benefit from the imwill provements made possible by the Child Care Management System. The new system will be progressively rolled out across childcare services from 1 July. The Child Care Management System will also provide the basis for the payment of the childcare benefit to approved childcare providers. Approved childcare service providers will need to comply with the Child Care Management System computer and reporting requirements. This will mean that approved providers will have appropriate computer software and staff trained to use the program to ensure correct childcare information reporting to the Family Assistance Office. If a childcare provider wants to become an approved provider and offer reduced childcare fees on an ongoing basis to parents, they will be required to use the Child Care Management System. The method of paying childcare benefit to providers who in turn reduce the childcare fee is the main method of delivering the childcare benefit. The new Child Care Management System also changes the way childcare benefit is paid to approved providers. At the moment, approved childcare providers receive childcare benefit in advance-bulk payments quarterly-and they in turn provide reduced childcare fees to eligible parents. In future, the childcare benefit will be paid to approved providers weekly in arrears for the child care used in their centre by eligible parents for past week. The new system will require far more regular and ongoing communication between childcare providers and the Family Assistance Office about childcare usage, using the Child Care Management System. The new computerised system will provide information about childcare usage or lack of usage, ensuring the government's childcare planning and budgeting needs reflect the true nature of the demand for service in specific areas. This up-to-date data is important as it will allow the government to make better informed decisions about allocating unused childcare places to areas of need, providing a useful picture of the needs and vacancies in approved childcare centres. The Family Assistance, Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2005 Budget and Other Measures) Act 2006 enables the government to change or move the placement of unallocated childcare places to areas of greater need. This enables greater flexibility for all-families and service providers alike. An enrolment advance payment will be made to approved childcare centres when they enrol for child care a child who is eligible for assistance and can provide a customer reference number. This enrolment advance is recovered when the child leaves child care. The Child Care Management System will ensure that childcare benefit payments are more efficient and are accurately tied to the actual childcare use by a parent, reducing overpayments by human error or fraud. The childcare benefit entitlement for individuals will be calculated by the Family Allowance Office and advised via the Child Care Management System to the childcare provider. This will be a saving for providers, enabling them to get on with their important core business of providing high-quality, stimulating, safe child care. The Howard government strives to ensure the that Australian people have as many choices and options available to them as possible. For those people who wish to or have to place their children in child care, it is never an easy decision, so it is important that the level of care is of a high standard and that there are adequate childcare placements available in the areas that people require. For those parents who rely upon the services of childcare providers, it is important that the arrangements be simple and efficient. The recent budget announcement took into consideration the needs of the working family and has provided a range of measures to assist parents. An additional 13 per cent increase in funding to the childcare benefit take effect on 1 July. This is a 10 per cent increase on top of the CPI and will help parents. Bringing forward the payment of the 30 per cent childcare tax rebate will mean that parents and families will not have to wait to claim it directly from the government. This change will mean that some 700,000 families will receive a one-off payment of up to $8,000-being two years worth of the rebate. This measure alone will cost $1.4 billion. Another important initiative is the $43.8 million over four years to assist families in regional and remote areas. This assistance provides childcare facilities operating in areas of need with financial support that is necessary for them to remain viable. The additional $71.3 million over five years to assist an extra 3,000 children with highsupport needs to be included in high-quality child care each year will be of great benefit to many people-and many people in my electorate. I know of a number of families within my electorate of Hasluck who are very keen to ensure that there are additional placements available to children with highsupport needs. Having spoken with many of them about the difficulties they face each day, I am very pleased that the government has increased the placements by an additional 3,000 places per year. This initiative will have a huge impact on not only the child attending the centre but also their parents, siblings and families. Good government is about responding to the needs of the people and ensuring that new ideas do not negatively impact on those we are trying to assist-unlike when Labor changed the funding regime in the mid-nineties, negatively and negligently impacting on the community childcare not-for-profit sector. It is anticipated that the new Child Care Management System will commence in January 2008. However, given the rollout over two years to such a large group, it was will decided to pilot the system to enable a smoother transition. The Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs will provide support and assistance, including training, information and the all-important help-desk support. Those taking part in the pilot program will have been chosen from voluntary nominations from childcare service providers. This bill also provides compliance measures aimed at strengthening the relationship between the government and the childcare sector, ensuring that the childcare needs of Australian families are met. There is projected funding of around $1.7 billion per annum in childcare benefits, which is most commonly delivered to families through their childcare service provider. Approval of childcare services to participate in the childcare benefit program is based on their compliance with certain conditions. This compliance system is now being strengthened. Incorporated into the system are new compliance measures which will help to minimise the risk of incorrect payments and fraud. It will enable these problems to be detected as soon as possible should they occur. The new system will help to increase approved childcare provider awareness of their obligations and the consequences of non-compliance with those obligations. The introduction of a civil penalties scheme will assist the strengthening of the compliance system. The penalty scheme provides for the imposition of a pecuniary penalty on a service that contravenes a civil penalty provision. This bill also sees the introduction of a new obligation on a service to provide information in relation to the childcare access hotline on time. The delivery of up-to-date information on time to the hotline means that families will be able to be fully informed of any vacancies at childcare services in their local area. This reporting requirement through the hotline also allows for this information to be used to assess the childcare placement needs in different localities and areas, greatly assisting families in locating vacancies. This bill streamlines the system by introducing the latest technology in electronic information systems, bringing both efficiency and effectiveness to an expanding service provision. It is another important forward in ensuring Australian families have easy access to assistance to provide further choice in maximising both work and lifestyle opportunities. I commend the bill to the House.",94
150,Ms GEORGE,MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND OTHER,"As other contributors to this debate have pointed out, the centrepiece of the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Management System and Other Measures) Bill 2007 is the creation of a new online based childcare management system. This national childcare computer system should ultimately improve the supply of information and accountability across the childcare sector, but, as others on my side have pointed out, the system is not without some problems-and I will address some of those later in my contribution. It is a very significant change in the administration of the childcare benefit, and, through this system, the relationship between government and childcare service operators will also change. On the most recent data available, we see that over one million children now use approved child care, with more than 700,000 families now receiving childcare benefits in respect of child care provided by approved services. There are currently about 10½ thousand childcare services approved for childcare benefit purposes, and all of these approved services will be affected by the introduction of this new management system. The major changes that are incorporated in this bill include the weekly payment of childcare benefit in arrears; the calculation of each family's childcare benefit entitlement, which is to be done by FaCSIA and provided to the operator, rather than the operators calculating the childcare benefit, as in the current system; having enrolment advances, which will be payable for each new enrollee to help operators with cash flow; step and, in future, having all communication of information done electronically. Examining the arguments outlined in the explanatory memorandum, obviously the benefits to government include a number of the following things, which other speakers have also commented on. The system should improve the accuracy and timeliness of childcare data, which has been a major problem to date, and should provide greater efficiencies in the administration of the CCB. It will decrease the funds tied up in the current advance-acquit cycle by moving to a weekly arrears payment model, which might be good from the government's perspective but certainly not so welcome by many of the operators in the sector. It will, we hope, reduce any financial impacts from incorrect claims due to error or fraud and align payments with FaCSIA's increased compliance roles. It will ensure that the operational functions of the Family Assistance Office and FaCSIA are aligned with their departmental responsibilities. It will enable a significant amount of childcare related information and data to be held by one central agency, hopefully improving the reporting ability of FaCSIA and, all in all, it will generate administrative savings for the government. But, on the reverse side of the coin, various stakeholders will face many financial and non-financial negative consequences. I want to refer to some of the downsides of the proposals contained in the bill. First of all, childcare services will be required to purchase and maintain new or upgraded software and possibly even newer, upgraded hardware and to set up and maintain internet access. For a lot of operators, particularly in the corporate, for-profit sector, this will not be a problem. But for the smaller business operations and the not-forprofit sector, I think some of the costs associated with the transition to the new program need to be given further consideration by government. Revised administrative processes will need to be developed and implemented in many of our childcare services. This will include, of necessity, the training of staff on new or upgraded software and training in the more frequent reporting requirements that the new system will require. A third area of concern that has been identified by some in the sector is that services will no longer be paid advances, which are currently paid monthly. Services that currently use these advance funds to smooth their cash flows across the month will no longer be able to do so. This cost will be mitigated to some extent by the enrolment amount, which will operate like a float paid in respect of each child enrolled at the service. Nevertheless, it could have some significant financial consequences-again, for the small, not-for-profit operators in the sector. A number of the concerns about the system were identified by the government in the consultation phase, and it does appear on my reading of the bill that some proposals have been modified in response to the concerns that have been raised. However, I believe that the legislation does warrant further detailed consideration in the Senate. Some of the particular issues that I think need to be further looked at include, firstly, the requirement that the services report the in and out times for each child for each session of care; secondly, the application of childcare benefit eligibility limits through a first-in, first-served application-and I think that causes some concern for operators in the childcare sector, particularly where families might avail themselves of more than one service in a week-and thirdly, the availability of the childcare benefit percentage. There was a strong preference in the consultation phase by operators for this information to be continued when an enrolment is confirmed to enable services to undertake their own estimates of the reductions. There is also some concern about the policy in relation to absences with the new rule of 42 absent days without an impact on childcare benefit payments. Others have pointed to the potential administrative load of weekly submission of attendance records, and I do understand that perhaps the detailed requirements that were originally mooted might be now varied to include survey periods during the course of the year, not the actual recording in and out on every day of every week. The payment of enrolment amounts could create complexities, particularly for services like school vacation care, when students might come along for one vacation care session but not attend the next so they have to be continually reenrolled. The childcare operators also raised issues relating to the security and confidentiality of the information provided on the central computer system. And, rightly, they raised too concerns about the nature of the support services that will be provided in the transition period and the cost that this might involve. So while supporting the bill in general I would refer again to the proposal that the matter should be given further detailed consideration by a Senate legislation inquiry so that we can hear further the views of childcare operators on the impact of the proposed changes to the administration of the childcare benefit scheme, the new online system and the penalty regime that will apply in future. I understand that this new system has been undertaken on the basis that it will complement the childcare compliance strategy that was announced in the budget last year. We have no objection in principle to protecting the integrity of payments made in support of families using child care. In the minister's second reading speech he said: In combination with the new CCMS, the new compliance measures will help to minimise the risk of incorrect payments and fraud, and to detect them as soon as possible should they occur. They will also help to increase services' awareness of their obligations and the consequences of non-compliance with their obligations. The bill for the first time also introduces the notion of a civil penalties scheme. Under the proposal there would be the imposition of a financial penalty on a service that contravened a civil penalty provision and, specifically, the provision that there will be an obligation on a service to provide information to the childcare access hotline. The scheme will operate with an infringement notice proposal which would provide a childcare service operator with an option of either paying the penalty at a lesser financial amount or proceeding to litigation on the issue. I agreed with the minister when he said: Families are entitled to know if the service's proval is under threat or terminated because childcare benefit may stop and they may become as parents liable for full fees. I think that statement made by the minister is unexceptional, but in my opinion, and it is something I would ask the minister to give further consideration to, there should be an obligation on childcare service providers also to ensure that they are complying with the law as determined by this parliament and that they are complying with industrial instruments that apply to the workforce before those services are approved as being eligible for childcare benefit fee subsidies. I draw the minister's attention to a local case study to highlight the point I am making-and I see the minister and the Assistant Treasurer both at the table. Today I have written to the Assistant Treasurer because I have had no satisfaction through the ATO to date on this particular case. I repeat for the minister: I think that in future consideration of amendments to the legislation there should be an obligation on childcare services to ensure that they are complying with the law and with the industrial instruments. In my own area the Wilbur Childcare service operates eight local childcare centres. For some months local union organisers had been pursuing complaints raised by staff in relation to payment of wages and superannuation entitlements. The ongoing problems were reported in our local media outlets in March this year. The owner was advised by the organiser of the particularly union that covers the staff that the staff complained of ‘incorrect or non payment'-of wages-‘at all and dishonoured cheques' as well as salary payments being made out in the name of the various companies with which the owner is associated. Further in the correspondence received by me the organiser of the union points out that ‘superannuation has not been appaid for some time and that individual memtheir bers were asked'-by the union-‘to notify the ATO' of that particular issue. Our local newspaper, the Illawarra Mercury, reported on one individual case before the Industrial Relations Commission involving the Wilbur Childcare centres. It involved a trainee who alleged underpayment of wages and entitlements at one of these centres in Moruya, which closed in November 2006. The union's lawyer said: ... discrepancies in the trainees pay began to appear shortly after she started work at the beginning of 2006. What confused the situation greatly was infrequent payments, payments on different days, at different intervals made it difficult for the employee concerned to gauge whether correct payments were made or not. The union's lawyer claimed that when the centre closed in November the trainee was ‘not paid her entitlements and had been left without seven weeks pay'. After negotiations the owner had offered to pay the trainee $3,000 in April; however, only $1,000 was deposited into her account. This one case that I have referred to, and it was reported in our media, appears to be symptomatic of the problems facing staff at a number of Wilbur Childcare centres. The union and individual constituents have now raised their concerns with me and sought my assistance to pursue their cases through the ATO in relation to their superannuation entitlements and salary payments. In April 2007, in response to my representations, I was advised that the ATO was ‘pursuing the matter actively' but that no further details could be provided either to me or to the individual constituents. It is now June 2007, Minister, and it appears that the matters of concern have still not been resolved. I have today pursued the issues in written correspondence to the Assistant Treasurer. These childcare workers are being denied their legitimate and legislated superannuation entitlements and their employer appears to regularly breach their award conditions. As well as these industrial breaches, the minister should be aware that I have seen a copy of a letter of complaint sent to the National Childcare Accreditation Council which listed serious matters of concern including: ... special accreditation staff were brought in every Centre for accreditation that do not normally work at the Centre. I understand that the National Childcare Accreditation Council has informed the licensee of Wilbur Childcare centres of the issues of concern raised in that correspondence and advised them: ... to provide a written response to the National Childcare Accreditation Council which adequately and appropriately addresses each area of concern. The lessons that I draw from this, Minister, are the following. First of all, the ATO needs enhanced powers and greater accountability in ensuring more vigorous and rigorous enforcement of superannuation contribution payments. After all, those payments have been legislated by the national parliament and to not pay them is, in my view, a breach of the law and something ought to be done about it. The second point I draw out from this case study is in relation to childcare services that wish to offer child care that attracts childcare benefit fee subsidies for families. As we know, these services must be approved. In my view, such approval in future should be dependent on the service complying with their legal obligations and their statutory obligations, including prescribed payment of superannuation, proper taxation remittance and compliance with relevant industrial instruments. The bill before us does not go as far as the recommendation I am making but I think it is certainly worthy of the minister's consideration. If service operators expect to be given financial assistance by the federal government then I do not think it is too much to ask that those services also comply with other pieces of legislation. In the time available I have raised the general matters that I wanted to pursue in relation to the childcare management system at bill. As I said earlier, it is a system that ultimately should provide the government with a better supply of information and enable better accountability across the childcare sector. It is not without some problems, and I think those have been identified by a range of operators in the sector. I hope there will be an opportunity for some detailed consideration when the matter goes to the Senate. I think it is incumbent upon the government to address the problems, particularly as they always say that they do not believe in a one-size-fits-all solution. I think there are some requirements of the new system which might have negative consequences for the small business operators and the not-for-profit operators in the childcare sector. While we support the main principles outlined in the legislation, the shadow minister has moved a comprehensive amendment to the bill which points out some of the inadequacies in the handling of the childcare issue by this government, and those matters in the amendment go to the critical issues of affordability, accessibility and ity of childcare services. I think the shadow minister has outlined the scope of our concerns with regard to those areas. I encourage the minister to give further consideration to the matters I have raised, and I am hoping the Assistant Treasurer will assist me in my endeavours to ensure that workers receive their just and legislated superannuation entitlements.",99
151,Mr BROUGH,MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND OTHER,"Longman-Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs) (8.20 pm)-I thank all those members of the House who have contributed to this debate. The Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Management System and Other Measures) Bill 2007 is an important bill because it is taking child care into a new age. It will ensure that the interaction between the federal government and the childcare industry is using the latest technology. We can swap information to ensure that parents are getting the right amount of money and that we have the best possible advice on where childcare places and vacancies are. We can then make that information available through our childcare hotline. That is all possible because the federal government has made a major investment in the childcare management system. It will start to roll out later this year through long day care centres and then over the next two years through the remainder of the childcare industry. It will really reduce the burden on, particularly, directors and the work that they do-many doing work manually. This will speed up not only their internal work but also the clarity of it, and provide that information in a timely fashion to government and then back to the centres. There are a couple of other intended consequences: the new compliance measures supported by CCMS will minimise any risk of incorrect payments and qualfraud and maximise the speedy detection of these problems should they occur. The amendments will raise awareness by services of their obligations and the consequences of non-compliance. Unfortunately, what occurs now is that through our compliance measures you do not get this information until well after the event. You then have to go back to parents to ascertain when a child was in fact in care et cetera. So this is in the interests of the taxpayer, the parent and of course the childcare centre. The Howard government makes a massive contribution to assist families with child care and this will help to ensure that what is spent is spent the correct way, that we get quality childcare places and also that all moneys expended can be accounted for. When I refer to a massive sum of money, I am talking about $11,000 million which is what we anticipate spending over the next four years, more than twice what was spent when the Keating government was last in power. We have also doubled the number of childcare places and have put in place other measures to ensure that there is greater access to child care, such as freeing up before and after school care. There are no limitations on anybody wanting to start up a before or after school care program, a family day care, or a long day care service. The federal government will fund the childcare benefit for those parents. It is important to acknowledge and understand that that is how we fund: we do not fund centres; we fund parents to help offset the cost of their child care. The member for Capricornia, the shadow minister present in the chamber, made some comments about the cost and lack of affordability of child care. Although she does not need to be reminded, I remind her that it is important to note the federal government in its budget has increased childcare benefit by 13 per cent from 1 July-in 18 or 19 days time that kicks in. That will mean $20.50 per child for low-income families using full-time care and that is clearly where we have targeted the majority of our assistance. Obviously we have made other improvements to the childcare tax rebate, bringing forward in a timely fashion. Most importantly, we are ensuring that approximately 100,000 families who do not have a taxable income sufficient to offset that rebate will benefit. This means that they will be able to offset another $300 to $500 per year against their childcare fees. When you take into account the subsidies, as a result of the increase in childcare fit, the Howard government will pick up between 55 and 93 per cent of the fees of Australian working families who use approved long day care. That is incredibly generous and appropriate. It will assist parents to back into the workforce and will offset those costs-and it belies the story that the opposition would have you believe. On the weekend, I was in Brisbane with the Queensland childcare association. I had a few hundred people sitting in front of me, predominantly childcare owners. In this open forum with the media present, I said, ‘Put your hand up if you are charging $350 a week for child care.' Not one did. ‘Three hundred dollars?'-it was like a bidding war. I think I got one hand at $300. ‘Two hundred and fifty dollars?'-and the majority of hands went up. That is not surprising because that is exactly what our figures show. Are Australian families paying $250 a week? No. The Howard government is picking up up to 93 per cent of that $250 a week and, for the majority, it is picking up at least $125. Divide that by five and you have parents out of pocket about $25 a day for having a quality childcare place. The Child Care Management System helps to protect that and ensures that parents get the money that they deserve. That is what this bill is aimed at. There are those who do not get childcare benefit because they are high-income earners earning over $108,000. In those cases, it through the federal government's childcare tax rebate and by making sure that the childcare benefit minimum rate is available, highincome earners can expect at least $5,000 per child in direct assistance towards their childcare costs. High-income earners do not get nothing; they get up to $5,000 or thereabouts. If their child is in care for two days a week, because it is calculated on 30 per cent beneof their out-of-pocket expenses, the more expensive that care is, the more that the government is paying. We are contributing to everybody regardless of where they are on the income spectrum and we are providing get the majority of support to the low-income earners. Another example is that a working family with an income of $60,000, which is fairly common these days in Australia, using part-time care for one or two children will have all between 55 and 79 per cent of their fee subsidised, depending on the centre they use. That shows that parents cannot listen to what the opposition says because they get told two things. They get told that there are no places. I have challenged the shadow minister on air many times to name but one place. Ms Macklin interjecting",103
152,Mr BROUGH,MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND OTHER,"Oh, they have. And it is? Ms Macklin interjecting",105
153,Mr BROUGH,MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND OTHER,Would you like to tell us where it is now in this place?,105
154,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND OTHER,Mr Haase)Order! The member will address his comments through the chair.,105
155,Mr BROUGH,MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND OTHER,"The member for Jagajaga says we have one place. When confronted in Adelaide she said that there were places needed in a suburb there and it turned out that she was wrong. When in Brisbane she was wrong again. In the Torrens Road Child Care Centre in my electorate she said, ‘There are shortages, but not here. We've got lots of places across the board and, by the way, so do all the other centres around here. In fact, there are a thousand vacancies.' So never let the truth on childcare places get in the way of a good story says the former Leader of the Opposition. She is wrong. Those opposite are saying one thing to the Australian public when they know it is undeliverable. There is no shortage of child care for the zero to two age group, preschool age or any other age. The former Leader of the Opposition can say this as long and as hard as she likes. We have before us tonight a piece of legislation that will take us from the rudimentary work that we have at the momentphone calls of availability from every childcare centre-to having information electronically available and being able to get the best information to the market and also to the parents. While we are on the issue of availability, would point out to the shadow minister that a number of centres in my own electorate, ones at which she stood only a few weeks ago and said that there was a shortage, have closed. Why? Because there is a more than adequate supply. So the hurt that the Labor Party has done to those people's businesses, to which families have contributed millions of dollars to set them up, should be in the consideration of the former Deputy Leader of the Opposition if she cares at all for small businesses and what they are trying to contribute to the Australian economy. It is one thing to sit there and laugh; it is altogether another thing when you consider the pain that your sorts of comments are creating for those people as families do not go and seek a quality childcare place because of your living this misconception-living a lie, you might say, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - in saying that there are in fact shortages around the country when that is simply untrue. The shadow minister also talked about the OECD report on early childhood education. What this report failed to take into account is that the state governments are the primary providers of preschools and that this is about the Commonwealth contribution. It also did not take into account that many of our childcare centres actually do provide a preschool. Once again, just as Sharan Burrow likes to go overseas and prattle on and tell fibs about the state of workplace relations in Australia, here we have the shadow minister once again misleading people about the real level of government-state and federal-support to Australian families so that their children can get a preschool education. In fact, take the most recent data in the report on government services for 2007. It estimates that 86 per cent of children attend a state or territory government funded and/or provided preschool in the year before full-time school. That is about 216,000 children, so I am not I sure where the shadow minister gets her figure of 100,000 from. These figures do not include the many thousands of children who do receive a preschool education program through childcare centres. A couple of other issues that were raised by those who sit opposite are worth commenting on and highlighting for their benefit. We were criticised over the consultation for this bill. This consultation was incredibly extensive and is ongoing. Briefings with childcare peak organisations and third-party software providers were undertaken. We had the release of the childcare management information paper. We had national consultations and information forums held throughout Australia. There was a web page. There was a mailbox for feedback and questions. We established an industry technical reference group which the government is still consulting, and the last time. I spoke with them they had been extremely happy with the consultation. Most importantly, to take up the member for Throsby's point, because some of the issues she raised were the very issues that they had raised with us several months ago, I note that all of those issues, such as the reporting time lines et cetera, have been dealt with. The whole idea of having a consultation task force or a technical reference group is to listen. As this is about the industry, that is exactly what we did. Opposition members have run around the country having people believe three things about child care. Firstly, they say it is unavailable, yet they cannot tell us where they are going to put their centres. Why? Because they know that as soon as they do they are going to be blown out of the water by everyone around there demanding to know what compensation they are going to give them for destroying their businesses when they have vacancies. Secondly, they have said as to the cost that child care is unaffordable, yet have a policy which will actually drive the cost up and do nothing whatsoever for the quality of child care because it does not take into account a large percentage of the childcare industry. Thirdly, they talk about the quality. Right now we are looking at the accreditation process. We are trying to improve that accreditation process so that parents can actually know that the most senior person in a childcare centre, the director, is overseeing the workers and having their time freed up to do so, not filling out bits of paper. The childcare management system will go a long way to directing that. I have huge faith in the childcare service providers of this country, whether they be private providers, not-for-profit providers or councils that have invested in child care. I do not distinguish one from the other. I do not go around the country telling people that there is a shortage and telling them not to look because they cannot afford child care as they would be paying $350. We face up to issues, we get information, we deal with the crucial issues and we invest in child care because it is a good decision by the federal government to do so on behalf of families. It helps families be involved in the economy of this nation and to be more self-sustaining and it gives families real choices about the decisions that they make. We will continue to build on the success of doubling the places, doubling the funding, improving the accreditation, improving things like IT and making better information available to parents and to the sector so people do not find that investing their hard-earned money has been a mistake. We will not mislead the Australian community, as the opposition continually does, day after day after day, without any basis for their allegations. This is an important piece of legislation. It is another downpayment by the Howard government on trying to assist the professionalism of the industhey try on behalf of the whole nation-not just the parents who use the child care and not just the directors and owners-because it contributes to people's capacity to be a part of this strong economy and to be able to make their way in the world. I commend the bill to the House.",105

158,Ms MACKLIN,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I want to start with some lyrics from a beautiful song by Paul Kelly and Kev Carmody called From Little Things Big Things Grow: And Vincent sat down with big politicians This affair they told him is a matter of state Let us sort it out, your people are hungry Vincent said no thanks, we know how to wait It is important to remember just how hard and for how long Indigenous people have fought for land rights. The struggle has been underpinned by absolute determination and dignity. That determination should not be underestimated by anybody in this parliament. The song documents the struggle of Vincent Lingiari and his people, but the lyrics resonate strongly today as Indigenous landowners are being pressured to accept land reforms with little negotiation on the model for reform. The Alice Springs town camps were offered $60 million in housing and infrastructure to agree to land reform. They responded, ‘No thanks, we know how to wait.' Today I am speaking on the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment (Township Leasing) Bill 2007, which follows the government's amendments that were pushed through parliament last year amidst a great deal of controversy. One of the most contentious amendments in last year's legislation included a 99-year township leasing proposal. This now provides that traditional owners can grant a 99-year headlease over a township located on their land. The headlease would be held by a territory or Commonwealth approved entity that would then grant subleases in accordance with the BILL 2007 conditions set out in the headlease. By making it simpler and faster to obtain a sublease, this entity model aimed to reduce transaction costs for businesses and services on Aboriginal land and encourage economic development. But it also removed direct control by traditional owners over development on township land. This bill seeks to create an Office of Executive Director of Township Leasing to enter into and administer township leases on Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory. The bill specifies the functions and resources of the executive director and provides that the executive director be appointed by the Governor General. The cost of the office will be met from up to $15 million to be provided over five years for the township leasing scheme. The necessary funds will be sourced from the Aboriginals Benefit Account, which is essentially Aboriginal money derived from mining royalties. Since the changes went through parliament last year, the Northern Territory government has allowed detailed community debate about the proposals. The Northern Territory government's position has always been that Indigenous people should have the time to understand and discuss the model and to negotiate what form the entity should take. The Commonwealth on the other hand is not interested in negotiating on the form of the model. Through the bill before us today, the government seeks to create its own ‘approved entity' to fill the gap until one is established by the Northern Territory. It is not clear what will happen if a model developed by the Northern Territory government is incompatible with the statutory model. Could we have duplicate, incompatible schemes operating in the Northern Territory? Last year Labor opposed the 99-year leasing proposal because the model had not been negotiated with traditional owners. Today we oppose the creation of this statutory office, be funded out of Aboriginal money, for the same reason. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 was the first and strongest legal recognition of the profound connection that Indigenous people have to their country. It recognised the communal nature of landownership in traditional Aboriginal law and culture through a form of freehold title. The act, back in 1976, represented the most significant set of rights won by Aboriginal people after two centuries of European settlement. It returned about 50 per cent of the land area of the Northern Territory to its traditional owners. The government now is seeking to radically reshape that land rights regime. It fundamentally seeks to alter the principle of communal landownership which is at the heart of the land rights regime. The government has taken this step without proper negotiation with traditional owners and without their consent. It is hard to imagine that any other group of Australians would have their property rights treated in this way. Before the changes were passed last year it was already possible for a lands trust to give a 99-year lease over a township to a particular body under the act. What has been common practice in the past, though, is the granting of individual subleases over parcels of land within townships. The minister argued last year that amendments were necessary to provide a clear pathway, or prescribed model, for traditional owners to adopt. The Tiwi Land Council has said that, by issuing smaller leases over individual blocks rather than a headlease over the entire township, you stand to diminish the value of township. However, it has also been asked why it would not be appropriate to have an Aboriginal land corporation hold the 99-year lease, as opposed to a government entity. Indeed, when the traditional to owners of Wadeye put a proposal to the government for an Aboriginal corporation to hold the headlease, they were swiftly rebuffed. They told the minister: The concept of a Town Corporation controlled by the traditional owners, the Diminin people, is a critical aspect of the lease. The government is arguing that land rights have not delivered economic outcomes, and is therefore seeking to construct a Hobson's choice for Indigenous people. Choose between your rights to land and your rights to economic development. I do not believe that it is beyond the wit of traditional owners and the government to devise land tenure arrangements which streamline transaction costs without fundamentally undermining Indigenous ownership and control of their land. Our approach-and this is our approach across the portfolio-is to review the evidence and assess each idea on its merits. We do not believe in taking an ideological approach to these very important issues. What we do want is an informed, open and transparent debate about the details of 99-year leases over townships. What we do want is for traditional owners to be able to negotiate a deal that is fair, underlines aspirations and anticipates their concerns for future generations. What we do not want is decisions being made in a rushed or politically charged environment. We do not want land tenure reform being made a condition of funding for basic services. And we do not want there to be any doubt that the consent offered by traditional owners is anything but free and informed. Unfortunately, the approach of Minister Brough has not inspired such confidence or trust. In fact, it has spawned the opposite. One of the main arguments that the government have put forward in support of the 99-year lease changes is that they want to increase home-ownership. Of course, Labor supports improving opportunities for home-ownership, so let us look at the government's progress. The Indigenous Home Ownership Program has been operating for a number of years and has assisted many Indigenous people in urban and regional areas through discounted interest rates. Since July 2006, over 500 loans have been approved. There is a 12month waiting list for this program due to housing affordability being a major problem in urban and regional areas. However, the largest injection of new money into Indigenous home-ownership has been for remote Indigenous land. In the 2006 budget, the government committed $107.2 million for a home-ownership program on Indigenous land. That program was predicated on there being a 99-year lease over the land. As no 99-year leases have been negotiated, no loans have yet been delivered. So now the minister is staring down the barrel of an election without one Indigenous homeowner on Indigenous land under his 2006 budget measure. The four new homes in the Wadeye outstations of Nama and Wadapuli were funded not from this budget measure but from public housing money, because they their will not sit on a 99-year lease. As a result, nearly $100 million of muchneeded money for Indigenous housing remains unspent. It is feared that a great deal of this program funding will be tied up due to negotiations over land tenure reform for quite a long while to come. About $23 million from the $107.2 million allocated for home-ownership on Indigenous land is money for Indigenous Business Australia to ‘create incentives and manage land tenure changes'. About $500,000 has been allocated to the Office of Indigenous Policy Coordination for ‘negotiations'. That money, allocated for negotiating tenure changes, could have built another 60 homes in remote Indigenous communities. There has been a lot of political rhetoric about the great Australian dream in the outback. But let us look at the economics. The department has described the program as targeting people who want to buy a house on Indigenous land in an environment where maybe the market is stagnant or there is no real appreciation in value possible. Mr Tollner interjecting",107
159,Ms MACKLIN,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I hear the member for Solomon saying that there is no market. I am glad to hear him say that, because his point of view will feed straight into my argument. The department has also conceded that a home on remote lands could cost anywhere between $475,000 and $500,000 to build and, by the time it is handed over to the buyer, could be worth only $50,000 to $100,000. Forty-two per cent of Indigenous households have an income of less than $264 a week and, on average, they are getting poorer. Between 2002 and 2005, the average Indigenous household income actually decreased from 60 per cent to 50 per cent of average non-Indigenous income. Statistically speaking, very remote Indigenous people are the poorest. In 2005, over half of Indigenous people-51 per cent, in fact-received most of their individual income from government pensions and allowances. And that does not include those people who participate in the Community Development Employment Projects program. In many places where incomes and the value of land are very low, and the costs of construction are high, regular public housing is a much more realistic solution. Of course we agree with the value of home-ownership in terms of the positive social and economic impacts that it can have on a family's life. But let us be sensible about it. Noel Pearson, for example, strongly agrees with the premise of increasing personal and family ownership of houses, but he also advocates for home-ownership schemes to operate in an economically rational environment. We support the expansion of home-ownership and innovative shared equity and sweat equity schemes in a way that makes economic sense. I now turn to the other area in which the minister has had a lot to say about this ing proposal-that is, on the Tiwi Islands. Our concerns about the township leasing proposals have only been enlivened, certainly not subdued, by the minister's efforts on the Tiwi Islands and, I might also say, Alice Springs town camps example. In December 2006 the federal government began negotiating with the Nguiu people on the Tiwi Islands for a 99-year lease over the new township. On 9 May 2007, the minister released a statement saying that he ‘welcomed the first 99-year lease over a township on Aboriginal land'. This was reported in the newspapers. It is wrong. We were told during Senate estimates by the Tiwi Land Council the that the land owners have signed only a memorandum of understanding, which is not legally binding but is more a statement of intent. So misleading was this representation that some community members launched a legal action against the agreement, seeking an injunction. Once they found out it was only a memorandum of understanding, they withdrew their action. The negotiating team for the traditional owners says that under the deal traditional owners will retain some sort of say through being employed as public servants in the office of the executive director and advising the office through a new consultative forum. The forum would only be advisory in nature, as the land rights amendments passed last year specifically preclude ongoing decision-making powers by the traditional owners in relation to the subleases. As the Tiwi Land Council is a statutory body that can be called before Senate estimates, in February 2006 the Labor Party submitted a number of questions in relation to the proposed deal. These questions were largely the same questions that had been raised by people on the islands about how leasthe model would work practically on the ground. We have never seen the answers to those questions. However, during Senate estimates at the end of May, the Tiwi Land Council admitted it was a complex issue that the people on the ground did not fully understand. Government senators, including the Minister for Community Services, Nigel Scullion, told us the department would be able to tell us ‘what the effect of these changes would be'. I have to say that this really is not acceptable. A memorandum of understanding has been signed. People should by now understand how it will affect them. This lack of public information has fuelled a lot of fear and division in the Tiwi Islands and in the broader Indigenous community. As Marion Scrymgour, the Territory member for the Tiwi Islands, has said, the deal has ‘divided our people like no other issue'. Another example we have is the minister's housing and land tenure reform proposal for the Alice Springs town camps. Town camp people do not hold freehold title but have 99year special-purpose leases over the land. The town camps existed originally as ration depots and labour camps for people who had survived dispossession of their traditional lands. It is important to understand the history of the town camps if we are to comprehend the depth of feeling of people living in these camps. Given the time. I have available, I want to go through a brief time line of recent events. After touring the camps in May 2006, Minister Brough said: These people deserve to have a better outcome than they're getting now, and I expect to be able to make fairly urgent decisions and put in place policies, if you will, initiatives that will turn lives around very, very rapidly. About 10 months later, in March 2007, the minister finally put a deal on the table. The deal consisted of $70 million worth of infrastructure and housing for town camps. In exchange, the town camps had to surrender their leases and the management of housing to the Northern Territory government. About a month later, on 18 April 2007, a concession was offered in relation to the leases. The town camps could sublease the residential areas to the Northern Territory government for 99-year leases, rather than surrendering the entire lease. To recap the events: the minister said he was going to change things in a year. It took his department 10 months to put a specific proposal on the table. One month later the deal changed substantially and then he gave the town camp people one month's deadline to decide, threatening that otherwise the money would be spent elsewhere. One of the reasons the town camp people did not sign up was that the deal included one non-negotiable term-that they relinquish housing management to the Northern Territory government. The environment was politically and emotionally charged and the time line was certainly unreasonable. With desperately needed funds dangling before them, the chances of people being able to make these important decisions in a free and informed way were undermined. We are still hopeful, I have to say, that a resolution can be found. But finding a resolution should be an imperative of the government, and an understanding is needed that it will take time and a willingness to negotiate. To sum up, Labor cannot support this bill because the model has not been negotiated with Indigenous people and because of the way the federal government has gone about advancing its adoption on the ground. We do support home-ownership schemes that cultivate financial responsibility, provide accredtheir ited training opportunities and are economically sound. We understand the need and the desire for economic development and empowerment in Australia's remote regions, working with Indigenous people, not taking away hard-won land rights.",109
160,Mr TOLLNER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I am very honoured to be standing here today speaking to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment (Township Leasing) Bill 2007, as it is yet another step in improving opportunities for Indigenous people on Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory. Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory are not that different from the rest of us. Aborigines want jobs. They want schooling for their children. They want access to good health services. They want proper roads. They want their rubbish collected. They want access to a whole range of services that are provided by the private sector: butchers, bakers, hairdressers and fruit and vegie shops. They want access to a range of services that most of us in Australia take for granted. Under the current system, a lot of that is not possible. This amendment bill seeks to establish an office of Executive Director of Township Leasing to enter into and administer township leases on Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory. The township leasing scheme was established under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 and enables Aboriginal landowners to issue long term leases over their land to promote economic development. It allows them to promote those things that most of us take for granted in mainstream Australia: the ability to have a grocery shop, a hairdresser, a butcher's shop, a proper school, proper health services and proper roads on their land. The bill specifies the functions of the Executive Director of Township Leasing for appointment by the Governor General. The bill also provides for the terms and conditions under which the executive director will hold office, the way in which the executive director may obtain the assistance of staff and consultants and reporting procedures for the executive director. Debate interrupted. NA",111
161,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 9 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Coal Industry",112
162,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this evening to talk about the important challenge facing the Australian coal industry-an industry that is exceptionally important to our future. Australia supplies approximately 30 per cent of the global coal supply, exporting coal to more than 35 countries around the world. Coal is Australia's largest commodity export-as the member for Capricornia, who is at the table, appreciates-with exports exceeding 270 million tonnes a year. Australia's coal industry was valued at $24.5 billion in 2005-06. The coal industry directly employs 30,000 people in Australia and indirectly benefits thousands of Australians. A great proportion of those employed in the coal industry are employed in regional Australia. It is the lifeblood of regional areas of Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales. The problem is that we are losing our international influence in the coal industry. In the past two years, the value of coal has risen considerably, but Australia has barely increased the volume of its coal exports. Alarmingly, in that time Indonesia has overtaken Australia as the world's largest exporter of coal. Australia's coal industry is facing challenges right now which affect its ability to efficiently supply coal and remain competitive during the current resources boom. In recent months there have been constant complaints by the coal industry about the great delays in coal exports. We have seen photos of bulk carriers dotting the coastline at Newcastle, Dalrymple and Hay Point. Ships are waiting an average of 27.3 days for coal to be loaded and are being charged tens of thousands of dollars in demurrage fees a day. Mining companies are losing revenue daily, with a loss to the industry of $1 billion in the past year alone. Hundreds of contractors and miners have already been given redundancies, with hundreds more facing the very real prospect of job losses. Industry and governments have been pointing fingers at each other as to who is to blame, but the fact remains that Australia is not exporting coal fast enough to satisfy market demand. If we do not start to address these problems promptly, we will lose investors and we will lose the confidence of our valuable export markets. Australia has not invested adequately in the infrastructure needed to supply coal. At the 2007 national conference of the Labor Party, I clearly stated, as the shadow minister for transport, that we as a nation need to invest more and state governments need to work in partnership with the private sector and the Australian government to fix our infrastructure problems and to end the blame game. Labor's New directions for Australia's coal industry policy paper supports industry and governments working together to solve this huge challenge. We cannot afford to lose further market capacity. Included in Labor's commitment to the coal industry is a $500 million Commonwealth government contribution to stimulate $1.5 billion in investment to develop clean coal technology, which is also a potential huge export earner for Australia. On behalf of the opposition, I simply say that if we do not get these things right, we as a nation will be the losers, and key regional communities in Australia will also lose potential job opportunities and training opportunities for our young people. We need to invest, and we have to make sure that we overcome the infrastructure problems that currently exist in order to build our capacity so that we can harvest the best possible results out of the current resources boom. We will be setting ourselves up for thousands of job losses and billions of dollars in lost nue if we do not start to solve these problems. There is also the potential to compromise the ongoing viability of our mining industry. People should note that international companies are threatening to buy coal outside of Australia. In the last two years, Indonesia has overtaken Australia as the global leader in coal exports. Indonesia is not experiencing the capacity constraints that we are in Australia, with the self-regulated industry that currently exists. Australian coal is of an excellent standard. Australia also has great capacity to increase coal exports. Unfortunately, the record shows that we as a nation have already fallen behind-from being the world leader in coal exportsdespite the global resource boom. We cannot allow this to continue to occur. There is an urgent need for the state governments, in partnership with the private sector and the Australian government, to end the blame game and to start solving the infrastructure problems that are holding back the coal industry. (Time expired) Kerang Rail Accident",112
163,Mr FORREST,ADJOURNMENT,"I am grateful for the opportunity, before the House adjourns, to respond to the remarks by the Prime Minister and the acting Leader of the Opposition with regard to the terrible tragedy of the train crash near Kerang in my electorate. I know that my constituents will be greatly encouraged by the condolences that have come from the chamber. It has been a terrible week for Swan Hill and Kerang. Upon hearing the news on the radio of the terrible accident, there were emotions of uncertainty for those who knew they had loved ones on the train and those who were not sure whether friends were involved. The editor of the Swan Hill newspaper summed it up in an editorial, which I revewould like to read into the public record, because it speaks for me as to how I felt. I travelled across that intersection less than half an hour before the accident, oblivious to the accident that was about to happen. The editor of the Swan Hill Guardian newspaper, Steve Strevens, captured the grief of the community when he wrote: WE have all changed. Whether we realise it or not, Swan Hill and its people will never be the same again. The tragedy of the V/Line crash will stay with us forever. While the crash occurred just north of Kerang, the train started its journey in Swan Hill; it was ‘our' train. With some exceptions, those who happily boarded the red coaches in Curlewis Street had a connection to Swan Hill. While some were on their way from Mildura, or on holidays, the others were ours. Perhaps not directly, but ours nonetheless. Otherwise they would not have been here. We know them or their relatives or their friends. Or someone that is connected to them, no matter how tenuous or slim that connection may be. We might have played with their children; we may have drunk alongside them or yelled at a football match together. We may have seen them or the people they know in the supermarkets or walking down the street. We may never have known them; but we know them. It is almost as if we are a huge pool into which a rock has been thrown. The ripples will reach far and wide. While our rural city is large, in these times it is so very small. We are a heart which supports the towns around us. The roads we travel, metaphoric or otherwise, connect us with each other; they make us who and what we are. We have overcome some enormous difficulties over the years and now we face our greatest challenge. We will need to give unqualified support to all those who need it, whoever they may be. We need to take care of our loved ones. We need to take care of each other-in our homes, in our schools, in our lives and on our roads. As we have seen, life can change dramatically, irrevocably, in an instant. Shakespeare wrote that ‘grief makes one hour ten' and while that is so very true in these dark hours, the grief will eventually pass. Those who have been injured will hopefully recover. Families who have lost loved ones will continue to mourn. As a city and as a region, we will also recover. We must. We will. It is a very sobering experience to be part of the community at this time. The community has been very strong in the support that it has given to so many families, not all of whom are associated with the district. Their names are mostly published. There is still one identified victim of the accident, a Korean visitor to the region, who has not been publicly named. They were all grandparents or grandchildren. It is a tragedy. It makes the point of how precious life really is. I am moved by the words of one of the SES rescuers, who said on local television, ‘We need to go home and hug our kids.' The community will take some time to recover. Sometimes I wonder. Last year, my region endured the terrible road accident which saw six beautiful young Australians tragically lose their lives up at Mildura near Cardross. And here we are again trying to address the terrible grief of parents who have had their families wiped out and grandparents who will not have the opportunity to enjoy their grandchildren. Many of the families and close friends of the victims are known to me personally and are very dear to me. (Time expired) Fuel Prices",113
164,Ms GEORGE,ADJOURNMENT,"Throsby) (9.10 pm)With an election just months away, the Howard government now belatedly acknowledges that petrol prices are too high and that motorists are being ripped off. It has taken a long time to acknowledge what motorists have known for years. As far back as November 2003, my office undertook a local survey over a four-week period which showed that the price of unleaded petrol peaked on Thursdays and the highest average cost of unleaded petrol was also highest on Thursdays. This local information coincided with the results of petrol price monitoring by the ACCC in the Sydney region between May and August 2003 which showed that all 18 petrol price peaks occurred on a Thursday, with the most common day for low prices being on Tuesday. When I pursued these matters with the ACCC on behalf of my constituents I was advised that they could act only if I was able to provide evidence of a breach of section 45A of the TPA by showing that actual collusion between suppliers had taken place. The evidence that I was to provide had to prove that there was agreement in advance to set prices. Similarly, motorists who I represent know that the price of petrol continues to remain high in Australia even when prices are falling overseas. Motorists are being ripped off because the oil companies are not passing on international price reductions at the local bowsers. In the week ending Sunday, 3 June, the average weekly price of petrol in Wollongong was $1.35, the highest it had been in 40 weeks of the survey period. These increases did not reflect the recent falls Singapore price, which continues to be used as the benchmark. The peak motoring group, the Australian Automobile Association, claimed a few days ago that there was no doubt that oil companies were price gouging. They pointed to the drop in the Singapore benchmark price of around $9 a barrel which should have translated to a between 5c per litre and 10c per litre lower price at the bowser. We now have the farcical situation of the federal government and the ACCC each trying to flick-pass the responsibility to the other. The Prime Minister said: … if the ACCC wants further monitoring powers, then we will certainly be willing to provide them. The commission chairman, Graeme Samuel, responded by saying that any change in his powers ‘was entirely a matter for government to deal with'. Talk about an unnecessary stand-off. It is an abrogation of responsibility while motorists are being ripped off. We all know that motorists have been ripped off for many years. The question is not, ‘What is going on?' but ‘What does the Howard government intend to do to stop this occurring?' We are told by the ACCC that price following is not collusion. Proving price fixing, they say, is about proving that there is agreement in advance to set prices. Under current law, price fixing is both hard to detect and hard to prove, as we saw in the recent case involving a group of petrol suppliers in Geelong. It appears to me that the law needs to be amended so that the hurdles are lowered to enable successful prosecutions. It is, after all, the federal government's responsibility to equip the ACCC with adequate powers to pursue apparent collusion on pricing as well as movements in Australian retail petrol prices that are out of kilter with international benchmarks. In the meantime, the in the Treasurer should do what Labor has been urging for a long time and issue a formal direction to the regulator which would give it the power of compulsory information acquisition from the retailers. The government should also agree with Labor's proposal to appoint a national petrol commissioner with the sole responsibility to formally monitor and investigate price gouging and collusion. The Howard government has a duty to do everything in its power to ensure that motorists are not paying one cent more on petrol than is absolutely necessary, and motorists need to know that petrol prices are being fairly set, something that clearly they are very concerned about. As the price of petrol continues to rise in Australia while the international prices are low and falling, motorists are continually concerned about the increases that we see on particular days of the week, specifically on Thursdays and particularly in pension weeks when they really impact on low-income earners and pensioners. Motorists continue to be concerned that the government has washed its hands of any kind of intervention in this issue despite repeated calls by the Labor opposition to at least give the regulator formal powers that go beyond the cursory monitoring that has been occurring for several years. It is interesting, it, that in the lead-up to an election the Minister has now suddenly acknowledged that petrol prices are too high and that motorists are being ripped off. He can acknowledge it, but the test will be to see what action the government takes to curb price gouging in petrol prices.",115
165,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I rise to speak about Telstra's plan to close its Launceston call centre. It is foolish and misguided. Our community was quite stunned at the announcement just one week ago that 257 jobs based at the Launceston centre would go from the centre, which receives and acts on fault reports from all around Australia. I call on Telstra tonight not only to reverse its Tasmanian call centre decision but to consider expanding the current Launceston operation, which is housed in a building which is especially and purposely designed for call centre operations. I have written to Telstra's CEO, Sol Trujillo, to express the anger of the local community, which I have been witness to. I have also written to federal ministers, including the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, and the Tasmanian Premier. I am very pleased to report that the Commonwealth minister has reacted very maturely, quickly and promptly along with the Treasurer in saying that she will meet with Telstra later this week, and she has said in the other place today that she intends to put the pressure on to seek appropriate assurances about employment. I also thank her very much for speaking up very vocally last week in favour of Launceston. Unfortunately, the Premier of Tasmania was not so cooperative, instead choosing to accuse others of playing politics at a time when the community needs to unite. It is, in fact, him who is deciding to play politics. I refer isn't to the Tasmanian parliamentary Hansard and Prime tonight propose to say no more on that. Telstra was interviewing for jobs for new positions in the Launceston call centre on the very day that this decision was announced. Labor has attempted to turn this issue into a party-political debate centring on the Howard government's decision and long standing Telstra policy to complete the final sale of the shares that it held in Telstra. It is worth noting that the Keating government corporatised Telstra, set up a board and gave it the mandate to function as a company in a very competitive environment. In giving this recognition I note that, while I do not accept or agree with the decision, it could have been taken under a 100 per cent government owned organisation or under a 51 per cent government owned organisation. In any event it is somewhat irrelevant, given that we have the decision to deal with. In addition to that, the bor federal opposition now apparently agrees with the government's position on Telstra, recently announcing that it, too, would dispose of the government's remaining shareholding in Telstra. As I have said, Launceston has a purposebuilt techno park which provides an ideal opportunity for national companies wishing to expand its services. My strong recommendation to the company is to consider Launceston-and to fairly consider it-as home to one of its more consolidated four or five super call centres. Northern Tasmania has a reputation for being a first-class location for call centres with quality staff, low staff turnover-arising from the loyalty which we have seen in regional communities-competitive wages, affordable land and a lifestyle unequalled anywhere else in Australia. I have invited Mr Trujillo to visit northern Tasmania to further understand why our region is an ideal place for further investment by Telstra. Recently, as well, I convened a group of Tasmanian community and business leaders, and we have formed an alliance specifically designed to challenge Telstra's Launceston call centre decision on business grounds. We intend to put together a strong business case to take to Telstra. We need to deal with this matter with a united front, and that is just what I have been very pleased to receive from our Launceston business and community leaders and the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Launceston Chamber of Commerce, the Launceston City Council, the University of Tasmania and our regional development body NTD. I do not accept Telstra's decision, I do accept the way in which it was taken and I do not accept the lack of consultation and good faith that it has shown in not even providing Launceston and northern Tasmania with an opportunity to put forward its creLadentials as a future location for Telstra to do business. Kerang Rail Accident Fuel Prices",116
166,Ms KING,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to commence my contribution tonight by acknowledging the contribution of the member for Mallee. Mr Speaker, having an adjoining electorate to the member for Mallee and to my electorate of Ballarat, you would understand just how much tragedies such as the Kerang rail disaster affect country people. Certainly the rail disaster at Kerang has touched all Victorians, but particularly those of us who live in country Victoria who see the rail services that we have and who live along that corridor. Tonight I want to talk about petrol pricing. Despite the Howard government's contention that families have never had it so good, the reality for many families is very different. Many families are struggling to make ends meet. Personal debt has reached record levels, with total personal debt in Australia increasing from $45.9 billion in January 1996 to a staggering $133.1 billion in November 2006. Families are struggling to keep up to date with their mortgage repayments-a fact demonstrated by the current level of mortgage repossessions being two-thirds higher than in 1991, at the height of the recession. Expenses for essential items like child care are increasing at a faster rate than inflation, with childcare costs rising a whopping 54 per cent in the three months between December 2006 and March 2007, with a 12.9 per cent increase over the past year. The budgets of many families in my elecnot torate are stretched to breaking point-and, once again, over the long weekend, motorists had to shell out extra for petrol. Too often oil companies have seen long weekends, the Easter break and school holidays as times to cash in. Motorists in my electorate alone paid an extra $734,000 at the petrol browser last week compared to what they paid in January this year. When you look at the number of motorists in the city of Ballarat itself, that amounts to $446,000 extra per week compared to January this year. In Hepburn Shire, motorists are paying $136,000 extra per week compared to January this year and in the Moorabool Shire motorists are paying $133,270 extra per week compared to what they were paying in January this year. Motorists in regional and rural Australia are particularly sensitive to petrol prices. Motorists in regional communities have further to travel, be it for work, visiting family or friends or attending social functions. Take communities like Bacchus Marsh and Darley in my electorate, which have a high population of commuters who travel to Melbourne each day for work. For many, this means a round trip of over two hours driving each day. With public transport not always as good or as affordable as it could be, compared to many of the areas in Melbourne, the task of going to work can become unaffordable for some families already struggling with the skyrocketing costs of health, education, groceries and child care. It is money that many families do not have. While it is true that there are many factors that contribute to the price of petrol, it is equally true that there is something very strange going on with petrol prices. You know petrol prices are too high when Caltex themselves admit that the petrol prices are too high. It was reported last week that petrol companies were overcharging consumers by up to 10c per litre in the lead-up to the long weekend. We need to assure motorists that they are getting the best possible deal they can get when they fill up their car. The Prime Minister admits that oil companies have been slow to pass on falls in the Singapore benchmark price and that this is what is hurting Australian families. But these are just crocodile tears. What has the Howard government actually done to counter this? What measures has the government introduced to prevent petrol gouging? What powers or instructions has the Howard government given to the ACCC to monitor petrol prices? The short answer is: absolutely nothing. At present, the ACCC can only monitor prices at the bowser and refinery gate by using data that is in the public realm. To access other documents on pricing, they have to be instructed by the Treasurer of the daywhich is something that this Treasurer has not done. The ACCC relies on informal monitoring, using only publicly available information on petrol prices. This is no match for the multimillion-dollar oil companies. The Howard government has not given the ACCC adequate resources, instructions or powers. This is simply not good enough for the thousands of families in my district. Labor has said that in government we will establish an office of petrol commissioner within the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. We will give a national petrol commissioner the legislative powers to get inside oil companies and access any relevant documentation on pricing. The office of petrol commissioner will be given full powers under the Trade Practices Act to monitor and investigate petrol pricing. This will enable the petrol commissioner to scrutinise documents and other information from any participant in the petrol supply chain to stop any price gouging. The Howard government must do everything in its power to ensure that motorists are not paying one cent more on petrol than is necessary. Unfortunately, this current government is not. (Time expired) Wakefield Electorate: Gawler Railway",117
167,Mr FAWCETT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to draw the attention of the House to the Gawler railway station, which over the last few years I have had the pleasure of attending on a regular basis-meeting commuters first thing in the morning to get feedback from them. There has been a transformation of the railway station itself from an old building which, although historic, was a little bit tired. That building has gradually been restored and now houses a community art gallery along with a historic engine manufactured by James Martin and Co. It was restored and moved to the railway station and has become a real centrepiece for the town. But the real story is in how all this has come about. The Lions Club of Gawler took on and managed this project back in 2000. Negotiations between the club and TransAdelaide's Adopt a Station program saw this project come together. The Lions Club of Gawler approached Employment Directions regarding a Work for the Dole program, and the federal government and the local government became involved. The town of Gawler gave permission for the Lions Club to do the work and to run a Sunday market to help with funding. So there has been a whole hub of activity around this project. The Lions market, which started with five stalls back in 2001, now has 30 to 40 stalls, generating quite a substantial income each year. The Work for the Dole program has given the Lions Club around six personnel at any given time for a few days each week. This has seen work on the stationmaster's cottage go ahead. A canopy was provided by Ahrens Engineering and sponsorship by the local business people amounted to around $50,000. I had the pleasure just last month to go to Station the opening of the Gawler Community Gallery and to see the fine work in there. The Work for the Dole participants can hold their heads high for the work that they have done there. I would like to particularly mention  nor, who has been the chairman of this station project. It was his vision and his leadership ability that brought together a number of disparate organisations, companies and individuals over quite a number of years to see this project work. There have been some setbacks along the way. There was a rash of graffiti that particularly affected the train engine. They caught one of the culprits, which I welcome. Surprisingly, it was actually a middle-aged person as opposed to a youth. It was good to see the resilience of the community in restoring the engine. I particularly want to mention Pat Mells, because he has provided leadership to this program as well as leadership in the Lions organisation over a number of years. I was very pleased this week to read in the paper that Pat was recognised in the Queen's Birthday Honours List with an OAM in the general division for his commitment to Lions and to the community over many years. The Lions Club is just one of a number of community groups that are very active in Gawler and the surrounding areas. It is the commitment and the sacrifice of time, energy and passion of people like Pat Mells that enable those community groups to make a significant difference. I wish to draw the attention of the House to this recognition of Pat Mells. I wish him all the best and thank him for what he has contributed to our community.

The government instead promised to do study to see where things go from there. That results became clear. This was a very difficult was no doubt that a study could take place and the situation was that it would be complex that had to be dealt with in the As a result of that the minister decided to the conduct of a study.
