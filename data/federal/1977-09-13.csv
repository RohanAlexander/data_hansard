1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Rt Hon. B. M. Snedden, QC.) took the chair at 3.20 p.m., and read prayers. DEATH OF MR L. C. HAYLEN",14
2,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,Unknown," Mr Speaker, I move: That this House expresses its regret at the death tember 1977 of Leslie Clement Haylen, a member of this House for the Division of Parkes from 1943 until 1963, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious service, and tenders its deep sympathy to his family in their bereavement. Mr Speaker, Mr Leslie Haylen was a member of this House from 1943 to 1963. He represented the Sydney suburban electorate of Parkes for 20 years in a most memorable manner. During the First World War he served overseas with the Australian infantry forces until he was discharged in 1919. From thetimehe was elected to the Parliament in 1943 he served on numerous parhamentary committees, ranging from the Joint Committee on Social Security to the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parhamentary Proceedings. He also represented Australia overseas as a member of the Australian delegation to the 27th session of the International Labour Organisation in Paris in 1946, as Chairman of the Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Committee which toured Europe in 1945 and as leader of the parhamentary delegation to Japan in 1948. In addition, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whidam) reminded us in another place earUer today, he visited China about 20 years ago. Les Haylen was an author as well as a member of this House. He had pubUshed numerous works ranging from plays and short stories to novels and historical works. His term in parUament, first on the Government benches and later on the Opposition front bench, was characterised by his sincerity and by his vigor. He will be remembered by his former colleagues for his conscientious and devoted service to the ideals and interests ofhis party and ofhis country. I am sure that I speak for all of us when I say to his widow and his two sons that we offer them our sympathy in their loss. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition)- Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party I support the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and I thank him for moving the motion. For 20 years Les Haylen maintained a reputation as a highly articulate and authentically Australian member of the Australian Parliament. He came to the Parliament in the great Curtin victory of 1943. His Division of Parkes always remained a very difficult seat for the Australian Labor Parry, one of those seats which were a litmus test of pubhc opinion. It was a tribute to him that until 1963 he retained the seat even in those elections which went badly for our party. He had a healthy sense of irreverence combined with a deep love for the Australian people. If I may use a term which on 12 Sepcame easily to him, he loved the ordinary bloke and he always saw himself as one of the blokes. He was the most effective debunker of humbug and the greatest deflator of pomposity in the House in his time. He spared nobody, not least, or even especiaUy not, Sir Robert Menzies himself. He was one of the handful of private members who could fill the House for a speech. The Ust of his pubUshed plays and books indicates the range of matters which roused his interest, concern and passion-fro m the Eureka Stockade to the war in Vietnam. He was one of the most scintillating raconteurs that any of us has ever met. Les Haylen was one of the. first members of this Parliament to visit the People's RepubUc of China. That was at a time when it was not popular or even prudent to do so. It is a remarkable change in public and poltiical opinion that has enabled us today to receive  Speaker, a delegation from the National People's Congress of the People's RepubUc of China. He was one of thefirstto oppose the war in Vietnam, years before conscription inflamed public passions on that issue. He was, above aU, a genuine character. Only Australia could have produced him. This Parliament was a poorer place when he was defeated. His widow and his sons can be proud of him, as his party will always be.",14
3,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"Richmond-Minister for National Resources and Minister for Overseas Trade)- I join the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) in this condolence motion on the death of Les Haylen. I speak particularly on behalf of those members of my party who were here with Les Haylen. They will remember him as one of the memorable characters of this House. He was a very effective parliamentarian. He was a hard-working member of the Opposition who had a very quick wit. Anybody who had the audacity to interject on him would very quickly suffer the effects of the very sharp tongue that he had. Les Haylen had a wide experience. He had a rural background. He was a very good soldier, a journalist and an author, and for 20 years he served as a member of this Parliament. I always think of him as one of the old school, of the Chifley and Curtin type, who was rugged but underneath all that was a very likeable, very polite and very gendemanly person. Most of those who knew him will remember him that way. Many of his works as an author were translated into other languages. I recall that some of them were translated into German. On one occasion the late Arthur Calwell said that the reason we had so many German migrants in Australia was that they had read Les Haylen's books and had gained an impression of Australia. I am glad to be able to make these remarks about a memorable character of this Parliament. I express sympathy to his widow and family.",14
4,Mr UREN,Unknown," I join the party leaders in this House by placing on record my remarks about Leslie Haylen. He was an old warrior. He was one for whom we on this side of the House had great affection. It is ironic that Leslie died the day before the visit to this country Chinese delegation from the National People's Congress. China had an enormous influence on his Ufe. He first visited China just prior to the eration of China in 1949. He again visited China after an invitation was sent from the People's Institute of Foreign Affairs to Dr Evatt in 1957 inviting a delegation of the ParUamentary Labor Party. Three people were chosen by the Austaken traUan Labor Party Caucus to visit China. They was born. were Leslie Haylen, Percy Clarey and CharUe Griffiths. Leslie Haylen was elected leader of that delegation. On that occasion he met Chou En-lai and many of the other leaders of China. When he returned he wrote a book entided China Journey: The Republic Revisited. When was a young parliamentarian we discussed great length the problems of the people of China and related them to the problems of the people in our own country. Leslie Haylen had a very widefieldof interest. He was interested in the arts and Uterature. He was not a man of malice. He was a man with a that light-hearted attitude who was respected sides of the House. FoUowing LesUe Haylen's wonderful AustralianThis defeat in 19631 was able to keep in close contact with him, both on the telephone his home. Also, he was a great letter writer. When he agreed with what one said he would write a complimentary letter. Of course, at same time, if he did not agree he would also let one know about that I say to Sylvia, his wife, and to Wayne, his son, that I am saddened at passing. Regrettably I have not been able know his other son. I know how proud he was Wayne who gained a law degree and is now practising at the New South Wales Bar. I join with other honourable members in paying my respects to Leslie Haylen for the service he gave to the Parliament and to the nation.",15
5,Mr KILLEN,Unknown,"May I take a moment or two to join with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whidam) in this motion. I sat in the Parliament with Lestie Haylen, together with some remaining coUeagues such as the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) and the right honourable member for Lowe (Sir William MCMahon). Even though on occasions we were at the receiving end of his irreverence and his wit the honourable gendeman was one who did not take his partisan views outside this chamber. He was a magnificent companion. His wit was elegant; it was ready. There was no malice in his being at aU. He once complained that I was in the Haylen wrong poltiical party. I have heard that comof the plaint come from my own side of poUtics. The honourable gendeman gave as much as he took. He did it in a magnificent parhamentary style. lib-One of my regrets is that Parliament today has lost a number of characters. There is a disposition by many people outside to think that every person who comes into this place should be taken from the one mould. Well, Leslie Haylen was from one mould but they broke it after he I recall on one occasion twitting him in a speech that he was using phrases made up on the spur of a fortnight ago. He just laughed at me. I recaU that in the same debate when Haylen was in fuUflight-when Haylen was in fuUflightthat I honourable gendeman was talking-durin g a at moment's pause one of my coUeagues said to him: 'The honourable gentleman should be in the circus'. Haylen, without batting an eyeUd, turned to him and said: 'And if I were, I assure the honourable gentleman that he would be fed at therighttime'. It is a matter of regret to me the honourable gendeman has passed from this world. To his wife and family I extend my on both very deep sympathy. world has lost a warm, character. Another world and by visiting has gained one.",15
6,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"My friend the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr the Clyde Cameron) and I are among the few members on this side who served with Leslie Haylen for the majority ofhis period here. What has not hisbeen mentioned is that his ancestry was very to close to this area. His family came from the ofBugendore-Queanbeyan district. At some odd stages he had a nostalgic idea of buying back family property. I think that in the long run prices and circumstances beat him as he did not do that. Nevertheless, he had an interest in this area always. I suppose that one of the ironies Hansard is that it does not record the nuances debate. I sometimes wish it would insert in the report 'Laughter', or something else, in brackets. But it does not. Often when one reads Hansard coldly later it does not sound quite the same did on the occasion. I am pleased that my friend from Queensland, pointfinest the Minister for Defence (Mr Kilien), has rolled-neck spoken. I think at one time he and claimed a distant ancestry. How close not know. Certainly it shows that blood someskins of a poor mink. Onturned times divides in rather odd sorts of ways. Haylen was a very close friend of mine. I some of his most entertaining moments were not Haylen on the system. He could see LesUe in the House; they were as a raconteur at some anomalies. He could see the issues as clearly intimate gatherings. I do not often take part in anybody. valedictories but I am pleased to do so on this occasion. I think it is rather sad that only a ful of people still remember individually a who left here in 1963. Those of us who are luckyhave to be among that number treasure his memory. am sure we extend to his wife and two sons our sincere sympathy in their bereavement.",15
7,Mr BRYANT,Unknown,"Like my friend the when he honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr only 16V4died. Crean) and my friend the honourable for Moreton (Mr Kilien), I served with LesUe unit as his brothers, France Haylen. He was a member when I wasfirsteleckilled almost in his presence. ted to this Parliament. I suppose the best term my deep regret. I know I express that one could apply to him is that he bUthe spirit. He brought into this place some is the touch which I hope is not lacking but think may be. People such as himself, the late Edward Ward, the late Arthur CalweU, Reg PoUard and so on, but particularly LesUe Haylen, brought to debate in this place a touch which is perhaps hard to deUver at this time when we are in such a hurry to do things. He a man who, both in prose and verse, was able leave his mark on Australian Uterature. I expect that if someone wanted to study LesUe Haylen the place to look would be in Hansard, for the sprinkled through that would be his philosophy, his wit and his attitude on everything that and goes. I wish to make two points about the way in which which he expressed himself and his capacity for using the EngUsh language to get the message across. He was a very humane man with an attiwas tude to humanity, no matter from where people came. One night the House was debating the question of providing aid for people in need the overseas countries. I think it was Sir John MCEwen who said that we had long range plans about aid. LesUe put the thing in a nutsheU, as succinctly as it could have been said in our lanof guage, when he said: 'It is no good having long of range plans for short range bellies'. He had an attitude to the pomp in a place such as this and the anomalous nature of it in some ways. I remember that one night here some friends ofhis as it were excluded from the Speaker's GaUery because they were not wearing ties. He made the that his friends had turned up in one of the products of the Australian countrysideLesUe Haylen was taken topullovers. the ladies He said that no exception who were friends of the it was I do people in office and who up in the flayed Les Speaker chose to sit there, as he said,hand, the other the with the think rear end of a sheep on his head. This was the as handI send this message to his family: We in this man House who remember him and those of us who taken an active and interested part in poUI tics in the last 30 years will remember him, although it is 14 years since he retired from this place. He went to the First World War as a young man. I think he was only 78 years of age years That means that he was probably of age or thereabouts when he member managed to get into to serve in the same one of whom I trunk was So I place on record the sentiments was a of all those who served with him here. worse for his passing, but it was AustraUablessed by which I his presence on this continent.",16
8,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,Unknown,"I am one of the few honourable members who served with LesUe Haylen for the period from 1949 until he retired from Parliament. I am pleased that the wasPrime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the to Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whidam) said what they did about bim. I am pleased that the Minister for Defence (Mr Kilien) spoke in way that he did of Les Haylen's attributes. If Les Haylen could hear the valedictories of this comes Parliament he would be pleased that we reminded ourselves of some of his witty exploits and some of the examples of practical jokes for he was quite famous. I know that it is normal to say that so-and-so a colourful character; it is done almost always when we talk about people. LesUe Haylen was indeed a colourful character. I canin not remember him ever coming into this chamber without wearing a red carnation. I think it is sad that others did not follow the example set because many of them would have improved their appearance considerably had they done so. I said that he was a practical joker. I should like to remind the House-and I know Haylen would Uke me to do so-of an example his pracucai joking. One day the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth)-stand ing in the very place where he now sits, incidenthe tally-wa s making one of his normal speeches against communism, unitytickets,the Russians and the Chinese, when LesUe Haylen said to 'Quickly, go into the bar and get a couple of white coats. Wardie will put one on and I will on the other and we will stand alongside him and see how long he keeps going'. I rushed and gathered two white coats which belonged to the stewards. Eddie Ward could not because it had narrow shoulders, but Leslie Haylen was able to scramble into his. In his white coat he walked up and stood alongside the honourable member for Mackellar. He quietly said to the honourable gendeman, as he was talking about communism: 'Excuse me, but the green van is waiting'. Mr King-What happened after that?",16
9,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,Unknown,"The honourable was gendeman was at once collected by, I think, Sergeant-at-Arms, who was a Utde chap named electorate Pettifer. This Utde man crept up on the honouris able member and asked him to remove himself from the chamber. I tbink he was taken into Speaker's room for an address of some kind. That was Les Haylen's idea of practical joking. He had a very healthy disregard for the Country Party. I can recall the former honour the weekends. able member for Mallee, Mr Turnbull, coming into the House, holding up a skeleton weed, saying: 'Here is a skeleton weed'. Les Haylen said: 'Which is the skeleton weed?' The honourpassing, able member for MaUee was concerned about its spread. On one occasion Les Haylen observe the bovine expressions of those in the Country Party corner. To give an example of their doleful approach to Ufe he lamented: 'The wheel of the waggon is broken; it ain't goin' rain no more'. That was Leslie Haylen. He was great character. He was one of the characters of the Parliament The honourable member for feel MackeUar is another. No doubt the Minister for Defence will be talked of in the same way in many years to come.",17

11,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,Unknown,"I thank the structure honourable member for the promise. with other honourable members in expressing he regret at the passing of LesUe Haylen. I convey my sympathy to his widow and his two sons. They at least will know that their husband and father was highly regarded by this Parliament, LesUe and by both sides of the Parliament. of Mr WENTWORTH (Mackellar)-I am sure that LesUe Haylen, Uke Aristophanes, would Uke - to be remembered for golden laughter beyond grave, for he was a man of infinite jest. Well do I remember the incident related by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde me: Cameron). I well remember addressing a normally rapt House, with it hanging on every word, put when suddenly for no reason that I could discern it dissolved into laughter. I did not know what to the bar was happening behind me. get into his Mr COHEN - You never do.",17
12,Mr WENTWORTH,Unknown,"I suspect that is true. I have always taken the precaution of sitting right at the back of the chamber. Even if one does not know what is happening behind, at least one knows what is happening in front. I sometimes feel that honourable members on the other side of the chamber do not always know that. I remember Leslie, amongst other things, for an expression which is now old but which I think new in his mouth. He always referred to the the ceremonies which he had to attend in his own as being 'fetes worse than death'. That now an old phrase, but I think it was his, and it was new when hefirstused it There were many the sides to his character which are not known by everyone. I remember, for example, the way in which he used to go camping down the Nattai Valley. He always loved to go into the bush for I join very sincerely in what I think would be and the appropriate tribute. Accompanying the laughter, there is the sadness that we feel m his and I would Uke to join with other honourable members in giving aU our sympathy invited us to to his family.",17
13,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"When I was first elected to the Parliament I was 27 years of age to and Leslie Haylen was 46. He took me aside as a a young man and said: 'If you are going to specialise, do not do it too obviously or the Minister will you are after his job'. I think one of the tragedies of LesUe Haylen was that he was not a Minister, and I believe that he should have been a Minister in the Chifley Government. He would have liked to have been Minister for Repatriation, which in those days was a portfolio and a oflaw which was full of anomaUes that I do join - used to make him very angry. But I am quite sure that his real first love the field of international affairs. He confided me on a couple of occasions that really tual home was France. When I was first elected to the Parliament he had just returned from some parliamentary delegation in France. Journey. France was just coming out of the trauma of the credit, Second World War, and he spoke of the spirit the French people who had been through a ter-Twenty ribly hard time. Yet he appreciated in the Frenchhad nature the gaiety which was certainly in his own.period I found it to be almost unbelievable when I in his obituary in the Sydney Morning Herald that he was 78 years of age. Even when he lefttuaUy the Parliament at the age of 64 he seemed to establish have an outlook which was perennially young and I believe he retained that really to the end, judging from whatever I heard from him and tually from when I met him when he came here. I jointhefirstmigrants with other honourable members in expressing his widow Sylvia and his two sons sympathy.",17
14,Mr LES JOHNSON,Unknown,"I am glad national that the House has not been tempted to talk about LesUe Haylen in any dour or miserable way today, because he was certainly not that kind of man. He would Uke us to have a laugh and probably a drink to celebrate the ume spent here in this Parliament. I had the good tune to work in LesUe Haylen's first election campaign and subsequent campaigns, and I hold as mementoes his letter of thanks and his poltiical pamphlets. He was certainly an animated and exciting man. I am pleased that I have the opportunity of speaking after the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) today because Leslie Haylen, although never a gourmet, one who certainly enjoyed a nice drop of red. remember an occasion when he came into the first verse: chamber with his touch of French sophistication and his knowledge of the vintage and talked excitedly on a wine Bill. He was followed in debate by the honourable member for Mackellar who I think said: ' Mr Speaker, the House has been treated to a delightful variety of a dry medium red'. LesUe Haylen was anything but that. He was a colourful radical. He was an Evattwas supporter at thetimeof the spUt. There was no equivocation about where he stood in respect the issues of the day. I suppose that, look back and realise that the split bringing troops back from Asia, banning and recognising China, symbolically we could say today that the great luncheon for the Chinesespirit delegation was Leslie Haylen's vindication. felt very strongly about the need to recognise wasone-quarter of the world's population. He to advocated that for the 20 years that he was a his spiri-member of the Parliament. He wrote many books and devoted one of them to his visit to China. It was caUed Chinese He had many other great writings to his such as Blood on the Wattle, a Cavalcade ofof Labor History-a . play-and A for Artemis. Years Hard Labor was his last work. He a great part to play as a back bencher in the when Labor was in office. It is not generreadally known, for example, that it was LesUe Haylen who went to Papua New Guinea virto hand pick the first patrol officers and to the patrol officer service. He was chairman of the Immigration Advisory Committee. It is not generaUy known that he went overseas virto hand pick the ships which were to bring to Australia under the great to plan of Arthur Calwell when he initiated the our sincere immigration program. Leslie Haylen was a great advocate of a theatre. Today he would reaUse that many of his contentions have eventuated because of the enthusiasm he brought to bear. He was a very great poet. I have collected a number of his poems. I have some of my collection here he in Parliament House today. Chifley's Grave is for-one poem for which he will be remembered. I shaU read a couple of verses from it: The pomp of power and the talk of princes cease, early The angry word, the hatreds fall and die. In austere beauty and in peace He lies beneath the arched and opal sky. Here was a man who loved the simple things; The breath of wattle and the stir of wings, The strong hand for a falling brother, The gende gospel: 'Love ye one another'. was There was his poem Arthur about Arthur I Calwell, a man he revered. I shaU read just the When a man dies and his friends weep, That is life and death in their order, the But when a man dies and his enemies weep, That is greatness crossing the border. I know that he would have liked me to mention oldhis dedication to bringing the Vietnam war to an early cessation. He wrote a Christmas card which headed 'It's rainin' on the Barcoo'. I shall not read it all by any means. The last verse says: of Yes, it's rainin' on the Barcoo, when we And it's rainin' back o' Bourke, was about When will it rain on mankind, bombs The Christ cry'PEACE ON EARTH'. These verses in themselves symbolise the great that was LesUe Haylen- a man who stood He for the great things but who stood for them in such a human way, in a way that ordinary men could understand. His wife, Sylvia, and Wayne and Ron, would be very touched to know today that in the Parliament those people who served with him and those who have come after him can learn from the example he gave in upholding the cause of mankind. I convey sympathy to Sylvia and his sons.",18

The suggestion has been made that Australia could act as a waste disposal dump for other countries. pub3. The Fox Report makes it clear that the mining of uranium will create few jobs and contribute Uttle to national wealth. 4. There is no safe method of disposal or storage of high level radioactive waste. 5. The increased avaUabUity of plutonium will magnify the terrorist threat. It is impossible and immoral to think of mining uranium Abortion only in Australian terms. Uranium mining contributes to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the increased risk of nuclear war. And your peutioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Hunt. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We, the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia by this humble petition respectfully showeth: That we believe that none of the safety problems associated with uranium and plutonium has been solved. The rnining and export of uranium will help to nuclear power industry thus contributing to the health hazards of the world. Mining uranium will damage the environment and the health of the aboriginal people. Our beliefs on this matter are shared by a majority of physicists and scientists including 75 per cent of all specialists in nuclear medicine. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Governimposed ment will not allow the mining, selling and export of uranium ore. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Innes. Petition received. Private Hospital and Nursing Home Subsidies To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.

We further urge the Government to reverse its decision withdraw the Nusing Home Subsidy as from I October 1977. 2. As we are already paying for the subsidies through our taxes, we consider it an imposition for us to be obliged meet these costs through higher health fund contributions. 3. We also request the immediate re-introduction of tralians. income tax concessions in respect contributions. by Mr King. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled, the Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showethThat the delays between announcements ofeach quarterly movement in the Consumer Price Index and their application as a percentage increase in age and invaUd pensions is excessive, unnecessary, discriminatory and a cause of economic distress to pensioners. That proposals to amend the Consumer Price Index by eliminating particular items from the Index could adversely affect the value of future increases in age and invaUd pensions and thus be a cause of additional economic hardship to pensioners. The foregoing facts impel your petitioners to ask the Australian Government as a matter of urgency to1. Require each quanerly percentage increase in-the consumer price index to be applied to age and invaUd and similar pensions as from the pensionpay day nearest following the date of announcement of the CPI movement 2. Give an open assurance to all aged and invaUd penUranium sioners that any revision of the items comprising the consumer price index will in no way result in reductions in the House value of any future entitlements to pensioners.

That there should be substantial increases in education expenditure to make education accessible and free to all people who want it. 2. That in view of the substandard Uving conditions forced on many tertiary students as a consequence of a totally inadequate student assistance scheme, there is an urgent need for an immediate increase in the present level of the Tertiary Educauon Assistance Scheme to 120 per cent of the adjusted Henderson poverty line; and, further, that the TEAS be indexed quarterly to movements in the Consumer Price Index. 3. That all students should receive a living wage, starting at the minimum wage. 4. That the needs-based grants scheme be in no way jeopardised by any other program of student assistance, including supplementary or comprehensive loans schemes.

NA RURAL INDUSTRY: ADDITIONAL",22
18,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. The right honourable gentleman remember that on Wednesday last, in response to a question without notice, he asserted that there would not be any additional assistance to rural industry in this financial year beyond the tax averaging provisions he announced yesterday. I ask the Treasurer: Is it a fact that these recently announced changes to the system of personal income tax, which were first introduced only 4 weeks ago, generally restore a benefit that primary producers enjoyed prior to the Budget? I ask the Treasurer how he can reconcile these changes with his statement on page 33 of Statement No. 2 of the 1977-78 Budget Papers which reads: Disarmament from Budget proposals themselves, there will be no fiscal measures during 1977-78. Is it also a fact that the measures he announced last night will not assist the majority of beef proserious tensions and risks world's ducers and many other straggling primary producers because so many of them do not nave a of national taxable income? Finally, in the Ught of press ways of speculation last Friday about a rural miniBudget and the parlous state of the beef industry, Governis the Treasurer prepared to assert again that the Government will not provide any meaningful ason Dissistance to the beef industry and other depressed to obtain agreed primary producers?",22
19,Mr LYNCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable gentleman and members of the Opposition Party have always zones in shown a sense of nostiUty towards men and women on the land. The fact is that one only has to go back to the poUcies of high inflation and high labour costs during the penod of the Labor Administration which imposed a crippling burden on people on the land. The honourable gentleman rests on an assertion and an inference which are in fact quite unfounded. The question Notice of Motion that I was asked during the course of last week's parhamentary sitting was whether there would be a rnhu-Budget. The honourable gentleman because of his past experience ought to know awarding of what in fact a mini-Budget means. What was announced last night is of very considerable the advantage to the rural sector. It is utterly jusHouse tified. It is deserved by people on the land.,22
20,Mr YOUNG,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Why did you not do it in the Budget?,22
21,Mr LYNCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I remind the honourable member for Banks and the interjector that if one looks at the Budget and the Budget Papers that I brought down this year or the Budget Papers for the previous year one finds that there is always ASSISTANCE an assumption built into Statement No. 2 that there will be no new fiscal initiatives during the course of the year. That is put down to enable the will various figures to have a soUd base. Opposition members-Oh !,22

24,Mr LYNCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for Oxley who interjects of course had a Budget deficit which blew out to $4.5 billion. As honourdevelopment able gentleman opposite are very much aware, of course decisions are made during the course any year in the light of events as they occur. was the case dunng the course of last year. Budget deficit and the expenditure level that put down was in fact reduced, as I recall, around $200m. So far as the rural sector is conbreeder cerned, a number of advantages were included the Budget papers. During the course of this as Government's administrauon it has taken a series of decisions which have been of particular assistance to the rural sector. I instance such things as stock valuation and the lowance. Beyond those things, as the year unfolds other decisions will be taken in the of particular events. I invite the honourable gentleman to curb his impatience about the ered problems of beef producers. Senior Ministers have indicated quite clearly that these matters are before the Government and decisions will be announced at the appropriate time. NA NA",23
25,Mr BIRNEY,EXPORT,My question is addressed to the be Ut Prime Minister. Will Australia's poUcies on ies uranium development and export be affected in matter. any way by recent discussions and decisions at the British Trade Union Congress on nuclear energy recently reported in the Australian Press?,23
26,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,EXPORT,"Attention has it is a been drawn to reports dated 10 September that the annual conference of the British Trade Union Congress advocated an expanded nuclear proIndustries gram. I further note that the Trade Union gress, as that report indicated, backed a full demonstration of fast breeder reactors on grounds that there might be a shortage of uramum and that therefore countries dependent on nuclear energy for peaceful purposes would need to conserve what suppUes of uranium were avaUable to them. I think all honourable gentlemen would know that compared with the Ught water reactor a fast breeder reactor makes more efficient use of uramum but, at the time, takes the country so involved plutonium economy which is something which has been of concern to this Government. I believe it is most significant that the Trade Union Congress has apparently come to these views. It also shows that in the United Kingdom responsible unions, having a considerable number of facts avaUable to them, having a very large number of their members dependent upon energy from nuclear suppUes, recognise that countries of Europe need uramum for the of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. It also shows that in order to conserve enof ergy even now they are thinking of moves That towards a fast breeder reactor. These two matThe ters together emphasise why the ready availwe ability of Australian uramum is important in by order to slow down the move towards fast reactors, if that is possible, and to slow in down the move towards the plutonium economy, well as to give Australia the strongest possible voice in the world forums against nuclear proliferation and in favour of proper waste disposal as modern scientific and technological knowlinvestment aledge now makes possible. Ught I hope very much that the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the delegates there gathwill take into account what their brothers in Britain have decided and determined on these particular matters, bearing in mind the fact that m Britain jobs are dependent upon uranium. It is very easy for people to make pohcy about these particular matters when they know that irrespective of whatever policy they make their homes will be heated, thetightsin their homes will still and that there wiU be power for the factorin which they work. In Europe it is a different NA NA",23
27,Mr HURFORD,AND TAX AVERAGING,"I ask the Treasurer whether fact that many small businesses in rural and urban areas have suffered greatly from fluctuations in their incomes. Is it also a fact that the Assistance Commissionreport,iniCon-tiated by the Labor Government, which recscaleommended the introduction of an income equalisation deposit scheme and the retention of tax averaging provisions for rural producers, also recommended that these proposals should be extended to all taxpayers, particularly the many who have greatly fluctuating incomes? Will the Treasurer and the Government consider implementing this IAC recommendation in the near future, particularly to protect small same businesses from bankruptcy in the present closer to the recession?",23
28,Mr LYNCH,AND TAX AVERAGING,"This Government has a very real concern for the problems of the smaU business community, unlike the Opposition in this House. The Opposition ought to remember that as a direct consequence of the investment allowance and the stock valuation provisions the effective rate of tax on many small businesses in the community was reduced by between 8 per cent and 10 per cent. The honourable gentleman ought to dwell on that. The averaging of incomes outside the rural sector certainly is a matter at which the Government will look, but I do not want to give the honourable gentleman any encouragement to beheve that, having regard to the framework of the Budget, that would be a matter for early consideration. PRIMARY PRODUCERS: TAX NA",23
29,Mr SIMON,AVERAGING PROPOSALS,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Why was it necessary to introduce revised tax averaging procedures for farmers?,24
30,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,AVERAGING PROPOSALS,"In one sentence, it was necessary because the changed scales that came from the Hayden tax reforms resulted in farmers paying in tax about $S0m a year more than otherwise would have been the case. Let me give a number of examples of how that occurred. A wage earner on an average income of $5,000 would have been paying $499 a year in tax under the Hayden scales. A farmer whose incomes over five years were $5,000, $5,000, $2,000, $8,000 and $5,000-that is, with the same average income of $5,000-woul d have paid in each those years $499, $499, nil, $1,204 and $499 tax. It is perfectly plain, when thosefiguresare averaged out, that the farmer was paying in tax over that period $200 more than the wage earner, even though his average income was the same. Obviously that is vastly unjust. Let me give some other examples of detriment of farmers flowing from the Hayden scales. farmer with a taxable income of $4,000 and average income of $3,000 in 1974-75, on the scales-that is, pre-Hayden-woul d have paid $293 in tax. Under the Hayden scales, tax payprovided able immediately rose the following year to $353. A farmer with a taxable income of $8,000 and an average income of $6,000 would have had his tax lifted from $1,333 under the premany Hayden scales to $1,540 under the Hayden the scales. A farmer with a taxable income of $10,000 and an average income of $5,000 would have had his tax lifted from $1,360 to $1,880. the great Hayden scales which were said to be full of benefits for so many people were, as now understand and putting it in the gentlest of terms, somewhat misleading. There were an enormous number of detriment cases involved them. I have given merely three or four instances Wales. of the way in which detriment occurred in a particularly onerous fashion to primary producers. That is why once the matter became clear the Government moved very swiftly to remedy it. BROADCASTING LICENCE: WESTERN NA",24
31,Mr ARMITAGE,SUBURBS OF SYDNEY,"My question is directed to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. I preface it by referring to the Minister's calling for fresh applications for a radio station licence for the western suburbs of Sydney at a time when the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is considering an applicauon by radio station 2KA to upgrade its reception in that area. Does the Minister remember rejecting in March the recommendation of the former Australian Broadcasting Control Board for a licence to serve the same area, justfivedays before the High Court had scheduled the hearing of a challenge to the proceedings? Is his latest action another attempt to circumvent a hearing by the appropriate tribunal in the interests of Liberal supporters who did not find favour in the hearings?",24
32,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,SUBURBS OF SYDNEY,"I again tell the honourable gentleman that the decision was taken at the time because we wanted to have a fresh look at the impact, in the technical sense, upon the requirements for broadcasting in that of part of New South Wales. Again I say to the in honourable gentleman that he is confused as to the facts. The present mquiry into stations in the Blue Mountains area is quite different, distinct and apart from my direction to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to call for appUcations for a broadcasting service in an area which is quite different from-althoug h it impinges on-the A subject of the present inquiry. I would have an thought that all members of the Opposition, old including the Leader of the Opposition, would wish to see an adequate broadcasting service in those growing areas of Sydney. That is the entire purpose of the inquiry. After all, there is a tremendously increased population in that area. New Ucences have not been issued for years in Sydney. It is quite reasonable that Tribunal will now listen to the appUcants and will make a decision. I repeat that the present Tribunal hearing, with regard to the stations in So the Blue Mountains, is quite separate and apart from the new appUcations which I have invited. we The honourable member continues to have this quite unnecessary sort of sinister suspicion about providing a service which he ought to know is in overdue and needed in that part of New South NA",24
33,Mr HYDE,ASSISTANCE TO BEEF INDUSTRY,I ask the Prime Minister: Will he please inform the House when he will be able to announce details of the proposed assistance to the beef industry?,25
34,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ASSISTANCE TO BEEF INDUSTRY,"Consultations are still continuing over these matters. Over a lengthy period the Government has had discussions with a wide variety of rural organisthetimetablewhich ations such as the Australian National Cattlemen's Council, the Australian simply Wool growers and Graziers Council, the Aussent trahan Wheat Growers' Federation, the Aushave trahan Wool and Meat Producers Federation am and the Australian Farmers Federation. Over a referral period all these organisations, in addition to Australian Cattlemen's Union, have given day advice to the Government on these matters. Indeed, I believe that over a very long period the organisations which I mentioned have taken a thoroughly responsible approach in the recommade mendations which have been put to the Governmatter. ment, recognising the stringent circumstances in which the Australian economy has been placed. With my colleague, the Minister for Primary spondence. Industry, further consultations are scheduled during the course of this week on one or two aspects of importance. I hope that after that it will be possible to come to a conclusion in relation to these matters. will be meeting the Australian Wool growers and Graziers Council, or at least Sir Samuel Burston will be present, and one or two others. This meetshould ing will take place during the course of this After that decisions can be made. I think it recognised- I am grateful that the Opposition has recognised this-that the cattle industry requires some additional help at the present the time, having gone through three to four years very low pnces and, at the same increased costs. The difficulty for those growers who depend entirely on cattle for their UveUhood is obviously a very grievous one. They are merely keeping their operations going until prices improve to a greater extent. Therefore, when measures are introduced I hope that all honourMinister. able gendemen in the House, including members of the Opposition, will suppon those measures wholeheartedly. AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL LINE: NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Minister for Transport a question. He told the House last April that the Government of Queensland had at last agreed to the proposition which I put Premier in December 1972 that the Australian organisation? National Line should be permitted to estabUsh and operate services within the State. I ask: What is holding up the enabling legislation which will greatly benefit the economy of Queensland ports and their hinterlands and, of course, the economics of the Line itself?",25
35,Mr NIXON,QUEENSLAND PORTS,"The Leader of the Opposition, as is usual in these matters, is correct in terms of he has laid down. The reason for the holding up of the program is that the projected legislation has been to Queensland for its consideration. We not yet had a response from Queensland. I advised that it is necessary for there to be a of power in this matter for the Australian the National Line to operate intrastate on a day-tobasis and to provide regular services, as is requested and required by those who live in northall ern Queensland. Quite a number of honourable members of the National Country Party have representations to me specifically on this It is true that the ANL is providing one service. That has been done by an exchange of correThat is the carriage of minerals out of Weipa to Gladstone. I am not able to rely with any confidence on an exchange of letters standing up to any challenge by a road transport operator or anybody else. Therefore it is necessary for We the Premier of Queensland to agree to a reference of power specifically in this matter. I make the point that if a reference of power be granted it would be within the capacity week. of the Premier of Queensland to get agreement is that the reference of power could be withdrawn if circumstances altered. I am hopeful that the Queensland Government will agree shortly to proposed legislation and that it will be in the ofHouse before the Parliament rises for the sumtime, suffering mer vacation. NA",25
36,Mr KING,ASSISTANCE TO BEEF INDUSTRY,"I direct to the Minister for Primary Industry a question which is supplementary to the answer given a few minutes ago by the Prime Has the Minister for Primary Industry kept abreast of the numerous propositions put forward by a number of producer organisations seeking aid for the beef industry in its economic crisis? If so, is the Minister in a position to indicate which organisations have forwarded fuUy documented and researched proposals for government consideration? Has the Minister received a consensus from all the recognised producer organisations, or is it a fact, as reported, to the that the Government is relying on one Mr SINCLAm-During the Budget deliberthat ations the Government on 2 occasions had proently longed discussions with the Austrahan Farmers Federation, the Australian National Cattlemen's Council, the Australian Wool growers and munity. Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation, the bodies that substantiaUy represent the major producing tors throughout Australia. Each has made very significant, substantial and well documented representations to the Government. More recently a paper has been submitted to the Government by the Cattlemen's Union. It also had occasion to make representations peryears. sonally to the Prime Minister and myself and, understand, separately to the Treasurer. to Independently altogether of those organisations, a large number of honourable members of the House, from both the Liberal and National that Countiy parties, residing in countiy areas have increasingly expressed their concern at what they see as the rift in terms of trade of cattle ducers. They have been worried that the expected up-turn in export markets has not taken place and that cash flows to cattlemen have moved to the position at which many are receiving a significantly lower income certainly than those on average male earnings and, tragicaUy, many are receiving even less than unemployment benefits. It is in those circumstances that the GovernTreasurer. ment has turned its mind to a package of representations. I think it is most unfortunate that at this time, when the industry is in such straits, there should appear to be such vocal isions within the cattle industry. The problems within the community are quite severe. Government recognises those problems and, in responsible way, is endeavouring to ensure that the measures which are introduced will be able to the cattle producers themselves. It easy to advocate a package of proposals, benefits of which may not flow In circumstances in which the long term the industry is assured, where the benefit to nation, as well as large regions of Australia, certainly flow from the restored Ufe in that try, it is obvious that the Government has sponsibiUty towards that sector. Unfortunately one organisation seems quite made intent on estabushing an identity separate from the every other body representing cattle producers. to be Our beUef is that the interests of cattle producers, teport from whatever part of Australia, it is necessaiy for the Government to work in harmony with those organisations to ensure an effective solution to the problems.

I hope, in the making of representations to the community, there is a recognition that many responsible organisations are working in the interests and on behalf of cattlemen and that members of parliaproment are certainly doing that. I hope that by working together, instead of in confrontation with each other, there might be a satisfactory solution to a very acute and immediate cash flow cattlemen position for cattlemen.

That should never be forgotten by people who claim that this Government is not concerned about migrants and about providing opportunities for them. In relation to the question asked by the honourable member for Melbourne, it should be remembered that this Government has displayed a most compassionate attitude towards people in fromvery great need. The honourable member wiU recaU that during the year in question over 12,000 people came to Australia in refugee or quasirefugee circumstances. These people were not selected on occupational grounds; so it could be expected that a number of them would add to the unemployment figures. Also, New Zealanders who have entered Australia without the need to be selected on occupational grounds have registered as unemployed, which would add to the unemployment figures in what are to classified as the migrant categories. of In relation to the other matters raised by the honourable member, I have never said, and this Government has never said, that immigration should be seen as a substitute for training or refraining. That certainly is not the attitude of the Government. Immigration should be seen as working in conjunction with training and retraining.

50,Mr ANTHONY,SUGAR CONTRACTS WITH JAPAN,"This very difficult matter to be in a state of suspense. For two to three months now the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Ltd, acting as agents for the Queensland Sugar Board, has been having discussions with the Japanese refiners to try to obtain a satisfactory solution. The honourable will be aware that in 1974 an agreement entered into between the Japanese refiners and the CSR for the supply of sugar on a long term contract basis over a 5-year period. At that about time that contract was welcomed by the Japanese refiners and the Japanese Government as being very satisfactory. Now we have a situin which the Japanese refiners have this dishonoured that agreement. We have a huge amount of sugar in ships in Japan waiting to be unloaded but, because the Japanese have been refusing to accept it, it continues to stand there. This is causing enormous anxiety to the Austhe tralian sugar industry and to the Australian Government as some $60m-odd is held up there. means a cash flow to the Australian proThe Minisducers is being held up. The Japanese refiners have made a counterroposal which would mean a loss of some 315m on the initial contract in the remaining 3 years of that contract. They have suggested partial compensation for an extra 2 years, which would compensate to the extent of $71m. MoreAffairs)-Pursuant over, the nature of the Japanese import and support arrangements is not such that a reduced contract price would result in a lower price beingwith paid by the consumers in Japan. Queensland Government has completely rejected the proposal. I think we ought to nise that Japan is coming under the spotlight other Australians who want to tiade with that country on a long term basis. Also, the rest world must start to wonder how valuable are long term contracts with Japan if this one is not to be honoured. It is a very serious matter. It growing in intensity each day.",28

I think all of us hope be found. The normal course of redress in this case, if there is a deadlock, is for the matter before the British courts where an arbitrator will make a judgment. But I hope an answer will be found before that situation is reached, and I hope that the Japanese interests and the Japanese Government, which must recognise the pressures now being applied, will come to early decision.

As required by Standing Order 107,1I have selected one matter, that is, that proposed by the honourable member for Blaxland, namely: Government confusion and inconsistency on taxation policy. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in theirplaces",30
66,Mr KEATING,GOVERNMENT TAXATION POLICY,"The Opposition has chosen this matter of public importance today because of the absolute confusion and inconsistency on the part of the Government in relation to income tax matters. In recent times the averaging provisions for rural producers have been a cause of great confusion, and this has been more especiaUy so in very recent times in regard to the resource tax on the extractive industries. The point is that while the Government traUs its coat and dithers on these matters, there is no resolution in industry. It is left conEXPENDITURE fused and uncertain and, of course, that is not conducive to investment. We have had the spectacle already of the Uranium Producers Forum communicating with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) today, and saying that there will be no development of Australia's uranium resources unless all semblances of the tax are Ufted. The Treasurer (Mr Lynch) mentioned in the Budget the concept of a secondary tax on the mining and petroleum industries. The Minister for National Resources (Mr Anthony) mentioned in the Parliament the need for a tax but he said that such a tax would be imposed only on the oU and uranium industries and on no others. So there is in the extractive industries at the moment absolute confusion as to what the Government intends to do. It is beyond me that the Government cannot understand that it just cannot announce these kinds of measures, dangle the threat of a tax in front of the eyes of industry and go away believing that industry will cany on in the face of these imposts. Of course, everything grinds to a halt until these things are resolved. The point is that they should have been resolved a long time ago. Mention should not have been made of them. The Government should have made a decision whether or not to impose a tax. To add insult to injury and to add more confusion to the picture, the Queensland Premier related in the Queensland Parliament last week a conversation he had with the Prime Minister. I might just recount it. In answer to a question he said: I am not in a position to announce anything for Canberra or my Canberra colleagues-whether it be the Prime Minister or Mr Anthony. I spoke last night on the phone to the Prime Minister when he rang me and one of the things I mentioned to him was my concern at the fact that an attempt may be made to impose this tax. I have an understanding, if I may put it that way, from the Prime Minister, that there is no intention to impose a resource tax in any way. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Burns, interjected: 'Not at all?' The Premier repUed: 'Not at all'. So who is telling the Ues? Who in fact speaks on behalf of the Government in this matter? The Prime Minister apparently says that a tax will not be imposed; the Leader of the National Country Party says that a tax will be imposed only on oil and uranium; the Treasurer is not sure, as usual, what tax applies at present or what the level should be. No rates arefixed;no tax is designed.that There is this constant chopping and changing; constant indecision and inconsistency. No wonder there has been no increase in the rate investment in these massive industries. So what we have in the face of obvious by Government procrastination and weakness is an industry gearing up for a massive propaganda exercise to try to crush the concept of a secondary profits-related tax. We on this side of the House,rruning of course, support the concept of a secondary profits-related tax. At the latest National ference of the Australian Labor Party held in Perth this year, amongst other things we said: Labor will establish a clear and equitable taxation regime to ensure a proper increment to the national wealth vide the mining industry and Australian Government consistent base for long term planning in the industry. SpecificaUy, Labor will investigate the concept of ondary profits-related tax on the mining and petroleum industries to deal with extraordinary envisaged that such a tax would, amongst ate in place of the Coal Expon Duty Levy. In other words, it is to be a tax on excess profits. My party is committed firmly to it. However, said that we would investigate the concept. We did not say that we would impose the tax forth-modest with. We reaUse that a tax on the mining industrystructure should be imposed on the totality of the niiningproject. industry-no t just on uranium and oU, but acrossreturn the whole range of mineral production in this countiy. Such a tax will need careful considerStrait auon and design so that it can be imposed and its objectives achieved. This is why the Labor Party beUeves that there should be a further incrementwithin to the national wealth in the form of such a This tax would provide certainty for the indus-reply tries themselves. For the highfliersand those companies which have extraordinary levels the tax would be a positive and sure way giving an increment to the national wealth with-nor out the imposition of indiscriminate excises which on occasions have been imposed as revenue raisers in the heat of Budget discussions. These excises affect investments. They do not discriminate with regard to profitabUity. They are fallGovernments regressive in nature. It is far better sistency in the company tax base and a predictOne able secondary taxing structure. Government which supporters say: 'Why discriminate against minwith ing? Why discrirninate against that area of Aushow they traUan enterprise which is efficient?' The simply is that for many years the Parliament hasThis discriminated in favour of mining. The report the Industries Assistance Commission on mining taxation, which was introduced a year ago, indi-investments. cates that in the six years to 1973-74 the miningation industry paid $400m in income tax. However, agreed. was because of the special concessions. If the same companies had been operating on the basis on which manufacturing companies and other ofcompanies in Australia operate the tax would have been $ 1,000m. There was a $600m saving the mining industry on that occasion. There needs to be a taxing system to secure an adequate return to the Australian people. The other reason why there should be a tax on as distinct from other industries is that other industries are not given a national asset. ConMining companies are given a national asset to mine and exploit to their advantage. The asset is the property of the people of the Commonwealth. The lease gives companies therightto and pro-work the asset. Because the Government or the with a nation gives companies an asset to mine there should be an increment to the national wealth if a secthose companies are successful. A resource tax, a secondary profits-related tax, can apply only if profit situations. It is other things, oper-profits are made. Somebody said that a secondary profits tax should not be imposed on the North West Shelf weproject. The North West Shelf producers are saying that their investment will produce a fairly rate of return, given the present pricing and the costs of infrastructureforthat That may be the case; but, if that rate of improves, if market prices change as was the case with the Esso-BHP investment in Bass and the North West Shelf project is very profitable in the future, the producers ought to be apprised now of the fact that they will come the ambit of such a tax. I said so in my tax. statement on the North West Shelf project into the Minister for National Resources last week. The Government should say so. It is a perprofit fectly proper thing to do. of I am not the only person who holds that view; are members of my party. Mr L. T. Froggart, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Shell group of companies in Australia, urged such a system a year ago. He said: are worried about the possibility of'windprofits' and have fuU powers to control the level of proto have con-fitabUity by means of taxation. has only to look at Britain's Petroleum Revenue tax, incidentally was introduced after fuU consultauon industry, to see how flexible such measures can be and can reconcile the legitimate interests of the oU compoint pany, the Government and the consumer. gentleman apparently believes that there is of a case for such a tax to guarantee certainty of investment for long term, high risk, high value It there is to be such a system of taxit would be much better if the rates were A couple of weeks ago the Government made an admrnistrative decision at Cabinet level to increase the price paid to producers of crude in Austraha. In the case of Bass Strait producers that meant an increase of $ 109m the other oil companies in Australia the increase was about $41m. In total, the increase in profit amounted to about $150m. The IAC made it clear in its recommendation for an increase in price of oil that there should be a secondary ing structure. It said: However, the emergence of very large additional from crude oil production will require the Government to consider the adequacy of existing royalty arrangements, which were negotiated before the recent rapid increase world price of oil. But the Government gave away the increases without any secondary taxing structure at aU. Obviously there needs to be a tax designed to ac-assessed commodate this situation. There needs to be tax designed to accommodate the situation in thepacity future with uranium if the Government has its wilful way and those developments go ahead. Such a tax should apply also to those companies which are successful in the coking coal area. It should apply also to iron ore miners they happen to be successful. At the moment theter Government is attempting to dodge any tax on the coal industry, particularly on the Utah pany in Queensland. The Government did a very siUy thing when it came into office. It was sUly in the pubUc interest; it was not silly in the Govern-mit ment's interest because, obviously, it had standing commitments to this company to reduceapply the coal export duty levy.",30
67,Mr YATES,GOVERNMENT TAXATION POLICY,Nam e them.,32
68,Mr KEATING,GOVERNMENT TAXATION POLICY,The honourable member are should go back into his hole. I refer to the UtahbeUeve situation in 1975,32
69,Mr YATES,GOVERNMENT TAXATION POLICY,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I am sorry to interrupt the honourable member. I was asking him to be kind enough teU the House the various things that Utah had done for the Government.",32
70,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT TAXATION POLICY,Order! All interjections are out of order. There is no substance in the point order.,32
71,Mr KEATTNG,GOVERNMENT TAXATION POLICY,"It is interesting to look at Utah's financial report. In 1975 the company made $ 100.9m when the coal export duty levy was only $10.8m. In 1976, despite an increase the coal export duty levy from $ 10.8m to $75.9m, the company still increased its profit from $ 100m to $ 136.9m; in other words, a rise of 35.6 per cent in its net after tax profit although it had paid out an extra $65m in tax under the export duty levy. Therefore, nobody could say that the imposiuon of such a tax was an inhibitor oilto its growing profitabUity or viabUity. Obviously, this company in particular can afford to in profit. For pay, and pay well. Yet the Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister are trying to dodge any commitment to thea secondary tax on the coal industry. Obviously, tax-there should be a clear secondary taxing structure designed to include all the extractive industries which are high profit takers and are able to profits contribute something back to the Australian Government. I believe that the Prime Minister in thetold the Treasury today that he wants the proposalsfinishedwithin three weeks. If that is the case I do not know what kind of a hotchpotch we will get. The incremental rate of tax should be on profitabUity. The tax then would disa criminate with respect to profitabUity and cato pay. We hope that it is not a 2c in the dollar or 3c in the dollar job but something that gives the people a real increment for the niining of national assets. With regard to tax averaging for farmers, it if was only because the Opposition raised this matin the Parliament and exploited the fact that there were deficiencies in the Government's procomposals that the Government now has seenfitto reconsider its proposals as they affect tax averaging for farmers. We on this side of the House subthat tax averaging provisions should apply to outmore people than just farmers. They should to storekeepers and other people who have sinusoidal fluctuations of income, who are taxed heavUy in one year and not taxed the next year, who because they lose the averaging provisions taxed and penalised relative to farmers. We that consideration should be given to this matter. As well the provisions which wiU now become toavaUable will mean that farmers on incomes below $16,000 will receive very Uttle from the tax, and beef producers who are experiencing negative income and who are not paying any tax will get nothing from it. As usual the wealthy ofareas of the grazing and farming industries will get the best out of it, just as Utah Development Company has got the best out of the Ufting of the coal export levy. As usual, the Government is looking after wealthy people. So clearly there is inconfusion in this Government as to the equity and justice of taxation measures and also confusion about when things will be appUed and how they will apply. The Parliament has a right to know that nauonal resources particularly will coalsecure an incremental income for the national purse and that there will be a proper tax desigsystem ned and applied to these industries. Adequate notice should be given to these industries of the kind of tax, and adequate cussion should take place in the Parliament about the tax, instead of the Government practisincreased ing sleight of hand and imposing a tax which appUes only to the oU industry in Bass Strait some potential industry in uranium. These are clear reasons why there should be a tax, uniform in its appUcation to the mining industries which discriminates particularly against miners with respect to moneys which they can pay to the tobacco, national purse. It should be levied on all elfuel. ements of the extractive industries and the should be the capacity to pay and not the whim or caprice of the Government or the Treasurer. speech:",32
72,Mr LYNCH,GOVERNMENT TAXATION POLICY,"This motion was moved by a party which commitments. in government imposed an intolerable tax burden on the Austrahan community, a burden that has been lifted by the reforms which have been brought down by the present Government. The charges of inconsistency and confusion made the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr tobacco Keating), who I might observe in passing is not the shadow Treasurer, are nothing more than smokescreen to cover up the enormous benefits which this Government has provided. this debate today I want to cover a wider scene. The honourable member seeks to quarantine the debate to two references to the question of taxaand tion- a resources tax and tax averaging. I deal with these in the course of the debate but ask the House, in looking at the substance of debate, first of aU to have consideration for has been the tax record in office of our opponents. No doubt the honourable member for sonal Blaxland is involved in this debate only because hoax. Labor's two economic spokesmen cannot speak on any matter involving taxation without sharply contradicting one another. I want to look at opponents' taxrecordand Iremindthe House what the Leadei of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whidam) said in his 1972 policy speech: The most pressing need in the tax field is to trend by which inflauon has forced lower and middle earners into high tax brackets. His Government increased income tax receipts by 89 per cent in itsfirsttwo Budgets and refusedHansard to index personal income tax in spite of the fact that the inquiry which that Government estabHayden scheme. lished specifically recommended the indexation of personal and corporate income tax. In Labor's first Budget-the 1973-74 Budget- a totally regressive changes was made to the tax and the Australian pubUc was hit very hard indeed by increases in indirect taxes. I remind the House that in that Budget Labor disamongst other things imposed taxes on age pensions; abolished the income tax age aUowance; the tax on Ufe insurance companies; removed a variety of concessions previously andavaUable to the petroleum and mining industries, as the honourable member for Blaxland might well recall; discontinued the investment allowance for manufacturing and primary industries; and increased customs and excise duties on spirits, motor spirit, diesel and aviation The net full year effect of Labor's first test Budget was to raise an additional $600m. The Leader of the Opposition said in his 1974 pohcy I see no reason why taxes, direct or indirect, need to be in order to pay for any of our continuing Yet in the 1974-75 Budget there were substantial increases in an extensive range of taxes, including an iniquitous surcharge on unearned income. by In that Budget there were increases in duty on and spirits and further increases in taxation for the life insurance and mining industries. a I emphasise that again for the benefit of the taxation honourable member for Blaxland. In I turn now to the last Labor Budget-the Budget for 1975-76. That Budget imposed a massive increase of some $602m in indirect taxes levies. I specifically exclude the coal export will levy from thatfigure.That Budget increased I duties on beer, spirits, cigarettes and tobacco. I this also remind the House that in 1975-76 the bigwhat gest increase ever was made in postal charges and rates. Labor's last Budget included, of course, the so-called Hayden changes to the perincome tax system. Those changes were a Thousands of pensioners and low-income earners were made taxable for thefirsttime.The our so-called general concessional rebate gave the of highly misleading impression that taxpayers were receiving a benefit that did not in reaUty exist. The full year cost of the changes was only retard the $205m. The new tax system introduced by the incomepresent Government has a fuU year cost of more than sixtimesthe cost of the Hayden changes.

73,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT TAXATION POLICY,"Is leave granted? There being series of no objection, leave is granted.

Looked at from beginning to abandoned any commitment end, the Labor Party's record of tax changes in indexation. If I may say so, this government is nothing short of appalling. poltiical opponents have done no better in Opposition. They would aboUsh the investment ance, with all that that would mean to the great mineral industries of this country, and of the other concessions that we have provided deUberately to the business sector. The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for (Mr Hurford)-on e never knows whether or not As he speaks for the Opposition-ha s made it clearin that aU those on incomes of $15,000 and above, the top 10 per cent of taxpayers, would have to pay more tax under a Labor f overnment. The Sydney Moming Herald of 29 une, referring to the shadow Treasurer, reported: He said the top 10 per cent ofincome earners should share more of the tax burden. I quote from the Australian of the same date: Announcing the Party's draft economic pohcy platform yesterday, the Opposition spokesman on the Treasury, Hurford, foreshadowed heavier taxes for the very wealthy, particularly the top 10 per cent of income earners. But what the honourable member for Adelaide obviously does not understand is that the top per cent of income earners, as I mentioned earlier, include aU those with incomes starting $15,000 per annum. But the shadow Treasurer went further. I quote from his Press Table 1 headed 'Taxation and FuU Employment* in which he said: Therefore we intend to examine our pubhc program with no dependants priorities and to pursue vigorously the coUection of revenue by other means. I refer again to newspaper reports of the shadow Increase Treasurer's Press conference. The Sydney MomTax payable in tax ing Herald reported him as follows: under Previous 'Hayden 'Hayden . . . Labor would be looking towards indirect taxes to Scale' Scale' provide additional revenue. $ $ % I quote from the Australian of 19 June: 400 17.6 . . .

The Opposition has not only, on the record, clear that the Australian pubUc would be savage increases in both direct and and also in business taxation under at the same time it has to personal tax shoddy piece of Our backsliding came to Ught only recently. allow Mr KEATING - That is completely untrue. also some Mr LYNCH-The honourable member for Blaxland says that it is untrue. Let me quote what the honourable member for Oxley said at his Adelaide Press conference on 18 August: to whether we would apply some system of indexation taxation, we have made no commitment on that at this per annumstage. We do not intend to. Obviously what this debate reflects is yet a further example of inconsistency between members of the Opposition in relation to matters concerning taxation. What supreme irony it was for the Opposition to criticise the present Government's decision to half index income tax for one year and at the same time to refuse to say whether or not a Labor government would provide any form of indexation. Our reforms are of Mr enormous significance. No government in Australian history has ever cut taxes by anything like the amount that we have done. The Labor Party's record is shabby, deceptive and com10pletely without merit. Our pohtical opponents imposed a massive tax burden on the Australian atpubhc to pay for their extravagant spending programs. We have, in a decisive and unprerelease cedented way, lifted that burden. I welcome the fact that the honourable ber for Blaxland has brought this debate foraveraging ward. I take the opportunity to look at the standard rate taxation system which has been introduced because the benefits of that system are very substantial. The take-home pay of all year. wage and salary earners will rise from 1 February 1978 when the reformed scale fully reflected in the pay-as-you-earn instalment deductions. The biggest proportional gainers those on lower incomes at the bottom of the tax scale. In addition, the incomes of about 225,000 taxpayers, including many pensioners with small give leave. private incomes, will be made non-taxable. the new system is a significant social reform that improves the position of lower income groups the Australian community. Thefirst$3,750 of everyone's income will tax free. Some 90 per cent of taxpayers-al l those with incomes up to $16,000 a year-wil l pay tax at no more than the standard marginal per cent. This will, of course, add very significantly to incentive. Thus, a worker earning $10,000 per annum could earn up to an adclear ditional $6,000 per annum without any increase in his marginal rate of tax. This makes it much more worthwhile to work overtime or to become qualified for a more skilled job. Almost all tune workers will have lower marginal tax rates than at present. There will be a large reductionfrom 45 per cent to 32 per cent-in the marginal tax rate applying to taxpayers with incomes tween $12,532 and $16,000. The honourable member for Blaxland mentioned the question of tax averaging producers. This is a very significant reform. It is resourceswhere designed to maintain the effective nature of the ations. tax averaging scheme. As I mentioned in the House today, taxable income will be taxed at average rates when taxable income is higher than allowance for risks in the industry concerned. average income. When average income is higher than taxable income the taxable income will be taxed at scale rates. In calculating the average rate, the zero rate of the first$3,750 of taxable income will be taken into account. The $16,000 not income Umit for appUcation of averaging aboUshed in accordance with the recommendadevelopment virtually came tions of the Industries Assistance Commission. I make two further points. Farmers who have earUer withdrawn from averaging will have the right to return to the averaging system in the rent year, and in 1978-79 primary producers will be taxed under the new arrangements irrespective of whether or not they have withdrawn averaging previously. The fuU year cost will be of has expired. the order of $ 100m. Mr Speaker, I seek leave incorporate in Hansard a table that gives memexamples of the way in which the new tax system will work as well as three other new tables which show the benefits of the new tax saving, the cost of our tax reforms and the increase in receipts this year compared with last will be Mr SPEAKER-Is leave granted?",34

It is notable that in today's Melbourne Herald, Mr Eric Risstrom, be the Secretary of the Australian Taxpayers Association, has called the farmers' tax 'a reviver' for what it will do for incentive and equity for rate of 32 men and women on the land. PubUc statements by Ministers have made that the Government has under consideration the question of applying a resource tax to profits from oU and uramum mining. Discussions have been held with companies in order to adfull vance consideration of the question. We have not, Uke the Opposition, sought to put down a detaUed tax without giving industry a full opportunity for consultation and co-operation in devisbeing what might be a most appropriate form of taxation. The basic purpose of a resources tax is to for primary return that ensure the community receives a proper its highly valuable mineral are used One thing I would in the course of rnining opersay is that any such tax would apply only to profits over and above ordinary levels of profitabUity including appropriate For that reason, what the Government proposes by way of discussion with the companies in relation to oU and uranium mining is that the tax wiU be an obstacle to development and to general exploration. Unlike what happened under the is to be former Administration, when exploration and to an absolute standstill, a number of major projects are moving at present and the country can have confidence that recovery is taking place in the mincureral sector. The Government decisively rejects the matter of pubUc importance before the Chair. from Mr SPEAKER-Order! The Minister's time J to Mr JACOBI (Hawker) (5.16)- I support the matter of pubhc importance raised by the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). The Treasurer (Mr Lynch), despite his verbiage, cannot evade the very simple fact that tax recountiy. ceipts are up 17 per cent this year. However, have heard hardly a word about a resource tax a secondary tax. Let us look at the rake-off, the rip-off, or the plunder, by the major oil coman panies, by this sell-out Government, as a result their proposed petrol increase. Additional returns to producers for 1977-78 would be sUghtly more than $150m. This figure does not take into account company tax. So it is not windfaU profit but a windfaU return. The net return after 47W per cent company tax is about $81m. I now turn to uranium. Using a price of $30 per lb UO , the Ranger Commission 3 s estimated a gross profit before tax and royalties of $ 15,864m, This return was based on the capi-fact; tal expenditure, believe it or not, of $ 1.5 bUUon. today. I will not traverse the same ground as that covered by the honourable member for Blaxland. I wm not add to what was in fact ceUent speech. But, of course, there must resource tax and it must be structured to apply situations where the rake-off of people's assets reaches mammoth proportions. Let me make collusion four quick observations. As far as SheU, BP, and BHP are concerned, investment in coal projopoly ects is much more profitable than investment oU exploration in Australia, whether oU is pricedbenefits. at the world parity price or not. The profits any oU price may be invested in oil exploration but not in Australia. The scramble by major oUsource companies for coal over recent years clearly underwrites the corporate pohcy in Australian investments. I warn the people just how crucial the need for a national government to retain trol over non-renewable resources, particularly energy resources, and how crucial it is to that those resources are exploited in the interests of our people and that the mammoth economic returns are ploughed back for the benefit of people. A resource tax must be structured. It must structured now. Why has coal in fact become integral part of what has become the energy industry? The reason goes beyond the ending ofrush cheap oU with the oU price hike in 1973 by thecountiy. Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and the consequent revaluing of coal, gas uranium in a world that is now energy conscious.ation For a number of years the world's majoi oU panies had been diversifying their interests into other energy sources. In the 1950s international oil companies began expansion in the seas petrochemical industry. By 1962 the oU corporcash ations | controUed more than one-third of the petrochemical industry in the United States of America and the proportion is far higher in this OU companies realised that the greatest we advantage was to be gained from becoming ormonopoUstic suppUers of raw materials. Our control of raw materials was a bar to new entry into industry and in such industries monopoUstic of profits can be obtained. If other sources of energy were to gain a competitive advantage over oU, monopoUstic control over oU would not be enough to maintain the enormous profits of the a oU majors. Economics suggest that the companies retain a monopoUstic position if they gain control over all energy sources. There is an awareness that oil suppUes will fall behind demand and this has hastened the oU companies into alternative sources. We overlook this simple and this is what the scramble is all about The result is that the major oU companies have now become energy corporations and are an ex-attempting to monopolise control over all be a sources of energy. Australia's massive coal toreserves are at present a target for these corporations. This is not necessarily a conspiracy but certainly exists. It is not a necessary elEssoement of a strategy which leads towards moncontrol over all energy sources. Gaining insuch control provides a number of major Those major benefits are, firstly, that fromthese companies can make monopolistic profits by driving up prices. Secondly, coal is a likely of oU or gas in the future and would give the companies even greater marketing flexibUity. Thirdly, it would tend to guarantee the stabUity is of the companies as coal and uranium would be con-used more than oil in the fastest growing yet most stable market-electri c utilities. ensure The major oU companies have rapidly cornered large quantities of non-oU reserves, both in the United States of America and in this country. ourThere are moves already in the United States to curb the growing power of this corporation and be this Government will have to face up to the issue anvery shortly. The increased profits coming from coal production have only served to increase the of foreign oil corporations into coal in this The Government's petrol price decision has effectively placed mUlions of dollars in the and hands of oU companies to finance monopolisof Australia's coal reserves. comForeign ownership of Australia's coal affects both the rate of extraction and the export price of coal. Foreign companies usuaUy have other overprojects and are anxious to generate big inflows from existing investments so as to finance the next project. Their interests are best served by exploiting the earliest, the easiest and therichestenergy resource that is possible, I suggest with no regard, or very Uttle regard, for the future coal demand or the adverse effects on the local energy market as a whole. The case of Utah Ulustrates the hazards to Australia of foreign ownership of a key energy source. In 1976 Utah sent to the United States $90.8m, and in the previous year the amount was $63m. This year it wiU return $130m to General Electric. The latest figures suggest that Utah is paying out more than 90 per cent of its net profits in dividends. This is by far the highest pay out in this nation's history. The massive profit boost to United States shareholders in Utah was assisted by this Government's devaluation in 1976. In spite of its large profits Utah's basic phUosophy is to undercut competition in coal sales. One has to think only of the exercise that the Premier of New South Wales was forced into because of this singular fact. It is not surprising that local companies resent Utah's approach which amounts to contempt of Australia's interests. Let us have these few simple facts on the record. The situation will deteriorate further if the foreign ownership bids by CRA and Shell which are now frozen are ultimately aUowed to proceed. That wiU leave only 3 local export ventures which will not have significant levels other than overseas ownership. The Japanese steel nulls",35
76,Mr YATES,THE HAYDEN SCHEME,What does it pay in income tax?,37
77,Mr JACOBI,THE HAYDEN SCHEME,"Perhaps the honourable member for Holt wiU take note of this statement. Australia's largest coal customers have also voiced their concern at the fact that the ownership of Australia's coal reserves is largely passing to aggressive multinationals which regard coal as a diversification area rather than one intrinsically connected with their operations. That is the view of the Japanese firms. This view has also been expressed with good effect over the last fortnight by the Japanese Government. The only benefit which Australia stands to derive as compensation for the minions of dollars lost to general revenue in the forgone coal duty is the quarter of a mUlion doUars hand-out by Utah to the Australian Opera Company, and I suppose we can expect a repeat performance this year after the further cut in coal excise. I conclude by making one constructive aphorism that I made in 1973. It is stUl apposite today. There are some startling lessons to be learned m Australia. We are one of the few highly industrialised nearly self-sufficient countries. If we low countries we have endeavoured to copy in the past, such as Great Britain and the United States, in mindlessly plundering our raw materials, or worse, allowing others to do it for us, we deserve to sink to the wretched position in which those other countries now find themselves. A majority of highly industrialised countries have little more than their technology to trade and the raw materials that are needed is all we know. Technology no longer recognises national boundaries and normaUy goes to the highest bidder. We have a sacred duty to see that the patrimony is not taken from us by handing over exploitation to others. Once natural gas, iron ore and bauxite are gone to fuel the economies of others, does anyone think that our erstwlule friends will give us a second thought? I doubt it. There must be no confusion, no inconsistency, in safeguarding and ensuring that any return on the exploitation of the people s assets of this country is maximised to the full. I support my colleague, the honourable member for Blaxland.",37
78,Mr VINER,THE HAYDEN SCHEME,"StirUng-Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (5.28)-It really is the supreme irony to hear the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) put forward the proposition that the Government has created confusion and inconsistency on taxation pohcy because, as he said, in essence the Government has not said that it is going to apply a resources tax to aU mining industries. I remind the House that that was the foundation of the honourable member's speech. He said, and he said it with some pride, that the Labor Party would apply a resources tax to all extractive industries. The honourable member was saying that the Government was inconsistent because it was not applying its announced resources tax to aU mining industries. I remind the honourable gentleman of what the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) said in his Budget Speech about the Government's decision on crude oU policy: The Government believes that not all the additional profits resulting from these decisionsHe was referring to the decisions to progressively increase the price of domestic crude oU to world import parityshould remain with the producers, and that the community should obtain a return from the exploitation of these resources which adequately reflects their value. The fact that the recently increased value of crude oil stems essentially from action by a cartel of foreign oil producers makes the community interest in that enhanced value all the more obvious. In view of this, the Government has decided to increase the production levy on crude oil from $2 to $3 per barrel. The Government is, meanwhile, examining whether the follevy should be replaced by a resources tax. That is what was announced by the Treasurer and that is what is happening. How, then, can the honourable member for Blaxland accuse the Government of spreading confusion or inconsishonourable tency? Discussions with the oil industry have commenced aimed at doing what the Treasury introduce said-to examine whether the existing oil should be replaced by a resources tax. I would have thought that in terms neither of logic pubhc policy could the decision of the Governprovide ment, announced by the Treasurer, be attacked as leading to confusion or inconsistency. During the years-it has been years-that the public bate has gone on about the need to increase price of Australian crude oil there also have discussions, not only with the present Governwith ment but also with the former Labor Administratheir uon, about the possibility of something in nature of a resource tax if the increased price eventuated. I was interested to hear the honourviously able gentleman refer to the United Kingdom petroleum revenue tax. This Government, the industry and the oil producers tax. We all have studied it and, of course, we have studied it against the Australian scene to see whether the scheme devised for the North Sea oil production is a suitable scheme for is Australia. The other point, which is plain enough too, that any resource tax in the oil industry must profit-related tax. We are not interested in imposing upon the industry an additional which might cripple the production of the crude oil that is so necessaiy for Australia at present cripple the prospect of increased production from fields presently uneconomic. We recognise, as the previous Labor Administration refused acknowledge, that by the early 1980s production of Australian crude oU will begin to diminish that when that occurs we must supplement our own supplies from overseas and pay the higher prices which are charged for overseas crude. way in which the Opposition speaks makes it quite clear that it has not learnt that taxation be used not only as a weapon to derive revenue for the Government but also as an incentive to cause people to work harder and produce more for the economic benefit of the countiy. That something that needs to be remembered we contrast the Budgets of Labor's several Treasurers with what this Government has done under our Treasurer. I shall run very quickly through the incentives that have been provided by this Governmentprivate enterprise government-throug h reforms of the tax system. We have introduced personal tax indexation-a n incentive to individuals earn more, knowing that more of what they earnAssessment wiU not be taken away from them simply by inflation. We introduced it. It was before the member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) when he was Treasurer, but he flatly refused to it. Why did he refuse to introduce it? It levy was because it would cost the Commonwealth revenue. We were prepared to forgo the revenue nor ofbecause we reaUsed that in doing so we would an incentive to individuals. Personal tax indexation has been supplemented by the magnificent tax reforms introduced in this year's deBudget. There is the standard tax rate system by the which individuals-blu e collar workers and been white collar workers alike-no w will be provided an incentive to work overtime, knowing that overtime earnings will not be taxed at a the higher rate. People will be provided with an incentive to accept promotions, whereas prethey were prepared to knock them back because to accept promotion under the Labor oil Government meant higher tax and it simply was know about that not worth it. The investment allowance which we introduced as soon as we came into office in 1975 a positive incentive to industry to invest. What was the record of the Labor Government? Already today we have heard the Treasurer is quote from the Press conference on 18 August be athis year at which the hallowed member for Oxley and the shadow Treasurer, the honourable tax member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) who has now come into the House, said that they would or remove investment allowances because they are an extravagance. We believe that they are a positive incentive for business. We also nave to introduced company tax indexation through the trading stock valuation adjustment as an incenandtive to industry. This is something which the Laboi Administrationrefusedto introduce because it amounted to a cost to revenue. We are Theprepared to acknowledge the incentive. We also have moved in relation to taxation of income can from mining and petroleum. Memories are not so short that the mining industry will not recall the terrible blow that was dealt to the rriining and petroleum industries through the withdrawal by is the Laboi Administration of tax advantages when undei the income tax system which that Administration inherited from the former Libejal-National Country Party Government. We havereintroduceda substantial part of those advantages for the very purpose of providing the mining and petroleum industries with an incena tive to get out, to explore and to produce. Distribution requirements for private comto panies under Division 7 of the Income Tax Act have been eased so as to provide much needed assistance to small and medium sized firms, again at a cost to revenue but in order to provide incentive. We have eased estateamendment duty provisions so as to ease the burden of duty on famiUes. Income equalisation deposits have been given to farmers to provide them withdiminished an opportunity to protect themselves effects of fluctuating income on their tax UabUities. Now we have the revised income averaging provisions for primary producers which were solely announced by the Treasurer last night. I remind the the House that all these measures have been Ueve introduced at a substantial cost to revenue. It probably runs into, in round figures, $4,000m $4,500m over the precedingfinancialyear and prepared thisfinancialyear, without taking into account thosefindings the continuing benefits which will flow to individuals and corporations. So, rather than there being any inconsistency or confusion, can say that the pohcy commitment we made in through the 1975 election campaign to restore to individuals and corporations, taxation system and to place more money in the pockets of individuals has been honoured",37
79,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,THE HAYDEN SCHEME," best Order! The Minister's time has expired. The disdoes cussion is now concluded. LOCAL GOVERNMENT (PERSONAL INCOME TAX SHARING) AMENDMENT wealth Second Reading Debate resumed from 25 August, on motion by Mr Viner: That the Bill be now read a second time.",39
80,Mr HURFORD,THE HAYDEN SCHEME,"The Opthe position is not opposing the Local Government (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Amendment Bill. I would have loved to have participated the previous debate on the subject of taxation generally and to have followed particularly the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr order to take up some of the things he said, but I must confine myself to taxation as it affects local government. This Bill results from the implementation of the Government's so-called new federalism pohcy. In its own way it is nificant because it points to the many problems which Government has caused by denying local government bodies direct access to the Commonunder wealth Grants Commission. The Australian Labor Party put on record last year its oppositionmention to the Government's new federaUsm pohcy, mission including the plans for local government. During that debate we stated that there would be enorreading mous problems in the aUocation of funds for local government in particular, and that is seen now to be so. However, we are not opposing this to the original Bill, because it is only estatea minor amendment. This does not mean that our opposition to the concepts involved has in any way over the year since we last against the debated this subject. We are accepting this amendment simply and because it results from a special report by Commonwealth Grants Commission on financial assistance for local government. We be that the Commonwealth Grants Comto mission is the best body to make decisions about funds for local government and therefore we are to accept itsfindingsin this case, where apply only to the breakdown between the various States of the amount being we made avaUable by the Australian Government the States for local government. Given incentive in the way ofwbich the obstacles the Government has placed the Commission distributing funds to reform the in the best possible manner, we consider that the special report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission makes, to use an old phrase, the of a bad job. However, the special report raise a number of queries about the distribution of local government general purpose grants through State grants commissions and the problems inherent in the role of the Commonnow is Grants Commission in the way in which it expected to play that role. Perhaps I BILL 1977 should remind those involved in this debate, and anybody else interested in this subject, that previously whereas the Australian Labor Party Government made avaUable an enlarged Commonwealth Grants Commission to apply itself to this very important subject of getting equity in aUocation of funds to local government, smce the so-called new federalism poUcy has blighted this country- a concept of the Fraser Governin ment which is now foundering-eac h State has been obUged to set up separate local government grants commissions to do a job which should be Viner) in done on a national basis. In introducing this Bill the Minister assisting the Treasurer explained that the Bill implemented the recommendations of the Comsigmonwealth Grants Commission concerning the distribution between the States and local governments of the tax sharing entitlements provided the Local Government (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act 1976. The Minister did not that the Government asked the Comto perform a task for which no guideUnes and Uttle methodology are avaUable. In fact, a of the Commission's report will leave one with the impression that the Commission thought it had been given an impossible task in an impossibly short time. The reference to Commonwealth Grants Commission arose besome cause the Premier of Tasmania felt that his State was disadvantaged by the distribution of funds as enshrined in the 1976 Act. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) gave an undertaking to the Premier that he would have the Commonwealth Grants Comthe States. mission re-examine the proportionate distribution between the States of the funds this entidement for local government. Frankly, when one examines the problems the Commission in following the Prime Minister's instruction when one looks at the ume at which this reference was made, one must be cynical and convey the suspicion which has arisen in mind, namely, that the Prime Minister's original commitment to make this change had something to do with the Tasmanian State elecuon which was taking place at the time. The Grants Commission found it impossible obtain sufficient new data on which to base updated review of the 1976 distribution. Consetask quendy, all it was able to do was to suggest changes which were confined to what it down described asfinetuning the existing percentages. When we have a look at the changes which have been made we see that they are of an incredible proportion. I note that although Tasmania was the State mainly aggrieved, and correctly so, its tween proportional increase was only 0.3396 per cent. local It is incredible that these calculations go to four general percentage places of decimals. At the same time,property of course, as a South Austrahan I must be parochial and be glad to note that South Austraha received some increase out of this change. But its increase was 0.0832 per cent. toria was another beneficiary in the changes by 0.1668 per cent. Sad to relate, the other three State's States lost similar amounts. It does seem that an rectly with local government enormous amount of effort had to be put into arose. In attempting to fulfil suchfinetuning. In its report the Commonwealth Grants mission makes it very obvious that it is at having to allocate funds for local government on a State by State basis. When the Commission dealt directly with local government as it during the period of the Labor Government had a set of well-established guidelines by which it was able to operate properly. Criteria for equalisation between councils were established on an Australia-wide basis. Under the Governmethodological ment's federalism pohcy-this new federalism the Fraser Government-n o such arrangement is possible. The Commonwealth Grants Commation mission somehow has to determine the distriparagraph bution of funds between the States and the State states: the grants commissions then divide those funds on criteria which they have established between the various local government areas in their own States. There is notie-upbetween the activities of the two commissions, that is, the Commonwealth Grants Commission and the local government Grants Commission in each of I remember at this time last year, in discussing Bill when it passed through the Parliament, making the point very strongly that at least the has Government ought to give the Commonwealth and Grants Commission the task of being an auditor of what was being done in the various States. After all, they are Commonwealth funds raised my by the Australian Government which we are considering. The least that we might expect is that the Commonwealth Grants Commission should be aUowed to get so involved as to learn the detaUs of what is going on in the various to States. This would leave the Commission in a so an much better position in order to determine the which the Government has hurriedly given of establishing what the proportionate breakbetween the various States should be. The immense problem facing the Commonwealth Grants Commission is spelt out in paragraph 15 of its special report which states: The Commission can see no necessary relationship be the relative fiscal status of State governments and government authorities in the respective States. The taxationresourcesof State governments for revenueraising purposes differ very significantly from the narrow tax base available to local government. The crux of the problem is that there are both rich and poor local government bodies within any State boundary. There is Uttle relationship Vicbetween a local government councU and its ability to raise revenue. When the Commonwealth Grants Commission dealt dino such problems its role in the Government's federaUsm pohcy the CommonComwealth Grants Commission is faced with unhappy something- I repeat the word-of a methodological nightmare. I really believe that the Commonwealth Grants Commission special did report where that word comes up so often is it something which every honourable member in the house who is interested in the breakdown of funds between the threetiersof government in the States should read. I repeat again that it is a nightmare. This means that the of Commonwealth Grants Commission must have access to an on-going supply of statistical inforabout local government. However, as 37 of the Commission's special report The Government's federalism policy does not envisage the Commonwealth Grants Commission seeking this inforis mation direct from local government authorities. At the moment stop-gap arrangements have asm been agreed in principle between the State authorities and the Commonwealth Grants isters Commission whereby the State authorities will supply the Grants Commission with required information. Mention has been made of the introduction of a permanent and comprehensive system for the collection of local government data. However, no details of the form this systemfrom will take or of when it will be introduced have been mentioned. I urge the Government- I ask the Minister in his reply to give some indication of his attitude to this urging-to have another look at this report and at the difficulties which have been raised by the Grants Commission about this matter. I ask the Government to give us some indication of whether another reference will be made to the Grants Commission in order to have some of these longer-term problems seen to. In speaking on this topic last year I said the Australian Labor Party believed that local government had a vital role to play in partnertue ship with State and Federal governments in the provision of services to the Australian people. That is what we are aU about. Labor recognised that in manyfieldslocal government was the ter's most effective administrative unit. That is why we introduced direct grants to local government during our period in government. These were recognition of the very real responsibUity that people expect local authorities to assume. Despite all its legislative action the Fraser Government has to accept that its prime impact on local govenunent has been to reduce the serHowever, vices which local government can offer. The Government's treatment of local government another interesting example of the contradiction which emerges in its attitude towards public spending. Since coming to power the Liberal and National Country parties have made an absolute virtue out of cutting pubUc spending. It now appears certain that when they leave office will be unable to claim any credit for lowering the rate of inflation or for lowering the tragic level of unemployment Their only claim to fame will be that despite their counter-productive effects, despite the fact that they are not curing inflation and despite the fact that they are cerbeen tainly increasing the level of unemployment, they have been able to fulfil their promise public spending, as if that was a virtue in itself. However it seems that whUe the Government prepared to take the dubious credit for cutting pubUc spending overaU it displays Utde enthusifor claiming responsibUity for specific cuts. It appears to have escaped the attention of Minthat cutting the whole also means cutting at least some of the constituent parts. Any experienced observer hearing the Minister's second reading speech on this Bill would no doubt get the impression that local government was doing very well under this Adrninistration. That is far the truth. Much is made out of this year's 18 per cent increase in the level of general purpose assistance to local government. It is not the only method by which funds go to local government. No mention is made of the fact that total payments to local government have increased only by 6 per cent in money terms. When an inflation rate of 12 per cent is taken into account there is a 5 per cent to 6 per cent reduction in real terms of the resources going to local government so it can fulfil its purpose. This is because of the enormous decrease in the special purpose grants for which many local government authorities were so that grateful during Labor's term in government. Surely if cutting pubUc spending is such a virthe Government should be proud to announce that in two years it has been able to cut the level of funds going to local government by almost SO per cent in real terms. No. The Minisspeech continues, I believe, to mislead. I caU it a charade. He has played out this charade, as have many of his coUeagues, and has mesa merised us into beUeving that there has been some growth in funds forfocalgovernment when that is far from the case. The real import of the meaning of the Government's policies is hidden behind a carefully selected selection of figures. despite the reluctance of the Government to recognise its negative achievement, is those who are responsible for providing local government services will be in no doubt about what this Government has done to decrease the standards of service being provided by local government. Many dedicated people in local government throughout this country are giving their time free of charge in so many cases. they The last Labor Budget provided a total of $275m in funds for local government, including road grants. If the value of these funds had been merely kept constant in real terms the total aUocation for thisfinancialyear should have been in the vicinity of $345m. That is what it should have if we were to keep up with the aUocation of those resources in real terms. The actual aUoto cutcation is not $345m but is estimated to be approximately $204m or roughly two-thirds of what it should be to keep local government in steady or no-growth situation. I am not talking about even a growth in real terms; I am talking about merely keeping it in a no-growth situation.one I am talking about keeping up with the sort of allocation that had been made in the past in real terms. The $204m is all that has been allocated this year, as against $345m which should have been made available. If this Government concentrates increased funds to local government by more than $100m today total funds going to local operations govenunent would be no greater in real terms than they were for the last year of the Labor Government-the 1975-76 year. Some idea of the Government's priorities can be gauged by examining where it has made greatest cuts. In 1974-75 local government received $43m for employment creation under the Regional Employment Development nation-wide scheme. In 1975-76 the amount was $93m. For this financial year there is no allocation-no t one dollar for this employment-creation scheme. Despite the fact that unemployment is at record high level and is at least 30 per cent the level of two years ago when the Labor Government left power, the Government has refused to take any initiatives which would stimulate employment in our community. There figures, were problems, we admit, with the administrascheme tion of the old RED scheme, but these mainly from the fact that the scheme was brought into action very hurriedly. The factremainsthat the Regional Employthe ment Development scheme employed up to 30,000 people at one time. This Government has had plenty of time to examine alternative employment-generating measures and to overgovernment come the administrative problems of the RED scheme, but it has done nothing. It seems to fer to do nothing for the unemployed and insteadcessful to give tax concessions to better-off people, have seen in the Budget. We all would be better off if there were far more stimulatory expendischeme ture than we have to date, particularly stimulasition tory expenditure of this son, through local government, to get our economy moving. repeat: We all would be far better off, whatever our income levels, if this were the policy rather than the giving of tax concessions which are of greater value to those who are better than to those who are worse off. Take the position in South Australia, which your home State Mr Deputy Speaker, as well astralian mine. I am glad to see you in the chair. In our State the Labor Government has different priorithrough ties, as you know. I do not know whether you prove of them. At least I know you are aware a them. The State Government has set up a local initiative program which is about to be expanded. It will put 1,500 people in work at any time. The program is done through allocations based on local government, which is why it is so pertinent to the matter which we are debating. The South Australian scheme, which heavily involves local government authorities, on activities which as well as being wonh whUe, are ones in which labour-intensive are suitable. It appears that the South Australian scheme could operate at a level, if the funds were avaUable, at which 2,000 people could be employed at any onetimewithout administrative problems getting out of hand or the the quaUty of the projects deteriorating. A scheme of this type in South Australia employing 2,000 people is equivalent to a scheme employing 22,000 people. Admittedly this is only a small proportion of those out of work but it is a stan. The local initiative program is one particularly relevant to disa cussions about local government. Those local abovegovernment areas in which pockets of unemployment run in excess of 10 per cent of the work force would find such a scheme of great community benefit. Based on South Australian the net cost to revenue of a local initiative employing 22,000 people would be in resulted the vicinity of $ 150m. It says something for the priorities of the two sides of Australian politics when we reaUse that present Federal Government has cut back completely on local employment schemes while the Opposition has spelt out one in its proposals to get Australia working again. At a State level things are no different. I refer to the program which I have just outlined. The preSouth Australian Labor Government has a suclocal employment program whUe the Vicas we torian Liberal Government has justrefuseda recommendation that an employment subsidy be introduced. The Liberal Party Oppoin South Australia at this time is threatening to cut out the job-creation program of the I Dunstan Government at atimewhen that program is so badly needed. This is part of its propursued gram for the State election. There are many examples of drastic cuts in off funds to local government by the present Government. Cuts in the national sewerage prois gram and in the efficient and innovative AusAssistance Plan come readUy to mind. It is in the context of what can be done so readUy local government that we view this Bill. apWe are not opposing the Bill. It merely alters to of four decimal places the present allocations. We are taking the opportunity to point out our general opposition to the Fraser Government's new federalism program. We do not believe that funds for local government ought to be cut. There is certainly no certainty of uniform standards of service being given throughout the countiy to local government. There has been a wasteful proliferation of State local government grants commissions. All in all, we are not very enthusiastic about the total scheme. We support the Bill for the minor amendments it makes. Debate interrupted.

81,Unknown,CONSTRUCTION OF ELECTRICAL,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. LOCAL GOVERNMENT (PERSONAL INCOME TAX SHARING) AMENDMENT Second Reading Debate resumed.,43
82,Mr WILSON,CONSTRUCTION OF ELECTRICAL,"The House is dechamber bating the Local Government (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Amendment Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to amend the existing legislation so in future it will accord with the recommendations contained in the latest report of the Commonreport wealth Grants Commission concerning the distrimission, bution between the States of the local governbution ment tax sharing entidements which are probasis. vided for under the principal Act. It was said earlier today by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) that this was not a significant Bill because it made only minor variations in the entitlements as between the States. I do not agree with him. I think it is a important Bill because it demonstrates quite clearly how the Government's federaUsm pohcy that is working. The Bill is sigmficant, not because of its length or because of the extent of the change to the present arrangements; it is significant because a change is being made. The Government's federalism pohcy recognises that we Uve in a dynamic society, a society that is constantly changing. Included in those changes are the changing relationships between the spheres of government-the changing responsibilities and the changing chaUenges that face different levels of government. Differing disabiUties arise from time to time. Other spheres of government gain from advantages of the discovery, for example, of new wealth and resources. The fact that a State, in relation to its local governments' entitlement to a share of a proportion of income tax, felt that a review would give it a greater share and that the Commonwealth was wUling to place the matter before the Grants Commission for consideration indicates that the Commonwealth is flexible in its attitude. I hope that from time totimewhen any State feels that due to changing circumstances a reassessment is necessary it wtil feel free to come before the Commonwealth Grants Commission and have the circumstances of its local government entitlement reassessed. I thought it rather odd at thetimethat in the very week m which the for Grants Commission brought down its report indicating a willingness to make a variation to its the previous recommendations some of the States were saving that the Grants Commission was not a sufficiently objective body to determine the relativities of the distribution of income tax between the States. I was pleased to read in the second reading BILL 1977 speech of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Viner) that a suggestion I made when the legislation which is now the principal Act was being debated in this that the legislation should contain a requirement that the Grants Commission should distribute money between the States on equaUsthat ation principles is now being examined by the States. It is noteworthy that, as stated in the of the Commonwealth Grants Comthe two larger States advocated a distriof the share of income tax on a per capita The other States and the Commonwealth Treasury urged upon the Commission that it should distribute the money on an equaUsation basis. I believe the decision taken by the Grants Commission to distribute the funds on an equalisation basis is the correct approach. However, I very do believe also that it is important that local government within the States be guaranteed that wtil be the basis of distribution in the future. AU those who appeared before the Grants balance Commission urged that, before any major review was undertaken, much more time should be 6 'ven to an examination of aU the relevant facts, nless the Grants Commission is given an indication of the Commonwealth Government's desire with regard to the appUcation of equaUsfunds ation principles, this whole question of the basis of distribution might well be raised again. imponant that the Grants Commission given such an indication because, unless it is made clear that the share of income tax that be passed on to local government is to be tributed on an equaUsation basis as between States, some States might suffer a double disadleaves vantage in that if equaUsation principles are applied to this money they might not be appUed in the determination of State relativities. Alternabasis. tively, it is possible that unless some directions are given double compensation will be given becapita cause equaUsation principles could be appUed the distribution of funds for local government whtie the same principles could be appUed in respect of distributing money to the States and the process the needs of the local government bodies of a particular State could be again brought into account. What the Commonwealth Government surely is seeking to achieve is an equitable distribution of theresourcesavaUable to three spheres of government. That needs to be done in a manner which each sphere understands and under a sysment tem that avoids argument which couldresultin the dupUcation of assistance or, equaUy, couldresultin no assistance being given where help is deserved. Therefore, I am very pleased know that this matter is under active considerment. ation. I hope that, given appropriate thought, State governments and the Commonwealth spheres Government wtil reach a solution which is table as between the States and equitable so far as local government is concerned. It that local government can best be served by local government money being distributed on an equaUsation basis so that local government in panicular State that needs special suppon is not necessarily dependent upon the State govern the ment for that additional suppon but can upon that support coming through the recommendations of the well reputed Commonwealth regards Grants Commission. Inrecentweeks announcements have been The made concerning the distribution the States. The House wtilrecallthat the arrangements contained within the legislation becentage fore it provide for a distribution of at least 30 per could notshare cent of the funds on a per capita on an equalisation basis. I think it will be interesting when aU thereportsof the local overnment grants commissions within the tates are tabled. They will need critical and careful analysis to see whether objective principles have been appUed and to see that the have not been distributed on an ad hoc basis. It is terribly imponant that each local It is government body within a particular State should be should be fairly treated. is to I might mention a concern I have that the disrequirement that a minimum of 30 per cent of the the funds be distributed on a per capita basis it open to a State to distribute too great a not proportion on that basis and to have inadequate funds avaUable to distribute on an equalisation EquaUy, I am concerned that the provision which enables a State to distribute these per funds upon the basis of the size of the local in government body, its population density or its area, enables a State government to distort the allocation so that we do not achieve the objective in set out in the principal Act, namely, that each local government body within a State should be able to achieve a standard that is not appreciably below the standards of other local government bodies within that State, given that each local overnment body makes an adequate effort to eep its standards to that level. Therefore I urge the Minister and the Governto examine carefully the reports of the six local government grants commissions. That that examination should not be seen as Commonwealth intrusion because itrelatesto the interto relationship between three spheres of governWhat this Government is trying to achieve aU is a better fiscal balance between those three of government so that their resourcesequitheir tax base-ar e adequate to enable each sphere of government to fulfil effectively the reis my view sponsibUity that falls upon it. I was interested to note that the Minister in his a second reading speech made reference to the distribution of 1.52 per cent of income tax. I remind house that when introducing the principal rely Act the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) said: I want to emphasise, however, that the Government the figure of 1.S2 per cent as a minimum percentage. It is subject to review. Minister, in introducing the Bill which is bewithin each of fore the house, said: The Government considered the matter of the 1.S2 per when framing the Budget but decided that it see its way to increasing it in the present economic basis and the circumstances. I think all honourable members would appreciinformation ate the difficulty of the present economic circumGrants stances. However, I am pleased that the Governeffectively ment recognises its earUer commitment to review the quantum or the percentage share ofincome tax that is to go to local government. It is to noted, however, that even in these difficult omic times the amount avaUable to local governproposal. ment this year is $ 165.3m compared with $ 140m last year-a n 18 per cent increase in the allolocal cation to local government. My experience is that local government recognises the efforts being made by this Government to increase the resources avaUable to it to enable it to carry more effectively its functions. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr should Hurford) who spoke before me in the debate somewhat critical of the Commonwealth which Government's proposal under which we had set up in each of the States a local government grants commission to distribute the resources avaUable to local government within each of States. I wonder whether he and his are proposing that those commissions be abandoned and that the total responsibility be handed over to the Commonwealth Grants and Commission. The honourable member did not make that point clear. I wonder whether, Ught of the experience so far and in view of the changed arrangements for the distribution of the support funds going to the States, that is what the areas honourable member is proposing. You will call, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the States were concerned about the suitability of the Commonfinances wealth Grants Commission as the body to deterpartnership mine those relativities between the States. At the July Premiers Conference it was agreed between the States and the Commonwealth that a commission should be set up which comprised three members of the Commonwealth Grants have Commission, two members nominated by the tant States, one member nominated by the two more populous States and one member nominated by the four less populous States. That again is Ulustration of the Commonwealth'sflexibleapindication proach to trying tofinda sensible solution to resolve the problems to be found in the relaaspiration tionships between the spheres of government. wonder, in view of what the honourable member for Adelaide said, whether, instead of concennecessary trating the determination of relativities of distribution of moneys between the ment bodies within a State, the appropriate to resolve the matter would be if the CommonJoint wealth Grants Commission were to have on local government grants commission in each the States a commissioner so that there avaUable to the Commonwealth Commission in order that it could more allocate the local government share of income tax as between the States. Perhaps the honourable member for Adelaide might uke to be make inquiries of his State Labor coUeagues to econsee whether they would agree to that sort of I do not believe that the cost of running these government grants commissions within the States should be seen as an obstacle. If it were to become an obstacle I believe, in the interests of establishing a smooth arrangement for the reout aUocation of resources as between the three spheres of government, the Commonwealth give consideration to funding those grants was commissions in a manner simUar to that by it provides the funds for the operation of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. In that way then there could be a more sensitive appraisal of the needs of local government as be the tween the States and the local government colleagues bodies within each State. This piece of legislation is very significant because it confirms the Government's acceptance recognition of local government as a sphere of government. In our policy statement on federin the alism the Government said: . . . the Liberal and Nauonal Country Parties wholly the concept of federalism in which there are three of government-Federal , State and local . . . reIn our policy on local government we said: The poUcies are designed to provide major reforms in the and functions of local government and a new cofor it with the Federal and State spheres. By our pohcy we have demonstrated our intent; by our actions we have fulfilled that intent. We have done so by recognising local government in that we have given it a share in income tax. We also given it representation on the imporand significant Advisory Council for InterGovernment Relations. But there is a chaUenge before the community at large and before local an government in particular. What is needed is an from local government of its true aspirations. I believe that local government has an to be an independent, autonomous I sphere of government in a three sphere federal system. But if we are to achieve that goal it is that local government clearly enuncithe ate that aspiration. There are very important local governissues to be considered. way In a report that was prepared recently by the Study into Local Government Functions in each Australia and New Zealand some interesting of conclusions were reached. Firstly, the report was stated that local government throughout Australia has never wholly performed the role local community self-government? Secondly, the Joint Study stated: . . . those changes need to be related to broad philosophic principles on the role of governmental governmental relations. It is important that local government indicate desire to fulfil the role of community self government and not to be merely an administrative arm of State government. The same report also stated: Local government sees itself State governments. The question I ask is this: Does local government want to remain a decentralised agent of State government or, for that matter, government? In a true federal system it is not only administrative responsibility which is shared between the three arms of government; is legislative power-the power to legislate. That power needs to be shared in a manner whereby cannot be withdrawn. The power that is now in the hands of the States cannot be withdrawn by the Commonwealth. The power that the States conferred on the Commonwealth cannot withdrawn by the States. The power that is conferred on local government, in my view, should be conferred in a manner whereby it cannot withdrawn. There is, therefore, a need for local government to proclaim clearly be an independent, autonomous sphere of government in a federal system that has three cooperating spheres of government. This legisgovernment lation is a step that will aid in the achievement that goal if local government rises to the challenge.",43
83,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTRUCTION OF ELECTRICAL, government Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,46
84,Mr UREN,CONSTRUCTION OF ELECTRICAL,"This Bill is a ment measure of the Government's total provide an adequate share of resources for local government in Australia. My later remarks will show just how badly local government is faring at the hands of Fraser's new federalism. First, shall set out briefly the approach of the Ausof traUan Labor Party to local government, as outlined in the poUcies adopted at the National Conference in Perth. The main theme of our icy is the protection of the needs of the people who are served by local government. Eighty-five per cent of all Australians live in urban munities. The other 15 per cent Uve in rural comthemselves munities of one sort or another. All these people depend directly on what local government prointo vides for the wide range of services which deterwhere mine the quaUty of their day-today lives. Their of links with State and Federal governments are much less tangible. Australians depend on local government for their water and sewerage services, roads, urban pubhc transport, and recreaand intertion and cultural facUities. Within Australian communities differences in the quaUty of these its essential services show up very starkly. The standard of services provided by local government varies enormously from one local government body to another. Some shires and as a decentralised agent of councUs have built up sufficient revenues from a high rating base and are able to provide services of a very high order. Other councUs lack the effective rating base and cannot provide proper services, or at best they provide services which of any other are limited in scope. The Western Sectors of Sydney and Melit bourne are prime examples of local government bodies which lack the resources to deliver serit vices to all their people on a basis of equity. Surely it is the basic aim of the Commonwealth to provide assistance to local government which gives aU Australians the same level of basic serbe vices no matter where they may reside. I shall talk briefly on the poUcies of the Labor be Government between 1972 and 1975. In broad terms we tried to do three things - in relation to its aspiration to local government. Firstly, we tried to give assistance to local on the basis of equity. We felt that of Commonwealth assistance should go to those councUs and shires which were most in need. We rejected the concept that Commonwealth assistance should be divided equaUy among all local bodies. This approach was adopted by the Grants Commission with untied grants and interest free loans which the Labor Governprovided to local government for the first failure to time in its history. Our second aim was to inject human values into the conduct of government at the grass roots I level which comes in contact with a wide section the Australian community. The whole thrust of the work of the old Department of Urban and Regional Development was directed to this aim. polOur people- I am talking about our pubhc servants-go t out of Canberra and worked closely with State and local government representatives comand community organisations and the people at the grass roots level. They got to understand what it was all about. They got out thefieldof urban and regional development they always should have been. The only way to solve the problems of local government is for representatives of the Austrahan GovernGovernment ment to become involved with people's problem. lems and to understand them. Many honourable members opposite came into contact with the public servants who represented the Department of Urban and Regional Development as they came into contact with local government. The honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Simon) was an alderman. He should understand clearly what the Department of Urban and Regional Development did. It made a new order for local government. It was properly recognised for first time. The honourable member for Patersonsigned (Mr O'Keefe) was well aware of the role that Department of Urban and Regional DevelopWe ment played in working with the Hunter Valley regional organisation. We in Canberra did tell people in that organisation what they wanted. They told us what they wanted, it was a grass roots organisation. This is what needs to be done. What is the situation under the present Government? These pubhc servants now stick to their seats in Canberra. They do not interrelate with their State and local government colleagues. The Labor Government's pohcy was based on showing our faith in people and involving ouroperation selves directly in thenbasic wants. The effort was based on co-operation between the three levels of government, with a fourth tier made up of community groups. Setting up this structure of pohcy making and dehvery of sertween vices and faciUties to urban and regional munities was one of the great achievements of the Labor Government. This basis of trust and co-operation between the three levels of governthey ment and between government and people has been destroyed by the Fraser Government. I say that advisedly. We cannot solve the problems local government or urban and regional proband lems unless we get the three levels of government working together. Each level cannot hve in a arate box on its own. They have to be interknows, related. They have to understand the human problems involved. The Fraser Government has washed its hands of the basic community programs butit up by Labor Government. It has destroyed the Grants Commission. The honourable member for Sturt (Mr WUson) talked a great deal about the munity Grants Commission. He has a genuine respect for the Grants Commission. But the Fraser Government, of which he is a supporter, despeople troyed the real concept of the Grants Comneeded mission, its relationship with local government, the expertise buUt up during the period of Labor and its understanding of the probThe Labor Government did not buUd up the Grants Commission from Federal bureaucrats in Canberra. We drew people from many sectorsuniversities, local government, the private sector and the State and Federal government sector, the wonderful body of skUled people buUt up in the Grants Commission has been gradually eroded. Now, it is just a skeleton of what it was formerly under the Labor Government. The Fraser Government also destroyed completely the the area improvement program which was deto provide basic services and facUities to the local government bodies throughout Australia. started slowly. We started with the area improvement program which was a regional not councU program. In the western suburbs of Sydney we amalgamated-whe n I say 'we' I becausemean in co-operation with the States",46
85,Mr VINER,CONSTRUCTION OF ELECTRICAL,"You made a slip there, Tom.",47
86,Mr UREN,CONSTRUCTION OF ELECTRICAL,"It is not a matter of making a sUp. If the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs checked with any of his counterparts in the States and local government he wouldfindthat we did it together. The Department of Urban and Regional Development worked in a spirit of cowith State and local governments. I policy said when I was Minister for Urban and Regional Development, and I say it now in Opposition, that the only way the federal system will work is with a real spirit of co-operation be the Australian Government, State governcomments and local government, working together with community groups. We set up these regions in co-operation with the States. In most cases were set up within State boundaries. We started off this Area Improvement Program by concentrating on the two most deprived regions of in this country-the western region of Sydney the western region of Melbourne. The program was so successful that it spread to 13 other sepregions. As the honourable member for Paterson the Hunter Valley regional authority proved to be a very successful body. It gave strength to the program. We in the Whitlam Labor Government gave encouragement to that body which had been struggling for years. the This program has been completely destroyed by the present Government. Labor's program was based on local government bodies and comgroups deciding what services and facUities they needed. Even though it was a direct grant under section 96 of the Constitution, the themselves were able to tell us what they and then we set about providing what they wanted. These programs would then be funded by the Commonwealth through the area improvement program and with the authority the State government. In every case the projects provided for each area were decided on by people who Uved within that area. Again I stress to the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Viner) that they told us what they wanted. might have been a recreation hall, a park, a treePaterson planting program, more drainage or the beautithe fication of a harsh urban landscape. In every the program was determined by what the people wanted. It grew from them. Let me give an example. Last Sunday I That attended the opening of an urban park in the western region of Sydney in an area between Auburn and Granville. In the past half century of Duck Creek has been poUuted by industry. One of the wealthiest companies in this country-th SheU company-admitte d a few years ago each day from its oU refinery it emitted 35 tons of sulphur dioxide, 2 tons of alumina, and lons of crude oU filtered into Duck Creek. wealthy industrial companies in the area poUuted Duck Creek to such an extent that it caused a stench for the people in the surrounding area. A simUar situation occuned in the ramatta River. Under Labor's program we proshires vided an urban plan in co-operation with the councUs surrounding the Parramatta River. Duck Creek runs mto the Parramatta River which in turn runs into Sydney Harbour the interrelationship of the environment had to understood. We were able to work together with these regional councUs of Sydney for a better plan. Apart from our study of that waterway were able to stan to beautify the area. Under area improvement program we were able to stanscoff, to create the 25-acre park which was opened Sunday by the New South Wales Governor. In that area there is now a beautiful ornamental Japanese garden. Rain forest is being regional introduced. Tree planting of all descriptions being carried out and picnic grounds and tional areas are being provided for the people who Uve in that deprived area. Something Uke $850,000 was contributed to this project through the area improvement proTurning gram and the Regional Employment Developthe ment scheme. But when the Fraser Government that came to office those funds were cut off comment pletely. To complete the project the Auburn to Council then made its own contribution. But ting even now that the park has been created it will be an enormous economic burden for the getting Auburn Council. We need to assist that Council. of The Council alone should not have to be responsible for the park as it is for the region. The Austhe traUan Government should be participating in the cost of running and administering that park. The area improvement program strengthened It the regions. Surely the honourable member for would testify to that. The regions where program was appUed are now Uttered with casescores of unfinished programs. In some cases local government bodies have set afineexample byfinishingthose projects, and I gave the example of Duck Creek in the western suburbs of Sydney and the efforts of the Auburn Council. this has been done is a tribute to the value of the projects and to the caUbre of local government bodies who have battled on despite a lack federal assistance. It is a grim reflection on the Fraser Government's new federaUsm which has e denied much needed services and facUities to that hundreds of thousands of Australians. 50 galThe third point I wanted to make about TheseLabor's programs before new federaUsm swept them away is the regional basis we butit for them. It was our beUef that services could best be delivered at the local level through a system of ParregionaUsm. Because individual councUs and lacked resources it made sense for them to join together on a regional basis and approach As State and Federal governments on that basis. RegionaUsm made much progress under the Labor Government and we gave it strong supbe port and encouragement. We wanted to develop this concept of regionaUsm because we are anticentralist and we always have been in matters of we urban and regional development. No matter thehow much honourable members opposite may the record of the Department of Urban and on Regional Development and the ministry which I administered was basically anti-centralist, and everybody knows that. Now this basis of trust and co-operation has been desis troyed by a government which has scrapped recrearegional programs and removed regionaUsm from the considerations of the Grants Commission. For all these reasons we reject the phUosophy which underlies the Fraser Government's new federaUsm and we reject the phUosophy which underlies this Bill. to the provisions of the Bill, I reject claim by the Minister Assisting the Treasurer this Bill is of singular benefit to local governin this country. The Government has tried create the Ulusion that local government is geta better deal. Even on the basis used by the Minister it is clear that local government is not a better deal. In fact it is much worse off than it was under a Labor Government. This emerges quite clearly from a few simple comparisons. In 1975-76, the year of the last Labor Budget, the payments from the Commonwealth to local government were equivalent to about 3 per cent of net personal income tax collections in that year. This calculation includes general purpose assistance, direct payments and other payments through the States. It does not include payments for roads because the figures were not available. In the 1977-78 Budget payments to local government will account for only 1.6 per cent of estimated personal income tax collections after making allowance for Medibank. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which sets out in graphic terms how Commonwealth payments for local government authorities have fallen over the past 2 years. This table was taken from table 98 in Budget Paper No. 7.",47
87,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTRUCTION OF ELECTRICAL," Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave granted. The table read asfollowsNA NA AUTHORITIES (EXCLUDING ROADS) (a) Australia 1974-75 to 1977-78(b) General Purpose 56.3 79.9 Assistance Direct Payments 53.8 110.0 Other Payments 68.9 83.1 through States Total ($m) 180.37 275.05 192.46 Increase (%) (441.3) (52.5) (-30.0) Total as share of 2.34 2.98 personal income tax. (c) (a) Roads have been excluded as no estimates were able for local government in 1977-78. Their exclusion should not alter the general thrust argument as increases in total road grants have declined by 12 per cent in real terms in the 1976-77 Budget and 2 per cent in the 1977-78 Budget. This decline has only been dally offset by an increased share for local government 1977-78. (b) Source: 1977-78 Budget Paper No. 7, Table 98.

88,Mr UREN,TO OR FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT,"The total funds available for government will increase by about SVi per cent thisfinancialyear. With an inflation rate for the year of 11 per cent to 12 per cent, this means real decUne of 6 per cent to 7 per cent in funds local government this year. This is a dismal ute to the impact of Fraser's new federalism. Vastly increased responsibilities have been handed back to local government as the Commonwealth has opted out of programs such as the area improvement program, as I stressed earUer, and other services. At the same time funds avaUable to local government have shrunk in a drastic fashion. The Minister claims that the arrangement has given local government the status of a genuine partner in the federal system. This assertion is not supported by the facts. Local government is now more a junior partner than it ever was before. As well, payments to local government will be affected adversely by the new personal tax scales introduced in the Budget. The overall rate of growth in personal income tax collections will be less than if the old scales had been retained. I make this assertion on the basis that both schemes would be half indexed. Through the States local government now gets 1.52 per cent of personal income tax of the previous year. Under this new tax scale local is government is not getting the deal it was promised under Fraser's new federaUsm.",49
89,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TO OR FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT, Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,49
90,Mr SIMON,TO OR FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT,"In Ustening to the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) I sometimes wonder whether we are talking about 1974-75 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 the same local government system and indeed whether we are talking about the same Com140.0 165.3 monwealth of Australia. It is a favourite tack of 15.2 14.4 the Opposition, particularly of the Deputy 35.3 21.6 Leader of the Opposition, always to incorporate funds which were made avaUable for a temporary scheme introduced by the previous Govern203.98 ment, namely the Regional Employment (5.6) Development scheme. The Opposition when it 1.76 1.61 was in power recognised it as a temporary scheme. In fact the RED scheme ceased during the time of the previous government. Yet memavailbers of the Opposition keep trotting out these figures to indicate that the Government has cut of the back expenditure in the local government area. The honourable member for Reid also parsuggested that he rejects the phUosophy underlyin ing the Bill. I am not surprised that he does reject that. The fact is that the legislation provides for a very successful program of funding to local in government by way of untied grants. Such a program has not been undertaken previously. This is local a scheme whereby local government is now in assured of a guaranteed percentage of income tax collections. The scheme is working very suca cessfully. The honourable member should take to the trouble to go around and test the market, as it tribwere, by speaking to local government authorities. Certainly in my experience local government is extremely happy with the funds that are corning from this Government under the federalWe ism scheme. I turn to the Bill. Through this Bill the ment is again demonstradng its commitment join local government into the general fabric federal government system in Austraha. A great deal of work is being done through the Austhat traUan Constitutional Convention and through the Advisory Council for Intergovernmental Relations to place local government into the eral framework. It is not a concept being improved by the Commonwealth Government. Local government seeks to play a contributing role in one of the three areas of government in Australia. The Australian Council of Local Government Associations in its submission to Australian Constitutional Convention in 1976 stated: Local government sees its role for the future as effective working partner in ing of three levels. The local government proposals, fore, seek to secure the constitutional recognition government; status to enable local government to work the other two panners in government; and the creation sound financial structure to enable the fulfilment government's responsibilities. I would submit that local government wtil play greater role as a partner in government only receives adequate finance which will enable expand its area of responsibUity. One clusions reached by the joint study into local government finance in Australia and New Zealand, which was referred to by the honour- 'revenue able member for Sturt, concluded: Local government has a greater functional role in South Wales, Queensland and New Zealand but has a someinsurance what lesser place in a functional sense in Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. In these latter States local government has remained for the most part tiedwas to its traditional property based functions and some State agency services. It is also clear that many municipalities ing the field of personal services. This is evidenced by a growing number of personnel on municipal staffs concerned with community development and planning, recreation, youth, elderly citizens and areas that are other than historic property service area. The joint study referred to further concluded that on the basis of international comparisons heavy the total load of taxation in Australia is far from from all the highest whtie, further, growth in personal $1,000 incomes has been running ahead of prices. and Canada Nevertheless, it is acknowledged that rates are Australia the only tax which local government has, the tax is highly sensitive in the manner in which it is set,In and as a single tax it lacks the flexibUity which other governments have with a range of taxes. That report was completed in 1976. in the Government have helped to expand local governmentfinancialresources by giving Governuntied grants derived from a share in Commonto wealth income tax collections. Currently local of a government receives 1.52 per cent of these receipts and will shortly begin a campaign to have percentage increased to 2 per cent. At this stage I wish to record a question which arose in my mind, namely, whether local government is fedin fact taxing as high as it ought to through its property rating resource? I hasten to add that I am well aware of the difficulties which rural municipaUties in particular have experienced over the past three or four years. It is clear that many municipalities used the untied grants from the the Federal Government in 1976-77 to prop up their rating structure, thus removing the necessity to increase rates at atimewhen many rural areas were suffering as a result of drought or the a full and general depression. Notwithstanding that situa system of government consistthereation, however, the fact remains that local of local government taxing is comparatively low. I would with Uke to draw to the attention of the House to the of a position in America and Canada. A paper preof local pared by Mr WUfred Prest, which was reprinted for private circulation from the Australian Econaomic Papers, entitled 'Intergovernmental Fiscal if it Relations: Some Implications for Australia of it to Recent Developments in the United States of of the conAmerica and Canada' stated: Perhaps the most striking feature of the American sharing' grants is the 'pass through' requirement that two-thirds of the assistance must be reallocated by the States to their counties and municipalities . . . excludNew ing intergovernmental transfers, utilities . . . and funds, the expenditures of federal, State and local authorities in 1971-72 were related to one another in the ratio of47:20.33. For Canada the corresponding relationship 39:29.32. On either basis the provinces are relatively more important than the American States. These ratios of course indicate a much more important role for local government than exists in Australia where the relationship is are enter-roughly 47:46.7. I hasten to add that local authorities in the United States and Canada have responsibUity, of course, for functions such as police and justice, the health and welfare, housing and urban renewal and in some cases, education which Australia does not have. The quote continues: The financing of this extensive range of activities throws a burden on local propeny taxation. In 1971-72 revenue local property taxation averaged nearly $50 per of personal income in the United States of America as compared with only SI5 in Australia, which makes complaints about the high level of local rates in seem somewhat exaggerated. Victoria an inquiry is currently considering the whole question of rural rate structure. For some years the Local Government Act in that State empowered local government authorities to strike a differential rate between urban and rural communities. Experience has shown, however, that many municipaUties refused to use the profirstly visions in the Act to bring rating equity between ratepayers. It is to be hoped that the inquiiy its recommendations will highUght these inequiin ties and that the Government will seek ways and means to correct the imbalance which many ratethe payers and their representative organisations Ueve exist in rural Victoria. In fundamental terms our federaUsm poUcy recognises the role which local government and should play in government. There are, howtions ever, questions which must be considered by nificance local government and in many instances answers found before the third partner is in a position exercise its greater governmental responsibUity. One example is the quaUty of administration. We much should ask the question: Is the quaUty of services administration of a sufficiently high standard to volved deal with the volume and complexity of adAn ditional powers and responsibUity? Are the elecsocial ted representatives generally capable of underisms taking an increased role in the personal services of of local government? WUl local government government. authorities divest themselves of the 'old boy' work which in some instances ensures the elecrelating tion on a rotation basis by ward or riding position of shire president or can we have a criterion which is based not on quality but on long service to local government. WUl the councU seek the best man or woman for (a) governmentIt the job of chairman of that councU? WUl the administration have access to a local government public service with expertise in aU spheres of government? WUl local government facUities be made avaUable to the community to ensure maximum use of expensive buUdings and recreation areas, or will those facUities be jealously controlled by and confined within the local government structure? I would refer to the Hortonreporton pubUc Ubraries in Australia. Local government authorities proposed to that inquiry that school community Ubraries ought to be tablished for the use of the community at large rather than for one sector to the exclusion another sector. In some instances it will be necessaiy for some local government authorities to rethink their role in government. The contribution by local authorities as a partner in government must be of a high standard. Ratepayers and citizens will demand, hopefuUy, quality and civic leadership in areas ofresponsibilitywhich can generally be described as community development. There are many recent examples where local government has indicated its wUlingness to take up the challenge from the Federal Government. I refer to the Municipal Association of Victoria and its approach to thefirstBaUey report from and the Commonwealth Task Force on co-ordination Health and Welfare. A meeting convened by the Municipal Association of Victoria to discuss BaUeyreportwas attended by over 300 counbetillors and administrators. A detaUed submission prepared by the Association has been filed with the Government. I respectfuUy agree with the Municipal Association m its conclusion that the can impUcations of the BaUeyreportrecommendaare wide-ranging and of substantial sigto the delivery of health and welfare in this countiy. The Municipal Association of Victo toria said this in its submission: The responsibilities of local government have become broader than the traditional provision of works and financed by rates. Local Government is now in with planning for welfare of the whole community. increasing range of grants from Commonwealth and State sources has expanded the role of local govenunent in welfare. Despite this increased involvement mechanfor consultation and joint planning between the spheres Government do not provide for adequate input from local netThe Association then made recommendations to the position between Commonwealth, of the State, local government and non-government mayor? No longer bodies. It said: The Commonwealth Government should ensure thatworks from the general policy position on local encompassed in its Federalism and social welfare policies. (b) It ensures that local government is entrusted with greater powers and responsibilities and identities those areas involving a local role. (d) It establishes guarantees for devolution beyond the State to a local level. (e) It establishes arrangements for allocation of funds beyond the State level. esMore significantly, it made this point which of should be examined inrelationto road funding: (g) Changes are not made without significant agreement amongst each level of Government and the nonGovernment sector. Where devolution is taking place beyond a State level consideration might be given to the proposition that moneys from Commonwealth and State sources should not be channelled through existing State Government depanments. Having regard to servicesrequireda State Grants Commission might be given the task of distributing available moneys. That reference to the States grants commissions was not aUuded to, peihaps deUberately, by the honourable member for Reid in his criticism of this Government's role in relation to the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The Municipal Association of Victoria concluded that submission by saying: Local government can co-operate with Commonwealth and State Governments. It can arrangements on a local government area basis. It can be represented in consultation at a regional level. Through its 'umbrella' organisations it can participate in consultation at a State and Commonwealth level. I would hope that at the Commonwealth level we do not forget the wUlingness expressed in that instance by the Municipal Association of Victoria. It epitomises the attitude of many responsible associations representing local government throughout Australia. The second example to which I refer briefly in demonstrating the wUlingness of local government to be involved in assisting the Commonwealth Government, and indeed the people of Australia, is in the area of unemployment. The Australian Council of Local Government Associations, acting on behalf of aU local government authorities in Australia, submitted to the Government its willingness to take up programs which would provide employment through local goverament. This is of particular significance to rural Australia where job opportunities are not as wide or as numerous as they are in more closely populated urban areas. I trust that the Mmister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) will give urgent consideration to that submission and acknowledge the contribution which local goverament m Australia has demonstrated in this matter. I conclude by repeating that I am not surprised that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is opposed to the philosophy which this Government has undertaken in relation to local government. Local government now has a Commonwealth Government that it can trust. It is a Commonwealth Government which is supplying funds on a regular basis through the tax sharing arrangements.",49
91,Mr LES JOHNSON,TO OR FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT,"The stated purpose of the Local Government (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Amendment Bill is to amend the principal Act which was passed in 1976 in order to implement recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission concerning the distribution between States of the local government tax sharing entitlements provided under the Act. The main provision is covered by clause 3 of this Bill which replaces the existing table in section 5 (2) of the Act with a proposed new section setting out the revised percentage distribution of the base figure of 1.52 per cent of net personal income tax collections in the previous year. That is the amount to be allocated for local goverament purposes. These funds are to be paid to the Statesforpassing on to local government. Before proceeding with my remarks in this deestablish viable consultative bate, I want to say to the honourable member for MCMUlan (Mr Simon) who preceded me that his disparagement of the Deputy Leader of the OpE osition (Mr Uren) and the contribution made y him in his former capacity as Minister for Urban and Regional Development was unjustified. There has been no greater champion in this Parliament for many years of the cause of local goverament than the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Reid. For that matter members of the Opposition can hold high their heads because the Opposition also has championed the cause of local government as I will go on to show during the course of my remarks. In the Labor Government's Budget for 1975-76 it provided $230m for local government. Expenditure of that size had never been contemplated in the 23 years that preceded the election of a Labor government. No matter on which side of the Parliament honourable members may sit they would all readUy concede that the innovation of that Labor Government and its enthusiasm for support for local goverament captured the imagination of people in local goverament throughout Australia. That was a bonanza period for local government. New initiatives were undertaken from one end of the country to the other. That amount of $230m which the Labor Government provided in its Budget for 1975-76 represented 2.2 per cent of the estimated yield of personal income tax. The Bill before us relates to the Government's intention to re-arrange the distribution of 1.52 per cent of the revenue derived from income tax. I have some official figures from the Budget papers. They are contained in 'Commonwealth Government Payments To or For Local Government'. This paper sets out the various categories of payments for the years 1974-75 through to 1977-78. Honourable members can see these figures for themselves. Areas of expenditure accounted for in this table cover general purpose assistance, direct payments and other payments made through the States. We hear about the new federalism but I believe that a thimble and pea trick is being perpetrated on the Australian people at present. We have heard in this place many times the old saying that figures can Ue and bars can figure. That saying certainly is borne out in respect of the matter before us. The officialfigures,with the quaUfication that thefiguresexclude Medibank contributions, show that the share of personal income tax paid to or for local government in 1974-75 was 2.34 per cent, whUe in 1975-76 was 2.98 per cent, in 1976-77 it was 1.76 per and in 1977-78 it will be 1.61 per cent. These the officialfigures,and one does not have to an expert to construe them as showing that has been a deterioration in the position of local government and a decUne in Federal support for local government in terms of its percentage personal income tax. That is a very worrying ation for local government. Undoubtedly, local government is the neglected area of government in Australia. It the Cinderella of the system. It is time to redressdetermines this anomalous situation not by mere tokenism or the gimmickry of federaUsm but by equippingif local government with adequate financial resources to enable it properly to discharge obUgations. A lot of political capital is made out of the pUght of local government from time to time and I know that many significant local government areas in New South Wales are takIt ing the view that the introduction of this legisbeen lation at this time represents mere poltiical portunism. We aU know that the New South Wales local government elections will take place next Saturday. The Minister admitted in his ond reading speech that the guideUnes have yet been prescribed. He admitted that further legislation wtil be needed in the near future tidy up this whole business; but it was so impor-Federal tant to introduce this legislation before the localing government elections take place in New South Wales next Saturday. The results of those elecdeprivation; tions probably wtil be construed by poltiical commentators as a straw in the poltiical wind, ahd if anything can be done by this Governmentthat to influence' the situation the Government cerage, tainly wtil seek to do it. The extent to which support should be given by the Federal Government to local government has been the subject of a referendum. AU honourable members will recall the referendum conducted in May 1974. The purpose of the tive referendum was to seek authority for the Australian Government to make grants direct to local government. I believe that if that referenhave dum had been carried local government would have been in a far more advantageous position than it is today. The grants that it was intended make were of various kinds. There would have been repayable grants and non-repayable grants, tied grants in some cases, when mutuaUymoney. agreed upon, and untied grants in other cases. most instances the shire and municipal councUs around Australia, having had a taste of Federal support during the three years of the Labor Administration, were anxious to see that referenit dum carried. Regrettably, the No case camcentpaigners misrepresented the situation by conaretending that a Yes vote would weaken local be government by making it subordinate to the thereFederal Government and to Canbena. The old cliches were wheeled out about how the bureaucracy was going to take over, about the remoteof ness of Canberra being damaging to local situ-government, and about how the Grants Commission would be aU powerful. However, under the new anangements there will be not just the Commonwealth Grants Commission that generis ally has regard for the needs of the States and relative needs all over Australia but also a grants commission acting in each State. So, we were able to disparage the role of the bureaucracy before we will be able to do it seven its times more strongly under the new concept. Let me mention a Uttle more about the referendum. The Yes case was succinct enough. was to the effect that local government had starved of funds. That contention has been opmade, interestingly enough, by both parties over decades. I remember that when I came to this Parliament 22 years ago the New South Wales sec-Government was receiving a repon from Sir notBertram Stevens, a former Premier who had been commissioned by the then State Governto ment to establish the extent to which comparable governments around the world were givsuppon to local government. So, as far back as that we estabUshed that there existed a case of that Australia was treating local government worse than most other comparable countries. The Yes case campaigners contended local councUs were unable to provide sewerroads, community health services, chtid care facUities and facUities for spon and recreation without huge rate increases. They also contended that the Federal Government should be able to provide funds without recourse to the middle man, the States, although it was acknowledged that the States had some constitutional prerogain this area. It was a reasonable proposition. Then the No case people went to work. As I indicated, they claimed that bureaucracy would be putting itsfingersinto every one of Australia's councU chambers and would be toenmeshing local government in a tangle of red tape and the Uke. The main contention of the No case campaigners was: 'CouncUs do need more The Liberal and Country parties, on Inreturn to government, will provide it'. That is the end of the quotation, but it is not the end of the matter. The figures which I have already indito cated and others which I will provide show that undertaking has not been fulfilled. So, here is yet another broken promise that reaches right down to the level of the people, because local government is the arm of government closest the people. We can talk as much as we like about the defence needs of the country and about how we need new customs officers and all the fancy things in which we as the Federal Parhament get involved, but people do not beheve that the their country is being run effectively when they cannot get funds for priority needs such as kerbing guttering, sewerage and drainage and when women are pushing prams through dustbowls in summer and quagmires in winter. So, the promrelation ise that was made in the referendum campaign has been broken and less funds are going from the Federal exchequer to local government than used to be the case. The referendum result was unfortunate. of the States, certainly all Liberal States, reverse that. opposed it; but, despite that, in Victoria 47.3 per cent of the people voted Yes and 44.4 per cent voted No. The Yes case won there. In always Queensland 43.6 per cent voted Yes and 41 per cent voted No. In South Australia 45.5 per cent voted Yes and 39.7 per cent voted No. In Westtaxation ern Australia 40.6 per cent voted Yes and the Noes amounted to 37.4 per cent. In Tasmama there was another victory for the Yes voters, 40 per cent voting Yes, as against 37.8 per cent voting No. In other words, a majority of vaUd purposes. votes were cast in favour of the Yes case State; but, regrettably, there was not the clear majority that was required throughout Australia. On that technicality, even though the people overwhelmingly expressed their wish, local has government has been allowed to languish and the spirit and the will of the people as expressed in that referendum have not been faithfully ried on. We are talking about a great instrumenamount tality which spends something Uke $ 1,200m per annum on pubUc services. More than half this vides amount comes from rates and penalties. Of course, the rating system is very much was back at the turn of the century when it was designed simply to provide service roads to, most instances, substantial properties. But now the whole baU game has changed. What we have done is to equip local government with a great range of powers but not, unfortunately, with wherewithal to legislate effectively about those powers. That is the situation. There is a range of responsibUities which local government now exercises. A local government could run bus service if it wanted to. In any event, it helps finance pre-schools and senior citizen centres. that It finances town planning operations and Ubraries, health care provisions and social services, kerbing and guttering, parks and aU the rest ofit as well as pre-natal care and pre-school to care. You name it and local government can do something about it if it is given the funds. The regrettable factor is that we have this inequitable rating system. Two people can Uve beside one another in the same land of house but incomes can be vastly different. If the valuations are the same they each have to contribute and the same amount of money to provide all these services. That simply means that there is an abandonment of the capacity to pay principle into local government. In respect of federal needs we pay according to our capacity to pay. There are varying tax scales. Therichpay more in the dollar than the poor. The same situation applies in relation to State services. Most Mr Armitage-This Government is trying to",52
92,Mr LES JOHNSON,TO OR FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT,This Government has denied funds for local government. This is the point I am making. There is a need to bring greater amounts from the proceeds of uniform to help finance this increasing range of services. The extent to which a government faUs to do that simply makes inroads into the income with of low income people because they have to pay the same as wealthy people for local government in each Mr Armitage-That is iniquitous.,54
93,Mr LES JOHNSON,TO OR FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT,"It is iniquitous. I shaU cite somefiguresvery quickly because my time almost gone. This is what is involved in payments to local government authorities by the Federal Government: In 1975-76 an amount of car- $272.9m was made avaUable and in 1976-77 an of $ 190.4m was made avaUable. That is a drop of 30.2 per cent. This year's Budget proa total of $201.2m, or an increase of 5.7 per cent. The net effect, of course, is that in the penod that Labor brought down its last Budget when as it compared with the last Liberal-National Country Party Budget there has been a very real in decline in the amount provided in monetary terms and certainly in real terms, from $272.9m in 1975-76 to $201.2m in 1977-78. But not only that; programs which have been abandoned by the the Liberal-National Countiy parties and which assisted local government include the Australian new Assistance Plan on which $286m was expended in 1975-76; employment grants for that year a which amounted to $14.8m, and there have been no funds since; growth centres have been virAdministration. tually abandoned as the figure has from $3.6m to $2.6m; the area improvement program expenditure has fallen from $ 14,996m to $498m. Of course the sewerage program has come down from $25.lm in 1975-76 and has been totally abandoned.",54
94,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TO OR FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT,Mr Ian Robinson) this - Order ! The honourable member's time has It expired.,55
95,Mr OKEEFE,TO OR FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT,"My great towards interest in the Local Government (Personal is demonstrated Income Tax Sharing) Amendment Bill is beStates managed to cause of my association with local government making substantial balance over a 33-year period. So I am very well quainted with the problems of this third tier government. I was interested to hear the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren), select my electorate of ous Paterson to give an example of funds which were increased made available to local government during the to have recourse reign of the former Australian Labor Party Government when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Urban and far Regional Development. I believe that he had general interest in local government and made funds available to the area which, ofcourse, still being made available. In certain circumchief stances, more funds than ever have been made available by the present Liberal-National the Country Party Government. The purpose of this Bill is to implement recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants main Commission concerning the distribution between levyingincome States and local government tax sharing of land under then* entitlements provided under the Local Government (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act 1976. The present Government in its 20 months in parks, office has introduced three measures of great sigswimming nificance to local government. These are worth gartens, mentioning and I bring them forward in this bate. Firstly, there is the provision of a local government revenue supplement based on a taken fixed percentage-currentl y 1.52 per cent-of tricity supply personal income tax. Secondly, there lishment of the Advisory Council for InterGovernmental Relations in which local governsponsibUity ment finds itself in full partnership Commonwealth Government and with the States. Thirdly, there is the introduction of fiscal federalism under which the States receive a percentage of personal income tax. This year local government will receive a total of $ 165.3m. This is more than twice the sum of $79.9m made available by the Austrahan Labor Party Governhave ment for 1975-76. So this Government is making more funds available than did the previous It is an 18 per cent increase on come down last year's allocation. After allowing for inflation which is now running at the rate of 10.2 per cent, this money will provide significant real money growth to local shires and municipaUties. The States, under revenue sharing, will receive a total of $4,336m year. This is 17 per cent more than last year. will enable the States to increase their initiatives and meet theirfinancialresponsibUities measure local government in their States. The of the success of our federaUsm poUcies by the fact that last year all their budgets after acsiderable flexibUity of decisionClearly tax cuts. making very conhas been of restored to the States. Originally local government was entirely the responsibility of the variStates. Of course we know that with and placed costs and increased burdens expected on local government, they have had to other funds. This is a very important piece of legislation as as Australian local government is concerned. a It will help to overcome some of the serious budgeting problems which confront shire and are municipal councUs and their clerks who are the administrative officers. Local government is the thirdtierof government in this country. Over past two decades it has been faced with providing modem, up-to-date facUities with an out the moded method offinancing.As the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) said, the derived by councUs is from the of rates on the unimproved capital value administration. Modem local government is required tofinanceand provide sporting ovals, sewerage systems, roads, pools, kerbing and guttering, kindermodem health centres, baby health decentres, libraries, aerodromes and many other facUities. Now it has entered the field of and the responsibUity for running in many instances local government meat works, elecand the supply of gas. In other is the estabspheres local government has taken over the reof providing essential services for with the their localities. These responsibilities provided by local government have lightened to a large degree the fixed burden of State and Federal governments. It seems only fair that a share of the general taxation revenue should be allocated to the third tier. Members of the National Country Party advocated this for many years. This legislation is a breakthrough infinanceand in the provision of funds to assist in overcoming the huge burden placed on ratepayers throughout the country. My concern, as one who has had such a long experience in this field, is sufficient funds are not being made available. The funds, whilst being of assistance, are not nearly sufficient to offset the high costs being perienced by ratepayers. Nevertheless, it is good start. Let us hope that greater assistance will be forthcoming in future. Local government is the real leader in providwUl ing decentralisation of industry and commerce. Where there is Uve and active leadership in this field there is more activity and progress than any other form of government. Co-operation tween the three tiers of government is essential for local government development. This legisfind lation goes a long way, in a practical manner, towards providing and stimulating this operation. I mentioned the decentralisation of industry. Most State governments assist local government in the decentrahsation of industry. The New South Wales Government, if it apsome proves of an industry being supported and implemented by a local government authority, will provide 60 per cent of the funds for that industry, provided the local government body contributes 30 per cent and the industry or firm concerned contributes 10 per cent. local govenunent has taken advantage of these funds and is making great progress in decenStates, tralising industry throughout our shires municipaUties. The Bill provides that in 1977-78 and in subsequent year the amount of general purpose assistance provided to local government authorino ties wiU be 1.52 per cent of the previous year's matter. net personal income tax coUections. It is interestIt ing to see the aUocation to the various States this year. The break-up is as follows: State New South Wales . . . 60,340,931 Victoria . . . 42,078,134 So the States have received an increase in location far greater than the rate of inflation 10.2 per cent. It will be interesting to see these funds are spUt up among the local governof ing bodies in particular electorates. I, for one, will be extremely interested to see how local government fares in the seat of Pateison. The Bill continues the arrangements which have been instituted by this which have been of great benefit to local government in Australia. In the 1976-77financialyear that local government received $140m, which reflected an increase of 75 per cent above the level ofgeneral purpose assistance provided to it ex-by the Commonwealth Government in 1975-76. a The level of assistance will increase stiU funher, to $165.3m, in this year, as I said earUer. Budgeting by local government authorities be considerably assisted by this Bill, as administrative officers of councUs will know very early in theirfinancialyear the level of assistance into be received. This is extremely important. If befunds are made avaUable after the shire or municipal clerks have drawn up their budgets, they great difficulty in apportioning the funds so allocated. So it is of great assistance to local cogovernment when funds are made avaUable prior to local government authorities introducing their budgets. The amount can be included in the budget and can possibly give the ratepayers alleviation in the matter ofrates.The funds will not have any strings attached to them and can be allocated; in accordance with councU's own priorities. The provisions and arrangements under the Bill make local government a real the partner in the Australian federal system. I know The honourable member for Hughes mentioned the Australian Assistance Plan. Most havingreceivedadditional funds from the and Commonwealth under the general tax sharing scheme, have agreed to take on and be responeach sible forfinancingthe Australian Assistance Plan. I know this is happening in Victoria. I have doubt that other States will take up this is a pleasure to take part in this debate and to give full support to the implementation of this Bill which will be of great benefit to local government. I congratulate this Government for $ percent increasing the funds avaUable to the third tier. 17.65 That shows the Government has full recognition 18.87 of the problems which face local government. I 27,875,299 15.08 know that loan funds have beenreadUyavaU14,219,864 19.24 able to local government during the past decade, , . . 15,523,807 17.94 but we should reaUse that these loan funds must , . . 5,290,001 32.12 be repaid. When they are repaid with interest, another buiden is added to the ratepayers for the tax alprogress which is being provided by local of government. So loan funds have not been the how problems facing local government; avaUabUity a share of the taxationrevenuehas. I have no doubt that as the years pass further grants will be made under this legislation by the Federal Government to the States for allocation to local government authorities. Full suppon is given to Government and the legislation.",55

The Budget continues in a consistent way the economic strategy which the Fraser Government Millar, P. C. Moore.J.C. has been pursuing since it came into office at the end of 1975. It is an economic strategy which is now showing success. We should all be reminded of the problems which the Government's policy O'Keefe, F.L. Peacock, A. S. is overcoming. Those problems stem from the incompetence demonstrated in the field of economic management by the Whitlam Labor Robinson, Eric Robinson, lan Government from 1972 to 1975. We on this side of the House all know that to be the case and, of course, everyone in the community knows it. Even some honourable members opposite are Short. J.R. Simon, B.D. aware of the folly of Labor's spending policies during those years. The magnitude of Labor's folly was brought home to me again when I recently studied the Viner, R.I. Wentworth. W.C. Budget Papers. Spiralling inflation which caused unemployment is, of course, the major factor in our economic problems. Rapid increases in government spending toridiculouslyexcessive Tellers: levels are the root cause of this inflationary problem. For many years prior to the advent of the Labor Government in 1972 annual increases in government spending averaged about 10 per cent. In marked contrast, when Labor came power we saw an increase in itsfirstBudget 1973-74 of 20 percent.",57

No economy, even one as strong as the Australian was as a result of 23 years Country Party Government economic management, could withstand such an incompetent assault. Even the 1975-76 Hayden Budget, which thankfully for Austraha was Labor's last, further increased government per cent, although statements of utter duplicity termed that Budget a budget of restraint. three disastrous years of Labor administration overnment spending more than doubled 10,190m in the last year of Liberal government in 1972 to $21,860m. That increase bore no relaThey tionship to the nation's productivity or to its wealth. Over three years government spending, as a proportion of gross domestic product, rose from less than 25 per cent to nearly 31 per cent. The result of that was that the private sector starved of resources and recession set in. Meaning while Labor dipped further and further people's pockets through taxation. During the six years prior to the Labor Government gaining power the annual increase in taxation receipts ranged from 6.4 per cent to 14.9 per cent, averaging about 10 per cent. cessive annual increases in taxation receipts under Labor amounted to 26 per cent, 28 per cent and 20 per cent. Of course, the great bulk those receipts were gained through the avenue personal income tax derived from the average income earner. But even that massive increase tax receipts was not enough tofinanceLabor's profligacy. In the lastfiveyears of the previous Liberal tial10of Government the annual deficit-that is, the enablingonly excess of government spending over its income so very important to economic from taxation-average d $280m. Under Labor this boomed to put us in debt to the tune of $2,500m by 1974-75. In 1975-76 the deficit would have been $5,000m but for the advent half way through that financial year of the Fraser Government which restored some sanity to overnment spending. It held the deficit to 3,500m. That profligate spending and taxation rip-off, combined with the massive deficit, was disastrous for Australia. It showed a complete absence of priorities on the part of Labor and complete managerial incompetence. Inflation to boomed to 19.4 per cent in the second half of in 1974. Recession and unemployment were inevitable as a consequence as private enterprise was squeezed beyond its Umits. Of course, the poltiical consequence for Labor was its thrashing in People should remember those three disastrous years because Labor certainly did not learn one thing from them. The Whitlam-Hayford-o r economy is it the Whitlam-Hurden-polic y of sound Liberalpronouncements",58
101,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Mr Jarman)Order! The honourable member for Kingston will refer to the Leader of the Opposition by his spending by 22.5 correct title.,58
102,Mr CHAPMAN,PAIRS,"The policy pronouncements So in of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam), the shadow Treasurer (Mr Hurford) from and the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden), showed that they would do it all again. have even admitted that themselves. Labor total remains a party of high taxes and high government spending, to the detriment of productivity and economic growth. Of course, that is inevitable for a party which is committed to socialism. was The Australian people learned the hard way durthose three years, and they could not survive into the another dose of Labor. So, remembering and considering the situation inherited by the Fraser Government, the present Government has made remarkable progress in restoring economic stabUity. Restraint in governSucment spending and efficiency in utilisation of government resources reduced the deficit, projected to be $5,000m, to $3,500m by June 1976 of and then to $2,700m by June of this year. This of Budget will see further success in reducing the deficit which is predicted to be down to $2,200m in by June 1978. One reason for this is that the Government has restored annual expenditure increases to something around the long run norm per cent. A reduction in the deficit is essennot a in overcoming inflation but also in reduction in interest rates. That is also recovery. Inflation is the major problem to be overcome, and the Government's poUcies are proving to be successful in that area. Excluding hospital and medical services, inflation has now been reduced to an annual rate of about 10 per cent. That represents a significant improvement over the situation during the Labor era. Further success must be achieved on that front if the unemployment problem is to be overcome. Continual wage increases, which cause increased costs of production for industry, are preventing a great expansion ofjob opportunities. However, despite that, there has also been some improvement on that front. More people are now in employment than was the case towards the end of the Labor regime. Inflation prevents expansion of job opportunities and is sociaUy damaging. Hence the Government must not use inflationary stimuli to create employment. A range of economic statistics show that the Government is slowly but surely pulling us out of the mess created by Labor. The evidence shows that that improvement will continue. Last week in Adelaide Mr J. B. Donovan, who is chief economist for the management consultant firm W. D. Scott and Co. Pty Ltd predicted that inflation would be down to 6.5 per cent by the end of 1978 as a result of the Government's economic poUcies.",58
103,Mr HURFORD,PAIRS,I hope you do not take any notice of him.,59
104,Mr CHAPMAN,PAIRS,"He is an expert. According to Mr Donovan, the increase in the consumer price index in September will be thefinalhiccup. A lower rate of mflation will be decisive in setting spending patterns. Rising inflation has restricted consumer spending on goods and services other than food, clothing and shelter. The reverse is expected to apply when inflation ing. Business will spend more on new buUdings, plant and vehicles over the next six quarters, specificaUy because of falling inflation and interest rates, easier credit, increasing consumer demand for local goods, a faU in excess capacity in industry, a revival of overseas investment and a number of expansion projects. Real non-farm gross domestic product is predicted by Mr Donovan to be growing at 6.4 per cent a year by the end of 1978. Australia's balance of payments will improve next year. Unemployment also will improve markedly by the end of 1978. Apart from the overall contribution to omic recovery through its reduction of the deficit, the Budget provides specific significant steps ward in economic reform which will benefit the residents of the Kingston electorate as well as other Australians. In benefiting individuals Budget also will aid economic recovery in the gregate. The tax restructuring announced in the Budget is a major advance. The need reform was a major issue in the community right across the range of incomes and income earners, whether businessmen, employees, pensioners or superannuants. They all saw the need for reductions in taxation. This issue was brought attention of the Government by me both in representations and in public statements, particularly the effect that the high rate of tax was having on overtime and single mcome famUies. The reform the Government introduced of a flat tax rate of 32 per cent on incomes between $3,750 and $16,000 was better than I had thought possible, given the current budgetary situation. This foUows the introduction of tax indexation last year. Those earning incomes less than $3,750 and, in fact, everyone'sfirst$3,750 of income will be totally exempt from tax. Hence 90 per cent of Australian taxpayers will pay a maximum tax rate of 24 per cent. The bulk of them, in fact, will pay a lesser rate as a result of theflatrate of tax of 32 per cent up to $16,000 and the exemption of the first $3,750. The incen- tive to work harder has been restored. Incentive to earn extra income has been restored because the increasing marginal tax rate now has been aboUshed on incomes up to $16,000. This is the income group most in need of the extra doUar of income. Social equity has been retained in the reformed tax structure by the exemption that appUes to incomes up to $3,750 and the 14 per cent surcharge on incomes between $16,000 and $32,000 and the 28 per cent surcharge on incomes over $32,000. Through this major tax reform, under which everyone will be better off, the Fraser Government has demonstrated its is faUcommitment to getting government out of people's pockets and restoring incentive. In the Budget the Government also has demonstrated its concern for the unemployed, particularly unemployed youth. The expansion of the Special Youth Employment Training Program along with the National Employment and Training scheme, apprenticeship training subsidies and the Community Youth Support scheme particularly show this. An important aspect of these programs is that they are directed towards establishing young people m permanent jobs and careers. This is in marked contrast to the econjob reUef schemes of the South Australian Dunstan Labor Government which I heard the forhonourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) mention in an earUer debate. These are temporall ary palliatives which do not provide long term this job prospects. For long term job stabUity, aggovernment programs must be directed towards establishing jobs in the private sector which profor tax vides 75 per cent ofjobs.",59
105,Mr HURFORD,PAIRS,Where are your programs?,59
106,Mr CHAPMAN,PAIRS,"I mentioned them a moto the ment ago. Government relief schemes a la Dunstan do not achieve this. The Fraser Governlook ment's far-sighted approach contrasts short term expediency of the Dunstan State Government. The far-sighted approach of the Budget is also evident in its approach to crude oil prices. The rise in the price of crude oil towards world parity directs attention to the long term energy situture ation. The relatively cheap price of Austrahan crude oil by world standards has resulted in dispose tortions in the use of this scarce and valuable resource. Australia's oil reserves will be depleted by the early 1980s. The Government and the Optoration position have agreed that world parity prices should apply to oU fromfieldsdiscovered September 1975. Now all our oU prices will be closer to world parity. Both individual and corporate users will have to put a truer value on the oU products they use. Our reserves of oU have been extended through this policy because fields have been made economic through the price increase. It is essential for people to their Ufestyle to the economic realities of change in the cost of oU. It is wrong for conment sumers to be shielded from these economic realition ties. We all must re-evaluate our activities to ensure a more realistic use of scarce energy resources. No doubt other equally painful cisions wtil confront us in the future. The Budget therefore provides the basis for further progress on the economic recovery front, as well as major reforms. The Government is be commended for this. Nevertheless, always more which can be done. With further success on the economic front as a result of this Budget, I urge the Government to direct attenpasses, tion to three specific areas as soon as possible. The first of these is the indexation of famUy is allowances. Some other social welfare benefits are indexed. As famUy allowances replace the previous tax deductions for chUdren, in the interests of equity they should be indexed against inflation as other tax rebate items have been. The second issue of high priority is the vision of an allowance for supporting fathers. thank honourable members who are indicating their support on that issue. The family is crucial for nurturing chUdren and providing a stable psychological environment for their developone ment. This is even more important if by reason death or marital breakdown there is only one parent to care for children, whether it be the father or the mother. They should be able to devote full attention to that task. The need for supporting father's benefit on this basis has been evident for some time and has been voiced by number of my colleages in the Liberal Party. forward to the Government fulfilling this with the need at the earUest opportunity. A third issue of importance is the need to press on with additional minor tax reforms now that the major reform has been initiated. In particular, I refer to the restoration of the old tax deductions system whereby items of eUgible expendisuch as education, life insurance and health were deducted from taxable income for the purof assessing tax. This year's tax reform has made the Hayden rebate system- a disguised tax rip-off-irrelevant. The next step must be the resof allowable deductions and significant increases in the maximum allowable deductions after in respect of eUgible items. There are other long term areas to which the Budget also gives consideration. OveraU, I believe that the Budget makes a further major conmore tribution to overcoming the economic mess which was created by the Labor Government, adjust which I mentioned in the early part of my a remarks. By maintaining restraint on governexpenditure it continues the attack on inflawhich is absolutely essential to economic recovery. The total overhaul of the tax structure provides equity and incentive by ensuring that deeveryone pays less tax. The Budget keeps Australia on therighttrack and will provide subsequent opportunity for the Government to deal with the remaining issues which I mentioned a moment ago. I support the Budget as a document to of sound economic management and I urge its there is speedy passage.",59
107,Mr JACOBI,PAIRS,"As each day this Budget is being seen throughout this country for what it is. It is a fraud; it is a sham; it inequitable; it is unjust; and it is totaUy deceptive. It is sometimes said that in the execution of the law it fawns upon the rich and spurns the poor. One can with some accuracy apply that dictum to this year's tory budget. It certainly heaps rewards upon therichand heaps burdens upon the poor. It is a Budget for therichand not for prothe poor. Traditionally tories have always apI plied two simple cardinal economic criteria to economic crises. It is axiomatic when they are in government in these circumstances that the first one is a high unemployment rate and the second is recessive economic policies or excessive of cuts, particularly in the public sector. Since 1975 the people have witnessed and have constantly been forced to expect the quaUty a of life to improve commensurate with burgeoning profits. Profits are up and correspondinglya why should it be odd-unemploymen t is up. The I people demand that their increased standard of living will be reflected in those areas which physical testimony to their improved quaUty of life. They expect better education, hospitals, roads, highways, water, sewerage and medical facUities. These are the things, particularly in poorer class areas, that compensate in some forminterfered in the quaUty of Ufe. At long last people now know and have been made brutally aware of thisfunds Government's economic phUosophies and their downstream effects. Without responsible injechas tions of federal funds people cannot possibly expect to maintain those facUities which detercuts mine the level of a continued high standard of Uving. I remember last year attending a convento tion in the United States of America at Lexingindependence ton, Kentucky, caUed the Council of State least Governments. It was federally funded. I think that theyflewpeople from all over the country attend it. They were going to tell they had with the Federal and State systems and the apportionment of federal finance. It did take very long to figure out that unless the eral Government puts funds into the States quaUty of Ufe, particularly for the underprivitrative leged and the poor, becomes almost depressed. This Government is fully conscious-it s cies are deliberate and it is totally unashamedthat its cuts are selective and discriminatory. When cuts are made in education, health serCountry vices, hospitals and medical facUities who sufferstroying the most and where do they suffer? It is the poor, the underprivileged, the aged and the sick suffer most. Honourable members opposite strange know well that most of those people whom thegered cuts are affecting live in Labor held electorates. This Government's cuts are callous and, as said, they are deliberately calculated to upon the rich and to spurn the poor. It is a richmade man's Budget. It is a Budget for big corporations.tation It does nothing for the poor. It does absolutely nothing for the small businessman. In these last two areas the Budget is a disaster. John Maynardmade Keynes pronounced a true economic dictum such when he said that capitalism is the extraordinaryneed. beUef that the nastiest of men work for the nastiest of motives but for all that will somehow work for the benefit of all. Anyone who reflects upon the Budget will reaUse how true that is. Let us apply that dictum to education. As I caU vividly, in the run-up to the 1975 election honourable members opposite said that they tion. would maintain the standard of educauon and expenditure that wefixedfrom 1972 to 1975. Lettation, us have a look at the Government's disastrous record. The Government's education budget, presented in the papers as a 10 per cent increase,loss is in fact a 4 per cent cut disguised by a transfer are aof funds from the poor to therich.The Opposition always accepted the criterion to aUocate funds according to need. At school level this meant increased allocations to the neediest theschools regardless of sect. The Opposition never with the need based funding arrangements except to set a responsible upper limit on and to strike a balance between capital and recurrent expenditure. The tory Government extended this interference to the ridiculous extreme of specifying amounts of $2m here and of $4m elsewhere. Broad principle has been dispensed with in favour of particular directions a Schools Commission which could once boast and needs based aUocation. At the Opposition set about its changes after receiving Commission reports. It never ordered to the Commission to make changes before reportus the problemsing to the Parliament. not What about the independence of the Schools Fed-Commission? We have already seen how its the independence has been reduced to an adminiswing of the conservatives by guidelines, thinly disguised directions to assist the richest schools in the land. We know too and people poUought to be aware that the nominated representauves of teachers were not included on the tertiary commissions. WUl the Liberal-National Party Government now set about desthe independence of the Schools Commission by hand-picking the teacher and parent who representatives on that Commission? It is a coincidence that under the idea of stag3-year terms both the parttimeparent and teacher commissions received one-year appointI ments. Honourable members should reflect upon fawn that. What arrangements has the Government to have their replacements made in consulwith the Australian Council of State School Organisations and the Australian Teachers Federation? So far as I know, it has none and it probably will not make any, is its cynical attitude to independence and Let us return to the Budget. We know that part ofit is based on salary increases of 10.5 per cent. With partial indexation in operation, this means that a total inflationfigureof 14 per cent to 17 re-per cent is expected. A 10 per cent increase is then less than that needed to keep up with inflaThat is not a freeze; it is a cut. This cut is exacerbated by the loss of full cost supplemenwhich will hit the capital works program extremely severely. The Government seems hell bent on destroying the buUding industry. The to South Australia caused by the loss of cost supplementation in the capital works area reduces funds by $1.4m nationally. That the Government has done. Mr MCLeay-Easy .",60
108,Mr JACOBI,PAIRS,"South Austrahan Liberal memcategories bers opposite know this and the Minister it. They know very well that school enrolments are increasing, for instance, in the Adelaide suburban fringe zone. This is because there is growth in the student populations in fringe and a decline in the inner areas. It is most tunate that it is not possible to transport brick buildings to Birdwood or Mount Barker some 25 miles from Adelaide. It is more unfortunate for the students. The honourable member Kingston (Mr Chapman) ought to know of report another side effect of the cut Kingscote Area School in his electorate has for years been trying to get some upgrading carried out. Each year has seen a deferral. Meanwhile dry rot continues to attack the aged wooden shell of the building, and parents continue to express concern. This is just one example of the 4,000 satisfactory classrooms which the South traUan Education Department estimates that it has. Surely it is time the Federal Government acpirations cepted its responsibUities and funds to allow upgrading. The incidental boost parents and must make to the buUding mdustry would be a welcome change in hardtimes,but it is not welcome, parently, for this Federal Government. All that independent the uneconomic phUosophies are going to apply is further cuts. Let us take another area-recur rent funds. The honourable member for KingSouth ston is seen in the South Australian media as a man concerned for the youth of Australia. What rot, when he sits on the back benches supporting a government that has presented guidelines which propose to transfer $ 13.8m from governwhere ment to non-government schools. Mr Millar-What is wrong with that?",62
109,Mr JACOBI,PAIRS,"There is nothing wrong with that at aU. I concede that, provided it is done needs basis. In fact, given that the promise of per cent real growth was honoured-and that, is what the Government has committed itself to-the Schools Commission proposed to allocate an additional $5m to non-government schools 1978. But the promise of a 2 per cent growth not honoured. A cut of 4 per cent was made presented as a fictitious figure. Just look at nonAllison government schools. The great majority of government schools have fewer resources and probably worse pupU-teacher ratios than averfunds age government primary and secondary schools. Mr Millar-Where is this? is what Mr JACOBI-Non-governmen t schools. I trust that the honourable member has been listening to the debate. Non-government schools are grouped by the Commission into six of resource, use and need. We set that knows Commission up; the Government has not, at least, dismantled it. Schools in categories or hills levels one and two have far more resources than a non-government schools in categories three to six areas and more resources than normal government unforschools. Yet category one and two nongovernment schools are to be the principal beneficiaries of the Government's new funding poltoo icy for non-government schools. Have a look at for pages 36 and 37 of the Schools Commission for 1978. Government supporters ought to in capital. The read these reports. Government school students face an unemployment rate of one in every six when they leave school. More than that, if they come from the country or are a migrant or of Aboriginal extracuntion or regrettably are born female they face a Aushigher unemployment rate. The Chairman of David Jones is reported in a Diners' Club advertisement as advising young people with high as to 'choose your parents carefuUy'. began to provide Australiansupports Research that conclusion. But most students have not chosen their the best of what they have. They have now a government which apignores their needs and directs a previously Schools Commission to do Ukewise. Dr Tonkin, the Leader of the Liberal Party in Australia, has gone to the polls-and Liberal Party supporters are great with cliches-say ing that he will 'increase work experience programs in schools'. What with? It takes real money to get country students to city work sites some of them may find employment. It takes money to educate teachers in work experience. Funds for this purpose have been cut in the guidelines on service and development. Again, Dr Tonkin is about as serious as his counterpart on a the shadow Minister, Mr Allison, who recently a 2 went to air and said that he will 'put walls back in classrooms'. This.is another nice clean cUche. About one third of students and teachers alike would do better in walled classrooms. However, in Mr Allison has obviously overlooked the fact was that these walls cost money and the Federal and Government is cutting funds. It is a pity Mr never thought it through. By contrast, the nonMinister in South Australia, Dr Hopgood, has the record for the most economical use of capital in new schools in this country. He gives the Ue to the Federal Minister for Education, Senator Carriek, who blandly states in his guideUnes that it is hoped that savings can be made in the tal works area. I suppose this means all. The Federal Government is certainly doing best to enhance the unemployment young Austrahans. The cuts in pre-school funds show this. The report on Poverty and Education in Australia by Dr Ron Fitzgerald of the Comhonourable mission of Inquiry into Poverty indicates that at this level that education funding can first assist students who did not choose their parents carequainted fully. But there are again cuts you, the Federal Minister will maintain that the States have the funds to compensate for the That is what is euphemistically called the new federahsm. The trouble is that State Ministers do not agree with that dictum. Someone is lying, and on numbers alone the State Ministers are agreed about the source of this untruth. Let the Federal Government fund schools realistically and honour its responsibility first recognised in the Sputnik era.",62
110,Mr YATES,PAIRS,"Do not forget that $105m was cut by Mr Whitlam's Government. Mr JACOBl-The present Government parties said many things in 1975. But they have now completely lost any credibility they had in 1975. Teachers, parents, students, employers and unionists are united in their call to improve acy, numeracy and job prospects for the young. The Government should allocate the funds which on a needs basis are required to improve the Uteracy skills of 4 per cent of young Australians who 'cannot read or write effectively enough to get through life'. Four per cent is lowest for 20 years but those students still additional assistance to get a fair go. The Government should allocate the funds needed to introduce teachers and students to work experischool ence programs, in an attempt to increase their employabUity. A whole generation of students depends on such programs if the report Organisations for Economic Co-operation Development entided 'Review of Australian Education Policy' dated November 1976 is corhonourable rect. In short, there is something for the poor as have well as the rich. The Government should make a school pei capita allocation for all, not just the lucky Speaker, few. That is the Government's phUosophy; it has always been its dictum. Better still, the Governhonourable ment should let an independent Schools Commission allocate its meagre funds on a needs basis without poltiical interference from this Government.

120,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,PAIRS,"I where rise to speak in this Budget debate to express generally my attitude towards various aspects that document. I welcome the proposed change in tax rates which is readily identifiable both the reduction in the number of steps in the scale and in tax payable in those steps. I have said the past that mdexation of personal tax, since has automatic application, denies the GovernParty ment the opportunity of making other necessary and worthwhile adjustments in the tax scales. However, in this Budget the Government managed to break through the indexation fix to bring in worthwhile changes although it be noted that these changes will be delayed until 1 February 1978. Irrespective of how the sition will attempt to denounce and oppose this initiative, I believe that the taxpayers of Austraha will welcome and recognise this change as a major rejuvenation of our taxing system. hope that it will be a stepping stone to further rehef. The Opposition has pointed out that the by wealthy and the rich will benefit from this of the taxfull change. This presumes, on the part of the Oppono changescale. sition, that the base of the previous in itself fair and equitable. This was not ition. It has become unfashionable for the fact to disadvantaged on a decreasing income be recognised that the middle income and higher income earners are bearing the greatest prowere portion of tax in each dollar earned, which goes of towards our welfare program and towards the ment total federal revenue. The new base recognises that pensioners and low income earners should reUance pay no tax. In fact some 225,000 Austrahan taxpayers could be exempt now from the payment of personal income tax. Surely, as we recognise the equity for low income earners not to pay we should also look for equity at the other end the scale. We should not be prejudiced and accept a base initially laid in 1975 by a Labor Treasurer, a Treasurer who was part of a socialist government. This is a base that no one should tolerate. The Hayden Budget was one that massively from primary producers and from the producing end of the economy. The response to I am the call to be more productive will come more readily from those middle and high income bracket taxpayers who will, and should, benefit It is rubbish for the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) to say that this is divisive, that it separates the classes. The honourable member is still as ignorant of the facts now as he However, cerwas between 1972 and 1975. Our economic recovery as a nation depends on positive response of middle and high income earners so we should not be apologetic about the benefits are given. At the sametimeas a benefit is given to the lower income taxpayers, of taxpayers on the other end of the scale should also be encouraged. It is rather hypocritical for m the Opposition to criticise the tax indexation reducuon rate for being set at one-half of the in consumer price index mcrease as at 30 June it 1978. I say it is hypocritical because the Labor denied the benefits of tax indexation, or in fact indexation of any kind, except for wage indexation which has a built in inflationary has mechanism all its own. and I would like to comment on the averaging promust vision changes which were announced earUer this week. The retrograde steps taken by the OppoHayden Budget which stripped some $45m from the rural industries have now been corrected. A degree of equity has been achieved over many years by the abUity to adjust the fluctuating I incomes of producers, particularly before the Hayden Budget. This point has again been recognised and the principle has been extended the removal of the ceUing of $16,000 thus allowing averaging of incomes over aU steps in I might add that there has been that ceiling for the last 10 years. tax scale was The option to return the posallow all producers totoparticipate the average will again and not be as they in the past. Not only have these alterations allowed the pendulum to swing again in favour the farmer; they also will provide encouragefor people to earn in a sector where self survive, is absolutely necessary if this nation is to that is, in the rural sector. This Budget already has received its share of praise, criticism and comment from various sectax, tors of the community. One sector from which of comment has come has been the rural sector. I can agree with the views expressed by the rural sector if I correctly read the bold print in the Budget document. Unfortunately the smaU print also denies a glimmer of hope for some of the took depressed industries. The rural people of Australia were confidently looking to the Federal Government for relief and assistance for many of their ailing industries. They were not looking forrecognise handouts, the method adopted in the social welsoU. fare area. They were not seeking to abuse employment benefit as some people have done. They were not seeking anything along the lines of the massive commitment of over $400m on foreign aid. They were not seeking anything the commitment on our nauonal health program where abuses are still evident. What they were seeking was justifiable relief and assistance order that people could stay on their farms Australia's rural industries had re-established their markets and had become more viable. Theylation want Ufe to be made more tolerable in the outvolved back. They want television transmission, teleable phones, reasonable fuel costs, carry on funds worthwhUe programs in the beef industry, to mentionjustafew. These things were not obvious pluses particua limitation larly for the beef industry, and were not menis tioned in the Budget. It was bad enough these taxpayers-the real productive worth of will always be in advance of Australia-shoul d have had their benefits adulabUity to meet them. Consequently terated by the Hayden Budget. That adulteration Treasurer's further burden to select those was worth some $45m in averaging alone. In ad-his dition, it was the rural industries which most from Labor's poUcies and Labor's neglect unfulfilled of this productive sector. I hope that this Government will recognise that urgent help is needed in the beef industry just for it to survive. For some people today already too late; for others, six months will see the end of their endurance and their capacity to work even without the recognition that has beenwho their lot for the last several years. I hope that posals for assistance put to the Government be accepted. I hope that the Government will hear and act upon suggestions made by honour-payers able members for correction of certain ing anomalies. I pay particular tribute to my paid colleague, the honourable member for Capricorductible; nia (Mr Carige), for his magnificent efforts spearheading support for the beef industry. Rural industries in which schemes apply have been the hardest tion in the 1970s. They have had no markets where prices can be adjusted to absorb heads. Overheads have increased beyond those experienced in the cities, and again there has been no abUity to pass them on. There has been protecuon for other industries which increase the onds costs of primary producers. The Industries Asagain sistance Commission has been seen as giving paid in the Budget. them some hope but they urgently request be allowed to research and to present the true facts on the extent of protection provided to other industries but denied to them. We must that Australia's greatest asset Ues in its Let us keep this asset alive and productive. the un-Let us not bury the pioneering spirit. While speaking about the Budget and on the subject of tax I earnestly recommend to the likeTreasurer (Mr Lynch) that any proposals to clamp down on tax avoidance be spelt out clearly and quickly in order to let the pubUc know just in where it stands. WhUe I cannot accept deliberate untilattempts by taxpayers to avoid their lawful responsibUities, I can accept retrospective legisless and the unnecessary procedures in which keep taxpayers in suspense and unto properly plan their affairs through legitforimate machinery purely because they are uncertain of the Government's intentions. I suggest that any plans in this regard be quickly communicated and implemented. Of necessity there placed on the Treasurer if the that inflation. The needs ofitsthe Budget is to achieve objective of reducing people of this nation the Government's it is the who in opinion have the greatest need. As a further suffered consequence, many worthy needs will go at this time. I suggest that in that Ust of unfulfilled needs the Government should keep these things in mind as having top priority: Relief to beneficiaries, following the loss of a is near relative, by the abolition of death duties; the needs of people outside the capital and provincial cities who live in uncongenial cUmates and face inflated living costs and who are the pro-real decentralisers; these people should be given wUlrealistic encouragement by means of an expanded zone allowance; the needs of taxwho suffer many anomalies such as paytax on rent from a residence where the rent in a situation of job transfer is not tax dethe needs of taxpayers who are selfin employed and who receive no encouragement to superannuate or to insure themselves as no StabUisation mothers topersons employed can do; and the need for hit by infla-to equate payment withfamily have their allowance indexed duction forgone by the parent.

Tonight I would like to speak about another person who was buried today in Sydney, Mrs Elizabeth Healy, a great worker for the Austoday tralian Labor Party. She was 99 years of age and would have been 100 in June 1978. She member of the Labor Party for approximately 75 years and was known as Ma in the suburbs of Pyrmont and Ultimo. She was Treasurer of the Sydney Federal Electorate Council. She held all positions in the Council and was a delegate State and Federal councils. She had lived in Pyrcare mont for 80 years and she died in the house which she had Uved for so long. She had six chUhealth dren. She lost her husband in 1937; yet she ried on her life for another 40 years, helped her children. She lived with her daughter AUie for approximately 25 years. Mr Armitage- A grand old lady.",66
123,Mr LES MCMAHON,ADJOURNMENT,"That is right, and the honourable member for Chifley knew her. She could be classed as the unsung hero of the Utde people. She helped many members of the FedShe eral and State parUaments and of local councUs. Some of the members she helped to elect to Pardaughter: Uament were Dan Minogue, a former member of 'Not the House of Representatives for West Sydney; Jim Cope, the former Speaker and member for Watson and Sydney; the late Eddie Ward, the former member for East Sydney; John Beasley, the former member for West Sydney; and Senaheaven tor John Armstrong from New South Wales. She told me a few months ago that she fell out with one person, BUly Hughes, because they differed in their views on conscription. She was almost expired. put in gaol over it; but when she said to the policeman who grabbed her ' I know your ing Mr father', he replied 'WUl you she was not put in gaol. She helped many State members of the Party such as Pat HUls, the former Lord Mayor and now the State member for PhUUp; Albert Sloss, the member for King; former Lord Mayor Harry Jensen; former Lord Mayor John Armstrong; and former Lord Mayor Ernie O'Dea. It is difficult to believe that this great woman, who was 99 years of age, did such great things in the area in which she Uved. There was a park named after her, the Elizabeth Healy Reserve, opposite the Dunkirk Hotel which belonged to the Armstrongs. They used to caU John Armstrong 'the golden barman' because he always had a few doUars and he went pretty well in the Labor Her name was made during the time from the early 1900s through the Depression to the serSecond World War. She used to go around helping the little people, mostly the famUies and the in the area.

She not only spoke about those things but also did them. was a Mr Armitage-Sh e practised it.",66
124,Mr LES MCMAHON,ADJOURNMENT,"Sh e practised it well too. I must thank the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) tonight. Since I became a member of this to House I have tried to get domiciliary nursing for Mrs Healy. I was pleased this year that in the Minister agreed, after checking with the authorities, that, because Mrs Healy was car98 years of age and her daughter was helping by her, and because the nursing sister was visiting only once a week and could not visit twice because Mrs Healy was so well even at 98 years of age, she should receive $2 a day for domiciliary nursing care. She received this small benefit until she passed away last Saturday. I am pleased to say that Mrs Healy did not have to go to a nursing home but was looked after by her daughter. was a great woman. Last Friday mght she had a bet on the trots and afterwards said to her 'How did it go?' Her daughter repUed too well; it lost'. Mrs Healy then asked: 'Do you think it was a goer?' She was a great woman and a great member of the Labor Party. She, Uke many other women throughout Australia, because of her unselfish work must have a place in where we know she will rest in peace.",66
125,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has THOMSON (Leichhardt) (10.35)-Durleave quietly?' and notethe the last few days it has been interesting to changed attitude of the Press towards rural matters. There has been much wider and more sympathetic coverage, particularly by some newspapers, of the problems of rural Australia. For the last 5 years the media have concentrated on the noise and clamour of the cities, where most Australians Uve. As this is where their ket is, I suppose that is understandable. Recently it seems that economic writers have become more aware of and concerned with the critical importance of Australia's balance of payments. They are acknowledging that it is the great exporting industries based on the farms and mines which can solve the balance of payments problem. In these circumstances there is a ing realisation that there are major rural Australia and this is being reflected in media comment. Rural Australia is not country; it is a vitally important part of the nation. Unless it prospers, the cities will wither and die. Although a very smaU percentage of Australians work outside the towns and cities, they provide most of Australia's exports. The great metropolitan cities, the provincial cities and the country towns all depend ence on the hard work and prosperity of rural Australia and its smaU and very hard working and very efficient work force. EarUer this year I said that 75 per cent of the area of Australia was represented by only seven members in this House. Between us we represent a very large proportion of the wealth of the nation, the wealth which comes from the farms they go. and the mines. Of course, there are other members who represent rural Australia; but just not enough of us, and for the last 5 years voice has not been heard. It is not that the representatives of rural Australia have not speaking. They have been speaking, loudly and clearly; but what they have been saying has beenening neglected by a city market oriented Press. Now there are indications of a new and awareness by the media. I have always thought that the sign of a great newspaper was that could foresee and report trends and ideas ment. perhaps in advance of pubUc opinion. In the tew days a few newspapers have shown signs of greatness in their detaUed reporting of and edijust torials on the problems of rural Australia. have given understanding and sympathetic treatweek ment to the major announcements of changes pohcy affecting rural Australia which have been made in the last week by the Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser) and other senior Ministers. These have been a great advance in Government thinking. Much of the credit for these announcenition ments must go to the months of hard work by Ministers concerned and by the back benchers who represent rural areas. They have been sisted in their efforts by the responsible rural organisations. However, there is one rural organisation marwhich in my view has been irresponsible in its pubUc statements, and that is the Cattlemen's Union of Australia. I agree with many of the aims of the Cattlemen's Union, but I disapprove very strongly of its methods. It has stooped to ersonal attacks and denigrations, particularly of the onourable members representing rural areas in Queensland. One of its main targets has been my growfriend and colleague, the honourable member problems in for Capricornia (Mr Carige). another Mr King-No one has worked harder. Mr THOMSONNo one has worked harder for the cattle industry than the honourable member for Capricornia, as the honourable member for Wimmera said. In my electorate the executives of the Cattlemen's Union are my friends. I rang the Secretary tonight and told her what I for their existwas going to do.",66
126,Mr LES MCMAHON,ADJOURNMENT,What did she say? Mr THOMSONShe said: 'Good on you; go ahead'. In my area the executives of the Cattlemen's Union have been responsible and moderate. It is a greaty pity that their colleagues in Canberra and in other areas of Australia have not shared their responsible views.,67
127,Mr SHIPTON,ADJOURNMENT,"They get worse the further south there are Mr THOMSONThey do, unfortunately. our Some executives of the Cattlemen's Union have resorted to threat and have attempted to blackbeen maU members of Parliament by attacking them personally as not doing their jobs and by threatto join Australia s latest and most formless political party, the Australian Democrats, in an dramatic attempt to take away our seats. The Cattlemen's Union is claiming credit for it recent announcements made by the GovernIt claims that the visit of its executives to last the Prime Minister last Thursday was responsible for recent Government initiatives. This is not true. After discussions in the GovernThey ment's joint party room on Wednesday of last the Prime Minster made a pubUc statement in in the House foreshadowing the announcements which are now appearing. This was before mem(Mr bers of the Cattlemen's Union had seen the Prime Minister. The most significant point made by the Prime Minister was the first pubUc recogby the Government that it is the exporters, the the primary producers and the miners who bear most of the costs of protection for manufacturing asmdustry. The Prime Minister foreshadowed a policy of redressing the balance by compensating rural industries for the heavy costs caused by the high level of protection for Australian manufacturing industries. I hope that my city colleagues will see any assistance which ts given to rural Australia in that Ught and wiU join the growing numbers",67
128,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,68
129,Mr ARMITAGE,ADJOURNMENT,"I ask that the Minister for Posts and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) table aU documents relating to the matter of radio Ucences for the outer western suburbs of Sydney. This request was made by Senator Douglas MCCleUand in another place in a question on notice, No. 323. The Minister refused the request because he has something to hide. I also ask that there be a fuU pubUc mquiry into this matter because this scandal cannot be swept under the carpet indefinitely. Let us have a look at a Utde of the history of this matter. First of aU the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal inquired into which company should receive a Ucence for a radio station for the outer western and north-western suburbs of Sydney. The result was that the Tribunal recommended to the Minister that the licence be awarded to Prospect Broadcasters Pty Ltd. Before the Ucence was awarded Metro-Western Broadcasters Ltd, one of the other appUcants, took out an injunction in the High Court to restrain the Minister from awarding the Ucence. The principal of Metro-Western Broadcasters Ltd is Harold Cottee, a federal councUlor of the Liberal Party of Australia, president of the Mitchell Federal Electorate Conference of the Liberal Party, a member of the Castle Hill branch of the Liberal Party and, furthermore, he was chairman of the Liberal Party of Australia Selection Committee when Max Ruddock, who was the State member for the HUls electorate, died. On IS March that injunction was due to come before the High Court to be heard. It is obvious that the Minister received legal advice that Cottee's injunction would not stand the test of the court so, on 10 March, the Minister rejected die decision of the Broadcasting Tribunal. In other words, he circumvented the High Court. After that we find that radio station 2KA, Katoomba, asked for permission to alter the strength of the station and to move its aerial so that it could then beam across the outer western suburbs of Sydney. That matter went to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal last week. Who was the person who sat taking notes throughout the whole proceedings? It was none other than Mr Cottee. After the hearing the Tribunal reserved its decision. Yet we find that last Saturday in an advertisement in the Australian the Minister called for fresh appUcations for a radio station for the outer western suburbs of Sydney. In other words, not only did the Minister seek to circumvent a decision of the High Court of Australia but also he sought to circumvent a decision of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal.",68
130,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,It sounds like a Watergate.,68
131,Mr ARMITAGE,ADJOURNMENT,"It does indeed. It should also be known that the week before last the president of the Parramatta Chamber of Commerce, Mr Rock Davis- I understand he is also connected with the Liberal Party-cam e to see the Minister. I ask honourable members to keep in mind that the week before last the Minister told Mr Davis that he, the Minister, would be calling appUcations for another Ucence. Mr Davis was able to go back to Parramatta before any advertisement had been lodged in the Press and tell people in Parramatta-of course, this came to my ears-that the fact was that an application for a Ucence was to be called. When we see this situation is it any wonder that I say once again that there must be a full and open inquiry into this matter. The Minister must table all the related documents. He must reaUse that he can no longer evade the issue. He was asked to come in here tonight. He is not here because he wants to evade answering. He must be made to reaUse he can no longer keep on sweeping this scandal under the carpet.",68
132,Mr DONALD CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"My comments will be more temperate than those of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage). I assure him that the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) holds no fear of anything which the previous speaker may have said. On 18 August I made a speech during the adjournment debate.",68
133,Mr HAYDEN,ADJOURNMENT,"No one else can sound like the honourable member for Griffith. I thought he had spoken before. He sounds Uke a chemical interaction. He is chemicaUy charged again, fermenting on the back benches.",68
134,Mr DONALD CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"At least I am not rotting in Umbo. That interruption was most uncalled for but that is the tendency of the honourable member for Oxley who aspires to be leader-irrational , erratic and unpredictable-of his party. But I put that aside. As I was about to say, on 18 August I spoke in the House about how the Commonwealth Government was not caring for the graves of deceased Prime Ministers. I speak tonight for the sake of the record and so that I might have the opportunity to thank the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Withers, for the manner in which he has responded to my detailed request for attention to be given to the neglected graves. The Minister has agreed that the Government will, subject to the availability of funds and the agreement of the families, accept full responsibility for the maintenance of the graves and, where appropriate and necessary, erect suitable plaques. A reference to Hansard of 18 August will show that a number of these graves are virtually unmarked. I am pleased to relate that this situauon will be rectified. The Minister has further assured me that because of the worn away wording on the gravestone of our first Prime Minister, Sir Edmund Barton, that stone will be re-engraved. He further informed me that the plaques which will be erected will bear the nation's coat of arms and mention that the remains are those of a former Prime Minister. The plaque will bear the dates that that person served as Prime Minister, et cetera. The Minister has assured me that a cairn and plaque will be erected eventually at Portsea explaining the significance of the plaque recording Harold Holt's tragic death. The present plaque is visible only low tide. Mr Bourchier-Goo d Lord!",68
135,Mr DONALD CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"As the Whip has form said, good Lord. The Minister has also assured me that in the case of Stanley whose ashes were spread across Lake Burley Griffin in 1967, a cairn will be erected beside Lake Burley Griffin with a plaque recording fact that that Prime Minister s remains were placed in the lake as hisfinalwish. Andrew Fisher, a great Labor man and a Prime Minister from Queensland, and Sir ing George Reid are the only two Prime Ministers out of the 15 deceased who are buried overseas. The Minister has agreed that their relatives will be contacted and, if they are in agreement and if there are no problems in the United Kingdom relation to reburial in Australia, their remains will be brought home to the land that they once led. I conclude where I commenced, and that by thanking the Minister for having been responthat sive and for having displayed sensitivity to a delicate subject. I beheve that the decision will be to the ultimate satisfaction of the nation.",69
136,Mr HAYDEN,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Deputy the Speaker, I wish to raise a matter for a constituent of mine who has approached me some concern. The concern arises as a result of an experience this constituent had with Voca Communications Pty Ltd which supplies Voca answering machines. I contacted the instrumentality, Telecom Australia, on behalf of the constituent but obtained no satisfaction. The complaint very simply is this: The constituent purchased a second-hand telephone answering machine. If I recall the circumstances accurately, the cost was of the order of $300. To have the machine's installation authorised it was necessary for the constituent, at the direction of Telecom Australia, to have a form completed by the firm which supplied the machine-Voc a Communications Pty Ltd. The cost of having this check carried out was $27.50. My constituent assures me that the machine was in first rate operating condition; it was a reasonably new machine. There could be no justification for such an expensive charge for what was no more than a cursory check of the instrument. The constituent subsequently noted in one of the daily newspapers an advertisement that a telephone answenng machine, the product of another firm, was for sale. The constituent contacted the advertiser, a telephone number having been listed in the advertisement. The advertiser advised my constituent that following the apat pearance of the advertisement thefirmsupplying this brand of machine, which I am told is a Plessey, contacted the advertiser and told him that the machine would have to be sold to it or no would be supplied clearing the machine for installation and operation, as required by Melbourne Bruce, Telecom Australia. It seems to me that an undesirable traffic is the developing in relation to the installation of second-hand telephone answering machines. It would seem to me, on the face of it, that firms associated with the sale of these machines are able to make a handy, profitable income by makwhat seems to me a fairly expensive charge for checking machines which, on the basis of what I have been told, are mainly infirstrate working order. I do not know and cannot understand why it is necessary for this sort of detaUed in check to be made. I would have thought that Telecom Australia would have been capable of establishing whether a machine was in working is order. In any event, I should not have thought the machine would have caused any probvery lems for the general telephone service. Accordingly I would have thought that the purchasers of such second-hand machines would find that if machines did not work satisfactorily it would be necessary to have appropriate maintenance and expressed work carried out. So in some desperation and with some sense of frustration I am raising this matter in the Parhament on behalf of the constituent who contacted me and no doubt on behalf of quite a number of other people who have had a similar experience. I have consciously understated some of the feelings that I have on this matter but I will certainly take the opportunity of raising the matter again and in much tougher language unless it is clarified and an easier and more reasonable arrangement is provided for the people. Mr Donald Cameron-Why did you not check it out.",69
137,Mr HAYDEN,ADJOURNMENT,I know that the honourable member for Griffith is always a reliable lap dog for business interests in the community and rarely defends the interests of people like my constituents who have been grievously disadvantaged by this sort of experience. He displays that tonight. Mr Donald Cameron- I raise a point of order. Is it in order for the honourable member for Oxley to make accusations although he admits he has not had a chance to check out those accusations?,70
138,Mr HAYDEN,ADJOURNMENT,Everyon e in his own party says that,70
139,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member for Oxley knows perfectly well that it would be better if he had not used that remark.,70
140,Mr RUDDOCK,ADJOURNMENT, I rise tonight in this debate to reply in part to some comments made by the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage) in relation to the proposals for a radio station for the western suburbs of Sydney. I wishfirstof all to say how much I welcome the decision of the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) to call for fresh appUcations for a radio licence that will be avaUable to serve the western suburbs of Sydney. I welcome the decision particularly after the statements that have been made by the honourable member for Chifley and by others who have doubted the sincerity of this Government in pursuing the interests of the people generally in the western suburbs who need this specialised service that will be offered to the district as a result of the decision and as a result of the inquiries that will undoubtedly be undertaken. Mr Armitage- I raise a point of order. The tenor of the honourable member's speech is such that it is obvious he too is involved in this scandal.,70
141,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,There is no point of order and the honourable member knows there is no point of order.,70
142,Mr RUDDOCK,ADJOURNMENT,"I deplore the invective of the honourable member opposite because, quite frankly, I believe he is domg what he has done tonight with a very sinister motive in mind and it is to take away the obvious benefit that wiU derive to the western suburbs from this decision and to confuse the matter in the minds of the people by creating a smokescreen of allegation and innuendo. That is what he seeks to do. He comes into this place and makes these extravagant claims and extravagant statements solely for the purpose of distracting attention from the very virtue of this decision that will do so much to further the interests of people in the western suburbs of Sydney. He uses the privUege that he has as a member of this House to make untruthful allegations about people. Mr Armitage-Such as!",70
143,Mr RUDDOCK,ADJOURNMENT,"For instance the statement that I knowfirsthand is incorrect, that Mr Cottee was the gentleman who chaired the preselection committee of the Liberal Party to choose a successor to my late father. That allegation is factually incorrect. The chairman of the preselection committees of the Liberal Party happens to be, in every case, the President of the Liberal Party in New South Wales or his nominee, and that happened to be the case in the preselection committee to select Fred Caterson, MLA. The fact is that the honourable member made an allegation-which he could have checked-whic h was factually incorrect. If one were to go through all the other tissues of information that the honourable member purported to give here tonight I imagine one wouldfindthat they are equally factually incorrect. If the honourable member looks at each of the parties involved in previous applications he will find people on both sides of politics were involved.",70
