To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House deterioration of Representatives assembled, the petition of the undermaintenance signed citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the delays between announcements of each quarterly movement in the Consumer Price Index and cation as a percentage increase in age and invaUd pensions is excessive, unnecessary, discriminatory and a cause of economic distress to pensioners.

To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the of Representatives in Parliament assembled. petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the existence of a system of double taxation of perthe sonal incomes whereby both the Australian Government of and State Governments had the power to vary personal income taxes would mean that taxpayers who worked in more than one State in any year would: (a) be faced with compUcated variations in his or her personal income taxes between States; and (b) find that real after-tax vary from State to State even when gross wages were advertised as being the same; and (c) require citizens to maintain records of income earned in each State.

3,Mr NEIL,NOTICES OF MOTION,"I give notice that the next day of sitting, I shall move: 1. That the House notes that 90 prominent American nam war protesters, including folksinger Joan Baez, Allan Ginsberg and imprisoned draft resister James have signed a petition presented to namese observer to the United Nations condemning the Vietnamese Government for grave abuses of civil liberties, suppression of free speech, grievous and systematic violation of humanrights,fillingof prisons with civilians accused of holding certain religious of an esumated 300 000 people in so-called re-educationis camps, suppression of cultural and polictical expression, stifling of non-violent dissent. 2. That there has been a deafening silence from Australian anti-war protestors, including members of the Parliamentary Labor Party,regardingthese abuses and the wholesale slaughter of innocent people in Cambodia. 3. The House therefore condemns the abuses and atrocities perpetrated by the Vietnamese and Cambodian governments. Trade Union Funds",15
4,Mr BOURCHIER,NOTICES OF MOTION,"I give notice that on general business Thursday No. 3,I shall move: That a full inquiry be undertaken into the use of trade union funds for political elections and that such inquiiy should inquire into: 1. The circumstances of contributions made by the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union to the Australian Labor Party campaign for the 1972 elections; 2. whether an opportunity is given to each individual unionist to decide whether of his or her union fee shall go to a particular Party; 3. how many unionists covered by unions registered in the Federal jurisdiction have been able to avail themselves of this right, and 4. has this right been brought to the notice of each individual unionist. Public Libraries NA NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-Has the Prime Minisand ter reiterated to President Carter the views on the upon local Indian Ocean which he expressed to President that Ford, in particular his view that it was unreal to of believe that the Indian Ocean could be a neutral And your zone? Does he now agree with the view of the President, expressed at his news conference a few hours ago, that the Indian Ocean should be transformed into a zone of peace free from nuclear weapons? Does he support the President's suggestion to the Soviet Union that the superpowers should agree to demilitarising the Indian Ocean? Will the Government now reconsider its attitude towards the proposed zone of on peace, freedom and neutrality which has been proposed and supported by the littoral countries Vietof the South East Asian and Indian Ocean areas, poet by the United Nations and at the last CommonForrest wealth Heads of Government meeting, but not the permanent Vietby his Government?",15
5,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INDIAN OCEAN,"I thank the only honourable gentleman for his question. I think it and ideological beliefs, detention worth noting that the view that the Governand ment has stated in relation to the Indian Ocean has been consistent, and it is a view that the Government does not alter. The Government has stated that it beUeves there ought to be a balance in the Indian Ocean but that it should be at as low a level as is possible. In the joint communique that was issued with President Suharto we made it quite plain that, pending achievement of the zone of peace which many people hope can be achieved, there ought to be a balance but that again it should be at as low a level as possible. That is the consistent view that the Government has expressed. The Government has opposed the philosophy which would have aUowed the navies and forces of one nation to dominate the Indian Ocean, whUe at the same time discouraging the forces of the United States, which are the only ones that can provide a balance in that area. Therefore we have encouraged balance. The Opposition has encouraged a situation which would have helped to persuade the United States not to be involved, not to rehe or she desires that part political inforce its capacities at Diego Garcia, and therefore it has encouraged a situation which would have left the Indian Ocean to the Soviet Union alone. That is a poticy which this Government will always oppose. If President Carter can be successful in persuading the Soviet Union to take in extensive naval facUities out of the Indian Ocean and to dismantle the very extensive, highly sophisticated and dangerous facilities at Berbera, this Government will be greatly pleased. NA",15
6,Mr BUNGEY,INCOME EQUALISATION DEPOSIT,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. How much has been deposited to date under the income equalisation deposit scheme? Does the Treasurer believe that the scheme is working well? In particular, do trends to date indicate that the scheme is being used by genuine fanners endeavouring to stabilise their incomes and that the scheme is not being used solely by so-called Pitt Street farmers?",16
7,Mr LYNCH,INCOME EQUALISATION DEPOSIT,"I certainly can agree with my colleague, the honourable member for Canning, both as to the objectives of the scheme and as to the successful form in which that scheme has been implemented. It is meeting a genuine need and is doing so in a most effective way. As I have mentioned, the new system already has proved to be highly successful. An amount of $31.3m in deposits was lodged as at the end of January in order to qualify for deduction in 1975-76 income tax assessments. I take the opportunity to advise the House of the detaUs of deposits lodged in each State. They were as foUows: In New South Wales $8.8m, in Western Australia $7.9m, in Queensland $6.5m, in Victoria $5.3m, in South Australia $2.6m and hi Tasmania $95,000. The scheme provides farmers with a highly satisfactory method of avoiding the effects of fluctuating incomes in relation to their tax UabUities. The Government is confident that the scheme will make a very important contribution to the stabUity and prosperity of the rural sector as a whole. I am glad the honourable gentleman raised the point. NA",16
8,Mr UREN,HOUSING CONSTRUCTION FINANCE,"I ask the Treasurer In view of the figures released yesterday showing a marked decline in lending for January by permanent buUding societies- a decline of 12.7 per cent over December and of 21.4 per cent over the previous January-at a time when buUding societies have ample funds, can the Treasurer explain the logic behind the Government's direction under which the Reserve Bank has asked the permanent buUding societies to restrict lending? Can the Treasurer explain also the logic behind this attack on the dwelling construction industry, which has been one of the few industries showing genuine growth?",16
9,Mr LYNCH,HOUSING CONSTRUCTION FINANCE,"I find it ironic that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition should raise in this House a question on housing. The problems of the housing industry, both dwelUng and nondwelling, can be sheeted home very significantly to the stop-go poUcies of the former administraSCHEME tion-to its programs which fueled wage increases, which fed into costs and therefore into the price spiral in relation to aU sectors of the housing industry. The industry was in very bad shape when this Government came into office. It is now a healthy industry. I am quite happy toMrUren-Ha!",16
10,Mr LYNCH,HOUSING CONSTRUCTION FINANCE,"The honourable gentleman seeks to take issue with that point. Five key facts indicate that the housing industry has been growing and that activity will remain at a satisfactory level. First of all, real private investment in dwelUngs in the 6 months to last September was at a rate 27 per cent higher than in the previous year. Secondly, total dwelling approvals for the 3 months to January were running at a seasonaUy adjusted annual rate of 154 000, compared with 147 600 in the same period last year. Thirdly, total dwelling commencements, seasonally adjusted, in the December quarter were mnning at an annual rate of 148 800, compared with 133 600 a year earUer. Fourthly, total dwelling completions in the December quarter were at a rate 10 per cent higher than in the same quarter of 1975. Fifthly, lending for housing has been rising steadUy from the somewhat restrained levels experienced around the middle of 1975. Bank lending has been fairly stable. The recent figures, to which the honourable gentleman referred, do show a flattening out process in the buUding society area. That does not represent a warning signal for the Government. The situation is subject to the closest monitoring with the Reserve Bank. The honourable gentleman ought well to understand that flow of funds is no total answer to the problems in the housing field, whether those moneys are going into the private banking system or are feeding into the buUding societies. The honourable entleman should have regard to some of the tates in which an overheating in relation to buUding has been emerging. I reaffirm that the position is being watched closely. I say again to the honourable gentleman that we are emerging from the situation which his own administration created. So far as overaU monetary poUcy is concerned, whether for the housing industry or for the non-housing industry throughout the country, the Government's pohcy is to ensure that there is adequate capacity and Uquidity to underwrite economic recovery but not at the same time to be accorrimodating to an increased rate of inflation. IMMIGRATION: INCREASED INTAKE",16
11,Mr SAINSBURY,HOUSING CONSTRUCTION FINANCE,Is the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs aware of newspaper reports recently that his Department is considering recommending an increase in immigration to Australia from 70 000 to 100 000 next year? Would such an increase lead to an increase in demand for goods and services in the Australian economy?,17
12,Mr MACKELLAR,HOUSING CONSTRUCTION FINANCE,"Yes , I am aware of newspaper reports to the effect that my Department is suggesting an increase in the immigration intake to 100 000 in the next year. There is no truth in the reports. At this stage the Department is working on its forward estimates. These, of course, will be discussed with other relevant departments and with the Australian Population and Immigration Council before a submission is put to Cabinet. I will not anticipate what the intake involved will be or what the Cabinet response will be. NA",17
13,Dr JENKEMS,AUSTRALIAN URANIUM INDUSTRY,"I direct my question to the PSI-Populatio Minister for Environment, Housing and Coma munity Development. Last year, the Minister said in this House that his Government would take decisions on the further development of Australian uranium industry in the Ught of pubUc discussion and of debate in the national ParUaister ment. In view of this statement, what action is Department, or any Government department, taking to further pubUc debate and discussion the uranium industry?",17
14,Mr NEWMAN,AUSTRALIAN URANIUM INDUSTRY,Let me sayfirstof aU that the given Government is still maintaining the position which was expressed very clearly last year.,17
15,Mr UREN,AUSTRALIAN URANIUM INDUSTRY,When will the report be avaUable?,17
16,Mr NEWMAN,AUSTRALIAN URANIUM INDUSTRY,"To that end 7000 copies of the the First Report of the Ranger Environmental out Inquiry are avaUable through aU Commonits own risk. wealth Government publication offices in Australia. I am told that, as of recently copies are in adequate supply and that 7000 copies should meet the requirement. If that requirement cannot be met by that number, we will be happy to look at the demand and, if necessary, increase supply. I agree that the matter of pubhc debate an important element in what is happening between the release of the First Ranger report and the release of the second Ranger report. that end, my Department has, under my orders, set up a task force. We are monitoring that desidised bate. I get regularly reports on what is said in pubUc debate. We have even gone to the extent of sending some of my staff to some of the more important pubhc arenas to hear what is being said. We will continue to monitor that debate. When the Second Report of the Ranger inquiry is presented the Government wiU have put in front of it what has been said in the pubUc debate. AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY: NA",17
17,Mr BOURCHIER,FREE STANDING ABORTION CLINICS,"My question is directed to the Mmister for Health. In view of reports that the Capital Territory Health Commission has no powers to control the estabUshment and conduct of free standing abortion clinics in the Australian Capital Territory, what action can the Minister take to ensure that the activities of such cUnics are subject to public scrutiny?",17
18,Mr HUNT,FREE STANDING ABORTION CLINICS,"In view of the fact that no powers are avaUable to the Capital Territory Health Commission to prevent the estabUshment of abortion clinics in Canberra, I have asked the Commissioner of the Capital Territory Health Commission to confer with the principals of n Services International, which is strange name for such an organisation-and to advise them to defer the opemng of the abortion clinic until all the health and legal aspects have the been given full consideration. I have had discussions with the Attorney-General and the Minfor the Capital Territory about this matter. his As this issue has far-reaching social consequences for the people of the Australian Capital on Territory, I feel it should be discussed and debated by the elected members of the Legislative Assembly in Canberra. Until sufficient ume is to enable these matters to be appropriately debated by people at the local level and all the health and legal aspects are given appropriate consideration, PSI would be very wise to defer opening of its clinic If it does go ahead withthese things being done, it could well do so at NA NA",17
19,Mr COHEN,BENEFIT,"I ask a question of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. In the view of thereportedcomments of Government is back benchers that people should work for their now unemployment benefit, has he further considered the question I asked him late last year in To which I suggested that new- I emphasise the word 'new'-loca l government works be subup to 25 per cent of the total cost? The the Minister will recall that I recommended 25 per cent as I believed this would be the amount of money saved through unemployment benefit.",17
20,Mr SPEAKER,BENEFIT,Order! The honourable gentleman is now giving information. I ask him to ask his question.,18
21,Mr COHEN,BENEFIT,"If thisfigureis correct, possible objection can the Government have to the provision of funds to local government if will mean simply a transfer of expenditure from one government department to another?",18
22,Mr STREET,BENEFIT,"Yes, I do remember the honourable member's question last year. Invesdiffering tigations by my Department indicate that the gross cost of employment creation schemes reduced by approximately 25 per cent due savings in unemployment benefit and increased tax receipts. Employment creation schemes deal only with the symptons of the unemployment ing problem in Australia and not with its causes. The basic causes of our high unemployment record rate of inflation caused by the the previous Government and the excessively high wage level, with people pricing themselves out of jobs. This Government, unlike cessor, is tackling the problems as itsfirstpriority. One area of great concern has been the level of government spending. It reached record levels and record rates of increase under the vious Government, which resulted in record levels of budget deficit. Even if the cost of ployment creation schemes is reduced by the per cent that I mentioned a moment ago due factors such as savings in unemployment benefit and increases in tax, such schemes are extremely expensive. No way has yet been found in which such schemes would not add to the budget deficit that I mentioned a moment ago. We, unlike previous Government, are attacking not only the basic causes-that is, inflation and the ively high wage level which were not tackled the previous Government-bu t also in relation the problems that these cause we have directed our programs to specific groups in the munity who arefindingspecial difficulties. I mention the expansion of the National Employdivided. ment and Training scheme which now has some organisations 14 000 people under training, the great majority proposal but so of them in productive employment, I emphasise; the special youth training programs that we have introduced; the incentives to employers through the Commonwealth Rebate Apprenticeship Full Time Training system; the Community Youth have Support Service scheme which now has some projects going throughout Australia, involving over 12 000 young people, keeping them motivated towards work, with a sense of purpose in Ufe. We, unlike the previous Government, are attacking the basic causes while at the same time offering contructive programs to those who are particularly affected. MEAT INDUSTRY: MARKETING NA what Mr IAN ROBINSON-My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industry. Has it the Government given further consideration to a restructuring of the meat marketing procedures in the Ught of disabiUties which currently exist to the disadvantage of cattle producers? Have ideas and suggestions delayed the implementation of the Minister's intention to is reconstitute the Australian Meat Board, which to he announced last year? WUl the Minister now take urgent action to implement reconstitution of the Meat Board and the restructuring of marketfor the benefit of aU sections of the beef production, processing and marketing industries, as are the well as the national economy? poUcies Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honourable gentleman is now providing information. I call its predethe Minister for Primary Industry.",18
23,Mr SINCLAIR,PROCEDURES,"Since the Government came to office one of the rural sectors that have concerned it greatly has been the beef cattle sector. preThere were obvious marketing difficulties. To overcome these we felt that there might be emreason to look at the efficacy of the Australian 25 Meat Board. I have received quite a number of to submissions from different organisations suggesting that it was perhaps from the present powers, structure and constitution of the Board that some of the disabiUties in meat marketing flowed. I therefore developed a paper, which the was a discussion paper and no more, for the industry to see whether a body which I suggested excessmight be termed an Australian meat and by Uvestock corporation might be able to improve to our overaU marketing capabUity and ensure a greater access and price return to Australian procomducers across the world market scene. Unfortunately the industry itself is incredibly Not only is each of the producer differing in its attitude towards this too are the meat exporters. The individual meat exporters are not unanimous. The big exporters want one sort of body and the smaU exporters want another. The consumers a different attitude again and the unions also have some variation of the proposal as put 60 forward. In those circumstances it has been extraordinarily difficult to make recommendations to the Government. Nonetheless, I believe that there is some advantage in looking at the efficacy of the Australian Meat Board. I am in the process of subletting to the Government recommendations for a new body. In the meantime, however, I would like to say to the cattle producers that the Australian Meat Board is a body constituted with a producer majority. Its powers are prescribed by statute so that it can operate to improve the returns to growers and to ensure that growers' voices are heard by all sectors of the industry to maximise their returns. I beheve that the Meat Board has done a very good job over the last 6 months in incredibly difficult circumstances. It has been able to broaden access to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, for example. It was a Meat Board initiative that first gained access for boneless frozen boxes to the USSR. This is a different form of packaging and a different form of product from any sold previously. As a result we have had very satisfactory sales of beef to the USSR. So within the Meat Board there is a capacity to improve access. The one real deficiency at the moment that concerns us",18
24,Mr SPEAKER,PROCEDURES,Order! There is too much audible conversation. I ask the Minister to draw his answer to a conclusion.,19
25,Mr SINCLAIR,PROCEDURES,There is too great a margin between prices being received by the producer and prices being received by the exporter. It is in that area that I believe the Australian Meat Board may well be able to take action untU such stage as this Government decides on whether there will be a new body to replace it. MEAT INDUSTRY: BEEF CATTLE NA,19
26,Mr WALLIS,PRODUCERS,"I direct my question to the Minister for Overseas Trade. Does the Minister's advice to beef cattle producers that they withhold stock from the market to force up beef prices mean that he now admits that the beef exporting companies can pay higher prices for slaughter cattle? Does he also agree that the beneficiaries of the removal of the beef export levy were the exporting companies and not the beef catde producers? Further, in view of the fact that the Minister for Overseas Trade, supported by the now Prime Mmister, pubUcly urged cattle producers to increase cattle numbers, will he now accept responsibUity for the over supply situation that exists and is this the reason for his now",19
27,Mr SPEAKER,PRODUCERS,Order! The honourable member's question is far too long. He has posed the point he wants to make. I call the Deputy Prime Minister. Mr Wallis-On e more sentence.,19
28,Mr YOUNG,PRODUCERS,Iriseto order. The Minister for Primary Industry just gave us a 6-minute speech in respect of the beef industry. It does not seem to me that the honourable member for Grey has been speaking for very long. Obviously there are many questions to be asked about this industry. The Minister rambled on,19
29,Mr SPEAKER,PRODUCERS,There is no point of order. I call the Deputy Prime Minister. Mr Wallis- I have one sentence to complete my question.,19
30,Mr SPEAKER,PRODUCERS,I have ruled on this matter. The honourable gentleman will resume his seat.,19
31,Mr ANTHONY,PRODUCERS,"I think the honourable member's questions give me ample scope to give him a reply. First, the honourable member referred to a statement. I released on Sunday night recommending to beef producers throughout the nation that they reduce the number of cattle they are sending to the sale yards for slaughter. This statement was based on information that I have been able to accumulate showing quite clearly that the exporters can pay a higher price than they are paying at the moment for cattle. With devaluation and increased prices for meat sales as well as the prospect of increased markets over the next 12 months, they will clearly be enabled to pay at least $10 to $20 a head more than they are paying at the moment. Some people have remarked that my statement was improper. In fact some even went so far to say that it was immoral because an increase would put up the price of meat for the consumers. If anything is immoral it is people who do not want to see cattle producers getting a higher price than they are getting now. Today housewives pay for meat a price which is basically the cost of transport, slaughtering, dulling and retailing. The cattleman gets virtually nothing. The only way he can get a higher price is for the price in the store to go up. An increase of $20 per head would mean to the consumers about a lc to 2c per lb increase in the price. Yet there are people who are so selfish that they do not want to see this industry, which is in a near bankrupt situation, get any improvement. I have even seen articles in some of the newspapers saying that the increase I have suggested would have a considerable effect on the consumer price index. A lc to 2c per lb increase in the price of meat would cause an increase of one-fifth of one per cent. People ought to consider what would be the impact of some of the other increases.",19
32,Mr SPEAKER,PRODUCERS,Order! There is too much noise in the chamber. I call upon the right honourable gentleman to draw his answer to a conclusion.,19
33,Mr ANTHONY,PRODUCERS,"The consumers and the the pubhc at large should realise that between 1972 and 1976 the costs of killing, dressing and ery to the chillers increased by 102 per cent. During the same period the price received for catde dropped by SO per cent. If there is any complaint to be made it is about the huge increase in slaughtering and other costs in the industry. Wages are certainly a major consideration. hope people, espeaally the consumers, do think they will not have to pay for increased wages by paying more for their meat, because they will have to pay. That is one of the reasons why we have been so concerned about the rapid increase in wages over the last few years. honourable member for Grey referred to",20
34,Mr BRYANT,PRODUCERS,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. A few moments ago you requested right honourable gentleman to finalise his answer. He has not done so. When you requested the honourable member for Grey to finalise his question and he did not do so you forced him to sit down. I think the same rule ought to apply the right honourable gentleman.",20
35,Mr SPEAKER,PRODUCERS,The Standing Orders permit me to bring a question to an end when it is long. The Standing Orders do not permit me to bring an answer to an end when it is too long.,20
36,Mr SCHOLES,PRODUCERS,"Mr Speaker, I rise to order. an earUer occasion when ruling against the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith in relation to a question you took the view that Uteral meaning of standing order 144 and the eral meaning of standing order 145 should be suggested. read together. You ruled certain sections of a question out of order on the basis of something standing order 144.I ask: Does your ruling now mean that you do not uphold that earUer ruling?",20
37,Mr SPEAKER,PRODUCERS,"Order! The honourable repUes. gentleman has no substance in his point of Furthermore, he has misunderstood the ruling earUer gave.",20
38,Mr ANTHONY,PRODUCERS,I believe there is some sigto nificance to be registered in the Opposition's ing continuing points of order on a matter which is of grave concern to one of the largest industries in Australia-the cattle producing industry. It is in such a serious state that I would that Opposition members would have been reasonable enough to listen to the points that I have been making.,20

41,Mr SPEAKER,PRODUCERS,Order! The House will come to order. I call upon the Deputy Prime Minister the to bring his answer to a conclusion.,20
42,Mr ANTHONY,PRODUCERS,"The point I wish to make is that if the very poor circumstances of the beef industry continue and cattle producers are forced to to sell their breeding stock as evidenced by the large numbers of cows and heifers that are coming into the yards at present the Australian herd will be significantly reduced and the ultimate too consequence will be that the consumers wiU have to pay considerably more. What we want in this country is a stable industry. If there is to be fairness then producers should at least get a reasonOn able share of the sales being made overseas. We are concerned that the exporters are not paying producers enough. If producers could marginaUy the reduce the number of stock going into the yards Utthere would be the improvement that I have Mr Martin- I raise a point of order.

Has the Government taken any action to seek the views of other CommonNational wealth Heads as to dissociating themselves from the regime of President Amin of Uganda? In view of President Amin's repeated assertions that he will attend the Commonwealth Heads Government Meeting, has the Government taken any action to dissuade him from attending?",20
44,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,AMIN,"The Foreign into Minister has made the Government's view very clearly and, I believe, forcefully known in relaJanuary tion to matters that have occurred in Uganda recent times. There is nothing that I would wish to add to that. The view is expressed in clear forceful terms and quite obviously that view stands. I have been advised that the British Government has just appointed a special envoy to consult with other Commonwealth countries concerning the Commonwealth Heads of the Government Meeting to be held in June and have been in contact with the United Kingdom Prime Minister over this particular matter. would not want to go into it in further detail the moment but obviously any communication complicated that I would have had was against a background of the pubUcly expressed view which has been year. made clearly known by the Foreign Minister. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam- I ask a question of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. announcing in Suva S months ago that traUan Government would commit $ 15m in bilateral aid to the countries of the South Pacific for the currentfinancialyear, and larger amounts in succeeding years, and that it would make special provision of $500,000 2 years to assist non-government organisations with the cost of development programs in the South Pacific. Is it a fact as has been reported that he has now informed the Australian Council for Overseas Aid that the aUocation to countries has been reduced for this year the special provision for the voluntary agencies has been cancelled for this year? If so, he inform the recipient governments and organisations of this decision? Also, what amount of aid will in fact now be made avaUable to the governments in thisfinancialyear?  sition refers to the extensive aid program that I announced last year in Suva, which was a gram of $60m running over 3 financial years. That amount is an increase of 300 per cent over the 3-year program approved by his Party in government. It is the most significant increase in any of our aid programs since Country Parties came to government. In regard to the assistance being rendered to the voluntary agencies, I have taken a decision that the same amount of money will flow to them as of announced but because the majority of those agencies operate on a calendar year basis and not on afinancialyear basis I am allocating $300,000 of the $500,000 from July of this year through until June of next year, to be divided $150,000 between July and the end of this calendar year and a further $150,000 between and the end of June next calendar year. in The remaining $200,000 of the $500,000 referred to by the Leader of the Opposition will and be allocated for thefirstpart of the succeeding calendar year-in other words, the latter part of the nextfinancialyear. So the amount stands. Thefirsthalf of the $300,000 allocation will be paid this calendar year from July to December, second half will be paid from January to June I next year, and the remaining $200,000 of the $500,000 will be allocated in the latter part of the I financial year 1978-79, namely, thefirstpart of at the calendar year 1979.

If there is frequently one area of short fall in government expenditure it is in regard to aid programs because although we can offer it, it cannot always be taken up either for lack of manpower or for lack of expertise in particular areas.

48,Mr BRADFIELD,ECONOMY,"My question is directed to me Mr the Treasurer. Will he assure all no credit squeeze is planned? What restrictions are currently applied by the Reserve Bank to Austrahan trading banks andfinancialinstitu Mr tions? Will the Government be monitoring closely the uquidity of trading banks during remainder of thefinancialyear 1976-77, when large amounts of funds will drain from their posits for the purpose of taxation payments?",22
49,Mr LYNCH,ECONOMY,"I thank the honourable gentleman for the question. As I have said before, I rule out completely that there is any form of credit squeeze planned as part of this Government's policy. With regard to the restrictions mentioned by the honourable member I would mention general guidelines for bank lending, the staturaises tory reserve deposit mechanism and also the rangements under the LGS convention. I emphaFriday sise, as I did in the statement brought down in the House recently, that thefinancialmarkets better geared this year to handle the run down in liquidity than they have been for some considerproposals able period. Treasury notes which will mature between now and the end of thefinancialyear will place approximately $2 billion in private hands. The reversion of the minimum LGS ratio from 23 per cent to 18 per cent at the beginning of next month will, in effect, release more $850m to assist Australian trading banks to meet the seasonal drain on their funds. Aside from that, I mention to the honourable gentleman that savings banks have considerable volumes of funds on deposit with the Reserve Bank of Australia and the private sector holds large deproposals. posits with the banking system. Any aUegation of a credit squeeze is therefore without foundation.

54,Mr NIXON,ROADS,"The last Bureau of Roads report which was given to me and which was tabled in the House was provided in 197S.

I also advise the that the amalgamated body will indeed be Australia undertaking the normal roads needs which traditionally has been undertaken by the Bureau of Roads over the years. That will be done in consultation with local government authorities and with State government ties, as is normally the case on each occasion. Therefore all this concern that is being expressed about the amalgamation of the Bureau of Roads and the Bureau of Transport Economics, in my Nation view, is not real. In my view, the amalgamated Snows Labor' body will serve this Parliament and this nation resented. I shallI read much better than the two separate bodies. As to misrepresentation.

'He has said he fears that if the pro nuclear campaign loses momentum he and other moderates will have a difficult task in preventing the Perth conference from agreeing to a resolution banning all uranium mining.' The reference made to me by International PubUc Relations is fictitious. I have never spoken to International PubUc Relations about uranium. This is an unfortunate example of yet another pubhc relations company trafficking in specureport lation and gossip to justify the retainers them by the industry that it represents. Nation Review, however, did have the courtesy to me before pubUcation and printed my denial in the body of the story. For the information of honourable members, I never have asked any Australian company for help to lobby anyone, alone to lobby the conference of my own Party.

89,Mr INNES,LEBANESE REFUGEES,"In October 1976 I rose in this House to deplore the pUght of Lebanese refugees stranded in Nicosia and other points around the Mediterranean. Irisein March 1977, almost 5 months later, again to deplore the pUght of these benighted people and to condemn Government in the strongest terms for its attitude towards them. In the meantime the Government has compounded its guUt for the injury it memhas done to these people. Many of those of whom I spoke on the last occasion are still there. are victims of despair and hopelessness because the Government wiU not do those simple as a things which the Lebanese people in Australia cry out for it to do. Leaders of the Lebanese community in Australia know the gravity of the situation and have told me many narrowing tales of their countrymen, their relatives, who have been stuck in Nicosia for months sustained only by what Australian Lebanese are able to send them. am a The Lebanese here have had to go heavUy into debt to raise the thousands of dollars necessary I to keep their relatives in Nicosia from penury The matter was and destitution. I have recently returned from Nicosia. The proof that these stories are true is there for anyone to see. Hundreds of the hopeless can be seen mUling around the immigration office where our immigration officers do their best to cope with the mess that this Government has created. I have already outlined to the House the events of last year and I do not intend to go over that ground again. It is necessary to refer to one thing that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar) did last year which was not necessarily wrong in principle but which was disastrous in the effect that it has had in our handling of the Lebanese refugee situation. It will be remembered that the Minister relaxed the criteria to allow members of the extended family to come to Australia with maxithe mum speed and minimum discomfort. This was not a bad thing in itself but a disaster given the circumstances at the time. In thefirstplace the Minister obviously had no conception of what Lebanese regard as an extended family- a conhave cept which goes well beyond the Australian part understanding of members of the immediate dreds family circle. In the second place there were hun-cruelly dreds of people already in Nicosia and other E laces whose appUcations for entry to Australia ad not been processed. Their chances of having the applications processed were greatly diminished by the Minister's actions. The result of what the Minister did was of Lebanese into Cyprus and other places which aggravated in particular the situation in Cyprus and made the task of overworked immigration officers even more difficult. Many of the people already in Cyprus were category A immigrants, that is, mothers, fathers or dependent chUdren Lebanese people Uving in Australia. They left Lebanon and went to Cyprus and other centres on the understanding that they would be coming on to Australia once they had satisfactorily passed medical and character checks. They went to Cyprus on the understanding that they would be there for two or three weeks only before they were approved to join their famUies in Australia. Fo? many the waiting period has been three or four months and for some it has been six or seven months and more. There are now arrangements for people to go back to the immigration office Nicosia as late as 3 April this year. These have left, or sold up, their assets in Lebanon. They survive in Cyprus on what their relatives Australia are able to send them. I can produce evidence in the form of currency receipts from range of people to indicate the amount of money that has been sent. In particular one man has more than $5,000 to a relative in Cyprus. The man sending the money is not a rich man, nor his case uncommon. He is worried because, as most of us would, hefindsthe burden of supportThe ing a family here and dependants overseas an ovemhelming load to carry. Many have paid out much more. The total needed to sustain member Lebanese refugees runs into nuUions of doUars. It is true that many hundreds of category refugees-brother s and sisters and others who fall into that category of Australian Lebaneseurgency came to Australia in thefirstheady days of the relaxed entry criteria when this Government was trying to demonstrate that it had therightaptreme proach to the refugee problem. Good luck to those who came and to the relatives who sponthe sored them, but in the process many hundreds others were disappointed. Many of these people left their homes and possessions because they had faith in what this Government had led them to believe, and their faith was sadly misplaced. Of course not only the Lebanese in Australia found their faith misplaced. That is the first of this lamentable story. Hundreds and hunof people had their hopes raised only to be dashed. They face the alternatives of continuing to subsist on Cyprus against the day when the Government here will stop bungling and bring them to Australia or of being forced to return to Lebanon to bUghted and uncertain futures. The price of that bungling is the despair of the refugees and the heavyfinancialburden a flood on the Lebanese community in Australia. A second part of the story is connected with thefirstand again involves what amounts to a false pretence on the part of this Government. In the early days of relaxed criteria and the window of dressing by the Minister, many Lebanese came to Australia on the strength of quickly processed medical checkups. In case anyone thinks I am using the tragedy of the dispossessed and desolate people to make poltiical capital let me put to the House what has been put to me by members of the Lebanese community. I refer to a signed document which I will table if needs be. I sent a copy of it to the Mmister some weeks ago. I have never received a reply. It puts certain points and no reasonable, humane man could say that the members of the Lebanese community are in asking for anything excessive. They ask that impeople mediate steps be taken by the Australian Government to re-establish the Australian emin bassy in Lebanon so that aU new nominations may be dealt with from an embassy in that couna try. Due to circumstances beyond their control many people are being forced to return to that sent country because they cannot afford to stay in Cyprus. They run out of money and then return is to Lebanon without their goods and chattels. members of the Lebanese community ask that the present poUcy which excludes a total family from emigrating to Australia where one fails the medical examination be altered so that only the seriously medically unfit members may be excluded. They ask that the appUB cations of large numbers of Lebanese presently stranded in Nicosia be processed as a matter of so that those wishing to emigrate to Australia may do so immediately. The Lebanese community here regards this matter as one of exurgency, as it would reUeve the suffering of the refugees and would lift from their relatives burden of having to pay the huge cost of of supporting them in Cyprus. The Lebanese community in Australia is understandably disturbed and frustrated by the Australian response to the refugee problem. The reopening of the embassy is of the utmost importance, because clearly would help Austrahan officers to assess the appUdifference. cants on the spot. It would speed up the processof ing procedures. Major powers are now operating embassies at Beirut. The explanation I got for our embassy not being reopened was that the Canadians are not there. What has that to do with the situation? There should be no inhibition on Australia reopening its post there. There is a whole range of issues to which would Uke to refer, but it is clear that I have the time to do so. It is absolutely necessary even now the Government reinforce the staff the immigration post at Nicosia. What is the ation? The Government is now looking at staff ceiling levels. When I was at Nicosia just a fortmedical night or so ago, UteraUy hundreds of people milling around the immigration office, standing there Uke cattle, and being processed at a that was deplorable. That was staff at that post They have done a magnificent job. I have already referred to that. The man whom the Government sent to Damascus ought to have been awarded the Victoria Cross. There granted. was a faUure to take advantage of the of the opportunities there. The expectancies of E eople were raised. Yet the Government did not ave the capacity nor the machinery to handle the situation. As I have said, the staff have worked diligently and under the most difficult munity conditions to cope with the situation, which is impossible given the number of distressed Preamble refugees. I have seen the desperate situation. I once again urge the Minister to do something serious about it. There was a question of refusal on medical Cyprus. grounds. The Mmister can go to the leaders of cases the Lebanese community in Australia to check they these facts. He has probably had some contact Australia with them. They have certainly contacted and expressed their disappointment in the strongest terms. MUd heart murmurs, diabetes and a understandably host of other chronic conditions which pose threat to anyone other than the sufferer are now As given as sufficient reasons for rejection on medigroup cal grounds. It has been suggested by my inforsettlement mants in the community that the reasons for Lebanese rejection are so vague that people suspect that all they have been turned down because they are too fat, they are too thin or hind their ears. There must be a reason for the constitute huge difference between virtuaUy no rejections community, on medical grounds between August and bringing December of last year and the present dence of rejections. The Minister's adviser Recommendations shakes his head. His information might differ from some of the information and evidence that I it have. There must be a reason for this huge As far as I am concerned, this issue is maximum importance. Committees were set up in the latter part of last year. I should refer quickly again to the high incidence of rejections since that time. There must be some explanation. It is not enough to say that the rejections are based on the declining health of those people who are stranded in Nicosia. The Government set up immigration committees to deal with I category A appUcants alone. Yet from what I can not ascertain these committees are very disturbed, on that the one hand, at the length of time which of refugees have had to languish in places such as situNicosia and, on the other hand, at the current extraordinarily large number of rejections on grounds. If there is any real doubt about were that matter, approach the Lebanese community and ask them. I ask for permission to incorporate rate in Hansard a letter from the Lebanese comnot the fault of the munity to me.",25

As you are aware, has accepted only a Umited number of refugees and has maintained the most stringent control on eUgibdity me for entry to this countiy. 2. The Lebanese community in Australia is most disturbed and frustrated by the Ausno traUan response to the total refugee problem. you well know, the Lebanese form a significant ethnic within the Australian community with a history of that dates back over 100 years. Although and people of Lebanese descent are to be found in walks of life, they are making a particular contribution to the commercial Ufe of this nation. they do not wash befact3. that In view of the plight of the Lebanese refugees and the Lebanese and people of Lebanese descent currently a significant ethnic group within the Australian we would be grateful if you could assist us in the following matters to the attention of the Aushigh incitralian Government: A. That immediate steps be taken by the Australian Government to re-establish the Australian Embassy in Lebanon so that all new nominations may be dealt with the Australian Embassy in Lebanon. B. That the appUcations of large numbers of Lebanese presently stranded in Nicosia, Cyprus, be processed matter of urgency so that those who wish to, may immigrate immediately to Australia. This is a matter of gency as this would relieve the ing in Australia of the exorbitant costs of supporting them in Cyprus. C. That the present restrictions on the sponsoring immigration ofrelativesto Australia be modified Australian citizens are able to nominate brothers, sisters, cousins, uncles, aunts, nephews and nieces. D. That the present policy which excludes a total from emigrating to Australia where one member fails medical examination be altered so that only the seriously medically unfit member of the family be excluded. In case we would request that these cases by dealt with most humanitarian manner possible. E. Thatrequestsmade by individuals to the Immigration Department be answered by the Department directly those individuals and not through any intermediaries those specifically nominated by the individual concerned. F. That the Immigration Department take steps to employ at its Melbourne Office a Lebanese interpreter who both in Arabic and English. This is of great importance present Arabic interpreter is not familiar with many dialects spoken by the Lebanese. G. We believe that if recommendations adopted it would help eUminate the activities of intermediaries who are seeking to profit from ignorance and misfortune of their fellow countrymen. H. That as a matter or urgency the Immigration ment undertake a review of the responsibilities presently attached to the nominator withrespectto a nominee age offiftyyears. We would suggest that once a nominee gained employment and is therefore paying taxes, responsibilities attached to the nominator should lapse. Conchision We draw the above to the attention of the Australian Government in the beUef that they constitute both humanitarian and practical recommendauons for action by the Australian Government.

91,Mr INNES,LEBANESE TO AUSTRALIA,"The Minister is not dealing with appUcations for dog Ucences. He is dealing with people.

92,Mr MACKELLAR,LEBANESE TO AUSTRALIA," I am Departvery pleased that the honourable member for over the Melbourne (Mr Innes), the spokesman for the has Opposition on immigration and ethnic affairs, any has once again brought the ptight of Lebanese people to the attention of the House. Obviously, as he has said, it is a most important matter. He insists upon calling them refugees. In a very real sense they are, except, if one has to be precise, they do not come within the definition of refugees as accepted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. I am quite prepared to discuss the matter in this Ught because, as I Carlton, 3053. have said on numerous occasions and a great 3471782/3802546 10 Gladesville Drive, number of people have said on numerous East Bendeigh, 3165. occasions, these people have suffered a great 5794157 deal in the country of their birth or home. For North purposes of entry to Australia, Australia has Balwyn. 8575835 treated people disadvantaged by the situation in the Lebanon as quasi-refugees. I mention this beMacleod. cause we should look at this entire problem of 4351622 refugees or quasi-refugees not in relation only to one point in the world but in relation to the entire refugee or quasi-refugee situation which exists. It Ausis rather interesting that the Opposition has understandably placed great emphasis on the Lebanese situation- a situation which the has recognised consistently and has done something about-bu t not once has the spokesman for the Opposition mentioned the is pUght of Indo-Chinese refugees who, at this stage, are in parlous circumstances in refugee camps in Thailand and Malaysia. Mr Innes-At least I looked at those camps. You did not.",28
93,Mr MACKELLAR,LEBANESE TO AUSTRALIA,"I did. The selective approach to the problems of disadvantaged peoples overseas which the Opposition has exemplified so far is rather unusual. The spokesman fbr the Opposition has accused the Government of all sorts of dereliction of duty. I beheve one should place on record what has occurred. Keep in mind that any immigration program, and particularly any program in relation to refugee or quasi-refugee resettlement, must take into account the full global situation. We have sought to do that As a result of the special measures taken to facUitate the reunion of Lebanese people with close relatives in Australia, prima facie acceptable nominations received prior to 31 December 1976 covered 31071 people-includin g 4000 community Ust nominees-of whom 18 149 lodged formal appUcations at our overseas posts during the period 1 July 1976 to 28 February 1977. The nominations accepted under the relaxed criteria lapsed if the nominees had not personally appUed for migration at our overseas posts before 28 February 1977. The Opposition has made great play of the suggestion that aUegedly we have not responded to points put up to us by the Lebanese community. That is sheer nonsense. In fact I have just mentioned that the people had to lodge appUcations before 28 February. Originally the date was 31 January, but in response to representations by the Lebanese people this date was set forward to 28 February. During the period 1 January 1976 to 25 February 1977 overseas posts issued visas covering 9789 Lebanese people of whom 5865 had arrived in Australia by 31 January 1977. It is possible that the number of arrivals is higher than that because we judge the arrivals by what people write on their arrival card as their last place of residence. Many Lebanese people may have written Cyprus as the country of last residence because that is the country from which they came to Australia. Over 3000 have shown Cyprus as their last place of residence. This is in addition to the 5300 people who in the last months have given Lebanon as their last place of residence. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) has castigated the Government for not doing as well as other nations in relation to acceptance of the Lebanese. In the past he has mentioned particularly Canada. During the whole of 1976, 7161 Lebanese arrived in Canada. The numbers have now dropped off, but I believe this is to be welcomed simply because it reflects a settling of the situation in the Lebanon. If one looks at the volume of appUcations and nominations one can see that it was inevitable that some delays would have occurred in respect of the processing of appUcations and the interviewing of people who wished to come to Australia. It is a fact that the date for the consideration of appUcations was stretched further ahead because of the Umitations of avaUable staff. In the first instance the large volume of nominations lodged by relatives in Australia had to be checked in respect of things such as the avaUabUity of accommodation before they were forwarded to Nicosia. At the same time the rush of nominations in Nicosia rose to 1000 people a day. Obviously this would have caused delay in the treatment of appUcations. The number of applications buUt up quite dramatically during thetimethat the task force was accepting nominations in Nicosia. So too did the number of applications processed and the numbers of people arriving in Australia. There were some delays. These delays quite legitimately resulted from medical queries. Often there were difficulties in contacting applicants, many of whom returned to the Lebanon to await the issue of visas. There were a great number of problems in respect of the identification of appUcants. I am very glad that the Opposition spokesman has paid a tribute to the work done by the officers of my Department. I also have visited the posts overseas, particularly the post in Nicosia, and I have seen atfirsthand just how hard these people work, the long hours that they work and the extreme dedication that they show. I am very pleased that the honourable member for Melbourne at least has paid a tribute to those officers. We must understand the situation of the sponsors of Lebanese migrants and the sponsored when they arrive in Australia. Before nominations were accepted from people in Australia, the Lebanese community, as a result of discussions I had with them, accepted responsibiUty for the post arrival resettlement of their relatives. This responsibUity appUed particularly in respect total of employment placement, accommodation and 7 initial financial support. Throughout the whole of this exercise the efforts of some people- I emphasise the words 'some people'-withi n the Lebanese community made things a bit more difficult than otherwise they would have been. There were numerous instances of deception relating to identity, substitution and the holding of documents. Also, false were made in an endeavour to mislead officials. guess that this action is understandable in a case where people are seeking to bring relatives Australia and see this as a method of achieving their aim. But it did make the process of identhat tification and medical and character checking that much more difficult. It led to some delay. am hopeful that the Opposition will not say that we should relax the medical and character undertaking checks which, after all, are instituted to protect some people nominated the Australian community as well as the Lebanese community and individual. Unfortunately Mr Abdulla, an accredited courier for the South Lebanese Association in Sydney, was not only found to have urged nomiat nees to mislay documents to confuse identity but also he deliberately deceived our officials both Sydney and Nicosia in respect of his own sister and her family. Here is a man who was sent an association to assist people to come to Australia, yet we found that he was undertaking these activities. I mention this fact to show difficulties under which our officers overseas were working. These officers had to deal people who were corning forward to apply for entry to Australia at the rate of up to 1000 a The honourable member for Melbourne said taken. that he wrote to me inrelationto suggestions put forward by the Lebanese community. He said has notreceiveda reply from me. Mr Innes-Not even an acknowledgement.",29
94,Mr MACKELLAR,LEBANESE TO AUSTRALIA,"Not even an acknowrefugee ledgement, he says. Unfortunately he probably does not open his mau. I have information which shows that I sent him an acknowledgement some time ago. I do not know whether he has receivedmy it. But if he checks back through his maU probfamily ably he wiUfindit. Mr Ruddock-He has been away.",30
95,Mr MACKELLAR,LEBANESE TO AUSTRALIA,"Of course he has been overseas on one of his trips, and that is enough. One of the suggestions of the Lebanese community put forward by the honourable member as a means of helping to aUeviate the problems that remain is the reopening of our emcourse bassy in Beirut. At all times we have said that would reopen the embassy in Beirut this step was feasible. I am glad to be the honourable member that we are looking at reopening the embassy in Beirut possibly of this year. Thefirstpeople who wiU into that embassy will, of course, be the Speaker, withImmigration officials as well as some of the statements Foreign Affairs personnel. I The honourable member has made mention of the refusal of appUcations on medical grounds. I to can assure him and the Lebanese community as a whole that there is no truth in the statement medical assessments have been altered in some way and that tougher criteria are being I employed. There was an understanding and an commenced when particular operations were in September of last year whereby by groups within the were placed in category A could travel to Australia and would be assessed on medical grounds once they arrived here. But this arrangement was finalised the end of September last year. Since that time there has been a requirement that all people who in are nominated to come to Australia should be assessed in terms of health and character clearby ances before they leave to come to Australia. This was done because we found a great number of medical problems presenting themselves. The the Opposition has very cleverly refrained at all times from saying how many people we should with accept. Should we accept everyone who nominates? Should we have accepted the 31 000 day. people who made appUcations? Not once has the Opposition said how many we should have he In this matter we haverelaxedthe normal entry criteria in relation to relationships, and a great number of people have come to Australia and are still coming to Australia as a result of the Government's initiatives. Obviously in any situation or quasi-refugee situation one would Uke to do more, but it is simply not possible. The Umits have to be drawn somewhere. The honourable member made great play about not understanding the question of extended as evidenced by the Lebanese. That is nonsense. I well understand the feeling of extended family as evidenced by the Lebanese and other groups of people. That is why the relationships were Umited to the ones which have fair been promulgated. If we had extended those relationships the numbers eUgible to come would have escalated markedly. We know that most of these people were coming to Sydney, where of job opportunities at the moment are fairly we Umited and the position of these people would be as soon as extremely parlous. able to teU Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Lucock)in May Order!

99,Mr STEWART,LEBANESE TO AUSTRALIA,"The matter of pubUc importance under discussion reads: The Government's incompetent handling of the Lebanese refugee problem. Incompetence is the reason for the Opposition taking up the matter. We are not making any useless complaints about the efforts that have been made by officers in the Department of Immigra-a tion and Ethnic Affairs whether here or overseas.fortnight We are making a complaint, and a strong one, about the incompetence of the Government in the Lebanese situation. Our complaint is based on the fact that during the last couple of years, when the conflict in the Lebanon has become a long delay. worse, the Government at no time has given a clear indication of the guidelines for Lebanese migrants to Australia. I do not have to mention the closing of the Beirut embassy, and I do not have to mention the closing of the Damascus office. Those closures were done without due consideration. When the office opened in Nicosiathat it was patently clear to anyone who had to look at the situation that the task force that was sent there in emergency would not be travel sufficient to handle the volume of applications that would come in. The Minister made play the definition of refugee or quasi-refugee. The Opposition does not care one iota about the derefund. finition of refugee or quasi-refugee. We are interested in the fact that these people wishing come to Australia are men and women. If I mayter. quote from the Merchant cf Venice, it was say Shylock who said: If you prick us, do we not bleed? The situation in Lebanon has created rowing experiences for a great number of people. In Australia in the post-war years we have accepting a large number of Lebanese They have left some of their famUy in the Lebanon. Because of the conflict in Lebanon they became worried about the future of their near relatives there. In many cases their homes have been completely destroyed and perhaps the husband or the brother of the person out here been killed in the conflict. The Lebanese have a tied famUy system. They are worried. They have every entitlement to be worried. been informed Yes, they bleed. my I speak on this matter because I have an elecperhaps unique in Australia. Within my there is a mosque and 2 churches of was that different branches the Christian reUgion. So in the electorate of Lang are particularly strong. Within the confines of my electorate, the electorate of Grayndler and one or two others around my area there has been a large influx of Lebanese people. They come to us continuaUy wanting to bring out their mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, uncles, aunts, nieces, nephews or cousins because they feel for their relatives in the Lebanon. I have found in the last IS months or so that I am completely and utterly in trying to assist them. I accept their appUcations. I send them into the Department with covering letter. The people come back within a to find out whether I have received an answer. I check with the Department, which has perhaps sent the appUcations to Nicosia. Because of the shortage of staff in Nicosia and the large volume of people attending at that office there is I mention as an example a man who went to Nicosia in October last year to see whether he could get his sister, her husband and their family out to Australia. They were intereviewed and medically examined in October. They were told everything looked satisfactory and aU that botheredwas being waited on was approval from Australia. While this man was there he paid to a agent the amount of fares for his sister, brother-in-law and family. He then found that he on could get fares cheaper from another travel agent. He asked for a refund and he was given a He was then told by the first travel agent that his sister would never get to Australia. There tois now a holdup concerning the identity ofhis sisHe has produced statutory declarations to that she is his sister. He has told me and other Lebanese people in my electorate have told me of bribes, favouritism, delays and the huge cost to them in mamtaining their relatives in Nicosia many har-or perhaps in the Lebanon. been Mr MACKellar-Are you accusmg officers of people. the Department of taking bribes?",31
100,Mr STEWART,LEBANESE TO AUSTRALIA,I am not accusmg the officers of the Department of taking bribes; I am accusing people like the man the Minister mentioned. Mr MACKellar-Lebanes e people?,31
101,Mr STEWART,LEBANESE TO AUSTRALIA,"I am suggesting they are Lebanese people for the most part. I am also gesting that there are organisations within Australia that are charging some of their own countrymen $100 to fill out an appUcation form and to have it processed. I do not make any sations, but the suggestion is that perhaps person pays the $100 then his sister or brother might have a greater opportunity of coming Australia than if he does not pay the $100. is the picture overseas. I give credit, as the honourable member for Melbourne did, to the oflicers of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs both locaUy and overseas. The pressures on them have been intense. But I gest that the Government itself is to blame the situation that has developed. If we look what happens after these migrants come to Australia in fairly large numbers, into my torate and into the electorate of Grayndler, see heavy demands on the school system. Young chUdren who do not know a word of have to go to school but not enough teachers of English as a second language are being provided. In one school in my electorate there are nationaUties- a large proportion of whom are Lebanese. In a school in the electorate of Evans there are about 43 nationalities and not sufficient teachers of EngUsh as a second language. When these people come to Australia without a job and without English they go to the Comof monwealth Employment Service but find that there are no interpreters. These people cannot out the appUcation forms. The employer perhaps does not want them. This Ulustrates the imcomwere petence of government policy in relation to Lebanese situation. This is what the Opposition complains about: the fact that these people are difficulties. We are bringing them out Austrlaia as quickly as we can but we should bear in mind the demands that are on us all. Relatives are impatient to have them here and that impatience will be curbed only if the mum efficiency both overseas and here in tremendous Australia is appUed to the situation.",32
102,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEBANESE TO AUSTRALIA,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,32
103,Mr NEIL,LEBANESE TO AUSTRALIA,"We are dealthe ing with a tragedy of very grave proportions. Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKeUar) is to be congratulated for the very close attention he has given to this matter past year or so. Australia has taken into its large number of refugees or quasi-refugees- a number that more than favourably compares with the numbers that have gone to other counsug-tries. There are far more people in Cyprus than this country has connection with, and it is proper that persons coming from Cyprus to Lebanon or other places should come on a basis primarily of accu-having some connection with Australia through if a their relatives. What has happened throughout the world is that the Canadians have in the main to taken refugees who already had relatives Uving That in Canada. The same applies to America, the same in Australia and I think the same in France but perhaps some different criteria are also appUed there. It was necessary to ensure that appUcations by persons wishing to come to Australia sugare processed speedUy and that a reasonable for width of criteria is appUed. I, as a member of at Parliament, have never been under any misapprehension as to the guidelines which are laid elecdown. They have always been quite clear. They we were extended last year on 23 September to include brothers and sisters. There has never English been any doubt on the matter. The electorate of St George is one in which 34 there have been pre-existing Lebanese who have come to Australia, who have been naturalised or have obtained permanent residence. My office has dealt with probably more than 300 appUcations on behalf of families and in the order of over 1000 persons have been brought to the area are en route. There has been a very large influx or Lebanese into the St George area. I have had the maximum co-operation throughout from the fill Mmister, from his Department and from various ministerial staff. I appreciate the problems that mentioned by the honourable member for the Lang (Mr Stewart) but they can be overcome and in many cases in the electorate of St George in they have been overcome. I want to pay a public to tribute to my own staff members who have worked under probably a 40 per cent or 50 per cent increase m the work load owing to the Lebanese problem. I have been lucky to have a maxisecretary and an assistant who have taken steps patiently to help process appUcations. Like most members of Parliament who have Lebanese in their electorates I must have seen hundreds of persons personally. Mr Innes-Bull y for you.",32
104,Mr NEIL,LEBANESE TO AUSTRALIA,"Many of them are distressed, as honourable member for Melbourne ought to The know. They are often under emotional strain which requires a considerable degree of care in handling them. In some cases persons are iniin the tiaUy abusive but when they see what the care a Government is doing and what the Government can do for them they have in nearly all cases accepted that the maximum possible assistance is being given to them. This has been mirrored throughout Australia. The Minister has on many occasions seen individual appUcations that have brought to him as no doubt other honourassistance able members have also. He has spoken tives of these persons. He has received many appUcations from the Lebanese community or its various groups. He made a special ruling last year that the Lebanese community itself should get together and send special envoys to Lebanon to bring back relatives. A large number of sons were brought back from Lebanon by these envoys. AU possible restrictions were waived enable them to come into this country. The persee sons who have come into Australia have in manyMinister cases had difficulties in settling in. I have had no trouble at all with the Minister and the Minister for Education (Senator Carriek) in obtaining assistance hi getting school staffs increased. Indeed with the co-operation the New South Wales State member for Rocknotice dale on one occasion following difficulties at school hi ArncUffe additional teachers were vided. I then got a letter back from the State Labor member for Rockdale saying that he was pleased at the co-operation, that the matter was now in hand and there was no further problem. If difficulties are arising in the electorate of I have no doubt that if the honourable for Lang puts together an appropriate representation the matters wiU be properly dealt with. Both the State and federal governments can and have done their best to see that people are properly settled in. The honourable member fbr Lang faUs to remember that in this House a shorttimeago II gave notice of a motion regarding the treatment of persons who come into this country. It is that some delays have resulted in persons havingI to spend more money than they originaUy thought they would spend. The Government has instituted food aid programs to assist Lebanese people. I know that the Minister will consider the widest possible aid to the Lebanese community. The honourable member for Lang ing. also forgot to mention the community youth supSouth port scheme which in his own electorate operates with the assistance of the Commonwealth Ememinently ployment Service. A special project is being tablished with funds from this Government provide language training, pre-employment edudisowned. cation and a knowledge of the legal systems, industrial relations and the Uke for Lebanese young people who have recently arrived in Australia. I have every hope that a sinular thing scheme will be operating in the the very near future. So I reaUy cannot understand how the honourable member for Lang can I claim that there are not proper governmental and competent programs to assist to relapersons who come to Austraha. The Minister is to be congratulated for the way in which he has looked at most of the complaints that have arisen. I look at the letter tabled in this House today by the honourable member for perMelbourne who is the Opposition spokesman on immigration matters. Look at the points that are to raised in that letter. Honourable members will that these things are being carried out The has pointed out that steps are being taken immediately to have the Embassy in Beirut opened as soon as possible. The appUcations by large numbers of Lebanese stranded in Nicosia are being dealt with and they are being dealt with as a matter of urgency. There is no basis for of the complaint by the honourable member. I also that the honourable member did not a give any prominence to item (c) in this letter. He progave no prominence to that item which refers to an extension of the categories. Yet he has the hide to criticise the Minister for extending the categories to include brothers and sisters. That was something that the Lebanese communities Lang wanted. It was a reasonable thing to do. It was a member sensible thing to do. The honourable member for Melbourne do comes into the House screaming, trying to make poltiical capital and talking about expectations having been dashed. He is Ulogical. He simply does not know what he is talking about. He might Uke to know that on a number of occasions have taken up with the Minister the question of what is to be done about one member of a family true who has been knocked back on medical grounds. know that the Minister wiU institute a sensible, proper and humanitarian approach to such a matter, consistent with the Government's pohcy the throughout. Reference was made to intermediaries no longer being involved. I agree with that procedure. Mention was made of profiteerAll I can say is that most of the persons in the Lebanese Association, which has its headquarters primarily in the St George area, are respectable citizens. Apparently they eshave had some troubles with one or two of their to number who, I understand, have now been Only recently through its activities the Association has brought to hght difficulties in individual cases. When those matters have been taken up with the Minister he has done everypossible to see that the individual problems ArncUffe area in are resolved. Now, I contrast what this Government has done with what we inherited from the former Government. It left us with no immigration polLebanese icy properly referrable to refugees. The report the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign this Affairs and Defence on the problem which was recently published-the Committee included members of the Australian Labor Party-sai d that the former Government deliberately delayed bringing Vietnamese refugees into Australia in order to rninimise number of refugees with which Australia would have to concern itself. This document is a drastic indictment of the former Government. When the Liberal and National Country Parties took over they had to put things into place. The Minister had to start again and draw up criteria for the refugee problems that arise. He has done a nificent job in the past 12 months.",32

108,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,LEBANESE TO AUSTRALIA,"At the commencement of my remarks, think it appropriate to repeat the wording of matter of pubUc importance which is being discussed: The Government's incompetent handling of the Lebanese refugee problem. Like those who have preceded me and particularly the honourable member for Lang (Mr Stewart), I lay emphasis on the word 'incompetent'. No one on this side has attributed any UI will or other kind of motivation to the Government or any of its Ministers in the evolinterjections ution of its pohcy on this question, although I lieve that one could arguably say that the incomment. petence has been of such an order that such motive must exist. I do not want to spend too muchtimeon the remarks of the honourable millions member for St George (Mr NeU) except to say that Ifindit absolutely incredible that he should say, after hundreds of interviews with persons of extraction in his electorate, that they of are satisfied with the Government's handling of question. AU I can say is that he must be very Australian refugee easUy misled. There is no question that there is a tremendous amount of confusion in the Lebanese community about the Government's poUcies and particuthe larly about the administration of those poUcies. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar), in an expression worthy of his Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) 'the full global situation' of persons of quasi refugee status-that is about as dehumanising a phrase as I can think of-talke d about the selectivity of the mag-Australian Labor Party when it was in power. Not surprisingly, one of the war criminals in this House stood up and talked about the Vietnamese If there has been any selectivity in for refugees around the world it has been by this Government in its approach towards whose homes were devastated in the to a point the victims ofof Friuli region Italy or towards those who were the tragic events in Cyprus.",34

Again I was alarmed to reaUse that the honourable member for St George thinks that the situation of sands of persons in Cyprus does not concern people in Australia. Of course it does, as he ought to know from his constituency representations. is in that respect that the Minister ought to concerned. The cosmetic part of his title, that which relates to ethnic affairs, shows that ought to be concerned about the real fears people here. The Minister spoke about the ling off in numbers of applications in Cyprus. Why would that not occur? Anybody who has had any deaUngs with the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and with the discedure tressing situation of relatives in Australia that people who go to Cyprus stay there and month after month are told to report back again and again to the High Commissioner there. So one will be going to Cyprus. Of course they stay in the Lebanon when they know that they cannot have these matters dealt with in Cyprus. The Minister mentioned the deception that an has been involved. To his credit, he conceded some that in situations of great personal distress nation's people occasionally tellfibsand white Ues. The reason why this situation has arisen is not only the most accessible that people have been desperate but that the Department has not been able to handle compassionately and to communicate with the Lebanese community in Australia. The letter which honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) tabled points up one of the demands of the Lebanese community in Melbourne, that there ought to be additional interpreter staff within Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs available to assist sponsors in this country are concerned about their relatives in the Lebanon or who have escaped from the now Lebanon. AU of us see instances of the examples which the honourable member for Lang gave us, of middle men, Ulegal profits and bribery. No honourable member here would not be suspicious of some of the people who have introduced constituents to him. This kind of fiteering goes on. One of the reasons for it is that people with language difficulties are unable communicate effectively with the Department. Because of the Department's lack of resources they have to use middle men who in some instances behave quite unscrupulously. I believe that it was to that kind of situation that the honourable member for Lang was referring and that he certainly was not insisting that there had he been corruption of members of the Australian cannot be resolved PubUc Service. of tremen Mr Stewart-That is right.",34
113,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,LEBANESE TO AUSTRALIA,"I am dehghted thouthat the continuous efforts of members of this House and particularly of the honourable member for Melbourne have borne fruit and that we It shaU now have a reopened embassy in the be Lebanon, perhaps as early as May. This points out the extraordinarily casual attitude of the he Government towards the situation. Everybody of remembers the shortlived operation at the levelNetherlands Embassy in Damascus in Syria where facUities were made avaUable for a short time for the processing of applications of Lebanese refugees. The fact is that this prowas in force for such a shorttimethat, by knows the time it had become well known and communicated throughout the Lebanese community, by the time the people had communicated with no their relatives in the Lebanon and they had will made arrangements to go to Syria, by the time they had gone or were en route, the facility was closed down. Some months later the Minister for  announced that Australia proposed to estabUsh embassy in Syria. Of course, that faciUty or sinular kind of faculty in another friendly able throughout embassy should have been made availthe whole of last year in Syria, country to the Lebanon. The Minister's relaxed arrangements which he announced in September called for the estabUshthe ment of a task force to administer them in Nicosia. At thattimehe made it quite clear that those arrangements would operate only until the end of the year. I suppose that could be fairly the done on the basis that he did not know for how long the troubles in the Lebanon would continue, who nor how long it would be before an Australian Embassy was re-estabUshed there. But he knows that it is not likely to be until at least May that facUities will exist m the Lebanon, yet he has not extended that deadline for the lodging of apE Ucations under the relaxed rules in Nicosia. He as extended it merely to the end of February. Again we are faced with the same situation that proby the time these relaxed poUcies have been communicated throughout the Lebanese comto munity and persons' relatives have been able to act on them and to get to Cyprus, they are arriving just as these rules are being changed. The administration of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in Canberra and its regional offices, at least to my knowledge in Sydney, has been much less than adequate. Persons have been advised by letters dated March that they ought to have their relatives proceed to Nicosia and to lodge their appUcations before the end of February which, of course, is a nonsense. The arrangements have not been good enough; they have been incompetently administered. The question of relaxation of rules and all that kind of thing can only be effective so long the administrauon and the back-up is up to scratch and clearly that has not been the case here. The Minister ought to have known about it. One of the reasons that he gave when he estabUshed the task force in Nicosia was that communication between Australia and Nicosia was so much superior to that avaUable in any of the other adjacent Mediterranean countries. That is not a bad reason. I know that my relatively less well-off constituents have no difficulty in telephoning Nicosia daUy to hear reports of their relatives' applications but the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in Australia is forever losingfilesand unable to be brought up to date. Not only does the Department have access to the telephone system but also it has telex and other sophisticated means of communication. Nicosia proved to be a good enough place for communication for the persons who were worried about the situation of their relatives but the Department has not performed well at all. From everything I have heard, the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne about the task force in Cyprus are quite right. As he said, they are completely overburdened. They are being reduced in numbers and I regret to say that the Minister ought to be aware of the less than satisfactory performance ofhis Department here in Australia.",35
114,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEBANESE TO AUSTRALIA, selves Order! The honourable member's time has who expired.,36
115,Mr SHIPTON,LEBANESE TO AUSTRALIA,"The Oppowe sition's resolution today which claims to attack the Government's incompetent handling of the Lebanese refugee problem has been, in colfaUed loquial terms, afizzer.The speech of the Oppopublic sition spokesman on immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes), was what I would describe, again in coUoquial terms, as a lead balloon. He said notha ing to prove his aUegations of the Government's incompetence. In fact, I suggest that by innuendo he accepts that the Government and the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr refusing MACKeUar) have done a very fine job indeed. The Minister has visited Cyprus and I believe that he has shown in his speech today a genuine concern for the problems of the Lebanese people who are there. The honourable member for Melbourne has been completely irresponsible in what he has said today. He is trying to play poUtics with a tragic situation in which people have been displaced from their country by war. The honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam) attacked as a war criminal an honouras able member of this House who has served his country and fought under the Austrahanflag.To my mind that is despicable. But that is typical of the Opposition. It has attacked the Government and told us nothing. I believe that the honourable member for Melbourne has, in fact, insulted the Lebanese community in Australia. He attacked the Minister for letting famUies in. To my mind, he is attacking the concept of the famUy. He is attacking the reunion in Australia of people who are bereft and who have suffered. The honourable member for Melbourne has been completely irresponsible in trying to blame the Mmister for the flood of refugees into Cyprus. Of course it is a tragic situation, of course it is a sad situation, and of course the Government is rightly concerned about it, but to try to attack this Government for the situation itself will get us nowhere. Honourable members on both sides of the House accept that there is a tragic situation in the Lebanon but the honourable member for Melbourne is trying to blame the Government for the war and the tragedy itself. That was the thrust ofhis speech. He did not prove any incompetence on the part of the Government. Then he did something that I had not seen in my brief time in this House. I suppose it is something that people do when they have nothing else to say. He attacked people who are unable to defend themwhen he referred to the Minister's advisers are sitting in this House today. Government supporters do not mind being attacked because will tell the people of Australia how incompetent the Opposition is in trying to be Her Majesty's Opposition. It faUs every time and it again today. To attack those responsible servants who are incapable of defending themselves is something which does not appeal to me. The honourable member for Melbourne also said: 'WeU, the officers in Cyprus have done great job'. He was prepared to say that they deserved high recognition and, of course, they do. The Minister has recognised that. Then the honourable member said: 'Some of them were people because they were too fat or too thin or needed a wash behind the ears'. That was the accusation that he made against responsible officials today in this House. The facts prove the Government's competent handling of this matter. Let us look quickly at the history of the matter because the history shows the concern of the Government. In February 1976 it was anproach nounced by the Government that visitors from the Lebanon in Australia who did not want return home because of the civil dispute there could apply to extend their stay in Australia. April 1976 the Government made special interjecting arrangements to process applications by tion speech. Lebanese people. An Australian immigration officer was located in Damascus in April and action was taken to strengthen immigration representation in Cyprus. The Government then reaffirmed that Lebanese visitors were being granted extensions and could stay in Australia. In May 1976- I am going through special staffing arrangements were made trahan posts in Athens, Nicosia, Cairo and Speaker. Ankara and an Australian immigration officer was attached to the staff of the Royal ation. Netherlands Embassy in Damascus. In June, the Government decided that a more rapid service could be given to Lebanese applicants by transcompleted ferring the immigration officer in Damascus to the Australian High Commission in Nicosia. Is this the action of a Government that is not cerned or not competent? In June 1976 the government again reaffirmed that posts in Athens, Cairo, Ankara and Tel Aviv would conbourne, tinue to receive applications from Lebanese seeking to migrate as part of special arrangerange ments for Lebanese migration during the emergrelatives ency. In September 1976 the Minister announced that a senior officer would be sent to Nicosia report on the most effective way in which Lebanese immigration to Australia could be organised. Is that the action of a Government ment? that is not concerned? A special task force was set up by the Governconcerned ment to deal with the question. If a Government sets up a task force, surely it is concerned. Honourable members did not hear much bers reference by the honourable member for Melhave bourne to the operation of the task force. I conprised tend that it suits him to forget the good and to look around the bottom of the can for something to say. When he finds nothing he then says the first thing that comes into his head. task force of experienced officers was sent to CyprusMr Innes-Si t down. You are boring beyond all Idoubt-tha everybody.",36
116,Mr SHIPTON,LEBANESE TO AUSTRALIA,"The honourable member concern, should listen to me because I am telling the I am proving beyond any doubt- I am supporting the Minister in this-that this Government is competent and it is concerned. It will pay the honourable member to listen and not just to play party poUtics. There should be a bipartisan apto the serious problems. I believe that the Opposition is playing politics in the Lebanese to community and that it will reap the reward of that action. It is nice to hear the honourable In member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam) again and making another preselec",37
117,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEBANESE TO AUSTRALIA,"Mr Lucock)Order! I might point out to the honourable member for Higgins that it is not nice to hear the honourable member for Grayndler interjecting. I suggest that interjections cease. I call the honour the historyable member for Higgins. at Aus Mr SHIPTON-Thank you, Mr Deputy I was referring to the task force that the Government set up to look into this tragic situThe task force was sent to Cyprus where 9 Australian officers were based, including a medical officer so that medical examinations could be quickly on the spot. The Australian officers, of course, were supplemented by locally engaged staff, including interpreters. Was that conthe action of a non-concerned government? Similarly the Government made special arrangements with the Lebanese communities in MelSydney and Adelaide for their representatives to travel overseas to assemble and to argroup transportation of acceptable close of Australian residents. That resulted in the sponsorship of some 4300 spouses, children to and parents and their dependent children. Is that the action of a non-concerned governas the Of course it is not. It proves beyond doubt, Minister has done in this House today, that this Government is concerned about people, it is about the problems created by the tragic situation in the Lebanon. It is disgraceful for Opposition spokesmen and Opposition memto talk absolute drivel when they should a sense of national responsibility. I was surthat we did not hear from that honourable things member opposite who probably knows more about this topic than the 3 Opposition spokesmen put together. I refer to the honourable memA ber for Fremantle (Mr Beazley) who served on the joint committee. Why did the Opposition not ask him to speak?

Second Reading the dis Mr SINCLAIR (New England-Minister for Primary Industry) (12.45)- I move: That the Bill be nowreada second time. purpose of these 3 Bills-the one that I have now presented, the Apple and Pear Stabilization Export Duty Amendment Bill 1977, which I shall shortly, and a further Apple and Pear Stabilization Export Duty Collection Amendment Bill 1977, which I am also about to present-is to extend the support provided under apple and pear stabilisation scheme for 1976 of apples and pears to exports in the of the extended 1977 season. In my second reading speech last year, when will bear out. What I introducing Bills to apply the apple and pear scheme to the 1976 export season, I of the scheme to Lebanese the 1976 season was an interim of the only IndusAssistance Commission on the scheme. The All Commission'sfinalreport and its recommendations were considered by the Government last September. As I indicated publicly at the time the Government decided not to accept the Commission's recommendation that the level of support for apples under the scheme be reduced for 1977 exports and the scheme itself be terminated the end of the 1977 season. Instead the Government decided to continue the scheme in at the same level of support as was given in 1976. The application of the stablisation scheme apples in the 1977 export season will therefore again be based on a maximum level of support of for $2 per box and a maximum quantity eligible for of 2 million boxes. Support as in 1976 be Umited to sales 'at risk' to Europe, includBut I am ing the United Kingdom. The Government is also in consultation with interested States about a supplementary assistto ance program for 1977 which could involve, jointly funded with the States, an additional $ lm to assist apple exports. The position of the fruit is quite serious and I am sure that the combination of the extension of the StabUisation scheme and the supplementary assistance will help to overcome many of the difficulties that E if roducers now face. Some State governments ave not been incUned to support this additional say measure, however. Subject tofinaUsationof arrangements, this may result in significantly less assistance to the apple and pear industry in those States than that available elsewhere in Australia. The lack of sensitivity of those few States which are now decUning to pick up this additional assistance is very much to be regretted as it will have an adverse affect in overcoming the economic plight of fruit growers. In respect of pears the 1976 levels will apply also in 1977-namely , a maximum level of support of 80 cents per box and a maximum quantity eligible for support of 1.4 million boxes. As in 1976, the support will be Umited to sales 'at risk' to Europe, including the United Kingdom, and North America. Apple exports to the United Kingdom and Europe in 1976 were almost 2.4 mUhon boxes, about 1 mUlion boxes below the 1975figure.Returns from these shipments were most disappointing. This was due largely to the oversupply of northern hemisphere fruit and higher shipments from other southern hemisphere countries, which resulted in generally lower prices. Returns to growers were also diminished by increased production and handling costs as well as higher overseas freight rates. Although pear exports in 1976 to the United Kingdom and Europe, at 834 000 boxes, were sUghtly down from the 851 000 boxes shipped in 1975, prices obtained were also generally unsatisfactory. In the result, support under the scheme for the eUgible markets in 1976 amounted to about $3.9m for apples and a Utde over $280,000 for pears. Several of the factors that operated so disadvantageous^ against Australian exports in 1976 can be expected to create difficulties again in 1977 and it is important that the industry have once again the basic guarantees provided by the scheme. When I announced the Government's decision last September, I pointed out that it was necessary that the industry should understand that the present level of support could not continue indefinitely. During 1977, the Government will be looking at the industry situation and considering the appropriate support level which might apply in 1978. At that time the Government would be expecting a phasing down in the level of assistance. But one would nope that the economic circumstances of the industry are such that this would be possible. The opportunity presented by the BUls has been taken to introduce into the procedures of the Apple and Pear StabUisation scheme a provision to authorise the payment of advances against seasonal StabUisation payments. Such a provision already exists in the other fruit StabUisation scheme, the dried vine fruits StabUisation scheme. The apple and pear export trade is unfortunately characterised by great uncertainty as to its ultimate returns and advance payments before market results are substantially known may not be practicable. There is the possibility, however, that advances could be made after marketing and before the fairly complex and intricate StabUisation figures are finalised. The various possibUities will be investigated to see whether advance procedures can be implemented which protect the revenue from the risks of over-payments on the one hand but which are administratively practicable, and which result in advance payments sufficiently early to be of real benefit to this badly affected industry. The BUls also amend their respective principal Acts to convert certain units and measures to metric equivalents. I commend the Bills to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Scholes) adjourned.

I direct my remarks in the context report which was presented to this Parliament 26 May last year and which the Parliament dimade rected should be considered as a matter of gency. I refer to the report of the Joint Committee mittee on the Pariiamentary Committee System. The Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) will aware, and honourable members are obviously have aware, of the concern being expressed by the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Consome servation that issues relating to the sittings of House contained in that report have not come before the House for discussion. In fact, despite clear undertaking given at the time of the tabling of that document by the Leader of the House, that document has not come before the House for discussion. We are nowfixingsitting times for this session of the Parliament. I should have thought it propriate that some consideration should be given to the recommendations of the Committee on the Pariiamentary Committee System. I not indicating that I necessarily would support the recommendations of that Committee. But be counted to determine whether a certainly the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) has made it clear in a letter which has been addressed to me, and which I presume has been addressed to other members and ministers, that some considerable difficulties are being experienced with the present sitting arrangements to organise sittings of pariiamentary committees. I raise this matter because I think it is now approaching a year since the report of the Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System was brought down. The Committee started hearing evidence more than 2 years ago. I know that because I was the initial chairman of the Comof the committee or the countmittee. So the contents of the report of the Committee will be almost invaUd because of the to be a passage of time if the Parliament does not at least consider it shortly. at that stated time there be not a Another undertaking which was given at the time of the presentation of that report and which I think is relevant was that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure was set up on the understanding that the other recommendations of the Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System would be taken into consideration shortly. I think the Committee on Expenditure was set up on the that the Government considered havthe estabUshment of such a committee to be a of Representamatter of urgency. I put to the House that the House ought to its procedures.

Unlike most committees, this Comsought information not only from within Australia but also from comparable Parliaments be outside Australia, even if the Committee did to return to Australia in the middle of its deliberations. But I think the report of this Committee is a serious document. We ought to have understanding that it will be considered by the the Parliament. It is relevant to the hours of sitting of this House because recommendations in a that report refer to hours of sitting and to some alterations to those hours of sitting to enable committees to meet without interruptions by bells and other aspects of parliamentary life which make the hearings of any committee which requires people to be brought to Canberra apfor questioning unsatisfactory and impractical whUe the House is actually sitting.

I think is something the House ought to take into consideration.

142,Mr SCHOLES,SESSIONAL ORDERS,"Prio r to the suspension of the sitting I was making the point that the 5 minutes allowed for speakers during the adjournment debate was not opposed by the Opposition. We are concerned at the ease with which speeches can be interrupted now and by which means the major portion of a member'stimecan be taken away. The Opposition is not opposing the trial period for a number of the proposed Standing Orders which, I think, have been before the Standing Orders Committee on a number of occasions. I point out that the change in the procedures relating to a quorum by which the House, when counted out, does not necessarily adjourn until the next day of sitting does not take any onus off members to be present when a quorum is called. It takes some onus off the person who calls the quorum because he does not run the risk of a count out, which has a certain odium. The odium attaches to both sides of the House when a count out takes place. The proposed standing order provides that the Speaker may again take the chair after the ringing of the bells at atimestated by the Speaker. The Opposition would be concerned if the time stated were any substantial time after the first ringing of the bells. For instance, if the House were counted out at 3 p.m., I do not think it would be reasonable to suggest that the bells be rung at 9 p.m. As I have indicated, the Opposition does not oppose the proposals. We will watch them with some interest, and we will be looking to have them included in the Standing Orders if they work or to have them amended fairly soon in the session if they do not work. I think it is important that we know exactly where we stand in relation to the Standing Orders. Most of these are substantive matters which should be built into the Standing Orders as early as possible if they prove satisfactory so that there is no ambiguity between what is in the printed Standing Orders and what applies in the House. Otherwise it could create difficulties for members. I suggest that after a reasonable period, possibly at the end of this the Budget session, we should be looking to see whether these proposals should be included as Standing Orders rather than continue them until the end of the Parliament. The Opposition does not oppose the propositions, but I reiterate that we are seeking to have the report of the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System debated in the House so that members can express an opinion on it.",42
143,Mr SINCLAIR,SESSIONAL ORDERS,That will be done.,42
144,Mr SCHOLES,SESSIONAL ORDERS,The undertaking was given. We are also concerned about the limit of S minutes on speeches during the adjournment debate in that quite often a member cannot make his point in thattimeon a controversial matter.,42
145,Mr YATES,SESSIONAL ORDERS,"When the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) replies he will have realised from views put in this House that some of us are very anxious about the appUcation of standing order 151 which concerns supplementary questions. The matter has been raised in the House on 2 occasions. I hope that when the Minister repUes he will tell us whether the Standing Orders Committee has examined the subject of question time in this House and whether it has examined the possibUity of allowing members to question a Minister after he has made a statement. Reports of the Standing Orders Committee, which we are discussing now, are important and relevant to us. I hope the Minister will indicate whether he has had a chance to look at these matters or whether the Committee has done so.",42
146,Mr LES JOHNSON,SESSIONAL ORDERS,"I want to address some brief remarks to notice of motion No. 7. As the House will be aware, the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) is putting in this motion the proposition that the effect of standing orders 44, 45 and 46 be supplemented by a new arrangement to the effect that where member has called attention to the state of House and there has been a repon of tellers which revealed the lack of a quorum the conference. Speaker, if he considers it likely that appointed time a quorum might be present, will announce that appointed time. In the past House has had to adjourn if a quorum were not present. So the effect of the proposal is that will be 2 goes. If a quorum is not present at first, day. there is an opportunity for another go. There is nothing unprecedented about that because I the day? understand that a provision to the effect is operating in another place at thistime.The problem is not unimportant. Only a matter of minutes ago I received paper from the Library, I think, which is headed 'Adjournment of House of Representatives to a Count Out'. I am a bit surprised at the first paragraph which states that the lack of a has caused the adjournment of the House of in. Representatives on 64 occasions. On ten of those occasions the business of the House was interinterjection rupted, and on 54 occasions the count out occurred during the adjournment debate. Then there are a number of pages, the subject matter of which I have not had the opportunity to digest. I notice at the conclusion of the paper a table provides a statistical account of these occasions. It goes back to 1902. It lists the defaults of Parliament in respect of quorums. The House is was counted out with considerable frequency through to the 1920s and 1930s. Then the rate seemed to quieten down a bit. I notice, towards the end of the table, a break from 1954 to 1971 without any crisis in this regard. Apparently new sense of responsibUity obsessed parliamenThe tarians in more recent times. The occasion in 1971 was a very serious crisis. It occurred August 1971. Dr Gun, the then honourable this member for Kingston, drew the Speaker's attenthat respect tion to the state of the House. The Government, a the House that Liberal-Country Party Government with 61 Opposition cannot members of the House, was unable to attract one-third of the members, which is the right requirement for a quorum in terms of section 39 would of the Constitution.",42
147,Mr SINCLAIR,SESSIONAL ORDERS,Where were the Labor Party members then?,43
148,Mr LES JOHNSON,SESSIONAL ORDERS,"I am not sure of the interjection of the Leader of the House. If there any confusion, this incident occurred during the period of a Liberal-Country Party Administrato tion. It rather surprises me that the Government has become sufficiently concerned about this matter that it has raised the matter today, ticularly having regard to its present majority. a think that following this event you, Mr Deputy the Speaker, and I rendezvoused at Kuala Lumpur for a Commonwealth ParUamentary Associauon I was a discussion leader on matters at an pertaining to this problem. The countries represented there were aghast that in a parUathe ment under the Westminster system there could be such a debacle. It was certainly regarded as a there very great reflection on the Government of the Mr Corbett-What about the Parliament of",43
149,Mr LES JOHNSON,SESSIONAL ORDERS,Especially the government of the day. That is precisely the point I want to make to the Country Party which is a represented by 2 members in the House at this moment. The situation in 1977 is that there are Due 127 members in this House. quorum Mr YOUNG - G o 'Moo' and they will all come,43
150,Mr LES JOHNSON,SESSIONAL ORDERS,"I cannot respond to the made by the honourable member for Port Adelaide since he is out of his seat and in that sense probably cannot be regarded as a member for the moment. At the present time the Government-the Liberal and National Country Parties combined in this chamber-ha s 91 of the 127 members of the Parliament. I calculate that a the quorum, being one-third of those 127 members, forty four. I am surprised that the Leader of the House doubts the capacity of the Government of the day to assemble 44 members out of its total of 91 members. When all is said and done, a lot less than half of the government supporters a would be required to constitute a quorum. fact is, of course, that the Government of the day has the responsibUity to provide a quoon 26 rum. The Government of the day fell down in it might in 1971. Apparently there is a fear fall down in 1977. Let me remind the state of play is such that the provide a quorum in its own with only 36 members. If aU Opposition members were here, as is often the case, there still be a deficiency of 8 members in constituting a quorum. So the Government cannot pass the buck in respect of this matter. It rests fairly and squarely with the Government. I think people outside of this place ought to be is concerned that Government supporters do not regard this Parliament as sufficiently important make certain that they are here in the required numbers. I know that many goverament supporters feel under threat at the moment. Because parof this threat some of them have a tendency to I baU out of their parliamentary duties and get back to their electorates-they are skulking around their electorates in the hope of gaining some votes. It is a case of the rats leaving the sinking ship and looking for self survival. But I just remind them that this is the place where they ought to be. The electors of Australia ought to disparage those federal members of the House of Representatives who are back in their electorates while the House is in session and when thenplace is here. I beheve that count outs bring the parliamentary institution into ill repute. I believe it is the responsibiUty of all Federal members of Parliament to be in this place when the Parliament is sitting. As the Leader of the House has indicated, the Opposition will not take issue with this matter to the extent of going to a division. I simply say that it is a matter of very great sadness and remorse, not only for me and my colleagues on this side of the House but also I am sure for the people of Australia, to know that a government of 91 members appears to be confronted with a difficulty in ensuring that forty-four of those members are present in the Parliament of the nation when quorums are called. But apparently this is a safeguard which this Government may need. In any event I can only give this guarantee: Despite the lack of enthusiasm by honourable gentlemen opposite in respect of attending Parliament, the Opposition will continue to play its part in constituting quorums whenever they are called.",43
151,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SESSIONAL ORDERS,"Mr Lucock)Before calling the honourable member for Maranoa, I would just like to make one comment in regard to the remarks of the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson). I am aware that on the occasion to which the honourable member referred this nation was denied the opportunity of listening to at least one magnificent oration that would have been made that day. I caU the honourable member for Maranoa.",44
152,Mr CORBETT,SESSIONAL ORDERS,"The problem of forming a quorum sometimes arises in this House. However, it does not arise for the reason that was stated by the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson). The honourable member said that the problem arises because members are in their electorates and not in the House when the House is in session. I think that the honourable member must agree that this was not the reason why a quorum was not formed on the occasion he mentioned. On very odd occasions problems arise in respect of the forming of quorums. On the particular occasion referred to by the honourable member when a quorum was not formed, the then Opposition constantly caUed for quorums. At that time government supporters were busy with business affecting their constituents and the people of Austraha. Each time a quorum was called they had to run into the House so that the quorum could be counted. However, when the quorums were called Opposition members did not come into the House. In fact they were encouraged not to come into the House. As a result the business of government committees was constantly disrupted. The situation arose in which members of very important government committees took the view that their coUeagues would form the quorum when a quorum was called and that they could go on with the important business of the nation. The result was that a quorum was finaUy called for which the required number of members was not present. I do not disagree that on many occasions there should be a better attendance of members in this House. The Whips generally-and I congratulate the honourable member for Hughes on his appointment as Whip of the Opposition-fin d that it is not always easy to ensure a greater number of members because of the increasing responsibUities that members have outside of the chamber in performing the duties that they have as members of Parliament. But I support the idea that there should be a greater attendance by members more often in this House. I would encourage and recommend that members make an even greater effort to be in this House in the interests of creating a better atmosphere for debates. Nevertheless, in all fairness we have to consider the reasons why government supporters were not able to form a quorum on the occasion referred to by the honourable member for Hughes. I might say that I was not one of the members who were not counted. I am very pleased to be able to say that because it enables me to speak more effectively on behalf of those members who were not in this place. As I have pointed out, the members of a number of government committees had to leave their work on a number of occasions to be in the chamber for a quorum to be counted. However, because they wanted to complete their meetings they did not appear in the chamber to be counted on the last occasion a quorum was called. I believe that the resolution moved by the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) deserves the support of this Parliament. It will ensure that the House wtil not be adjourned if a quorum is not obtained. I believe that this is a very good move in the interests of the nation. I believe that the Speaker should have the right to decide whether a quorum is available. Excepting for the moment for the sake of argument the claim of the honourable member for Hughes that the responsibiUty for forming a quorum rests on the shoulders of the government of the day, there is clear evidence to suggest that a quorum could have been formed on the occasion I have mentioned. But the honourable member for Hughes and others continue to berate the Government for the fact that there was not a quorum at that time. This resolution allows the business of the nation through the national Parliament to procould ceed at an earUer time than is possible under present conditions. Having made those few experienced remarks and having put a slightly different point of view from that put by the honourable member for Hughes- I think probably a broader concept of what happened on that occasion- I support the resolution before the House.",44
153,Dr JENKINS,SESSIONAL ORDERS,"In addressing my remarks to the matter before us I comment first of all that, as the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) said, the Opposition is not opposing these sessional orders. Secondly, would like to say that as a member of the Standto ing Orders Committee I have been a party to dissional cussions of the sessional orders. No objection raised because it is hoped that further matters wiU flow from these proposals. But there areas to which I wish to address some criticism. These are the questions of sittingtimes,the lack Wednesday. of a quorum and matters arising out of the changed adjournment debate. With regard to the times of sitting, honourable members would be aware that early in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament, because of transport difficulties and so on, bers tended to be here for longer periods of time continuously and so there was more continuity debate. That has lapsed with faster means of transport. There has been an increase in the of legislation that comes before the Parliament. There has been an increase in concern among private members in the Parliament about the mcreased power of the Executive. speaking just now on a partisan basis. I am not just referring to the present Government. There able has been an increasing tendency in recent years for the power of the Executive to increase out the corresponding examination by the Parliament. A third factor is the concern over the attitude taken to the private member. Instead of private members being active in the Parliament to examguided ine legislation, to discuss reports, to discuss isterial statements and so on, there is a tendency for them to want to be back in the electorate serving the social worker or welfare worker functions there. This aUows quite a deal of the increase of Executive power and lack of consideration of legislation. We do not sit many days in this Parliament. We do not sit long hours in this Parliament, compared with comparable parliamentary institutions in other countries. To allow those who feel they must be back in the electorate- I know there are a lot of members on the other side who worry about their electorates in the present circumstances-the partial answer be in the staffing supplied to members of the Parliament. Honourable members who have the extra efficiency they are able to have in their offices by the provision of the electorate assistants we now have introduced by our good friend Fred Daly, who understood private members' problems, will appreciate that that is a partial answer. If the sittings of the House are to be as proposed, perhaps there will be the waste of a morning. We are to sit at 10.30 a.m. on ThursI day, but on Tuesday and Wednesday we are not start until 2.15 p.m. under the proposed sesorder. It would seem to me that if we are to is have more opportunity for parliamentary work we should be setting aside one morning for party are 3 meetings-w e should have them on Tuesday morning-and sitting at an earlier hour on The question of the quorum relates in part to just what I am talking about. As the honourable I suppose member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) suggested, the Government carries the prime responsibUity for mamtaining a quorum. A quomemrum cannot be maintained if honourable members feel they must be back in their electorates or in ifwe are to have the party committee and parliamentary committee activity that goes on at the load moment. When quorums are called, most of the complaints of honourable members dragged to the chamber are to the effect that they have been pulled out of some party committee or parliaI am not mentary committee. This leads me to the next point. The honourmember for Corio made a plea about the report of Joint Committee on the Parliamentary withCommittee System. I think the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) knows that I have an interest in this because I was Chairman of that Committee for so long and through the permission of the members of the Committee actually and substantially formed the report that minwas put forward with a high degree of acceptance by members of the Committee, whether it was in the last Parliament when there was a majority of Labor members or in this Parliament when there has been a majority of Liberal Country Party members. Although an assurance has been given that some action will come out of that report, my concern is that what will come forward is a recommendation once more from the Executive about what should happen in the Parliament. It seems to me that, honourable members on both sides having examined this matter, before recommendations come before the Parliament, go to the Government party and go before the House there should be a debate in the House so that a matter that affects all members of the House can be clear to the Government before it puts its propositions forward. I think it will stifle proper debate if the Government makes its recommendations before this House and the members in it have a chance to discuss what goes on because this could very much affect the hours of sitting. The question of legislative committees replacing the Committee of the Whole is important. It could very well allow better examination of legislation, but to do this one will have to revert to what I mentioned before concerning the actual days of sitting and the hours of sitting. We may have to sacrifice the desire to be in the electorate for the sake of saying: 'We are examining legislation properly. We are examining the actions of the Executive properly. We are responsibly carrying out our roles as members of Parliament'. So there are many matters that flow from this question. If the Committee report is to come before the House, I ask that there be a general debate on it before recommendations arising from it are brought forward by the Government. Finally I refer to the question of the adjournment debate. I think there is a desirable feature in the proposed sessional order relating to the adjournment debate in that provision is made for a Minister to answer matters raised during that debate. I think this is a proper thing to occur. I refer to the custom that was followed until this Parliament. If an honourable member raised during the adjournment debate, the grievance debate or general debates on legislation and reports a matter which required answer by a Minister he received an answer within a week or two- a courteous note from the Minister saying that in the debate on such and such a day the honourable member referred to such and such a question and the detaUs are as the Minister set them out. I know that on several occasions in the life of this Parliament I have raised matters affecting my constituents in relation to which I have felt there has not been satisfactory action or answer. Not once have I received the courtesy of a reply from the Minister concerned. Whereas when I refered to my concern about the power of the Executive and so on I was not speaking on a partisan basis because I think the situation applied to both sides of the fence, on this occasion I state that there has been a marked decrease in this Parliament in the courtesy of Ministers of this Government in answering questions raised in this manner. I hope they will take some notice of what I say and return to the previous procedure that former governments of its type followed and that the Labor Government followed. Debate (on motion by Mr Bourchier) adjourned. COMMONWEALTH DAY 1977",45
154,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,SESSIONAL ORDERS,"by leave- I move: 1. That this House, (a) notes the agreement of governments of the member countries of the Commonwealth that from this year the second Monday in March shall be observed throughout the Commonwealth as Commonwealth Day; (b) notes the common heritage which member countries of the Commonwealth share; (c) commends the maintenance of the institution of the Commonwealth as a unique forum for discussion and the exchange of ideas between member countries, irrespective of race, creed, culture or colour; (d) commends the observance of Commonwealth Day as an opportunity for all Australians to re-affirm their commitment to the Commonwealth and (e) notes with pleasure that her Majesty the Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, will be present in Australia on Commonwealth Day in 1977. 2. That the terms of this resolution be conveyed to the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Associauon. Mr Deputy Speaker, as a result of an initiative taken at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting at Kingston in 1975 the member countries of the Commonwealth have decided that a day should be set aside each year to mark the existence and significance of the Commonwealth. That day, the first of which we shall celebrate next Monday, 14 March, shall be called 'Commonwealth Day'. The Commonwealth is a unique and important institution. Its 36 member nations are spread throughout the world and comprise nearly one quarter of the world's population. The Commonwealth is a free associauon of nations characterised by a great diversity of race, language, culture and economic backgrounds. It is bound together not by force or legal restraints but by a long standing history of co-operation at many levels of government and by a continual exchange of knowledge and perience. The very informahty of the Commonpose wealth structure means that there is no encroach-of ment of the sovereignty of individual members. The Commonwealth is more intimate than the United Nations and the rivalries brought superpower relations are more distant. The Commonwealth provides a major forum in which free and uninhibited discussion can place in a sympathetic atmosphere of friendship and equaUty of the problems and alternatives that face modern international society. Nowhere else, not even in the United Nations, do more than 30 Heads of Government together-as they do at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting-and spend a week or so discussing major issues concerning the world. The Government regards the Comironical monwealth as a significant force for co-operationmonwealth-Canad and understanding in the international commember munity and beUeves it should be used to make a real contribution to resolving contemporary ternational problems. We believe that the ters to be raised at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London are so imporvolve tant that we have established a task force comprised of all relevant departments to ine the issues and advise on how we may most effectively approach them. The Government also initiated consultations with Commonwealth leaders in our region so that we can have benefit of all their views. The Commonwealth an active and important organisation that contribute significantly to international affairs. believe it is mostfitting,that in the year of Majesty's SUver JubUee, and at a time when Majesty is here in Australia, a decision announced that, as from this year, Commondozen wealth Day will be universally recognised being the second Monday in March. It is with much pleasure that I inform the House that Majesty the Queen, will deliver her Commonmonwealth wealth Day message for 1977 on 14 March. I commend the motion for the consideration of been the House. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition) (2.48)-On behalf of the Auswealth traUan Labor Party I wholeheartedly support the motion that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has moved. The declaration of a Comlong monwealth Dayflowsfrom a decision of the secfree ond Commonwealth Heads of Government body meeting which I attended, that at Jamaica May 1975. We know it used to be said not many years ago that the Commonwealth was a debatI ing society or a vestige of a bygone empire. exused to be doubted whether there was any purin Australia's continuing to attend meetings the Commonwealth. At neither of the meetings which I attended-the one I have just mentioned at Jamaica or the one at Ottawa in August by 1973-di d the members in attendance regret their attendance. No member of the Commonwealth has to remain in it. No Head of a take Commonwealth country has to attend the Commonwealth summit. The fact is that nearly all members of what used to be called the British Empire on obtaining independence have chosen to remain in the Commonwealth. The fact is that most Heads of Commonwealth members choose come to attend its summit meetings. It is, as the Prime Minister has pointed out, an association of independent nations. It is perhaps that the earliest members of the Coma and Australia-ar e the only countries which are not yet absolutely independent of Britain. Features of their Federal insystems-amendment s of the Constitution in matCanada's case and gubernatorial appointments and Privy Council appeals in Australia *s-stil l in the British Government and the British Parliament. The Statute of Westminster is no examlonger an instrument of Canadian and Austrahan independence but an impediment to it. has AU other members of the Commonwealth, however, are absolutely independent. They choose to the attend its meetings. They proceed over the is course of about 7 days of working sessions with can an intervening weekend. However diverse the I Commonwealth is in traditions, cultures, instituHer tions and creeds, however unequal in literacy, Herhealth, personal opportunities and national be development, it is a meaningful forum for 3 independent nations of which one dozen as have the Queen as their Head of State. Her When the Queen became Head of the Comthere were only 8 members. Six of them are still in the Commonwealth. There has a great increase in the numbers of the Commonwealth right up to the present time and not least in our own region. There is stUl the very great advantage for members of the Commonin that their Heads of Government can still effectively and wUUngly use English as their means of communication. They can in the quite session every 2 years of their summit have a and equal consultation. It is a meaningful for a very great number of nations and for a in quarter of the world's people. trust I will be forgiven for making an aside It about the use of the term 'Commonwealth' in this connection. It is not that I have any inhibitions at all about the use of the word 'Commonwealth'. I have thought it has a very honourable history. It was the term applied to the British State under Oliver and Richard Cromwell. Nevertheless there has, I regret to say, been in the course of a reaction last year, some reversion in Australia to the use of the word 'Commonwealth' as referring to the Federal entity in Australia. I think it ought to be understood that the word 'Commonwealth' in Britain and in the Commonwealth of Nations has the significance which we use in debating this motion today. In the United States it has a particular connotation-formerl y applied to the Philippines then later and still to the Marianas and Puerto Rico-of a state which does not have independent international status. Accordingly, I welcome the use of the word 'Commonwealth' in this sense in the way that it is known by most people who belong to what used to be the old British Empire and most people whose nations still choose to remain in this Commonwealth of Nations. I will be forgiven, I am sure, for recalling once again the statement that Sir Robert Menzies made in October 1965 in this House: I myself have been in the habit of referring tralian Government' wherever I go. This is something mend to all honourable members. There are 3 particular points for Australia continuing membership of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth is composed, with one in exception, of nations which used to be ruled Britain and were part of the British Empire. exception is Papua New Guinea, which was Australian colony, an Austrahan mandate later trust territory. It was under Austrahan auspices that Papua New Guinea was brought independence and nationhood. It was on AusNations. tralian sponsorship that Papua New Guinea joined the Commonwealth. There is a second point for Australia, and that is the regional significance of the Commonthat wealth. More than half the members of the Comwhere monwealth are situated in and around the Indian Ocean or in the South Pacific. It is really significant regional association to which Australia belongs. One asks: Where is ANZAM and where is SEATO today? What is their relevance now? But the Commonwealth is more varied, more relevant, for Australia in a regional sense than ever before. At the last Commonfuture. wealth Heads of Government Meeting at the Jamaica, for instance, there were resolutions particular concern to Australia. Every nation Ottawa confirmed the Commonwealth's total support for the African people of Zimbabwe and assistance for the people of Mozambique insofar as they were damaged economically by supporting international sanctions against the Rhodesian regime. Again every member at Ottawa reaffirmed the need for the Indian Ocean to remain an area of peace and stabUity, and expressed concern about military bases in the region. These 2 matters in a regional forum are of continuing relevance to Australia. Thirdly, there is the fact that 3 members of the Commonwealth are a very large source of migrants for Australia-Britain , as always, and since the war, Malta and Cyprus. It is a happy circumstance that the Head of the Commonwealth in her jubUee year is in Australia. The Commonwealth has continuing- I believe, growing-significanc e for all its members and not least for Australia.",46
155,Mr SINCLAIR,SESSIONAL ORDERS," I briefly associate the members of the National Country Party with this motion. As has been said by both the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) the Commonwealth is a voluntary association of nations. Its to the 'Auscontinued relevance in the modern world is I comsometimes questioned, yet its survival is not. The Commonwealth has brought together a quarter in of the world's population in a loose affiUation, in a way which preserves the traditions of the past the modern conflicts of today.

I think it worth noting that it was a Commonthese wealth Government of Liberal-Country Party persuasion that first took initiatives to remove the right of appeal in Commonwealth matters to the Privy Council. However, as to gubernatorial appointments, I think that it is in that that principal differences on the Austrahan Constibut tution and its future relevance Ues between our side of the House and the Opposition. the maintenance of an association with the Monarch a preservation of the rights of the traUan citizen.

156,Mr SINCLAIR,SESSIONAL ORDERS, I seek leave to respond briefly to a sition number of matters that were raised able members in conjunction with these motions. pecuUarly the Government,49
157,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SESSIONAL ORDERS,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, granted.",49
158,Mr SINCLAIR,SESSIONAL ORDERS,"Le t me say very briefly because the matter has been canvassed by a number of honourable members that it is my intention to cause a matter relating to the report of the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System to be submitted to the Parlia- (a) ment for debate at an early opportunity. I say in response to the honourable member for Holt (Mr Yates) that I believe that it will be in that conjunction that we can best discuss the subject of standing order 151 and the matter of consideration of supplementary questions. At this stage the Standing Orders Committee has before it a number of matters which are not embodied in motions but on which there is some division. The matters that are before the Parliament are, ofcourse, matters on which there is considerable unanimity and it is for that reason that those matters are brought forward. I am bringing them the forward not pecuUarly as Leader of the House on behalf of the Standing Orders Committee. It is as a result of the Committee's determination We see in that they are before us today. The Manager of Opposition Business in the AusHouse, the honourable member for Corio (Mr has raised the question of interruptions the made to the 5 minutes which are an honourable member's right within the adjournment rule by one of the notices in my name. Obvithere are problems not only in relation to the 5 minutes but also to other times when from side of the House it is sought to interject, to raise points of order or to disturb an honourable opportunity to speak. It would be unfortunate if that practice were to be abused. However, I see Uttle way in which the Standing themselves can correct it. Indeed it is one of the areas where it is necessary for honourable so remembers themselves to exercise some responsiFedbUity. I see little chance of our correcting the Standing Orders to impose responsibUity on any On beindividual member of the House if he himself endorse the refuses to comply with them. The honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson), speaking as the Opposition Whip, canvassed the question of count-outs. I think it is of interest that on 26 August 1971, the last occasion on which the House of Representatives was counted out, in the 2 divisions prior to the House so adjourned, the then Labor Party Oppopresent 53 members and then in the by honourbers of both29sides next division members. I suggest that memof the House and not have a responsibUity to maintain a quorum. I commend again the leave is motions to the House. Questions resolved in the affirmative. NA",49

163,Mr LES JOHNSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Opposition is not opposed to this motion because it re-constitutes a Committee which has been operating for some time now. But I want to say that during the period in which the Parliament has been prorogued there have been some disheartening developments in respect of the Aboriginal and Northern Territory land rights legislation. Contrary to the provisions of this legislation the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly has taken on board legislation which is contrary to the principles enunciated by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) in that legislation. The Committee, of course, has been operating under the impression that its principal task has been to reconcUe the attitude of the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory with the attitude of the Government, as expressed by that legislation. It is a very dme consuming activity to belong to the Joint Select Committee on Aboriginal Land Rights in the the Chairman of the committee at Northern Territory, particularly because members of the House of Representatives who are involved also have responsibUities in regard to inquiries concerning Aboriginal health and alcoholism among Aborigines. It would be most frustrating if the purposes of the Committee were to be circumvented by the Legislative Assembly. In regard to certain matters affecting off-shore Aboriginal land areas some actions appear to have been taken which are contrary to the spirit of the legislation and the spirit contained in the Government's decision to establish this Committee in the first instance and to re-constitute it now. I am certainly not disparaging of the Minister vote, who, I believe, has been betrayed in this matter by the Majority Leader of the Legislative Assembly. I must say in fairness that the Majority Leader of the Legislative Assembly is not a member of the Liberal Party but a member of the National Country Party. I know that the Minister has expressed concern about this circumhave leave to report from time to vention of the decision of this House to have r these matters thoroughly investigated by both the House of Representatives and the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. I congratulate him and I sincerely hope that if there is any further attempt to undermine, sabotage or avoid the objectivity of this Committee, which is spelt out in the motion before the House at the present of this resolution, so far time, the Minister will continue to effectively represent this Parliament in admonishing the Majority Leader in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly.",51
164,Mr HODGMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What a lot of rubbish.,51
165,Mr LES JOHNSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not think that the Minister would say that it is a lot of rubbish. I acknowledge the fact that the Minister has stood his ground on this matter in a high-principled way. If he had not, one would find that many members serving on this Committee would not be prepared to serve on it any longer. It would be most frustrating for that to occur. I express the hope that the Minister will continue to pursue high principles in this matter.",51
166,Mr CALDER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I must comment on the remarks of the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson). He seems to have the wrong impression about the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 which states that the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly shall compile complementary legislation.,51
167,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY," I interrupt the honourable member for one moment to remind him that the House is dealing with a motion to set up a select committee. I ask him to suck fairly closely to that aspect rather than to broaden the issue, which the previous speaker, the honourable member for Hughes, bordered on doing but avoided very adroitly. I ask the honourable member to remember that we are debating the motion to set up a select committee.",52
168,Mr CALDER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I could not agree with you more. The honourable member for Hughes introduced this matter and I thought that someone should say something about it. I have a criticism of the wording of this motion and I have stated it on previous occasions. Clause (1) states: That a Joint Select Committee be appointed to examine and report on(a) The operation of provisions of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territoiy) Act 1976 relating to the identification of traditional owners of Aboriginal and the means of establishing the views of such owners to the satisfaction of the relevant Land Council; I am assured by various legal advisers, of which the Minister is one, that this refers to the Land Councils operating to the satisfaction of traditional owners, which is as it should be. But to me the wording makes it seem exactly the other way around. I know that the Minister will say that is not so but we are dealing with Aboriginal people and I would be surprised if the majority of them understood the wording. I am not insulting the few who do.",52
169,Mr JAMES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What about Charles Perkins?,52
170,Mr CALDER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,He is not an Aborigine.,52
171,Mr JAMES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What is he?,52
172,Mr CALDER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"According to the definition originally introduced by a former Minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for MACKellar, (Mr Wentworth), he is certainly not an Aborigine. He is not considered to be an Aborigine by the Aborigines in the Northern Territory. The honourable member should find out a thing or two about this matter. I would like whichto see some clarification of the clause which would make it apparent that the Land Councils are supposed to be responsible to the traditional owners and not vice versa. I think the word 'as' (b) pate between the word 'owners' and 'owners to the satisfaction of the relevant Land Council' would probably make it a lot more clear. I turn to subclause 12 which states that the Select Committee has to present itsreportby 18 August. I note with regret that it is a Select Committee. It might seem an adequatetimeto report on some aspects of these matters before the Committee and the Government but I consider this should be an ongoing committee. I think everyone who has any real knowledge of the Aboriginal situation in the Northern Territory would agree. Not only could there be other legislation introduced by the Legislative Assembly but also there certainly will be legislation introduced by the Land Councils, whose actions and personnel are being questioned very strongly in some cases by the Aborigines in the areas. I refer to the traditional owners to which this Act applies. I think it is a great shame that this Committee is to be a Select Committee because as such it goes out of action when the report is brought down unless it gets a new term of office. I would like to mention briefly that the leader of the Legislative Assembly has not betrayed anyone. He has not sabotaged or undermined anything. The Legislative Assembly provided land draft legislation to the Federal Government. It was the Government's duty to consider that and to consult with the Legislative Assembly. For anyone to abuse any member of the Legislative Assembly, and the Majority Leader in particular, over this matter is complete and utter nonsense. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA NA Motion (by Mr Viner) agreed to: (1) That the following matter be referred to the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs: The health problems of Aboriginals with particular attention to(a) the prevalence of different types of disease suffered by Aboriginals and Aboriginal communities; (b) the relationship between Aboriginal health and environmental, social and cultural factors; (c) the effectiveness of existing health care programs for Aboriginals generally, and the adequacy of Western European-type health services to cope with the health problems of Aboriginals, and (d) alternative methods of health care delivery that take account of Aboriginals' life styles, including camp situations. (2) That the committee consider ways and means by (a) persons with appropriate qualifications can be encouraged to assist Aboriginals achieve a better standard of health, and Aboriginals including traditional healers can particiin the development and delivery of health care services to their own communities, and in any modification of existing services. (3) That the committee recommend possible courses of acdon. NA Debate resumed from 9 March, on motion by granted. Mr Groom: That the following Address-in-Reply Majesty the Queen be agreed to: Most Gracious Sovereign: We, Your Majesty's loyal subjects, the Members of the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, desire to thank Your Majesty for the Gracious Speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament.

173,Mr HODGMAN,SPEECH OF HER MAJESTY THE,"Having last night dealt with the petty and vindictive pantomine of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whidam) earUer this week in snubbing Sir John Kerr at Fairbairn Airport in front of Her Majesty the Queen, the ludicrous and offensive remarks of Mr Donald Home in describing Her Majesty as a symbol of division in Australia, and what I have described as theriseof 2 bob republicanism as opposed to calm and rational debate, in the remaining moments avaUable to me I wish now to mention 4 matters, all of which concern me considerably. Three of them are related to international matters and one is related to the domestic policies of the Government. I believe that each and every Australian who has applied his mind to recent publicity of allegations of atrocities having occurred in East Timor must support the call for a full and impartial international inquiry into atrocities, whether allegedly committed by Indonesian forces with or without the approval of I Winston of the Indonesian Government or whether com1938 mitted by any other group in East Timor. In particular I raise again, as I have done on a previous occasion, the unresolved situation with respect the deaths of 5 Australian nationals, the 5 joumaUsts, who I have no doubt in my mind that this were in fact murdered in DUi in circumstances ing. which must and should be fully investigated. I which have set out my views in some detail in an article which the Australian newspaper invited me to write and which was pubUshed recently. I have dme, the consent of the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) for this document to be incorporated in Hansard. I now seek leave to have the document so incorporated. NA",53
174,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUEEN," Is leave Address-in-Reply granted? There being no objection, leave is The document read asfollowsto the Speech of Her NA 'The belief that security can be obtained by throwing a small State to the wolves is a fatal delusion.' . . . Winston Churchill (21.9.38). Any thinking Australian must be concerned about and distressed by, recent allegations of atrocities having been committed in East Timor. Many were gravely concerned by the act of annexation of East Timor by Indonesia, following the Portuguese withdrawal. I must confess that for some time. I have been deeply troubled about what happened in East Timor and Australia's reaction to it. My personal anxiety has been heightened by a massive campaign to brand any person concerned about East Timor as' pro-Fretilin' and therefore,' pro-communist.' This is not so. Even my most bitter poltiical opponents would concede that I am staunchly anti-communist and I have, on one occasion, been descnbed as 'the worse Redbaiter'in the House of Representatives. One could hardly call the Catholic Commission forjustice and Peace, headed by Bishop Mulkearns, of Ballarat, a 'leftist'organisation. Last December, the commission publicly expressed its dismay over East Timor, asserting that the situation (of up to SOO 000 East Timorese) had become 'critical' for food, clothing and medical supplies. The commission eloquently pressed for international humanitarian aid to be allowed into East Timor. The commission's anxiety has no doubt been increased by the persistentrecentreports of alleged atrocities. These reports cannot forever be swept under the carpet, and our penchant for non-involvement should not extend to abstaining from probing for the truth behind the allegations of massacres, and the still unresolved mystery of the deaths of five Australian journalists in 197S. In conscience, I can no longer countenance that we, as a nation, should recline in supine acquiescence. As a nation, we do not emerge with any pride or credibility in the eyes of the free world and those who expouse the cause of freedom. those allegations of Inspiration take considerable inspiration from the immortal speech Churchill in the House of Commons, S October when, following the Munich debacle, he said: ' . . . the terrible words have, for the time being, been pronounced against the Western democracies: ""Thou to art weighed in the balance and found wanting''.' Churchill went on to say,' . . . and do not suppose is the end. This is only the beginning of the reckonThis is only the first sip, the first foretaste of a bitter cup will be proffered to us, year by year, unless by a supremerecoveryof moral health . . . weriseagain and take our stand for freedom as in olden times.' The Munich experience must surely have shattered, for all the false logic of equating appeasement with peace. The recent allegations by Senator Kilgariff, and Austrahan Consul in Dili (Mr Dunn) cry out for prompt painstaking investigation, either by a United Nations mission (as Mr Gordon Bryant, MHR, has suggested) or visit to East Timor by an Australian parliamentary egation, as I have advocated. The eyes of the free world are on Australia, nations will base their attitude on the stand we take. We are passing through 'an awful milstone in (Churchill) and as Alexander Solzhenitsyn has said: obligation to those still alive out weighs (our) obligation the dead.' I commit myself to the course of acuon of seeking, revealing, the truth concerning East Timor. For us, as Australians, turn our backs on what is alleged to have occurred a gross act of national moral cowardice. We would grading Australia, and future generations would bear the same shame and disgrace which fell upon those zens of nazi Germany who turned a blind eye to Auschwitz by the simple process of saying exist-it has not occurred.' The dilemma of East Timor will not go away-it will not conveniendy disappear. The ghosts of the dead will each and every one of us who seeks solace in silent acquiescence. I cannot put out of my mind the knowledge of the thousands of Timorese who laid down their in the cause of freedom-man y of them traUan service men. Diggers Go into any RSL club and talk to the diggers, and they tell you of their shame that we, as a nation have today our backs on our former friends and allies in Timor. Is our nauonal conscience so dead that we can ignore cri de coeur for a full inquiry. Surely the Indonesian Governof ment would welcome the opportunity country's name. I commend our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Andrew cock, for asserting so firmly that our Government 'has not recognised Indonesia's incorporation sard, 30 October 1976, page 2016) and I and, I believe, all Australians now anxiously await his response to the recent revelations and the call for a full international commission inquiry. (Michael Hodgman is Liberal MHR for Denison, situation Tasmania.)",53
175,Mr HODGMAN,TIMOR APPEASEMENT MUST END,"I also take this to congratulate the parliamentary group of Amnesty International, and the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Ruddock) in particular who is chairman of that group, on the preparation of a petition which was circulated to a number of members of this Parliament and which in fact indulgence. was signed by more than 95 members of the Uament.

177,Mr HODGMAN,OF THE UNITED STATES,"I thank the House for its The next matter I desire to raise is in Parregard to Uganda. Earlier today we had unanimously passed by this House a resolution to alia, recognise throughout the world Commonwealth Day. In fact, it will be recognised in all Commonwealth countries next Monday. Quite frankly, I to do not believe that at the present moment is worthy to be a member of the British in Commonwealth of Nations, nor should its deI mented leader, President Idi Amin, be permitted to attend the conference of the heads of governthat ment of the British Commonwealth of Nations due to be held in London later this year. I feel that there is a very strong case for Uganda to suspended from the British Commonwealth of Nations because I find it impossible to reconcile in my mind that we, in passing the motion earlier, intended to convey to the world that Uganda had the same common heritage that we have, that it represents an institution through which the Commonwealth is a unique forum of discussion and exchange of ideas. I do lieve that any Austrahan could approve of this man Amin, a mass murderer, the butcher of There Uganda, a pathological killer of Eichmann proportions, who has inflicted upon the people of Uganda a reign of terror, murder, kidnapping, thuggery and religious persecution unprecedented in the world since World War II. Uganda is a country in which more than one Date of increase third of the population are Christians who have just seen their Archbishop slaughtered. Now the Standardtroops of Amin are going around the country and May 1976 persecuting and wiping out Christians. I believe there is a dreadful stench over Uganda today. There will be a dreadful stench Commonwealth if this madman, this maniac, is May 1976 permitted to attend the conference in London. I November 1976 appreciate that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm May 1977 Fraser) cannot at the moment indicate pubUcly what are the views of this Government. convey them in the appropriate manner to the Envoy of the British Prime Minister. But member of this House want to say that that the Government will make it quite clear it cannot and will not tolerate the presence Amin or the representation of Uganda at that conference. The third matter I wish to raise relates to Palestine Liberation Organisation. I must say that as an Australian Ifindit a matter of proproblems found regret that representatives of that line: organisation-internationa l terrorists, kidnappers, thugs and gangsters-ar e coming to Caneconomy berra in April of this year as duly accredited representatives of the International Parliamentary Union-at atimewhen the International Parliamentary Union refuses to permit Amnesty International even to have observer status. I not believe that the PLO should be permitted come here. If its representatives do come, then for heaven's sake confine them to Canberra. In relation to the economy, I adopt completely the brilliant speech of the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom) in moving the tralian Address-in-Reply. He summed up everything I wanted to say with respect to unemployment and inflation. But I do want to draw attention to the fact that as of May this year, by virtue be of our Government's policy of full indexation of ensions, the standard rate of pension will rise to 47.10 and the married rate of pension will rise we did to $78.50. Again with the approval of the honourable member for Corio, I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a table indicating what the Government has done by means of its poUcy of full indexation of pensions for the betnot beterment of the people of Australia.",54

179,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"Order! The I as a honourable member'stimehas expired. I hope Mr KEATING (Blaxland) (3.23)-The adthat dress written for Her Majesty outlining the of Government's program was positive proof of a total lack of any policy direction by the Government. Apart from a few glib references to the productive area of the private sector, the Speech the was characteristic of the intellectual bankruptcy of the Fraser Government. Australia's economic were dealt with bUthely with this one My Government is not only taking action to restore the . . . Then the Speech goes on to waffle about the fundamental well being and freedom of the Australian people. The Speech characteristically do dwells upon the miniscule housing voucher ptiot to scheme and the family allowance scheme which, it is worth noting, took money on the one hand from the bread winner of the famUy and handed it back to the mother without effecting a cost to revenue. Yet that initiative is promoted in the address as being a great social change. If the Auspeople were looking to that Speech for any guide to the Government's economic policy they were badly let down. This Government has now made it clear that it has no policy whatsoever and that it intends to bluff its way through to the next election with an attack upon the work force on the wages front as the only basis of its pohtical survival. Let us take the opportunity of looking at the promises that won the Fraser Government power in 1975. We will note that, as I said earUer, characteristicaUy they are absent from the Speech of Her Majesty. During the election period the main plank of the Government's platform was to reduce inflation and unemployment. Another was to abolish rural poverty and to increase the real level of farm incomes. Then there was the promise to start some of the major mineral projects that have been waiting upon world markets for commencement. Not one of these promises rated a mention in the speech by Her Majesty. This was because the Fraser Government has been shown to be unable to honour the commitments that it made during that general election campaign. The point is that the economic managers have faUed to perform and none of these important commitments has been fulfilled. Yet the Prime Minister of this country (Mr Malcolm Fraser) was prepared, as a Leader of the Opposition, to tear up the social fabric of Australia, abuse the prerogatives of the Senate and to do anything to tear the Labor Government out of office so that his Party could, in its view, seal the doom of the Government which was destroying the economy. He was given the prime ministership of this country without a majority in the House of Representatives and elected to government to do as I said, that is, to reduce inflation and unemployment, to abolish rural proverty and to start some developmental projects in this country. He has faUed on all 3 counts. Let us consider the economy and some of the indicators which tell the tale of the performance of this Government. I refer to the production statistics. The latest production index of the Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd shows production in Australia to be stagnant. The Australian Bureau of Statistics production statistics for January show falls in output levels exceeding rises at a rate of approximately three to one. In retaU sales the picture is the same. The momentum appeared to pick up somewhat in November but fell off dramatically in December. When deflated for price rises, retaU sales at the end of December were at the June level. RetaU sales in January feU a further 2.5 per cent. Yet the Prime Minister wants to reduce spending power by reducing wages and at the sametimeis telling people to have confidence and to spend their money. On what basis can any Australian employer invest in productive capacity when sales are down and capacity is presently underutilised? Of course, there cannot be any improvement in the investment picture and, therefore, there can be no improvement in job creation. Take the rate of inflation as an example because this was a single solitary policy plank harped on by the Fraser Government during the general election campaign. The consumer price mdex increased by 6 per cent in the December quarter, bringing it to the highest level since the Korean War in 1951, which was a record. The Treasurer (Mr Lynch) even claimed that this was not a true indication of the picture. He said that there was the Medibank blip. If he wants to refer to the Medibank blip, it is a consequence of the wUful poUcy of the Prime Mmister who, on an ideological basis, broke another specific election promise, upset the Medibank arrangements and imposed this cost upon the community. In fact, it was a tax which led to an increase in the cost of living and showed up in the index. Now the Government is running to the courts trying to squeeze the Medibank component of the 6 per cent out of wages. In other words, it wants to let the person in the street carry the total cost of that without being compensated for it in their wage packets. Even without the Medibank component prices rose in that period by 2.8 per cent. This was happening before the effects of the devaluation were even felt. In the last 6 months of 1976 the CPI rose by 8.2 per cent. Honourable members should compare thatfigurewith thefigurefor the last 6 months of the Labor Government in 1975. Therisethen was 6.4 per cent. So much for the economic management of the Liberal Party. Within 12 months of the Government coming to office there has been a 2 per cent increase in the CPI above the increase for the same 6-monthly period when Labor was in government. Of course, the Medibank blip to which the Treasurer referred will blip on all year. He will have the first quarter bUp, the second quarter bhp-the blip will last a whole 12 months and we shall see a massive increase in the CPI. Yet the Government will have the temerity to say to the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission that if it passes on the 6 per cent increase it wiU jeopardise the economy. Now Mr Justice Moore has to try to work out a way out of the problem. He has to try to determine a new basis of assessing the index and to try not to pass on the 6 per cent. When we said some time ago that the Government needlessly had upset the Medibank arrangements, that it should leave Medibank alone in line with the clear promise the Prime Minister gave, he pooh-poohed the scheme and introduced this abortion of a thing we have now. People, of course, now have to pay the money out of their back pockets. This is showing up in the index. Yet the Government, which said it would stand by the principle of wage indexation-anothe r clear promise-is now backing off from that principle and wants to refuse the work force adequate adjustment, which it was given under this indexation arrangement. To add insult to injury, the devaluation was the final pohcy step which capped and sealed the doom of the Fraser Government, in economic terms at least, within the life of this Parliament. This decision, hastily entered into for the benefit of a couple of sectors of the economy, when added to the mixture of prices, will see Australia settling down to a level of hyperinflation during this year. Of course, this will have consequences in interest rates, inflation and, therefore, unemployment. So after 15 months of government all that we have seen from the great economic managers-the representatives of the establishment, the big banking and finance men-is the prospect of a bout of very high inflation. When one considers that the Labor Budget was thrown out because it was said to be such a bad Budget and not able to deal with the problems of inflation one can see the phoniness of the people who oppose us in this chamber. No political party in this country has ever survived politically the ages of unemployment and inflation. I am now of the view that these problems will not be solved during the life of this Parliament. The level of unemployment has reached post-war record. At the end of January it represented 5.8 per cent of the population or 354 600 people. Of course, that is a very low figure because a lot of people are not registering as unemployed and overtime is falling away. Overtime hours worked fell to 2.2 hours in December, which is back to the low levels of 1976. Work force participation increased by 100 000 people fewer than in the previous year. With this level of unemployment there is again an absence of people spending because they not employed. They are not receiving adequate incomes, therefore there can be no consumer next recovery. Without consumer recovery there can be no investment. Without investment there be no job creation. So we have a vicious circle. But when the Labor Party when in government tried to introduce a wage indexation policy slow down wage increases on the one hand and a slow cutback in the growth in government expenditure on the other- a happy mix in the Budget which would have reduced and brought these distortions into some sort of harmony-the Budget was thrown out because of the political tactics of our opponents. We find that under the restrictions of the other arm of the Government's poUcy, that is, its monetary policy, buUding soaetyfinancefor home purchases and construction fell by 15.7 per cent m January, reflecting the severity of the Government's monetary poUcy. Property developers are falling over one after the other. All of the finance companies in Australia are writing off huge losses which came from the property boom earUer in the 1970s. But this is a symptom of the monetary pohcy of the present Government. It is sticking to a rigid rate of growth in the money supply, though the Treasurer is not admitting it. The Government has forced upon Australia by stealth a credit squeeze of fairly massive proportions which probably will lead to an increase in interest rates and a severe curtaUment of the amount of money avaUable in the community for lending. So the buUding industry and other industries which survive upon the avaUabUity of finance will have no opportunity whatsoever to get themselves off the ground and to get started again. Of course, the severity of this squeeze is affecting some States more particularly than others. If one looks across the board at the monetary ravpolicy of the Government, unemployment, inflation and the performance of the Government one sees a dismal faUure by the Government with no prospect in the life of this Parliament of any improvement at all in the economic indicators. a We will have a crude poUcital ploy by the Government to tough it out, to brave face the indicators and to say, as the Minister for Post and Telecommunications and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Eric Robinson) said, that the unemploymentfiguresare a myth. The Government will take this line of approach and turn the whole attack back on to the work force. There will be confrontation with the unions about the industrial bureau and the like and pressure applied to reduce the real level of wages. This will are be the Government's policy approach which it believes will carry it through successfully to the general election. It will need a lot of luck for that to happen because one thing that the discan missal of the Whitlam Government did for the Australian community was to raise very sharply the level of political awareness of this comto munity. The community will not tolerate these broken promises of and lack of performance the Government, particularly when it was ted on the basis of those promises. We recall ruthless manner in which it came to office on thefidence specific promise of reducing inflation and ployment. It failed in those specific areas. I turn to the quesdon of resources. As I menGovernment tioned earUer there are 3 areas of undertaking: The economy; the restoration of rural incomes cussion and the abolition of rural poverty; and the resolutionwhich improvement on the resources front. After 3 question, years of attack and viUfication by Government upon the former Minister for Minhave gained on what erals and Energy, Mr Connor, for faUing new projects, the present Minister for National retreated from Australia's Overall Resources (Mr Anthony) and the Government position of recent years and faUed nhard-wo have not one new major project off the ground 15 months-no t one! Yet this alleged failure again one of the reasons why the previous Government had to be thrown out. The export approvals which had been given by the previous Government have been repeated. The Governwas ment has said that it will allow the Norwich company to export its coal. It has given the kinds of approvals in respect to a couple of otherThe projects. But in fact no commencements have occurred in this respect. The greatest demonstration of the ineptitude of the Government and particularly of the visit National Country Party was the dismal perforAgain mance of the Acting Minister for National Resources, Mr Nixon, on his recent visit to Japan. Mr Nixon and Mr Sinclair, 2 of the seniorpacking Ministers on that delegation, faUed to exact any important commitments from Japan in the minerals area whatsoever. They chased only minor agricultural concessions and allowed the 350 Japanese once again to reassert their bargaining dominance in the mineral resources area. They achieved a small increase in beef quotas and chased some school lunch franchise. These Australian Government Ministers lead a major delegation to Japan and come back with some increase in the beef quotas and school lunch franchise. Mr Nixon attacked the work force the PUbara. He obUgingly accepted the assurmills. ances on export tonnages for coal and iron which were given by the Japanese and which blind Freddie knows will not be honoured. Of course the Japanese saw him coming and gave him the Une which, of course, the Labor Govern-the ment had refused many times. It was also interesting to note that Mr Nixon on returning to Australia said that he was happynotion to accept the premise of the Ninayama agreego ment of 1975 for increases in the amount of coalThe to be sold from Australia to Japan. When the by Labor Government announced the agreement elecbetween Nippon Steel and the Australian the Government, it was pooh-poohed as a contrick, as a phoney ploy, to take attention unemaway at thetimefrom the loans affair. Now of course the Government faUs back on the agreement and says that in reaUty it does exist and the will depend on it. There was no disof natural gas exports and there was no of Japan's interest in the natural gas I thought was one of the prime the present been sUent on thecourse considerations. Of the Government has mformation which we should commitments it made with to startthe Japanese on uranium. the delegation negotiating to estabUsh in any significant advance in the trading wastionship between Australia and Japan. relaThe Press had the hide to report that the trip successful and was a new step along the way Parkin buUding relations between Australia and sameJapan. What happened a couple of weeks ago? Japanese resource negotiators came here to try to convince Australian companies and the Federal and State Governments that they could not afford price increases and that there would have to be reductions in tonnages. The whole turned out to be a complete and total flop. these great business managers, these men offinance,banking and commerce, went up to the industrial colossus in Japan and were sent back to Australia empty-handed. Now the Australian extractive industries are saying: 'We might not have liked Connor but at least we got profits out of him'. The coal price increased per cent in 3 years of the Labor Government. We went to Japan and made it clear that Australian resources were to be sold at world parity prices and no less. Now the industry is calling on 2 the Minister for National Resources to do the same and to stop persisting with the foolish notion that it is a commercial transaction with the Australian companies deaUng commerciaUy in with Nippon Steel or with the Japanese steel The Japanese steel nulls are a cartel. They ore have Nippon Steel and Sumitomo negotiating for the whole of the industry. The Government backs them right to the lult. Anyone who speaks of'Japan incorporated' is certainly very much to pouit. One must admire the Japanese for it. They are sensible about the way they do their business. This Government persists with the that some south coast coal producer can to Japan and negotiate a commercial deal. steel nulls just devour them one after the other. These producers cave in on prices and of course the whole industry loses. On 30 000 tonnes of coal the amount involved would be $60m. In iron ore we are losing up to $150m a year in income because the Government will exercise its proper authority under the export control powers. The industry now has had ful of the Government and its nonsense about commercial enterprise and the rest. The industry wants some performance. There is an adage that in the days of the Labor Government there was no confidence but plenty of business; in these days there is plenty of confidence but ness. After a while it starts to hurt. Industry in Australia requires this Government to produce theI am the goods that it promised in the was in Opposition. I deal briefly and lastly with agriculture. For years we heard the constant bleating by the National Country Party and the Liberals about the state of Australian agriculture. Yet in months not one substantial thing has been for the agricultural industries heard a debate last week about beef. In 15 . . months the Government has extended the States ditions grants beef assistance legislation In the Labor Government's term of office $47m was given to the beef industry. The Government Ufted the export levy charge on beef and gave back to the exporters. The industry received nothing from the levy. Throughout the 3 years of Labor Government the Country Party encouraged extra beef production. Last week I read aU of the speeches of the people. Leader of the National Country Party (Mr the cakeWe Anthony) urging the beef industry to increase varying production. This week he is talking about withomy will holding beef from the market so that the price Australia are will go up. The Government has nothing. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics members oppositeseems estimates on net farm incomes are catastrophic. They indicate a complete social crisis in the countryside. I wiU refer to what the Bureau gives as projections for 1977 of net farm income return for capital investment, management and labour per week. In 1974-75 thefigurewas $ 186; in 1975-76 it was $162.33; and the projection 1976-77 is $125.87. The labour projection $169.48. One can see quite clearly the dramatic fall which is taking place in rural incomes and one can witness the fall in property values in country.",55
180,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES, Order! the The honourable member'stimehas expired.,59
181,Mr BURR,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"I find it unprosper necessary to make any comment about the speech just made by the honourable member Blaxland (Mr Keating). The track record ofhis Party in government shows that it is totaUy lacking in any expertise in economic matters. For him not to come here and piously teU the Government where it is going wrong is, I tliink, worthy only of a gutcontempt. The Government of course is prepared to speak to individuals and groups in the community which have a contribution to make on economic matters. In view of their rather deplorable track record in these matters, I find it impossible to give credence to comments which no busiare made by members of the Opposition. proud to support the motion moved by days when it Groom) proposingmember honourable for Braddon (Mr the Address-In-Reply to Her Majesty's Speech in opening this Parliament. 3 Some of the things that Her Majesty said to us in her opening Speech are, I believe, worthy of reconsideration in this debate.

Australia as a nation depends on creating the conwhich foster the strength, independence and creaby $ 15m only. tivity of its people. I think that this is something that the honourable member for Blaxland and his colleagues should it take to heart. They obviously are of the opinion that economic matters can be played like a harp string or by juggUng the load from one side to the other. We must remember the words of Her Majesty about economic conditions which foster the strength, independence and creativity of the should get away from the idea that is so big that aU we have to do is to serve sized portions. This country and its econprosper only when the people of prepared to work hard for that done absolutely prosperity. This do not to be what honourable understand. At the moment we have an economic crisis which we inherited from our predecessor. This as a Government has been working strenuously to overcome the problems in the inflation, unemployment and other economic fields. Our probfor lems are not just those which can be titled in is economic terms, the problems extend further. They become a social problem. That social problem is one of a welfare society. Australia and the this people of Australia are becoming more dependent on what they can be given rather than on what they can earn. If this attitude is pervading minds of people in the work force we can no longer look to prosperity because society will only on the strength of its own hard work. We have heard a lot of comment in this for place, in the pubUc media and in debates throughout the community about the unemployment problem. The problem is not confined just to those who are registered as unemployed with the Commonwealth Employment Service or to those who are receiving unemployment benefit. It extends to those who are currently on the payroll, those who are working in industries and factories throughout Australia, who are not prepared to give their job their best endeavours. Until we, as a country, are prepared to work harder and to put more effort into our jobs without demanding additional holidays and extra pay, we will not survive. We will pass on a sorry state of affairs to our children and to future generations. This was brought out by Her Majesty when she said: The prosperity of the Australian people depends on the strength of its productive private ing, mining and rural industries. I agree with that statement. The strength of this country is in the strength of its people and their determination to work hard and to realise this country's potential. It seems that groups in the community and a growing number of people throughout the Austrahan nation are saying to the Government: 'We are not satisfied with the present economic conditions. We want you to do something about them'. That is getting back to the welfare society to which I referred earUer. We, as a government, industries throughout the country and individuals in the society must realise that this problem is not residing only in Canberra, that governments cannot wave a magic wand and solve all these problems for the community. The problem is one that pervades the country. It touches every individual in the community. All of us have a responsibiUty. A farmer cannot look for more return from his product and at the same time be prepared to screw his employees for a lesser wage. A wage earner cannot look for a higher wage from his industry and at the same time be prepared to go on strike, which would increase the cost of production. The problem is one that extends to everyone. If the people of this country, if governments and if unions and all the other social groups in the community want economic recovery, each has a responsibUity to work for that objective. I am addressing my remarks not so much to the economic problems in the community but to the social problems in the community. Her Majesty said: With the growth over the years of the power of public and private bureaucracies, particular care needs to be taken to protect individual liberties and humanrightsagainst unwarranted intrusions. This, in my opinion, is one of the greatest social problems that this country faces. I believe that many thousands of Australians who are prepared to work hard and who want to accept the rewards of their hard work, their labours and their endeavours are constantly retarded in their ambitions by a bureaucracy that constantly weighs on their every endeavour. We have heard in this place and in pubUc debate about the impinging of government bureaucracy on the rights of individuals. This does not end with government bureaucracy. I find Uttle difference between the bureaucracies that are contained in large companies and the bureaucracies that are contained in unions. All of these bureaucracies impinge on private individuals. They retard growth. They retard ambition. I believe that all of them should be viewed with disdain. sector, on its manufacturThis brings me to the real point. What are the social problems in the community? The problem of bureaucracies is one thing. Their inherent power is another. The problem that Australia is facing is, I believe, the result of a bartering that is being conducted by the big three in Australiabig government, big business and big unions. That assumes that the private individual, the person in society is irrelevant and is nothing more than a small cog in a very big wheel who can be used to suit the ambitions and the purposes of whichever power body has the upper hand at a particular point. We must get back to a situation, as Her Majesty said, in which Australia as a nation depends on creating the conditions which foster the strength, independence and creativity of its people. That wtil not happen whUe the bureaucracies of government, business or unions constantly try to use people to do nothing more than extend their power game. Her Majesty reflected the attitude of this Government when she said: My Government is acting also to protect and expand politicalrightsand strengthen the responsibility and responsiveness of governments to their citizens . . . Steps have been taken to reverse the trend towards the concentration of power in the hands of the Commonwealth Government. This Government is conscious of the encroaching bureaucracy and of the power that the bureaucracy has to impinge on personal rights and freedom. In its various poUcies such as federalism and other poUcies it is consciously and conscientiously attempting to reverse that trend which became evident under the Labor Government. It attempted to concentrate all powers in the Government which sits on the shores of Lake Burley Griffin. People in our small State of Tasmania are aU too conscious of how power was concentrated under that Government. We strenuously press the Government to reverse that trend. I am quite sure that, in the words of the Queen, the Government has taken note of this and is acting to reverse that most unjustified trend. The problem does not stop with big government. It also goes into big business. I refer to some actions of large companies such as multinational corporations, particularly those which are headquartered outside Australia. I believe that the Australian people should be conscious of them and actively lobbying governments to reverse these actions because big business is equally as obnoxious as large government bureaucracies. A typical example of what is happening in big business as it impinges itself and attempts to obliterate small business is typified in the oU industry. As we know, most of the oU industry is monopolised by large international corporations with the retail outlets being conducted by private businessmen in a rather restricted capacity, usually under lease to one of the larger corporations. At the moment moves are being made, I believe most insidiously, by some of those large corporations to restrict the rights of individual businessmen-in fact I believe eventually to force them out of business-so that the oil industry and the retailing industry of petroleum products will become totally monopolised by a very few large companies. I have a letter from a retati seller in Sydney who has outlined the problem that he is facing in relation to the corporation to which he is under lease. He says that his lease is now up for review and that the company has put it to him that he should in fact accept a commission of $16,000 flat per year. He says: In signing this lease I relinquish all my access to profit on petrol together with the fact that I am obliged by this lease to accept1. all stock losses 2. all bad debts and dishonoured cheques 3. all cash shonages 4. to carry the book debts . . . So in other words he is being paid a flat salary but has to take all the losses. I wonder what he would end up with under such an arrangement? If this policy is continued there is no doubt that eventually we would see only the slot type machine retail petrol outlets and the service station as we know it would be completely gone and dominance would be given to the multinationals. But that is not all. He has a choice. In his letter he states: But the alternative lease is worse insomuch that instead of the old style lease of paying l.Sc a gallon purchased-the y now say to me that based on last year's gallonage, 49 000 gallons per month I will have to pay rent on this amount; my gallons have now at the present moment dropped to 29 000 gallons per month, due to other discounters in the area around me and with . . . He mentions a certain petroleum companyselling at 63.2c per gallon and me selling at the correct retail price, 77.3c per gallon . . .",59
182,Mr HODGMAN,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,You don't have to think too hard to come up with its name.,61
183,Mr BURR,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"As the honourable member says, one does not have to think too hard about what company that is. This is what is going on in the petroleum industry. We find that one of the main offenders in this insidious move to have monopoly situations imposed on petrol resellers and on the oU industry is a gentleman very well known to this House and much mentioned, namely, Mr Hawke, the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. It is his organisation of ACTU-Solo which in fact has led the move against the genuine retaU seller. What is he trying to do? Is he trying to establish a situation in Australia where our petroleum and fuel and energy resources are dominated by a few large companies which are headquartered outside Australia in America and England. Is this what Mr Hawke wants? I believe it is what very few Australians want.",61
184,Mr SCHOLES,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,Hav e you not heard of the IAC?,61
185,Mr BURR,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"I would remind the honourable member for Corio that we also have big unions. We certainly have heard plenty about the big unions in this place. The Queen mentioned in her opening address that the Government has certain legislation in hand to correct the monopoUsing power of big unions and the way they are able to extend and impinge upon the rights and freedoms of their members. As the honourable gentleman opposite would know, certain amendments are proposed to the trade practices legislation. I believe that these amendments will do no more than bring the trade unions under the control of law. At the moment they choose to, and can in fact, be exempt from the provisions of law. We are conscious of the fact that trade unions are up in arms about this move. Why is that? They want to perpetuate a system where they are not responsive to the law. What is wrong with having one group in society equally as responsible under law as every other group? The other provision that the Government proposes to introduce is, as Her Majesty mentioned, the establishment of the industrial relations bureau. Why are the trade unions so frightened of the industrial relations bureau? Is it that they do not want their activities to be investigated? Is it that they do not want their members to know how to go about correcting the monopolising power of their union leaders? Is it because the union leaders themselves want to maintain a situation where they can manipulate their members for their own pohtical ambitions and they see in the industrial relations bureau some challenge to that monopolising power? I think the provisions that the Government is planning to introduce in this session of Parliament will do no more in their totality than allow the individual society to have rights and freedoms that I beheve every Australian citizen has the right to expect. It was Abraham Lincoln who said that government should be of the people, for the people and by the people. Under this Liberal Government we are seeing this very meritorious statement of Lincoln's being brought into effect in this country. The Government s first objective is to have a totally integrated society without people having some undue advantage over other sections of society.",61
186,Mr SCHOLES,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,What about the Parliamentary Library? You are putting censorship in there.,62
187,Mr BURR,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"What we have to do, contrary perhaps to what the honourable member for Corio might believe, is to break down the monopolising power of big government, big business and big unions. If that means in the process that people like Mr Hawke have to have their wings clipped, I believe this will be in the best long term interest of this country and the people of Australia.",62
188,Mr FRY,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"It was interesting to hear the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Burr) equating big government and big business with big unions. What he did not say, of course, is that the inevitable process of big business and its move towards automation and technological progress in its manufacturing processes in the long term cannot fail to produce unemployment among workers. This process will not only reduce the number of people in the work force in terms of their productivity but also it will tend to reduce the skill of workers. As a result skilled jobs will become semi-skilled and semi-skilled jobs will become unskilled. This is a long term problem that has been created by these people. The problem will not be overcome by repressive legislation about which the honourable member has been talking. Sooner or later the Government will have to acknowledge the problem-no t just the present problem of unemployment which it has created but the longer term problem of structural change. It will have to do something about creating employment. Big Brother will not help them in this respect. I endorse what the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) said by way of interjection about placing big brother in the Parliamentary Library so that members have to channel their requests through big brother. This arrangement will not help the democratic process in this Parliament either. It is hardly necessary to say that most Australians today are gravely concerned at the extremely high level of unemployment in Australia. in I suggest that they are even more concerned with the forward projections of many responsible economists who consider that there is little prospect of a decline in unemployment. Many, of course, would go further and say that unfortunately the prospects are that unemployment is more likely to increase than to decline. I said 'most Australians' advisedly because while I know that most Australians are concerned about unemployment it is very apparent that there are many people in the Government who in their obsession with maintaining profits and reducing inflation in fact see increasing unemployment as a measure of the success of their misguided policies. Even though the policy of inducing unemloyment has faUed to contain inflation the ardliners within the Government still persist with this misguided policy. I believe that the lack of sensitivity and the gross lack of compassion for the plight of the unemployed is the badge of distinction of the hardliners who now dominate the Government's thinking. Some members of course are genuinely concerned at the way events are unfolding in the economy in Australia, but their voices are being drowned out by the raucous cries of those strong men, those men of steel who want to flay the backs of the unemployed; the men who want to brand them as dole bludgers and malingerers; the men who want to deny the very lowest income people in our country, the people who really need full indexation, the benefits of full indexation; the men who are completely committed to the idea of survival of the fittest; the men who are utterly and completely lacking in compassion for people who happen to be less fortunate than themselves. To detract the attention of the Australian pubUc from their lack of concern for the unemployed, Government Ministers have recently embarked on a deliberate campaign to discredit the unemployed by attempting to undermine the vaUdity of their own figures in a most shameful and dishonest way. The Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) on 28 February in commenting on the 354 589 unemployed made the extraordinary statement that these figures are largely a myth. They may be myth for the Minister, but I am sure that for people who are suffering under the unemploychestrates ment in this country it is not a myth; it is a and a very stark and harsh reaUty. He went say that there are many people including young people who choose quite deUberately not work. These statements were supposed to have statistics. been made on the basis of a Bureau of Statistics survey of November 1976 which was supposed to show that 147 600 people who left employ the ment in 1976 did so voluntarily. This figure and the numbers concerned were given great promialways nence in the Press-larg e headlines in fact. then a Department of Employment and Indusincrease.  First Assistant Secretary, a very senior man, the cat out of the bag. He threw real light on subject. He said: The information is quite incorrect. It is based misreading of freely available statistics. The survey ducted last year shows that 38.1 per cent of those interviewed who had left or lost their jobs had resigned voluntarily. There is no basis for the assumption that these people registered unemployed or receiving unemployment benefits. He gave the Ue to the Minister's statement. He also said that such survey figures were suspect because many people who lost their jobs ferred saying that they left voluntarily to admitIt ting that they were sacked. Probably the most pertinent point about these figures is that they were based on a very small sample survey small number of people who were interviewed and to translate that over to the whole field unemployment figure is quite misleading and deliberately dishonest. There are many reasons why people who leave a job may appear to voluntarily. People quite frequently are under pressure from their employers who want to pressure them to leave. Quite a few people come into my office, and I know other honourable members see them too, who say that their emmeat ployers have made Ufe unbearable for them, have abused them or have asked them to do all sorts of things that they are not qualified to do are not supposed to do in their jobs. UndoubtGovernment edly a lot of pressure is put on various reasons an employer may want to get of. Eventually the employees cannot stand the pressure and they leave the job supposedly volnothing untarily. There are the sorts of cases that these the Deputy figures are buUt on. As could be anticipated, Mr Kirby's stateinteresting ment, which gave the Ue completely to the Minis-Townsville ter's statement and to the headlines in the Press, was buried at the bottom of an article where only those who were reading every word of the article would have seen it. No headlines of course for a Mr Kirby's statement. This is the sort of thing we the have come to expect from the Press, which orits pubUcity to fit in with a deUberate reaUty,poUcy of the Government to take attention away on to from the unemployment problems and to mislead the Australian people by deUberately using to dishonest methods to undermine official I want to say a few words about the rural sector and the beef industry in particular because of emphasis in the Queen's Speech of the need to sustain and suppon the private sector as it is referred to and to increase those areas of But productivity where there is some scope for The beef industry is a complete disaster a area. An industry spokesman said recentiy that let low cattle prices throughout 1976-77 coupled the with a substantial increase in farm costs will result in beef dominant producers in the high on a rainfall zone receiving average net incomes of con- $3650 per annum or the equivalent of $70 a week. This is the private sector which is supposed were to be supported by this staunch supporter of private enterprise, the existing Government. This is forcing producers to continue to offer cattle for sale that are either unfinished or could be preretained until the market improved. is very interesting to look at the profit figures of meat exporters. I have tried to keep the House up to date with the very strongrisingprofit trend from ain every meat exporting company. It was interesting to read in the paper a couple of days of the ago that Anderson Meat Industries, one of the biggest meat exporters, recentiy announced a 39 per cent increase in profits. That was very good, do so but in the year concluded at the end of December 1975 it had a 102 per cent increase in profit. On top of that it now has a 39 per cent mcrease in profit. It would be all very well if the producers were sharing in this prosperity the exporters are experiencing, but, of course, they are not. The meat exporters are making their profit at the expense of the producers, and or this Government is doing nothing about it. This is supposedly committed to sustainpeople who for ing the rural sector. rid Of course the beef industry leaders are up in arms because the Government is doing precisely except offering gratuitous advice such as Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) gave to the beef producers last week. It is all so to see a meat export company at manipulating the market by stopping its buying from the producers at certain stages and kUling its own cattle, at the sametimekilling the demand in the market. There is a very limited time for people to market their stock. The meat company is manipulating and deliberately depressing the market. This is just another concrete example of the way meat exporters are exploiting producers and the way the Government is doing nothing about it. The Australian National Cattlemen's Council has called for a national inquiry into the marketing and distribution of beef in Australia and overseas. There is a crying need for this inquiry and the Government has been completely silent about it. The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) will not be drawn about it. Obviously he is in a bind. He does not want to upset his friends in the meat exporting industry. He is not preE ared to do something for the producers whom e is supposed to represent. There has been an inordinate delay in restructuring the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation. There has been a delay in establishing a national rural bank which was promised by this Government. There is a standoff or an inability to do anything about the way beef is marketed in Australia which allows exporters to exploit the producers continually. The Deputy Prime Minister has suggested to producers that they withhold stocks from sale to increase prices. I suggest that primary producers do not need him to tell them when to sell their stock or when to withhold it. Most of these people have been in the game for a long long time. They know the restrictions under which they operate. They know the pressures under which they are from theirfinancialinstitutions. They do not need that rather stupid advice from Mr Anthony to withhold their stock to force up market prices. A lot of them, of course, cannot afford to withhold stock. Many of them have a bank breathing down their necks to meet their interest payments. They need a cash flow and there are very few avenues of credit available to them. I suggest that in order to follow up the Minister's suggestion the Government should agree to assist beef producers to meet interest charges which will mount up while they are withholding their stock. The attitude that the industry has to Mr Anthony's suggestion is summed up by Mr Rod Black, the President of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation: The withholding of finished ducers to meet their already crippling financial ments. Indeed it will only increase the problem. Of course, it will increase the problem if it delays the time when large numbers of stock have put onto the market and upsets the normal ebb andflowofthe market. To come nearer to home, I just want to refer another disaster area in my electorate which has emerged as a result of Government policy. This is, of course, in the building industry in the Australian Capital Territory. In this area some very interesting and rather frightening statistics have emerged in the last few days. The number of people working in the industry fell 22 per cent last year. To bring these statistics further up to date, in the last 2 months building permits taken out in the Australian Capital Territory have dropped by 50 per cent. It is good to see that my colleague the honourable member for Canberra (Mr Haslam)-the independent member as some of us are calling him; he is a member of the Liberal Party but quite often I think he would much rather be an independent member and he might feel more secure if he were-ha s to his credit brought out the facts concerning the buUding industry in Canberra and described its deplorable condition. WhUe buUding permits have dropped 50 per cent in January and February total unemployment in the Australian Capital Territory has increased by 235 per cent in the last 12 months. It has been the most rapid increase in unemployment in the whole of Australia and this is in a place which traditionally is free from unemployment problems. One of the greatest deterrents, of course, to the buUding industry in Canberra is the cutting back on Government spending particularly by the National Capital Development Commission. Most of the projects which it is now completing were initiated by the Labor Government. Very few new projects have been undertaken despite all sorts of promises by the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Staley) that some great projects are just about to materiaUse; they are just about to come to fruition; they are just around the corner. They are still around the corner. I have not seen any major projects that have been initiated and brought forward by the present Minister for the Capital Territory. The other deterrent is the extremely high interest rates in the Australian Capital Territory on housing loans which prevent people who want to buUd houses from embarking on a construction program because they just cannot meet the extremely heavy commitments that are brought about by high interest rates. This is not helped by the increase in the stock will not assist beef prostatutory reserve deposits which the banks are commitcalled upon to meet from time to time.Every time they are increased this puts further pressure on the industry because it deprives the industry to be of some funds which are badly needed. I have tried to help the Minister for the Capital Territory. I have some sympathy for his situation to but I find him very difficult to help. I suggested recently that it would be very easy to increase the pine planting program in Canberra by 50 per cent. There are ample seedlings available. land has already been prepared. It is ready planting. All that was wanted was money to emwhatsoever. ploy a few more people. The Department did not want any more resources. It would not have had any influence on inflation. The equipment was there. The plants were there and the land was there. All that was wanted was the manpower. suggested that another thirty people could employed for a whole year orfiftyor sixty could be employed for half a year. This would have increased the program by 50 per cent. I not know what is wrong with this proposition. The people are available. It would create a term resource that this country undoubtedly needs. The land is ready. Everything is ready go ahead, but so far I have had no response. quite pessimistic about it because I think again the Minister has failed to convince Government that it should in fact try to get people off the unemployment list. Here was opportunity to get thirty or sixty families employment and back into productive work but the answer apparently is no. I hope it is not but I put it to the Minister several weeks ago I have not heard a word about it so I am beginnot ning to fear the worse. In other areas there has been gross waste. The Department of Construction has embarked upon a pohcy of not employing a day labour force despite the fact that it has hundreds of of dollars worth of heavy machinery for day able labour jobs just sitting there-graders , bulldozers prettymember and these sorts of things. The Government has insisted that the work be let out to private enterprise. The Government finishes up paying a Johnson) good deal more for the job because the private Speaker saying enterprise developer has to use his equipment announcing the 'Let and the Government is paying for that while its equipment is left to go rusty just because it has this crazy pohcy of cutting down on the day opening labour force. All the problems in Canberra have been means. deUberately induced by this Government. The staff ceUings set for the PubUc Service have tributed to a great deal of hardship. It has caused a drop in morale in the Public Service in Canopinion, berra. It will be very interesting to see the response of Canberra people in a few months time when the election for the local Legislative Assembly will be held. That will be thefirstopof portunity that the people of Canberra will have to say what they think of the performance of this Government. I am quite conndent that they will give a resounding vote to the Labor candidates and show the Government just what they of its poUcies for Canberra-poUcie s of deUberThe ately inducing unemployment and hardship in for an area in which there is no justification",62
189,Mr LUCOCK,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"It is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise to support the modon for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply moved I by my colleague the honourable member for be Braddon (Mr Groom) and seconded by another people colleague the honourable member for Calare (Mr MACKenzie). As has been said, it is approdo priate that this motion should be moved at this time when Her Majesty is in Australia and it is long also appropriate that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) should move in this House to today a motion in regard to Commonwealth Day I amwhich was supported by the Leader of the Oppoonce sition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) and by the Deputy the Leader of my own Party, the National Country a few Party. This is something that we should think an about. It is important in these days that we off unshould be reminded of what this motion and some of the traditions of our country and of this no, House really mean. A number of honourable and members have spoken today. Although they did perhaps quiteridiculesome of the traditions of this House they have suggested they were not important. Mr King-Prett y close, though. thousands Mr LUCOCK-As my colleague the honourfor Wimmera said, they went close to doing so. For example, I can recall the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les talking about Black Rod knocking on the door, the message being passed on, the him enter' and Black Rod message that the members of the House of Representatives are requested to attend the Senate in the presence of the Queen for the of the Parliament. I wonder whether there is a full appreciation of what this really This sort of tradition is a protection of the rights of this House of Representatives. It is a conprotection for every member of the House of Representatives. These things, are not, in my to be thought of lightly. In the early days the Crown was not allowed to enter the House of Commons. One of the reasons for that practice was that there should be no intimidation members of the Commons by the Crown. They should have the freedom and the capacity to pass legislation or to refuse certain finance that the Monarch wanted. This prevented, in those days, members being intimidated in any way or think being forced to pass legislation. We maintain the old tradition of the Speaker being escorted reluctantly to the Chair. The reason for that reluctance-it might be rather opportune in the case of the present occupant mention this matter in the course of the Royal visit-wa s that the Monarch might order Mr Speaker's head to be chopped off. If the Speaker took a message back to the Monarch which not approved of there was a danger that he would suffer 'certain disabiUties'. For one thing he would not need to shave again. Today, with looking mob. all the benefits and privileges associated with the Speakership, the reluctance is not quite as it was in those early days. What I am trying to reaUy. impress upon honourable members is that these traditions indicate the independence and freehave dom of members of the House of Representatives or, in the situation to members of the House of Commons. These traditions are important. We should remind ourselves of them because each embodies a basic with DDT. principle. I am amazed by some of the groups today that keep talking about independence. They say that we should stress it and that we should assert Yet those who are standing up and asserting strongly are in some instances saying that Her Majesty should have intervened in the situation in which the Governor General was involved some Uttle whue ago. Literally what the traUan Parliament was told then was: 'You are an independent group. It is your responsibiUty. Your Governor General is independent. There is no authority for the Crown to interfere in matter'. Yet those same people who talk about independence and who want it so much are the people who UteraUy ask: 'Why did the Crown value not intervene?' As I said, I think it is vital should think about these aspects. I referred to the statement by the Prime Mimsthe ter about Commonwealth Day. We should remind ourselves that Her Majesty of Australia. She is the Head of the Commonhalf the trouble wealth of which Australia is a part. As was said our people needthat by all the speakers earUer this afternoon, this is fact. It is of tremendous importance an important factor in our world situation at the that the monarchy is separate from the moment. I have had the privUege of attending life of this nation. Amidst all the changes one or two Commonwealth Pariiamentary Asthe problems confronting us this is one fact sociation conferences. I think that, weaknesses and with all the handicaps that there may be with our Association, it would be a tragedy not only for the Commonwealth but also for the world if that organisation were weakened. I referred to some people who are saying that we should be a repubUc. The honourable mempeople ber for WUls (Mr Bryant) made and valuable comment when he said that this was irrelevant. I do not quite agree with some of the tilings he said but I think that the point he to made about repubUcanism was vaUd. I had a look at some of those people who were outside when the Queen was reviewing the march past. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, for certain was reasons I was not able to be present but I watched the events on television. I must admit that the people displaying banners were a scruffy real as Mr SHIPTON - There were very few banners",65
190,Mr LUCOCK,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"I think that reaUy it would been an advantage if they had held the which I referred, banners not have in front of themselves so that they would been seen on the screen. Mr Katter-They should have been sprayed Mr King-They were a vocal minority.",66
191,Mr LUCOCK,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"As my colleagues have said, it. they were a vocal minority and they should have it so been sprayed with DDT. That might have been effective. I think that the only tiling one can say about those associated with this republican movement is that they are mental midgets and Auspseudo academics. One gentleman has never really been very successful, not even when he wrote for a particular magazine. I think that he is trying to show that he has some contribution to the make. He is puffing himself up with his own importance. I do not think that he is being very successful. I remind these people that the real of the monarchy in our system is that it is that we divorced from the poltiical scene. I remember that at a very important function I attended- a dinner in New York given for Her Majesty and Duke of Edinburgh- a very prominent is the Queen Americanmonarch said to me: 'You know, if we had a in the United States we would not be into we are in today'. Some of remind themselves of that and value poltiical and all of with all the which we can be very proud. Of course, we also have a respect for Her Majesty as an individual. Her character, her wisdom and her strength of purpose have been an inspiration to our Commonwealth. I recaU her late father and the inspiration that he was to the of Britain during those dark days of the an interesting Second World War. Let us look at the value of some of the trathey ditions that we have in this House. Although do not enforce it, honourable members are required to acknowledge the Chair as they enter and leave the chamber and as they cross in of the Chair. This has nothing to do with individual who is occupying the Chair but is mark of respect for the authority of the Chair. that were taken away, frankly, this place would not be manageable. I have had the privilege of serving under four magnificent Speakers of this House from Liberal-National Country Party governments and also under Mr Cope, and honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) who were Speakers in the previous Labor Governdelay ment. I pay tribute to both of those gentlemen under whom I had the privilege of serving Deputy Chairman. They contributed to the stabthe Uity of this House. These traditions have value and they have meaning. They show courtesy respect. Many people talk about independence. They electorate aUow some ratbags to come here from and run their unions. There is not much Ausallowed to visit this country. I believe traUan independence shown in that respect. Men like Carmichael and Halfpenny have no thought would for the individual. They are concerned only with Lebanon their own power. There is not a great deal of ter independence shown by some of the members of MACKellar) the unions with which those 2 gentlemen are further associated. If we maintained and thought a Utde Australia. more about courtesy and consideration, perhaps we might not be in some of the economic troubles that we are in at the present time. I believe that one of the reasons we are facing economic difficulties is that there has been too much thought in this country of'What is in it for me?' instead of thinking of the contribution that make for the progress, development and vancement of the country of which it is my priviyesterday lege to be a citizen. I think we need to get back towards that attitude. Mr MCVeigh-Tell it to Bob Hawke and a few ofhis mates.",66
192,Mr LUCOCK,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"As my colleague the honourholding able member for Darling Downs said, I frankly think that if they started to think of these things, we might be able to make more progress in the industrial situation in Australia. I do not say that the fault is all on one side. Unfortunately leaders of our industry do not play their part either in the community or in contributing towards peace in industry. I have said that on more than one occasion in this House. On this particular occasion when we are occupied with the Address-in-Reply debate, these are some of the things that we should think about because are important in our national life. Having we said that, I make 2 comments. This morning we had a debate on a matter of public importance initiated by the Opposition alleging the Governfront ment's incompetent handling of the Lebanese the refugee problem. I do not want to make any a comment on that matter nor to revive the debate If that was held this morning. I appreciate the Government's problem concerning these countries and the entry of these people into Australia, but I want to comment that I am surprised and disappointed at the attitude of the Government the towards the past President of Lebanon, Mr Chamoun, in that it has been suggested that he his visit to this country because of particular reasons. When he was President, Mr as a Chamoun worked for peace in Lebanon and in surrounding countnes. His effort always was directed towards the establishment of peace in and that area. I am extremely fortunate in the number of distinguished Lebanese that are in my and in the contribution that they have overseas see no reason why MrlifeChamoun made to community in that area. Frankly, I should not be that he make a contribution to the association of and Australia. I suggest that the Minisfor Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr and his Department might have a look at this matter and that the former President of Lebanon be allowed to visit I wish to comment briefly on the economic situation. I stUl believe that it would be an advantage to look at the situation relating to taxation at the present moment and not to wait for a I can further period. The honourable member for adMackellar (Mr Wentworth) made a suggestion which I think has certain value but, of course, like all schemes and ideas it has drawbacks. If one looks at the total economic position, anything that is done by the Arbitration Commission to hold the adjustment of the cost of living and of wages must make a contribution to inflation. If agreement can be reached so that the increase is held because of the adjustment in taxation, I believe this would be an advantage to all sections of the community and to Australia. I support the motion in relation to some the Speech of Her Majesty the Queen with a great deal of pleasure. I have pointed out previously to the House that I was thefirstmember of the House of Representatives to take the oath of allegiance to the Queen at the commencement of her reign. I think that we need to remind ourselves of the privileges, the benefits, the opportunities and also the responsibilities that we have as citizens of this country at this time in history. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of Government the Opposition) (4.42)-The Speech by the Queen on behalf of the Fraser Goverahave twisted and distorted ment was such an empty and contemptuous document-contemptuou s of the Parliament, have contemptuous of the people-that it is easy to the overlook its essential dishonesty. It is in fact the and they latest in a series of dishonest and dishonoured speech they statements about the Government's poUcies. Four times in 16 months we have had solemn assurances about the Government's economic poUParty cies and legislative program. They have all won. proved worthless. In all of them-in the election pohcy speech, in the Governor General's Speech a year ago, in the Budget Speech of the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) 7 months ago and now in the Speech given to the Queen-w e have had the same empty phrases, the same Utany ises ana the same Liberal mixture of sloth, comMy placency and deceit. The Queen's Speech, want regrettably, is no exception. It is doubtful now if even the Government beUeves its own propaganda, its own Ues and half truths. Each time there have been promises of economic steadily recovery followed by ever-woreening Eachtimethere have been promises to farmers, investors, wage earners, consumers and the disadvantaged foUowed by dithering, dodging omy and and delay. Each time grandUoquent appeals to this goal. free enterprise, initiative and self-reUance have been followed by attacks on wage earners and further handouts to the strong and the wealthy. The only thing missing from these torrents of promises and platitudes is the sUghtest acknowltion edgment of responsibUity or regret for the age done to the Australian economy and the Australian people, the destruction of great and creative programs, the continuing stagnation decUne and the falling Uving standards and diminishing opportunities which this Governcommitment ment is inflicting on the Australian people. Where is there any word or admission that under the Fraser Government Australia has the worse employment since the Great Depression and the highest inflation since the record the Menzies Government in 1951? Where there any word or acknowledgment that our problems are getting worse, that Australia is ing into deeper recession whtie the rest of world recovers? Where in this speech or in any other does the Government have the courage decency to admit that its poUcies have faded; interests. that on every important economic indicator the Government has been proved wrong; that hundreds of thousands of Australians are suffering our because of this Government's gross incompetence and reactionary poUcies? When is the going to give us one simple, honest, deUvered months its membersabout credible statement the economy? In 16 have wriggled and lied, they everyfigure,and they broken every promise to the people and to big Parliament. This is the Government of the Ue. TeU a Ue often enough and big enough believe it themselves. In their poUcy said: We have a comprehensive strategy to restore prosperity . . . Only under a Liberal-National Country Government will there be jobs for all who want to Today we have the highest unemployment since the Great Depression-3 0 000 higher than a year ago-and inflation is the worse since its record levels in the 1950s. In the Governor General's of specious promSpeech they said: Government's immediate objective is to bring inflation under control so there again will be jobs for all who to work. stale In their Budget speech they said: Inflation-and therefore unemployment . . . will be reduced by the budgetary policies to which this results. government is adhering. Now in the Queen's Speech they tell us: My Government givesfirstpriority to restoring the econwill use all the resources at it disposal to achieve The people are still waiting. They are waiting for action, for honesty, for sincerity, above all for results. AU they have had is waffle, false hopes, broken promises, bewtidering switches of direcas the Government lurches from one failed dammeasure to the next. First an investment-led recovery, then a consumer-led recovery, then an export-led recovery. One minute a staunch comand mitment to maintaining the dollar; then the highest devaluation for 40 years. One minute a to reducing interest rates; then interest rates rise further. One minute a pledge to reduce the deficit; now a deficit that in thefirst8 months of the financial year is already $ 1,000m greater than for the corresponding period a year ago. One minute a I7W per cent devaluation; set by then eight subsequent revaluations before is Christmas. One minute an announcement of spending cuts; then no announcement of what slidcuts are being made. One minute an appeal for the stringency and attacks on essential community services; then a series of massive handouts to prior vate companies and foreign and multinational This is the achievement of the bora economic managers, the natural rulers, the responsible economists of the Liberal Party! No one beUeves a word they say. They cannot be trusted on thing. Their statements not only also ignore the facts. The latest figures snowed the rise in the consumer price index during 1976 theThe was 13.7 per cent-highe r than the increase in themselves-th 1975. What does the Treasurer say?

That is his contribution humanity in tackling our economic problemsbe no benefits foraanyone unemployment is a myth. Ignore it and it will go unless he is actually sackedwho away. What does the Treasurer say? He says thatployer. In other words, the man who the record unemployment figures do not matter. After all- I quote his very words 'unemployment data are never among the leadtravels ing indicators of economic recovery.' TeU that to who resigns the unemployed and their families. So now we find the CPI figures are not such relevant and the unemploymentfiguresare not relevant. Inflation continues to rise and the Treasurer teUs us it is falling. Unemployment at record levels and the Minister says it is stable. Every new setback in the unemployment figures or the inflation figures is a 'bUp'. School leavers are a bUp. Medibank is a bUp in the CPI. Mr Keith Johnson-Colonel Blip? Mr E. G. Whitlam-Corporal. The next 2 quarters will produce a devaluation blip. Soon we wtil have a commodities bUp. All these Ues, all this doubletalk and deception have destroyed confidence in the Government and are destroywhatever ing confidence in the economy. How many thoutotal sands of school leavers must be trimmed from thefiguresbefore they are 'relevant'? We know the Government has resorted to stringent, hand methods to get thefiguresdown to 'rockand bottom'. We know the instruction that went to every employment office manager in New South Wales: Intervene personally and get the figures down! The only mythical figures are thePolicy'. ones produced by the Minister. They understate the real level of unemployment and everybody knows it! 'StabUity' Street, 'Mythology' Robinanyson, 'Rock-bottom' Lynch-the y aU know the defy logic but figures are phony. Government's fury and desperation with economy are vented on the unemployed e victims of its poUcies. They are ones who must suffer for the Government's blunders. Every day brings some new tactic of or humiliation. A whole vocabulary every household of Liberal invective the prejudice is used to unemployed-dole Gold Coast holagain in idays. We have heard it aU. Now hi is talk of the Liblotus land. There are new work tests. Aborin Queensland are to be struck off the lists about New South sions and tribalunless of unemployed they move from their missettlements. The Prime Minister Friday came up with a brand new idea for 80 000 unemployed people off the Usts in swoop. He was proud of it. It was one ofhis to sanity and great brainwaves, masterstroke! There are to by cannotfinda job his previous emmoves to a new city or town, the family that voluntarily to work interstate, the breadwinner who returns after disabUity or Ulness, the employee because of poor wages or conditions or to seek new opportunities, the person who quits work to care for chUdren or a relative-n o person, whatever his or her needs, would receive any help from the community if he could not get work. That is the sort of callous, halfis baked thinking we have come to expect from the Prime Minister. What right has this pampered patrician, cocooned in wealth and privilege, drawing his fat superphosphate bounty at the taxpayers' expense, to lecture to the unemployed that life is not meant to be easy? People are sick of the Government's attempts to blame Labor for the mess it is making of the economy and the nation. We have had one Liberal budget, one mini-budget, and the biggest devaluation for 40 years. With that devaluation, its effects may be, the Liberals assumed responsibUity for the state of the economy. They ruled off the book. They wtil stand or faU on the results of their own actions and decisions. underThere can be no blaming Labor now. The Ues evasions will not work any longer. The out Treasurer on 17 February quoted from a long document prepared by the Treasury called 'What's Wrong with the Opposition's Economic It was a false, tedious, tortuous attempt to blame Labor for the deepening Liberal recession. The Treasurer ought to spend his time more usefully. It is time he stopped looking scapegoats and getting Treasury officers to do pohtical work. The Prime Minister prates and moralises about pohticising the Pubhc Service while the Treasurer gets his Department to spend dozens of man-hours drumming up private blatant government propaganda. The same hypocrisy and double standards are apparent in everything. The louder and morerighteousthe Government's fulminations the more blatant deceit. The Prime Minister brought in a Bill last year which politicises the PubUc Service very top by making the chairman of the PubUc Service Board a key poltiical figure. The Minister used to rant about jobs for the boys; Government has already appointed four expromises, Liberal or National Countiy Party members to be judges or ambassadors or public onicials. know the Treasurer met his friend Mr Gyngell inworse. Sydney and fixed his appointment to the Broad-worse casting Tribunal. The Prime Minister used to moralise about overseas trips; in just over he has visited 9 countries himself and usually with disastrous results for Australia's reputation. On the economy, the Government has steadUyand painted itself into a corner. It has closed off rational and decent option and is left now with no course but to attack wages, demolish government programs, reduce Uving standards and cut back on essential community services. poured scorn on overseas borrowing attempts a Labor Government but unblushingly bornothing. rowed almost $US 1,000 million from overseas itself. Had it taken the Treasury advice and rowed further-the proper, rational and accepted course-it would have avoided its catastrophic devaluation. Not only did the Government borpromised row when it criticised us for attempting to do not only did it refuse to borrow when it should have done; but when it did borrow from overseasgenerous it did so at needless cost and with needless payouts in commission. In March last year the Government elected to make a pubUc issue on the Swiss franc market. It paid commission of 3.75 per cent to the cartel of 3 big Swiss banks and ignored the lower commissions payable private placement. In fact, the Government paid a commission of some two-thirds of $lm more than necessary. Faced with a rising deficit Government has resorted to secret, expenditure which it has not the courage to specify pubUcly. Yet while it demands evergrowing sacrifices from the people it cheerfully forgoes hundreds of millions of dollars in legislation revenue through handouts and incentives to min-curities ing companies, businesses and multinationals. In Perth on 2 February the Prime Minister gave for detaUs of the lost revenues estimates for next hisfinancial year. The 40 per cent investment allowance is estimated to cost no less than $550m. Incentives for the mining industry will cost $40m, easing of distribution requirements for companies, $25m; new arrangements for Commonwealth estate duty, $10m; the new system of income equalisation deposits, $4m; trading stock valuations and investments, $400m. No its wonder the Government is desperately looking for more cuts in public expenditure to pay for its from thelargesse to wealthy friends. Prime This Government must never be aUowed to hisget away with its record of falsehood and broken its slippery and devious dealings. It promised to restore the economy after the interWenational recession; it has made the economy It promised to reduce inflation; inflation is and getting worse as a result of the Government's decisions. It promised to preserve a yearMedibank; it destroyed the very basis of Medibank. It promised to support wage indexation; it has undertaken a systematic attack on real wages. It promised to retain tax deductions for home buyers; it is curtailing those deduction depriving half a million home buyers of tax everydeductions worth $40m a year. It promised to maintain federal funds for Aborigines; it has cut them. It promised last June that it would not oppose the flow-on of Medibank charges to the Itnational wage; it now opposes a flow-on. It bypromised to abolish the means test; it has done Nothing has been done about the special chtid care rebate promised in the poUcy bor-speech for single parent famUies or famUies where one parent is an invaUd. Nothing has been done to estabUsh a rural bank. The policy speech 'a bare level of security below which so;no one can involuntarily fall'; nothing has been done. The poUcy speech promised: *We will be to those who cannot get a job'. Instead the junior unemployment rate has been frozen at $36 and school leavers are being kept waiting up to 3 months for unemployment benefits. Nothing has been heard of the promised legislation on sex or race discrimination. Nothing has been heard for aof the promises in the Governor General's speech a year ago of legislation on pollution control and an effective appeals system to protect the applicants for unemployment benefits from drastic cuts inofficial abuses. The Government is doing nothing about uniform company law or the urgent need for the to restore pubUc confidence in the seindustry. Yet Senate committees have investigated the need for this legislation for the last 7 years. How many more company crashes and scandals are needed before this Government exerts itself? How many more examples of MinWales. eral Securities Australia Ltd, Parkes Developments Pty Ltd, Gollin Holdings Ltd, Cambridge Credit Corporation Ltd, or Patrick Partners? How many hundreds of millions of dollars of public's money must be wasted or embezzled fore the Government does something to protect investors and shareholders? The report of Mr Masterman, QC., tabled in the New South Wales Parliament, shows that Patrick Partners' accountants were aware of a discrepancy in the company's Uquid capital position nearly a year before the firm coUapsed. Nothing was done correct the situation. Nothing was reported stock exchange.

When Patrick Partners sought a practising the commission in June 1975, when thefirm'sfinanbecial position was already grave and known to be grave, the honourable member for Macarthur signed the documents for renewal ofhis dealer's Ucence.

It is yet another aspect of the national credibUity crisis.

It is every bit as important to prevent abuses and waste in this area as it is in the pubUc sector. Yet what do we find? The Prime Minister covers up for a part colleague who misleads the investing public. The only stockbroker in the Parliament cannot be a fractional profit share. trusted. If the Government wants to smear the Labor Party and prate about virtue and propriety, let it look to its own connections. Let it remember the deaUngs of the Treasurer, the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) and the Minister for Business and Mr Baume Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) with Mr to Licardy, a soUcitor struck off the roll for repeated up to disgraceful and dishonourable conduct during in the very time that they and their staff were dealof the ing with him, and banned from even being to it. employed in any solicitor's office. Let it conremember the activities of the honourable memJune 1975 ber for Curtin (Mr Garland), who was found to also have a prima facie case to answer on a charge of took electoral bribery. Let the Prime Minister disown the activities of the honourable member for Macarthur as he disowned those of his former ministerial colleague. Let him remember the meetings between the Attorney-General and the by Deputy Prime Minister and Mr Wiley Fancher- a representative, indeed the emissary, of the Queensland Premier; a man whom the power Treasurer and the Deputy Prime Minister recommended as a likely source of information for Liberal Party purposes; a man who has since been declared a bankrupt. It comes down to this:Sydney The Treasurer, the Attorney-General and the tralian, Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs this Government are associated with a soUcitor who is struck off, a financier who defaults, and grazier who goes bankrupt. And what of the Prime Minister's own connec-to tions? A report by Mr John Spender, QC, to the New South Wales Parliament was made pubUc Eric on Tuesday. It revealed that 2 directors of Gollinnection Holdings Ltd channelled $647,000 of company funds into their own hands. One of the the Liberal Party. gentlemen named is Mr Keith Gale, the former managing director of the firm. It is the Gale who provided the Prime Minister with full-time adviser on industrial relations when Prime Minister was the Opposition spokesman on industrial matters. This was a service vided free of charge-at no cost to the Prime Minister, presumably at the cost of Mr Gale his company. Gollin and Co. have since gone the waU, just as this Government and this Minister are going to the waU. Mr Spender preparing a further report for the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission on the grave breaches by Mr Gale of his duties to the Gollin companies. This is the man to whom Prime Minister is personally and poUtically indebted. After the gale we need a wind of change. The dubious connections of the Government are not confined to its operatives and hatchetagainst men outside the Liberal Party. Let us remember Mr Vincent Teresa, the American mafioso, determined. whom the Commonwealth Police met on his arrival at Sydney airport and escorted through toms there. His visit was sponsored by Mr are MCCrudden, a soUcitor who was a Liberal candi-they date at the New South Wales elections last There are some very strange Sydney solicitors who are prepared to do the Liberal Party's dirty work. Some years ago another stooge launched private prosecution against a Uberal member Parliament: He was later struck off the rolls. According to revelations in 2 Sydney spent newspapers m the past week, there is within the Liberal Party a dangerous group of fanatics takis ing control of the Party organisation in New South Wales. The Australian, no friend of the Labor Party, reported last Saturday: They are well organised and know what they are doing. Like the communists, their organising ability gives them a out of all proportion to their numbers. The extent of their power was demonstrated at a meeting of the Liberal Party State Council in last month, where, according to the Austhe group effectively controlled the meetin ing and 'delivered a stinging vote of no confidence in the State executive and the most senior a officials of the Party'. Who is behind this group which has achieved such power in the ruling councUs of the Liberal Government? According the Australian, 'there are hints of Arab money, of an influence from Queensland, of links with Butler's League of Rights and a sinister conwith a strange organisation caUed the Sinless Perfection'. These are the faceless men of same Mr In plain terms we have a dishonest and a discredited Government, a Government of lies the and broken promises, a Government that is driving Australia into deeper recession and decline, a proGovernment that is wtifully neglecting the urgent needs of the Australian people, a Governor ment renouncing aU responsibUity for national to welfare and national progress. Medibank Primeremains the supreme example of the Governis ment's true nature-broke n promises, incompetent management, an abdication of responsibiUty, aU disguised by specious propaganda. The Prime Minister is constantly telling us that the the dismantiing of Medibank enables everyone to know the real cost of health care and health insurance. Of course people should know the real costs of health care, but there are two things that reaUy matter First, to discover the minimum inescapable costs of such care and of insuring them and, secondly, to devise the fairest way of paying those costs once they are cusIf the costs of any essential community service high, a Government's obUgation is to see that are reduced to a minimum and that everyMay. one shares in paying them. The Government's obUgation is to the people, the consumers, the patients-no t to the insurance companies or the adoctors or the private health funds. If people of have to contribute by law to any form of insurance or community service governments must see that the money is raised equitably and efficiently. That was the fundamental principle of Medibank; whether or not we pay a levy of secondary importance. And it is this fundamental principle that the Fraser Government has destroyed-the principle of efficiency, of equity, of costs fairly shared. Everyone knows that the private funds are wasteful, extravagant and necessary; it is the funds, not Medibank, that the true source of waste and dupUcation. The pubUc is entided to know the cost of private insurance, of the private bureaucracies to which this Government has handed more than half of the operations of Medibank. The Nimmo report showed about 7 years ago that 16 per of the funds' receipts are consumed in administrative expenses. A Government that deliberately restores these overlapping, wasteful private bureaucracies is putting private interests and vate greed before the needs of the people. The Queen's Speech-this threadbare, empty and dishonest document-is the final indictment of the Fraser Government, the last gasp of discredited and bankrupt administration. In of it there was not one novel, constructive or ative idea, not one initiative for the welfare people, not one serious proposal for economic recovery, not one example of imagination vision or endeavour. It offered nothing. Its real meaning is this: The economy wtil get worse. our economic crisis and our national crisis substance deepens there will be more attacks on Uving stanon dards, more unemployment, more pressure on the the wages of ordinary breadwinners and famUies. Every government program for the people's welfare and security, every State and federal and for Mr local initiative for better transport and community advancement will be generality. The main thrust starved and strangled. All that this Speech is the slow and steady destruction of the best and accepted across this country.

194,Mr SAINSBURY,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"It is indeed refreshing to see at last eighteen twenty members of the Labor Party in the House at the sametimeto hear the speech of their bedifiicult loved Leader. But they must have been terribly disappointed to have come in here today to hear such a great diatribe. (Quorum formed.) I am indeed grateful to the Opposition for increasing the numbers in the House though I see that idly. Labor members are all disappearing again. I about to tell them what I thought of the speech just finished by the Leader of the Opposition E. G. Whitlam) which sounded to me very muchomy, like his re-election speech. I have no doubt many members of the Labor Party would have been disappointed in what he had to say because whereas as usual he did have a chance to speak unabout the economy and to bring up some conare structive criticism of the Government, he got caught up in his read speech in a great amount of sublimated gutit. The slander that kept coming out ofhis mouth was absolutely shameful at this time when we are looking to get this country into some form of recovery. I will admit that it was a well read speech. Obviously the Leader of the Opposition is going to the speed reading classes being conducted at the moment because he did speed up so beautifuUy later on. I suggest he priwould be better in a job at the Australian Broadcasting Commission than leading the Opposition which has shown so markedly not to be an Opposition. The Opposition has not at any stage in the last 12 months put reasonable and positive a alternatives to the poUcies of the Government, all and the speech by the Leader of the Opposition creis no exception. I wonder what the honourable of the member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) wtil say in his pohcy speech. No doubt he will be speaking later or m the Address-in-Reply debate. As I should add one thing before I move on to the of my speech, and that is that all of us this side of the House wtil be very pleased if Leader of the Opposition retains his position. Mr King-What about Tommy Uren? SAINSBURY-The honourable member cities, health care, TheHindmarsh Queen' s (Mr Clyde Cameron) is smiling. Speech was, of necessity, one of of the Government's offers economic policy is well known her basically well speech the My Government is not only taking action to restore the it is also making social reforms which are of fundamental importance to the freedom and well-being of the That presents the balance of our Government. We are taking action to restore the economy. We are making social reforms. To do both at the or same time is not a simple job. The previous Labor Government showed very clearly how it was to try to do both. No doubt it would have Uked to have restored the economy every few months when it saw how swiftly the economy was going down htil. It did make social reforms, we wtil admit. It made them very rapWithin the context of absolutely disastrous was management by the previous government, it was impossible to keep the thrust of social reforms (Mr gomg because unless we have a restored econan economy that can stand social reforms, that an economy that is properly managed so that social reforms can be afforded by the people of Australia, those social reforms cannot be carried forward. Social reforms will break down if we do not have real productivity in the country to for them. There is great pressure on the present GovernGovernment ment because of its absolute commitment to social well-being of the people of Australia. the same time it has an obligation to restore economy which we found in such disastrous cumstances in December 1975. The pressure balance the Budget is creating all sorts of probfact, lems for the Government. We must remember that we have obligations. We have obligations pensioners, and we have stuck by the pensioners. We have introduced important reforms in pensions. We have stuck by our commitments fence. In 1975 it looked as if it would not long before the typical fear of the socialists defence forces would bring about a run down the forces which would leave us completely with our pants down. It was obvious to us that we to find money to spend on defence. It was ous to us that because of the run down in the value of the dollar aged people were suffering. was obvious to us that the child endowment sysployees tem had become out of date because of the of the payments being made and that necessary reforms had to be made. The Budget is still running at historically high levels. It is a great problem and a worry to the Government that we are spending more shall money than we are raising in taxes. It is putting tremendous pressure on the interest rate ture of this country. We, as a responsible Government, must borrow the money to cover the Budget deficit. That is what we are doing. are not printing money, as the then Labor face Government was proposing to do. We are boryear rowing money but in doing so we are putting pressure on interest rates. As I have said, there great pressure to balance the budget but there are so many areas in which money needs to be spent that that is still an extremely difficult lem. Therefore, the social reforms to which are committed are continuing at cost to inflation rises. and to the general economy. The paradox in which we are trying to exist, that of restoring the forThe economy at the same time as making social This was of great reforms, is a difficult paradox in which to fit. I was reminded of the mendacity of the sition when I heard the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) this afternoon ridiculing the Government for the increases in the conhave sumer price index. I often hear him urging rises and tax rises. He must be urging taxrisesiflocked he is talking about paying for some of the travagant programs that the Opposition appears to advocate fromtimeto time. He, like so many members of the Opposition, is always urging pay pricerises.What other construction could one put on the fact that the Opposition wanted the to pay so much more to buy ships in the Australia? What construction could one put on At that idea other than that the Opposition wants the pricerises?It worries the Government when the cirOpposition keeps talking about how we are to increasing the consumer price index when, in it is the Opposition's poUcies, if there are any, that would rapidly increase the CPI and to bring about higher inflation. The Government's position is extremely difficult. Because we have this opportunity to speak in on dethe debate on the Address-in-Reply to the be too Queen's Speech, following the prorogation of about Parliament, I should Uke to review briefly the of past year on some respects and to look at the future as it applies specifically to my electorate of hadEden-Monaro. Many things have been done for obvimy electorate by this Government in the last realyear. I remind the Opposition that it is often It repeated in my electorate by employers and emthat inflation really is the main problem size and that the rise in costs under the Labor administration left an indeUble scar especially in the rural sector of my electorate which is very stuggling even at atimewhen prices are beginning to nse in some sectors of the rural industry. I refer to some sectors of the rural industry. I shall refer to some of the things that the Governstrucment has done for the electorate of Eden Monaro. Like so many other honourable members in this House I represent a large number of Wepensioners. I think it was admirable that in the of having to make cuts in so many areas last we were able to introduce automatic adjustments to pensions. That has never been done beis fore. The fact that it has never been done has often been repeated by honourable members on this side of the House. The pensioners hi my area probhave some degree of security now that poltiical we decisions will not be involved in their pension Government also relaxed the means test pensions and the assets test was removed. help to people especially in the coastal region of my electorate. It was a bold Oppomove. If some honourable members opposite who, I believe, remain closeted in the inner city areas would go out and see how some people been struggling in rural areas and towns wage they would find that many people have been into assets that do not bear any income. exThese people have been struggling at a time when, having worked very hard throughout their Uves, they deserve a pension. It was this Government that brought in that innovation. The honourable member for Blaxlandridiculedthe rural sector, as he always does. I think he sort of a spokesman for the rural industry. He said that not one substantial thing has been for primary industry. He ought to go into area and talk to the wool growers. He should them what they thought about the previous Government's policy towards the wool support plan. The wool growers can see that recent innovations in the Australian Wool Corporation have meant a real increase in income at a time when it was desperately needed. Let him talk to great all the farmers about the price escalations that reaching occurred between 1972 and 1975. Do not let the no Leader of the Opposition teU the Australian public as he did in his read speech over the radio this near afternoon that inflation is not falling. Of inflation is coming down. It has over 4 per cent in the last 12 months. That is admirable result, it has been achieved despite the destructive criticism that we have had when the ever we have wanted to cut the size of the Service and cut programs that are costing the Australian taxpayer so much money. In my electorate of Eden-Monaro there have decreasing. been at least some moves towards more fundingwtil for roads. This is an important item in any large electorate. There have been 2 increases over above aUocations proposed by the previous to Labor Government in respect of road grants. Only in the last few months the Minister for to Transport (Mr Nixon) had an openfightby way of letters with the State Minister for Transport New South Wales about how money would be government. allocated. (Quorum formed) Doesn't the truth hurt. Honourable members opposite do not like what I am saying. Probably they should The remember that I am always short-no t in stature so much, but I am always as short and to the point as my engineering background requires. I have been talking about some of the good things that have happened in my electorate. Nine projects for aged people have been fundedwe in my electorate for this triennium- 9 projects out of a possible ten. I am not the only member around Australia in whose electorate a great of money is being spent on the aged. As I have said, these people have been neglected because of the rundown in the real value of the dollar over the Labor Party's regime. Many things are in the pipeline. Only or so ago pensioners received another increase their rate of pension. In the rural sector the posal to estabUsh a meat and Uvestock corporin ation is to be cleaned up, properly we hope, within a week or so. Meat StabUisation is someas thing of which I have been an advocate for somegram time. Hopefully within the next year or so alter is someproper consultation has taken place such a scheme wtil be introduced into this country. The done Leader of the Opposition dismissed the rural my bank as something on which the Government ask has not acted. It is something on which the Government is acting and which the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) has said we should look forward to in the next Budget. More money is to go into rural local roads in my electorate in the next year. There wtil be a increase of the order of 40 per cent. The far report on the aged and infirm, on which doubt the Government will be acting in the future, is another indication of our concern course for social reform within the context of the come down by recovery of the economy. an At the beginning of the thirtieth Parliament I aU spoke during the Address-in-Reply debate about divisiveness that has been built up in this PubUc country following the Labor Party's time in power. I said that diversity was required in this country and not divisiveness. Divisiviness is We have introduced legislationamendments to the Trade Practices Act-that reduce divisiveness in terms of employers andand the actions of employees. We are returning diversity in this country. We are returning to the thrust in this country that we had been used having over many years-the thrust that is brought about only by having the work in this in country done by private enterprise, not big The gross national product moved up last year as distinct from the trends in the previous 2 years. fact that it moved up is something that so many of the newspapers forget to report. We are having smaller government and we are giving people something to spend, something to use as they seefit.We are moving away from the dullness, the stagnation and the dehumanisation that would have in the socialistic society that a Labor government would bring about. The Leader of the Opposition's speech was fuU of dealgarbage and slander. I am pleased that I have been able to speak about Australia, about the people of my electorate and about the people of this Commonwealth. They matter to us in the Liberal and National Country Parties. a week Mr UREN (Reid (5.31)-The honourable in member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury) protalked about the good things that had occurred his electorate. He omitted to mention other things that have occurred in his electorate, such the stopping of the area improvement proand the reduction in the special assistance provided to local government and councils like those in the Queanbeyan Shire and the shires the South Coast of New South Wales. He also omitted to mention what happened to the assist in any way. ance that was formerly given under the Australian Assistance Plan. How good is that now? has ceased. The honourable member talked about how well the people of Eden-Monaro have fared under this Government and how farm the income has fared under this Government. In this financial year alone there has been a drop of 30 per cent in farm income; even after devaluation the reduction is running at 8 per cent. The honourable member represents a semi-rural particular electorate. Farm income has decreased by 36 per cent smce 1973. Farm income has faUen from $15,900 in 1973 to $5,700 in 1976. That shows how the rural sectors of this country are suffering under this Government. Farm income is at the lowest level of any year since 1973. We all know that the Queen has a duty to mouth the words prepared for her by the governnot ment of the day. I mtend no disrespect to the Monarch by describing the Speech before the House as the most deeply disturbing I have ever heard. It is a speech which should stir every Aus-will traUan to a very deep anger. It is very much statement of the personal phUosophy of one tal into mining. man-Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. We all know that for many years the Prime Minister has given a weekly broadcast to his electorate. These talks provide the most damaging expression Malcolm Fraser's narrow ideology and his reacment tionary outlook on poUtics and the economy. Queen's address was phrased in the style of Malcolm Fraser's sermons to his electorate. the text was sUpped into the sequence of the Wannon electorate broadcasts I doubt whether anyone could tell the difference.",73
195,Mr YATES,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,I rise to a point of order. I thought it was customary in this honourable House for honourable member to refer to the Prime Minishave ter as either the Prime Minister or the honourno able member for Wannon and not just Malcolm Fraser in such a vulgar way.,76
196,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,That portunity is correct. I did intend to stop the Deputy of the Opposition at the end of the sentence.,76
197,Mr UREN,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,It is a shame to see an address by a Head of State degraded to such a level. Unfor-sector tunately we must accept it in terms of a conthe sidered statement by the Prime Minister of what he beUeves in and what he is trying to do with this country. The insights it gives us are truly alarming. Government supporters interjecting,76
198,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,Order! The interon jections that are coming from the Government side of the chamber are not helping the situation,76
199,Mr UREN,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"The statement is imprinted with It the Prime Minister's phUosophy- a phUosophy which we reject as regressive and reactionary and which we will fight to the last. The essence of speech is the Prime Minister's obsession with giving an open cheque to the private sector. This should be quaUfied because the Prime Minister and his Government are not dedicated to the interests of the whole of the private sector. In they reject the crisis of manufacturing, the sector which employs a large part of the Australian work force. They want to protect only a small element of the private sector-the speculators who reaped more than $1 billion from the devaluation of the Australian dollar and the multinational miners. That is what the Government means by the productive private sector. It does assist the manufacturers and it does not benefit the vast majority of the rural sector. Both sectors face grave problems from the Government's favouring of the mining industry. Both suffer because their terms of trade will wora sen and because of the massive draining of capiTurning to the broad generalisation which makes up most of the Queen's Speech, we reject the whole phUosophy which underlies it. It states of quite hypocritically the Government's committo mcrease the freedom, opportunity and TheequaUty of the Australian people. It goes on to express concern about enhancing people's abUity If to make their own choices and Uve their own Uves in their own way. Both propositions are absurd in the context of the massive unemployment which we now face. In simple terms, the degree of inequaUty in the community increases as an unemployment increases. Unemployed people no choice but bare subsistence. They have freedom but the freedom to survive. They have no equaUty except with their feUow unemployed. Certainly they Uve their Uves in their own way but they lead grim Uves lacking any real opor dignity. This is the true meaning of Leader the cliches about freedom, equality and opportunity. The Government's blatant program of pubUc bashing has increased unemployment. In last year of the Labor Government there was a steady improvement in employment prospects. We recognised that this improvement was dependent on sustained pubUc sector spending, in particular on keeping up the spending levels on capital works programs which provide jobs. The Fraser Government rejects this approach. In the double talk of the Queen's Speech, it reduced own relative demand on national resources. plain English, it wiped out capital spending it wiped out jobs. It increased the damage providing investment incentives for private panies. In effect, companies were encouraged replace workers with machines. Mining comopportunities panies that undertake large capital expenditure provide relatively few jobs. The result the chaos which now confronts us- a battered labour market and a constant decline in long term job creation. In the face of bad structural problems in economy, the Government has adopted the worse possible mix of measures. It has encouraged private firms to trim their work and devote all of their resources to investment new equipment. This trend might have been inevitable but it should not have been speeded neglect. up when jobs are the most vital need in this try. At the same dme the Government has not used its powers to create jobs, not even temporof ary jobs. It has deliberately wiped out thousandsirony of existing jobs. We now face the fact that employment problems now facing Australia not a passing phase. We are in a position of severe structural unemployment. It has been emerging over the past 10 to 15 years and now its impact has been multiphed by the world wide cession. If there should be some sort of economicmission recovery, and on the latest figures we see Uttle hope of an early Uft in the economy, employmentone will not return to former levels. A simUar pattern has occurred in all of Western economies. According to the Organistion ation for Economic Co-operation and DevelopGovernment. ment, unemployment will rise in its member these countries during 1977. There will be Utde improvement in employment for at least The OECD is not noted for putting forward soft In the options, but to its credit it has supported the use munity, of the pubUc sector to create jobs and to ease thetect the my misery of unemployment. This Government prepared to use the OECD when it suits its pose but it ignores the OECD's advice to proach the unemployment problem with bureau'. compassion. This is the reaUty behind the claim in the Queen's Speech that the Government's econit omic program is designed to overcome unemsubject ployment. This is the reaUty behind the Prime Minister's completely fictitious claim that 80 people left their jobs without another job in view.for The reference to programs designed to assist young people who are out of work is just as temptible. The Uttle that has been done has beenthe directed to areas which are not those which have its the greatest need. The western sectors of Sydney In and Melbourne have been virtuaUy untouched and by these programs. There is no doubt that the by crushing burden of unemployment exists in these comareas. There is Uttle evidence that the Governto ment's programs have had an impact on job in provincial cities or country towns where unemployment is also concentrated. has been These programs might have been of some benefit as pilot programs in an economy where there were structural problems but the level of unemployment was generaUy stable. This is not the the case in Australia at the moment. We need extensive employment development schemes directed and funded by the Australian Governforcement and we need them now. The Government inhas shirked this responsibUity and it cannot point to the few meagre youth programs to absolve its counI turn now from unemployment to another issue raised by the Queen's Speech-the question industrial relations.

A number of measures for the protection of fundamental freedoms were outlined such as those relating to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Commonre-wealth Ombudsman, the Human Rights Comand the freedom of information legislation.

However there was no menof that or recognition of it on the part of this The Speech went on to extend principles to the area of industrial relations and here the crunch comes.

Let me remind House that this Government put these words into the mouth of a monarch who is also the Queen of England, the home of the social conceptance tract. We should remind the Fraser Government that the British Labour Government, like other enlightened governments in Europe, has sought the co-operation of the trade union movement, not confrontation with it. It consulted with British trade union movement and entered with it into a contractual agreement which has come known as the social contract. In return trade unions acted with restraint and patience a time of economic difficulty and the British Government made concessions which recognise the great burdens borne by those workers. Thereonly was a spirit of co-operation and conciliation dme of extreme economic hardship. We face just as pressing problems here in Australian economy yet wefindno spirit of coother operation or conciliation on the part of the Fraser Government. It looks for coercion and confrontation. The Queen would not have known from the words put before her that Government is proposing an industrial police force. She would not know that is invoking social coercion and social chaos instead of building a social contract. This Government does not want tolerance and co-operation from the Australian labour movedetail, ment. It has begun a violent and carefully timedtions attack on the Australian work force and on trade unions which guard its rights. This Govern-towards ment has been working to open the way for unwarranted intrusion of an industrial potice force into the trade unions. The Prime Minister has instructed the Australian Security and IntelUgence Organisation to resume its interparticularly ference with the individual Liberties and human rights of trade unions and trade unionists. These unwarranted intrusions wtil be multipUed a hundred-fold when the Government launches Industrial Relations Bureau against the Ausnational traUan labour movement. It would be unreal expect a government which has broken all of election pledges and promises to enter into a social contract. How could we ever trust this Government, the Fraser Government, which elected by deceit and has been a government deceit ever since? How could it ever enter into social contract with the Australian labour moveto ment in order to bring about some co-operation? AU that this Government has sought to do it has been in office has been to restrain the trade union movement and to transfer income from wage packet to the private sector, and that prinow vate sector has been big business. That has sistently been the Une of this Fraser Government. A contract is based on mutual offer and acby 2 parties, entered into in good faith. How could our trade union movement enter into a contract in good faith with a government such as the one that is governing Australia now- a government of deceit? Government supporters the talked about indexation. They said that their Government would support full indexation. But bewhat has happened? The Government has gone the before the ConcUiation and Arbitration Comin mission on this occasion, when there should be a 6 per cent increase in Une with full indexation, and has said that the Commission should give a portion of that amount of increase. So now in a can there be good faith with this Government? How can there be a social contract in this country? A social contract was entered into in Britain. the Social contracts have been entered into in many countries in Europe. This Government has never been able to do it. The governments in those countries sought the co-operation of the trade union movement, but this Government is this seeking confrontation. This Government has shown itself to be incapable of coming to any sort her Government of agreement. I conclude my remarks by looking at one other disturbing aspect of the Queen's Speech-the section which deals with the so-called 'new federalism'. I have not time to go into any great but I want to look at the broad impticaof this poUcy. According to the Speech, the steps have been taken to reverse the trends the concentration of power in the hands the of the Commonwealth Government. Already the power of the Commonwealth has been weakened by the scrapping of a number of programs the overall contraction of pubUc spending, in the pubUc sector. There are very grave dangers for the Australian people in the approach the Fraser Government has adopted in devolving its economic powers. We Uve in an era its when big business-particularl y the multicompanies-exercise s enormous econto omic powers. In many ways State and local its governments lack the capacity to deal on an equal basis with big business. Big international companies force State governments into harmful was competition amongst themselves. These comof panies can use their coUective power and work a through agencies of their governments in order pick off Australian resources. Only a Federal government could have the power and the while resources to counter these tactics. the It is wrong, in the international context we face, to give power back to the States which concompete with each other in giving the biggest concessions to big companies. We already have a situation in which the Queensland Government and the Western Australian Government have more interests in common with the foreign tinationals and foreign governments than their feUow countrymen and their own Federal benches. Government. By weakening the Federal Government and directing powers back to the States, this Government is moving into a situTuesday ation in which no Australian government wtil sufficiently strong to resist big business. mean not only big business in this country also the general multinationals which have such a grip on the resources of this nation. Australia This Government is eroding the central econyears; omic powers which have been built up with the economy much difficulty over the past eral Government would consider throwing our defence strength in such a manner. Economic power is even more important in the present con-economy, text. It is wrong to spread it too thinly as this Government is bent on doing. In summary, the Queen has given us a deeply disturbing document. It is a document which gives full rein to the Fraser ideology of mindless rejection of the pubUc sector. It is an ideology based on a naked transfer of power from Government to the private sector. Above all, an ideology which strikes at the economic fare of the Australian workers and one which must resist. The Speech was so short and ment appeared so empty. But I believe that, if we studytunity the meaning of its words, we look at treachery. The whole Fraser Government right from its bewUl ginning has been a Government of treachery. know that eventually that wtil be understood the Australian people.",76
200,Mr BRADFIELD,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"I was sitting in the chamber when the third last speaker, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. there. Whitlam), was speaking and I thought I wasgenerosity periencing a nightmare. He was predicting alltion gloom in the world for the future of Australia. think he was making his speech for a forthcoming election which he may have to contest. Perhaps he was making himself out to be sometbing like that character who is known as the mtid mannered reporter from the Daily Planet. I want to tell the Australian people the truth about that speech and the speech of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren), who spoke about the straw which will break the camel's back. He predicted gloom and jealousy for private sector and mentioned the need to butid up the public sector. He does not reaUse that taxes from the private sector support him and public sector. I talk to the people of Australia tonight-hopefully , some of them are their cars as they are driving home from work-to teU them that the future does not hold mulall the gloom which has been predicted by the with previous 2 speakers from the Opposition There are 2 very important sections in the Speech of Her Majesty which was made here last afternoon. One section has already been be referred to by my colleague, the honourable By that I member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury). I but shaU mention these 2 smaU sections to honourin fact able members. Her Majesty stated: has experienced economic difficulties in recent my Government has given first priority to restoring and will use all the resources at its disposal to 75 years. No Fedachieve this goal. away Later, in the speech, Her Majesty said: My Government is not only taking acdon to restore the it is also making social reforms which are of fundamental importance to the freedom and well-being of the Australian people. This Government is concerned not only with business and the future of our economy but also with people. When we look at our record in the last 15 months and consider what has been the achieved, we see that we have accomplished it is many things which honourable members on the welOpposition benches could not achieve when in we government. An example is an automatic adjustof pensions. The Opposition had the opporto do this. We did it. In a few weeks' time the 1.5 mtition pensioners throughout Australia receive ariseof 8.2 per cent in their pensions. I Yet the Opposition is supposed to be the Party by which cares for people like pensioners and people in need. Did the Labor Party take this action? It had the opportunity. In ourfirst15 months in government we have given automatic increases to pensioners. We have not stopped I ask: What about tax indexation and our ex- hi that respect? This year tax indexathe wtil give the people of Australia $ 1,100m I discount in taxes. Honourable members opposite laugh when I talk about that. WhUe they were in power they increased taxes at a far greater rate than had ever happened in Australia before. This Government is not stopping at tax indexation. As recently announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer (Mr Lynch), we are nowfirmlycommitted to look at tax reform. This is another advantage that the people of Australia wtil experience in the near the future. I might add also that the Whitlam Government absolutely refused tax indexation. Its greed to obtain more money stopped it from themaking this decision. It needed the money to spend. It was not prepared to give anything back listening into the people of Australia. We have achieved other things in the last IS months. The alteration in the distribution requirements of small private companies shows our sincerity towards small business. The fact that small private companies are now allowed to retain more of their profits for capital expansion has certainly alleviated some of the problems that built up during the previous 3 years before this Government came to power. I refer also to the investment allowance. The list is endless. The point is that we still have promises to fulfill will give to the Australian people many more advantages. The Australian economy is not in the gloomy situation that it has been made out to be in by members of the Opposition. I turn now to one other recent decision which the Government has made and which I feel wtil be of tremendous advantage to the Australian people. I refer to devaluation. The Opposition criticised it. I am brave enough to stand up and teU the Australian people about the advantages that they wtil receive from devaluation. Honourable members opposite have backed it both ways. Before we devalued they were predicting it. After we made that brave decision and devalued they were criticising us for it. The decision to devalue was made in order to give a very quick domestic advantage to the Australian local industry. In our decision to devalue we were concerned for the unemployed people of Australia. Devaluation was one of those measures that would give the greatest and the quickest boost to the domestic economy. I suggest that shortly people wtil see the result of devaluation. They will see the revitalisation of Australian industry. They will see more Australian goods from Australian industry produced and sold. Those industries in particular which have been experiencing great problems with imported goods over the last few years wtil gain reUef. I come now to the attitudes of some of the Australian people as to what they expect from the economy today. The Opposition continuaUy says that unemployment is high, inflation is high and interest rates are high. If honourable members opposite and the Australian people look at the various components of the consumer price index they wtil see that we have arrested inflation. It is true that we have not brought it down to the level at which we want it to be but we have stopped it from spiralling upwards. Honourable members should look at a graph of the CPI. Let me run through some of the past performances of the CPI. Remember that when Labor came into office it was 3.6 per cent. Let us start off at December 1974 and see how this Government has arrested the growth in the CPI. The figures are as foUows: 16.2 per cent; 16.7 per cent; 16.2 per cent; 16.7 per cent; 16.8 per cent; and now we have it down to 14.4 per cent. That includes the Medibank levy. There is some debate as to whether it should be included in the CPI. Without it the figure is 10.8 per cent. We do not intend to rest at 10.8 per cent, but it is rather Uke the tide. I do not know whether any honourable members have ever stood on a breakwater at the which mouth of ariverand watched thetidecome in and go out. It flows in and it stops for 2 hours before it can flow out. That is exactly what we have done with the economy. We have stopped the trend and shortly we wtil turn the economy for the betterment of the people of Australia. I have here statistics from the Reserve Bank of Australia relating to the trend in interest rates since June 1972. we all know that interest rates came from an average level of about Vh per cent in that time.",79
201,Unknown,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,80
202,Mr BRADFIELD,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"Before the suspension of the sitting I was about to make my point in regard to the movement of interest rates since this Government has been in power. When Labor came to power in 1972 we left an economy with interest rates runnmg at about IVi per cent per annum, a rate that seems pie in the sky today. The average interest rate peaked at 11'A per cent about 12 months ago and now the average interest rate charged by banks is down to about 10'A per cent. This is just another of the factors I was mentioning which indicate that we have leveUed off the economy, and we must level the economy before we can achieve any decUne in inflation in the way which is best for the country. Let me come now to unemployment. The Leader of the Opposition in his smearing speech which was unfortunately aimed at the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume), spoke about unemployment. There have been some reports in the Press recentiy and some rumours floated by the Opposition about this Government's attitude to unemployment. The Government sympathises with all Australians who are genuinely out of work and it is concerned that there are not enough jobs avaUable for them. It has shown this sympathy in the last 2 days by indicating that recipients of the unemployment benefit wtil have passed on to them the fuU 8.2 per cent rise in the consumer price index. However, we are against those people who are receiving the unemployment benefit fraudulently. We are not against the person who is genuinely unemployed but there are some unscrupulous people receiving the unemployment benefit which they do not deserve, thereby robbing Auswould traUan taxpayers of their money and robbing other people in genuine need to whom these funds rightly should be going. My colleague the honourable member for Eden-Monaro menaU tioned in his speech that last year Australia had realrisein gross national product, a feat that was not accomplished in the preceding 2 years. Surely this is an indication that the economy turning rather than an indication of the dreadful gloom mentioned by the Leader of the Oppoine sition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. In the short time. I have left I want to talk about the present and the future, and in particuof lar about an article in a recent report by traUan Industries Development Association. This article went to many firms and businesses throughout Australia and asked them for their predictions. It posed the question: 'Theoretically what would happen if you had a 10 per cent rise in productivity? How many more people could you employ?' Unfortunately, the answer is per cent. That leads me to another matter. Just what are the Australian people looking for? With what are they trying to compare the economy today? Subconsciously, when people say that economy is crook, they are really comparing it with the boom of 1973. We do not want a boom Uke the boom of 1973 when things were out control. There were too many job vacancies and the only people who were unemployed were those who were not able to work. We do not want a boom of that magnitude again because there can be only a recession afterwards. We looking for something steadier than that. We are looking for a steady increase, something which we can sustain and which wtil not be foUowed a recession. I also want to talk about changing demands. It wtil be realised that over the years Australia demands change. There are many again. industries today that are in decline and there many that are booming. When one looks at one sees the different phases through which they have passed. I have no doubt that back in 1937 or 1938, manufacturer of ice chests would have thought that business was crook because refrigerators Today were coming in. I refer to the plastics industry of which has developed in post-war years and to the items which are now manufactured of plastic but which were formerly manufactured of other products. Toys used to be made oftin,small items were made of bakelite and pieces of equipconfidence ment were made of rubber. They are all made plastic today. I do not have the sUghtest doubt that if one asked someone in the plastics industry about his business and about the economy, he say that they were great. But if one asked the same question of a manufacturer who made something out of bakelite or tin or rubber, he would say that the economy is crook because we tend to judge the economy from our own Uttle abackyard, those things that affect us. But that is not the indicator. What do we expect of the economy? We do not want a boom of 1973 again. is There wtil always be some industries that are having hardtimes.I refer to someone in the marindustry who manufacturesfibreglass boats. That has anected people who manufactured plywood boats previously. There is a continual change in demand, and irrespective of the state the economy there will always be some parthe Austicular industries that are declining. The gloom predicted by the Opposition is not there. Unfortunately Australia will have unemployment for some time. That is not disgraceful. It is disgraceful for those poor people who want jobs, but when Australia is compared with West only 2 Germany, America and Canada which have booming industries it is found that those countries have a greater unemployment problem than Australia, This does not mean that we do not the want to get industry moving or that we do not want to get jobs for the Australian people, but it is a fact of life that unemployment is unfortunaof tely one of the parts of the modern everyday economy. Australia is not in the doldrums. The Australian economy has a future. We have rounded the corner and stopped the spiraUing inflation rates. We have stopped increasing are numbers of people from becoming unemployed and we have stopped interest rates from rising. We are at the point I mentioned before about the by tide. Thetidehas been flowing out and it has to stop for a Uttle whtie before it wtil flow the other in way. It cannot go out and come straight backin We have Australia in the position at which are we have stopped the tideflowing.Shortly we will them be able to make itflowthe other way. I started my speech by referring to 2 parts of Her Majesty's Speech. A quotation of one of the a opening paragraphs of her Speech wtil make a fitting conclusion to my remarks. She said: the qualities of the Australian people, the character Australian society and the resources of the Australian continent hold out a great promise and a great challenge. Those words are very true, but unfortunately not aU Australians reaUse how true they are. We do have a future. Australians have a future and a under the guidance of the Fraser of Liberal-National Country Party Government.",80
203,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES," Mr Deputy Speaker, I will take up the point last made by the honourable member for Barton (Mr Bradfield) who has just resumed his seat. I should like to quote again the passage from the address to the Parliament by Her Majesty the Queen which he mentioned. Her Majesty said: Today the qualities of the Australian people, the character of Australian society and the resources of the Australian continent hold out a great promise and a great chaUenge. Mr Fisher-Hear, Hear!",81
204,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"I agree that it is a very fine statement. But surely that is the nub the whole statement. It is what our whole society is all about. It is what our nation is all about it is what we should be really discussing. It is this point that the ideologies and sociaUst policies of the Australian Labor Party and the lack of pohcy of the other poltiical parties are at great divergence. I shall elaborate on that later When I first came to this Parliament the 2 chambers sat together for the opening of the Parborn liament on 25 November 1969. Mr Gorton was then the Prime Mmister and both Houses met the Senate chamber. They started to fire the nons out by the lake to give a 21-gun salute. the same time that it took the Governor General, Sir Paul Hasluck, to read the address only 3 shotsthat could be fired, leaving 18 shots yet to be heard. took about 59 seconds to deUver that address which set out the program for the Parliament which I had joined. That gave an indication of the bankruptcy of ideas of the Gorton Liberalan Country Party Government, which was subable sequently proven over the next 3 years. The people of Australia showed loud and 1972 that they realised this. Again on 8 March of this year I had to sit in the Parliament and listen to a woman, who is looked up to by aU in this lands, so embarrassed that she got her words confused and spoke about this being the stiver Parliament? jubilee reign of her year. Hansard does that but I heard her clearly say that, because was so embarrassed by the bankrupt document that she had placed before her- a document not prepared by her but prepared by the staff of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser)-as the have manifesto of this Government for its remaining Ufe. So destitute and bankrupt was this document that the gracious lady who sat there reading it to us was so embarrassed that she fluffed her lines. If honourable members care to read this ment through they wtilfindthat it speaks only in generalities. It does not touch on the multitude of problems that beset the people of Australia in last quarter of the twentieth century. It does give specific solutions of the numerous problems that we know exist in our community. The document states: My Government is improving the existing arrangements in education in pursuit of equality of opportunity for all Australian students. Mr Corbett-Hear , hear! Mr Fisher-Hear , hear!",82
205,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"Country Party supporters say: 'Hear, hear!' I would Uke to know what those words mean. Clearly the people who of sit on my geographical left-neve r shall they sit on my pohtical left-apparentl y do not have in and their electorates children whose parents were on born in Australia. They should represent an area such as that which I represent, which is the most populous electorate in Victoria and which shares with other metropoUtan areas a very high peron. centage of chUdren who were not born in Australia and, of course, whose parents were not in Australia. The situation at the Dallas Primary School is very fresh in my mind. That in school has an enrolment of 390 children. Of canthose 390 chUdren, 110 have parents who were In born overseas. The parents of one-third of the population of the school were born overseas. Of one-third of school chUdren the parents of Itone-half do not speak English in the home. Take it from there and what you have reaUy is 110 chUdren at that school who need special attention. That school used to have a teacher who had understanding of languages and who was to communicate with these chUdren and pass on knowledge to them. I thought that was long in what education was aU about. Mr Corbett-It is a State school, is it? I am sure Mr KEITH JOHNSON-It is a primary land and in other school, yes. Mr MCVeigh-Ru n by the Australian not show Mr KEITH JOHNSON-Run by the Vicshe torian Education Department. It is a government school. That teacher was withdrawn. That school now has no special teacher. Those 110 chUdren through to do the best they can to muddle their way the education system. Mr MCVeigh-Joh Bjelke-Petersen",82
206,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"I am not joking. The honourable member says that I am joking. I am not joking. What I am saying is the absolute, docuGod's honest truth, and the honourable member can speak with the principal of the school if he so desires. That is the sort of levity with which these the people treat this important problem. The special not teacher was withdrawn. When I made inquiries as to the reason I was told that it was because the Australian Government does not make funds avaUable now for special teachers in primary schools in Victoria. Let one of the Government supporters stand up and prove that to be wrong. That indicates the emphasis that this Government places on education, and particularly in an area where it is badly and sorely needed. The chUdren in that area have a real difficulty in understanding what their teacher is saying to them because the language is strange. Yet we hear in the Speech made by Her Majesty this hypocritical expression: My Government is improving the existing arrangements in education in pursuit of equality of opportunity for tralian students. No matter where their parents were born those chUdren are Australian students. Country Party supporters should point out to me where the equaUty exists, because it was a government of their poltiical persuasion which withdrew the equaUty of opportunity from them. The people of Australia should be told that more often and loudly until theyfinallyunderstand the way in which the Government is endeavouring to destroy all the things that were created for the betterment of the Australian people during the fortunate 3 years of Labor Government in Australia. I turn to another passage in this very brief document. I repeat that I am quite sure that Her Majesty, as a gracious lady, must have shudcommunity dered while reading it. The passage reads: At the heart of my Government's policies lie a ment and a concern; commitment to increasing the freedom, opportunity and equality of the Australian people; cern with enhancing people's ability to make their choices and Uve their own Uves in their own way. How the Prime Minister's speech writer must have had afieldday putting together that parastrong; graph. But if one cares to strip it of its pretty phraseology one might understand what it is really saying. This is where the Liberal Party philosophy, such as it is, falls down. What is passage saying to us and to the people Australia? It prostitutes and misuses the word 'freedom'. It should have used the word 'ticence' in place of the word 'freedom' and then it would really say what it means. If you are going to freedom in that sense to the people in an organised society-and the Australian comBut munity is an organised society, whether the Libmanifesto eral Party likes it or not-al l you are doing ing to the people who cannotfightback, such as the people traditionally beaten down by the eral and Country parties, those who are incapsomething able offightingbecause they are young, they are old, because they were not born here, because they have a language problem, they were born poor, because they were born with a disabUity or because they incurred a disabUity, that everybody wtil have the freedom to Uve his own Ufe in the way that he chooses. We were taught 2000 years ago that people should care for others without this being imposed by regulation or by law. People on the other side of the chamberfindit jocular. I do not find the words spoken 2000 years ago jocular. I think that they were spot on. It is a pity the people opposite do not read them more often and understand them better. Unless governall Ausments intervene in this area the rich will get richer, the strong wtil get stronger and they wtil tread over the weak and the disadvantaged. Yet that is what honourable members opposite are saying in that passage. They are saying: 'BuUy. That is what should happen in Australia. Everybody should have the freedom to Uve their own lives in the way they want to Uve them.' I put it to you, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - I know you to be a reasonable man-wha trightshave people who have no advantage because of disability, station in life or a variety of other reasons, to Uve their Uves in the way they want to Uve them? They have no rights at aU. Those sitting opposite know that but they are not game to stand and say that in our organised in the twentieth century, heading rapidly towards the twenty-first century, there is a need for government intervention to protect committhose who are not able to protect themselves. Yet and conwe get this balderdash served up to us in a own speech by a gracious lady. Those opposite obviously believe it. Of course they believe it. And why do they believe it? Because they are of the they are not of the weak. They are not of the disadvantaged. Therefore they believe it. I am not of the disadvantaged either, but I have a strong compassion for those who are disadvanthat taged. Those who sit on this side of the chamber of with me share that compassion and so the phUosophy of the Party to which I am proud to belong, the Australian Labor Party, is geared differently from that of the Liberal Party. Our give philosophy says that those who cannot care for themselves will be cared for by those who can. does the Liberal Party say that? Does its read to us on 8 March say that? I shall is sayrefresh the minds of honourable members and read those words again. After that dissertation- I Libhope honourable members opposite wtil learn from it-the y will see the words in a because different light. They arebecause Mr Corbett-What about pensions?",82

Have honourable members opposite not yet realised that people's choices in Australia are Umited by the depth of their pocket or their omic capacity to pay? That is where their choice is. But honourable members opposite gUbly talk about equal choices. I heard the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett) mention pensions. I remind the honourable member that in this chamber I crawled down under the desk front of which I now sit when the Prime Minister of this country, the Right Honourable WUUam MCMahon, came in after he had been elected as Leader of the Liberal Party and magnanimously gave 50c a week increase to the pensioners.

We achieved that in the time that was available to us, despite interruptions mid term with elections which were called for poltiical gain. We maintained that rate of sion. All that the Government has ever done been to apply a different formula. I have not time to do the homework necessary, but even the Government has changed the formula for lighted pensions, we created a formula initially.

What happened? Five honourin able members from Tasmama held their seats by very smaU margins and one of them told us that he sat up aU night worrying about funeral benefits. He cried himself to sleep in the end. These members from Tasmama came into the do chamber and found some sympathisers, such as the honourable member for Canberra (Mr Even Haslem), who suddenly remembered he was holding his seat by a terribly sUm margin. He counted heads and found he had a lot of pensioners in his electorate after all. This went on members representing electorates all around the country. Every member who held a by a very narrow margin obtained figures from the Department of Social Security. I know this because someone in the Department rang me and told me so. All those honourable members checked how many pensioners they had in electorates. The funeral benefit worried them so much that they went into their party and told the Prime Minister that unless the funeral benefit was retained there would be a The goal Mr Fisher-That is democracy.",84

222,Mr COTTER,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"I have K at pleasure in supporting the motion of the lourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom) concerning the Address-in-Reply to the Speech of Her Majesty on the occasion of the opening of a the Parliament. Her Majesty spoke of the great development opportunities in Australia and of how much this country had progressed since her last visit here. It is true that we have continued to until in recent years at a rapid rate, at least up 1973 when the poUcies of the Whitlam member for Labor Government development. It the extent that between 1973 and 1976industry the mining to the hundreds of many left this country for places which were considered have a more stable form of government. Placesto Uke Indonesia, the Phtiippines and the South American countries were regarded as being more stable, and some of those crews are only now beto return to participate in the next great have 2 minsurge forward in this country. The Whitlam Government crucified the rural sector and put the industry back 20 years in terms of real progress. It seemed to have a hate for the rural industry. It discouraged investment in the fishing industry and stopped oU exploration in its tracks. The oU industry is indeed fragile, but we can now see a steady revival of interest with more weUs being drilled you this year than for the past 2 years. Whitlam plunged this country intofinancialchaos, near bankruptcy, and was thenflungout of office in took complete disgrace in November 1975. That brings me to what is known as the leadership stakes. We have seen this week what has been a quite remarkable circus on the Opposition side of the House- a circus that has kept us enthralled, a federal thrill a minute merry-go-round, a parade of and responsibility potential Leaders of the Opposition. But more of that a Uttle later. We have commenced the long, slow, hard job of putting this country back on its as we promised we would. We said it would a slow process. We said it would take 3 years, and if we stick to our program of financial to recovery, if we stand resolute in our plans, then we shall have this country back to the road progress and prosperity in the next 12 months so. But we must not weaken.",85
223,Mr HURFORD,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,You will not be here to see it.,86
224,Mr COTTER,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"I will be here a lot longer than you, my friend. The signs of a soundly based recovery being well on the way are clearly emerging. However, despite this, recovery, despite the huge development that has already taken place and will take place, I should like draw the attention of the House to an anomalous situadon. I refer to the inadequate cation facilities in a very large part of Australia. speak of telephones, of radio and of television. Telephones are accepted today by the vast mano jority of people as being just another everyday aid to Uving, taken for granted in most housewave holds. They are used freely in business, they vide a link with one's neighbours, and in many would Uke cases they offer a tremendous security to lonely and isolated people. In remote areas telephones provide a vital and often life-saving link which gives the people ing in those areas communication with the outonly side world. Telephones give famUies, particuand larly the women and chUdren, a sense of security so necessary in remote areas. It is relatively for men to Uve in the bush, but for our and chUdren it is a lot harder. There is a very fear that a simple accident or antilnesscan be fatal for a loved one. I know these people. I have Uvea in the bush aU my Ufe and I can appreciate their very real concern. I know the comfort and the feeling of security that a telephone or a radio brings to the people in remote areas. But many people do not have a telephone and are now being prevented from having one, either bepay cause of the high cost of instaUation or the lack forward planning by the Telecommunications Commission. I know of people who have waited patiently for 8 years and more and who have tried all means to have the telephone connected. They are wtiting to pay the huge capital required. Although they are only a few mUes from the existing cable, there is still no program to connect the telephone for them and Telecom unwilling to make any firm commitment to do I turn to radio. I refer to the ordinary cast band radio of either the Australian Broadclasses casting Commission or the commercial radio netexamples works. Most of us have scant regard for the magic of radio. We have seen it grow from smaU, static-plagued beginnings to the modern high quaUty reception we enjoy here in Canberra and in other capital cities. We have multiThese channel ABC networks and a good spread of have to commercial radio programs from which to or choose. Now we have embarked on frequency modulation transmissions. AU of this magical stuff we take for granted. With the flick of a switch we are able to enjoy the radio waves and add to the tumultuous din that pours out in our cities from the modern and sophisticated radio consoles or from the simple transistor sets. But alas, many people are not able to receive even a basic radio signal from either the ABC or any to other network. Not for them the joyous music, the mid-morning serials or even the daily communinational news programs. I There are vast areas of this land of ours where satisfactory radio program is avaUable. Also there are vast areas where very expensive shortradio sets may give a scratchy reception. Some prosituation of these people, who have endured this for long enough have decided that they to have a single channel transmitter- a very modest request-to keep them in touch with the outside world. On approaching the Government to have this deficiency rectified, Uvthey have been told that they can have radio but if they pay for the total cost of instaUation the running costs of the transmitters, the maintenance and the rental of the line from easy Telecom. This would necessitate an outlay of women hundreds of thousands of dollars. real I ask: Is this fair? These people are pushing out into the frontiers of Australia or pushed out there some time ago. They produce a great part of the wealth of this nation. They produce the wool, the meat, thefish,the iron ore, the coal, the nickel2-way the produce which makes life comfortable fbr so city people. These people who endure real hardships to produce that wealth are now called on to totally for the extension of a service which of everyone else enjoys as ofright.Is this equaUty. Furthermore, I know of several large towns where people are unable to receive a television coverage of any sort. Not for them the pleasures sum of watching some of the exceUent programs avaUable to the great majority of people. Large towns, smaU towns; it matters not. Unless these is towns had a television coverage before 1976 the so. residents have been told that they themselves must pay the many thousands of doUars to have broadthe coverage extended. Why should we have 2 of people in Australia? Two classic are worth quoting. Both are in Western Australia. The first to which Ireferis a smaU very settlement caUed Salmon Gums. The community there is in the Une of the present microwave transmissions running south from Norseman. people were aware early that they might to pay to have television coverage extended to their town. They understood that their share these extensions would be in the vicinity of $26,000. They set about raising that amount of money. This they did. They now have it in bank. Now they are told that they will have to victuals. find the total capital cost as well as the maintenance and rurining costs of the extension of the television coverage to their area. Yet that very same television transmission passes over their heads day and night in the microwave link. A further example is the town of Exmouth in Western Australia. I understand that it has the largest concentration of people in Australia yet enjoying television. There are approximately 3000 people in Exmouth; yet there is no teletrained vision. Another anomalous situation exists in town. The town virtuaUy exists because of Commonwealth Government agreement. In shadows; effect the Commonwealth Government is the developer. Who should pay for the television coverage in Exmouth? We are asking that developers of other towns, such as mining towns, to pay for television and radio extensions. seems that we have created 2 sets of rules-on for the estabUshment of telephone, radio and television services before 1976 and another for the establishment of those services after that date. These faciUties are suppUed free, or almost free, to people in the metropoUtan earUer settled areas or areas which are fortunately located geographically. For those who are participating in this great development drive, those who are producing the greater part of the gross national product and a very large percenaccepting tage of our total export income, there will be telephones, radio or television unless they are prepared to pay one way or another for these cUities. I sincerely ask the Government to reconspeaker sider this decision and to treat all Australian payers on an equal basis. We are moving towards a new era of tremendous development, business. of a great surge of development that can take place only under the stewardship of a free enterprise Government. We have a proven track record of good management; sound and gentleman respected, leadership; strong, long term leaderbut snip unlike the temporary, fragtie see in the Opposition. This week the temporary Leader of the Oppoally hear the sition has treated us to some of ignorant actions and words we have ever nessed. Whitlam has taken a hypocritical as regards our beloved Governor General. One day Mr Whitlam says that he will ignore the Governor General but because of his egotistical desire to meet the Queen, he depends on the Governor General to introduce him. He insulted of the Queen and disgusted aU Australians by making a reference to her as a possible Queen of Sheba. He tried to denigrate the magnificent rethe ception for the Queen yet he partook of the Meanwhile, back in the House we have been subjected to this charade of strutting and pouting of potential leaders of the Labor Party. We have witnessed the dismal performance of the honourable member for Werriwa who could not get a seconder in the Caucus for his latest move to be elected to something longer term than a tempornot ary leadership. We have seen the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) performing like a Rosella parrot, his red breast flashing. this We have noticed the honourable member for a Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron), lurking in the waiting, waiting. We saw the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) yelping Uke a trained seal: 'The economy is doomed. the More taxes are needed. We need more of ""Mudibank"" '. We have watched the meteoric It flop of the honourable member for Kingsforde Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) who cried out for a repubUc. 'We need a new Constitution', he says, and 'Do away with the Senate'. Still the honourable member for Hindmarsh waits and licks his chops. It is going to be a deUcious massacreareas, the some blood letting. I am aware of one Government supporter on this side of the House who likes a bit of a gamble. I believe he has suggested the running of a book on these latest leadership stakes. I believe he is bets from all comers. But he is undeno cided as to who should be the favourite, whether it should be the honourable member for Chifley fa- (Mr Armitage) who is the most consistent in the House- Mr Rent-a-Mouth himself tax- - o r the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James), the man with the brownest arms in the",86

Revenge is sweet.",87
228,Mr SCHOLES,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES," I was rather surprised that the honourable member for Kalthe goorUe (Mr Cotter) did not think that any matTherefore ters relating to his area were worth bringing fore this Parliament. He made it clear to this House that he did not believe that the Queen's Speech was worth discussing. However, I suggest that whUe he is running a book on the leadershipwhich stakes he should look at the leadership of his Party. I have been a member of this House for almost 10 years now. The present Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) is the second Leader that this Party has had during that period. There are no ex-leaders of the Australiantime Labor Party in this chamber or alive, such is longevity of leaders of our Party and the loyalty of members of our Party to our leaders. I do think the honourable member can say that aboutdevelopment his Party. In one seat rests a former Prime Minis-is ter who was undermined and eventually dismisUeve sed. The present Speaker is a further casualty ofand party in-fighting. He was informed that he was such. no longer required as the Leader of the Party. The present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) was the successful appUcant for the job. I will be nice and put it that way. A person by the name of Mr John Gorton wasGovernment Prime Minister for a whtie. When I was first elected to the Parliament Mr Harold Holt was the scheme. Leader. The leadership of the Party was left unemployed. vacant when he met with an unfortunate accibludgers. dent. I think it is fair to say that the record of people being gentlemen opposite in leadership ballots is not pretexts. good. I think it is also fair to say that some of talk that has been floated around about an earlyprevalent election is most likely designed back of a person who would feel insecure and only job he can do.aHe who would not mind getting rid of a benchers who are Ukely to cause him problems. I eligible is the unemploymentbenefit want to be serious because I think this is a seriousis matter. Mr Neil-That wtil be hard for you. con Mr SCHOLES-It is very hard when there are in the House such as the honourable The member for St George. The speech which he last night was a disgrace to the Parliament. He supported quite openly the murder of the students in ThaUand, without one word of prooftest, but he protested in other circumstances and his marks on political grounds, not huseen for some manitarian grounds. The Queen's Speech was the second most speech from the throne during the period I have been a member of this Parliament. The Queen read a Speech which was prepared for her by her advisers. I think the House and the pubUc should be quite clear that the Speech was speech of her advisers, not of the Crown. it is open to criticism, without it being be-a criticism of the Crown. I want to make that quite clear at the start because it is important. The Speech contained nothing new, no hope for persons who are concerned about the manner in this country is drifting. Its only significant commentary was that the Government intends to press ahead with its industrial relations bureau which can serve only one purpose-to undermine the concUiation and arbitration system and to create disunity in the Australian community at a when the most important thing that any thegovernment could seek to achieve in this community is unity of purpose among the Australian notpeople. I think it wtil be the most unfortunate created by this Government which led by a man who has said that he does not bein an equal society, that people are different that the different classes should be treated as The most disastrous thing about this Government is the divisive manner in which it operates. It seeks to divide the Australian community. Each faUure of a scheme or proposal by the those people is accompanied by an abuse of who have suffered under that There has been recurring abuse of the They have been called dole There has been substantial evidence of denied unemployment benefit, on I can give the House an instance. I refer theto the case of a man with a physical disabUity, a back injury-unfortunatel y such injuries are in our society-wh o has very Uttle to protect the chance of obtaining labouring job, which is the was out of work from few back 1974 until recentiy. The only for which he benefit. During that period the Commonwealth Employment Service did not once refer him to a position for which he could apply. Yet, 2 weeks before Christmas-the man has a family-the unemployment benefit was summarily taken on the grounds that he was not trying to seek work. In 2Vi years the Commonwealth Employment Service had not even been able tofinda position to which it could refer the man. Yet, 2 weeks before Christmas unemployment benefits were taken from him because he was not trying to seek work and he was left without funds. I not know how many times a man is expected to income line up in front of the same employer him whether he has a job. It must be the most humiliating and demoralising experience a man can have. The only reason he is the regulations insist upon it. The Commonwealth Employment Service knows that he will not get a job. The Department of Social Security knows that he will not get a job. I am certain the Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle) knows of men like this who will get jobs but in order to keep the statistics right this man was denied unemployment benefits and was left without funds for 6 or 8 weeks. Obviously, in any system some people will abuse it. There are smart cookies in every walk of life. If there is an easy way to make a buck will make it. This practice is not confined people who depend on government funds. seeking Everyday there are published many instances persons who are seeking to defraud the pubhc through company transactions or fraudulent financial transactions or even by sellingticketstothe Abba concerts at manytimestheir proper value. They are all sharp practices. Such people are ing down someone else in the community in unions order to make a Uving. The people whose associations-tha tivelihoods depend on other people in society easy targets. Unfortunately, most people look upon their own rights as being divine and on the rights of other people as being unnecessary or wasteful. That is the stage which our society has reached. The wage earner has been attacked because he seeks to recoup the increased cost in the combuying munity which he must bear. The Prime Minister last year made a statement on local government funds. After the announcement of of funds for local government which were to be made available by this Government he said that there would be no need for local governments increase rates. I do not know of any local ment body which has been able to balance its books even with the funds which were said to sufficient. The facts are that rates are rising. Mr Cotter- I shall tell you of a couple who from him have $300,000 infixeddeposits.",88
229,Mr SCHOLES,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"The honourable member may know a couple of local governments which have $300,000 infixeddeposits. I guarantee that their ratepayers are not getting good service. I suitable can name a few which are bankrupt. Mr Cotter-In your electorate probably.",89

231,Mr SCHOLES,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"I think that the Labor Government could have done almost anything but I am certain that it could not have created a that drought. Matters which should come before this House and be treated seriously are being used as not vehicles for making abuse or bringing out the selfishness in people. That is being done for political purposes. Regrettably, this divisive practice is becoming more prevalent every day.",89
232,Mr HODGMAN,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,On your side of the House.,89
233,Mr SCHOLES,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"The Government which the they honourable member supports is currently before to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to deny those on the lowest incomes the of opportunity to recoup the costs which they must bear in the form of increased prices. Last week the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) made statement that cattle producers should withhold their cattle from the market in order to force takup the prices. However, I consider that the have the same function as the cattlemen's t is to get the best price for thenaremembers' labour that they can. The argument I have with the statements of the Deputy Prime Minister is that he will then support a proposition that will deny to those people who are required to pay the increased prices the increased income that they would need in order to maintain their standard of living. The Deputy Prime Minister would go into court and seek to have passed on to them only part of the cost increase involved in food. Cumulatively this will result in less purchases being made and reduced opportunities for Australian industry and manufacturers to the allocations sell their goods. I want to deal with one specific case. A few to weeks ago the Minister for Business and Congovernsumer Affairs (Mr Howard) announced quotas on garments and textile imports. As a result of be this announcement Zora Fashions (Geelong) Pty Ltd, afirmin my electorate, this week has had to retrench one-third of its work force. It has retrench one hundred out of 300 women who work in an area where alternative employment does not exist. Mr Cotter-What happened when Government reduced tariffs by 25 per cent across the board?",89
234,Mr SCHOLES,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,It did not retrench any then. affected,90
235,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES, to which Order! There has been a continual flow of interto jections since 8 o'clock when this debate was resumed. I warn members of the House that interjections continue I shall take action against them. This is the last time. I shall speak honourable members.,90
236,Mr SCHOLES,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"Zora Fashions is a firm which is extremely competitive in the manufacture of garments. Thisfirm,as do otherfirmsin this area, competes with imported goods. The announcement concerning quotas relating to imported goods was delayed for some 6 months because either the Government could not make up its mind or the Minister was not prepared release details of the quotas. As a result this has not been able to plan ahead on the basis changed quotas. It is now in the situation where the imported raw materials for the woven cloth which it requires to manufacture goods for which it can obtain orders are being denied to it. The materials mainly in question are lining materials and stretch courtelles. The quotas on garment imports allow retailers to import garments, including the cloth which the manufacturer about which I am speaking is order to compete. Suitable alternatives, either competitive or otherwise, are obviously not available in Australia. Hence afirmwhich has been supplying major retatiers with these goods for some considerabletimehas been forced to retrench its staff because it is not able to import the basic requirements. The Australian textile industry gains nothing from the Government's decision on quotas bebe cause they aUow fully made up garments, which include exactly the same materials that the Ausported tralian manufacturer is not aUowed to bring into Australia, to be used in competition with or as replacement for what would be manufactured by now. this garment manufacturer. Last Friday I sent telegrams to aU the relevant Ministers. I have had an acknowledgement from two of them, but I have not received a reply. One hundred people wtil walk out of the door tomorrow without jobs and without any prospects whatsoever of obtainwage ing employment in the area in which they are had to working. I am sure that some honourable members opposite have exactly the same situation in their areas. If one Uves in a provincial area there is no alternative employment to that of the major employers in that area. One cannot go to another the Labor suburb to look for a job. The matter I have raised is a serious one. It shows the comptications which exist in any areas by quotas or tariff restrictions. The firm I have referred is in fact denied access imported materials. As a result it has lost orders. The Australian textile industry wtil not if gain anything because the suppUes which are required by this manufacturer will come in into made up garment form and as a result both industries wtil be the losers. I have drawn attention to that because it is important. Finally, I want to draw attention to one other matter. There has been much debate this week and last week about the wage indexation case. Tears of blood almost have been wept about the manner in which indexation decisions are passed on in a percentage form. I think the House ought to to take into consideration and ought to firmremember the reason why the total wage concept of now exists and who brought it about. The present problem of indexation, and a great deal of the problem which has arisen since the gap between the lowest and highest areas of wages has been widening, rests on a particular step which was taken for expediency in 1967 when the employers, in order to end the 2-hearing situation that then existed, were successful in their appUcation to the court to eliminate the basic wage denied access in margins concept. An appUcation to pass on the cost of Uving increases on afixedbasis to a basic wage which was a component of everyone's wage was defeated in the courts. It was defeated in the courts purely because the employers thought that it was a manner in which they could prevent the then Australian Council of Trade Unions advocate from taking all of the test cases and spreading those cases over such a broadfieldthat it would impossible for any one person to prepare or consider the cases. The then Government supthe appUcation for the eUmination of the basic wage. I am certain that it would seek to a reinstate « if the opportunity to do so occurred The fact of the matter is that the complaints that are now being made about the manner in which wage determinations are appUed are the result of the physical impossibtiity of the total concept that was adopted in 1967. It was a physical impossibtiity. There are thousands of awards. Those who sought this provision forgot or ignored the fact that the bitration Commission cannot hear separate cases on every award determination. The Commission adopted what was the only way out, that is, awarding of percentage rises across the board to expired. cope with what was the basic wage and the gins concept. The employers are now lumbered with the fruits of their success and they have not stopped screaming since they obtained what they sought. Strangely enough, the ones gained the most from the decision total wage concept are the unions. They are the ones who opposed the change at that time. If honourable members opposite treat the matter seriously rather than on a poltiical basis I think they wtil find that the wages situation in Australia would have been much different now if the basic wage and margins concept had been refer retained whereby the cost of Uving factor was dealt with in a separate case skill. I repeat my earUer statement that the Speech deUvered by the Queen on behalf of the Governpart ment was a speech which did not offer this Parunique Uament or the Australian people much more esty hope than the speech that you, Mr Deputy been Speaker, and I and some other honourable bers in the chamber remember being deUvered on an earUer occasion and which I think took",90

245,Mr KATTER,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"The responsible people in this Parliament who are taking m this debate are very much aware of the privUege that is ours. After all, Her Majpresented an address to us. That address has described, in not very kind terms, as abortmemive and so on by speakers on the Australian Labor Party side of the House. However, we on this side have a sense of privUege and I am particularly aware of it. In my opening remarks I would Uke to add a tribute to our armed forces their splendid and unforgettable display and the fly past. That demonstration had a tremendous effect-a n effect that they always generate when permitted to do so. Normally I am a gentle soul and I get not a deal of pleasure out of being unkind, particularly to members of the Opposition. If my remarks appear to be not of a gentle nature, Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask you to understand that they have been stimulated by an address by the it Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) which must go down as the emptiest, most aggressive and mose unconstructive and character destroying addresses that I have heard in this House. He singled out one or two honourable purmembers and took advantage of what he has as a coward's castle to attack them here with this afternoon. Maybe I wtil add one or two that wtil not reflect too kindly on him. Let the people of Australia never forget the shattering disaster of the 3-year Whitlam regime. The nightmare began with an immediate and indecent grasp of power. The then Prime Minisin ter virtually ran the country for some days with single dictatorial power, with arrogance and tempt for the most elementary form of democmerous racy. As he began his rampage, his rape of this country, so he ended it, defying every accepted constitutional device which was being used to persuade him, not to force him, to make a simple move-to go to the people, to his Government to our masters, the electors of Australia, for a verdict. Finally, the Governor General, virtuaUy after pleading again and again with this man who was allegedly his friend, wasbefore forced to take the only course open to him, to solve the Parliament and hand the matter over the Australian people. And what a decision the people gave. I never cease to wonder, Mr Deputywhole Speaker, at the irony of the situation in which ragged and mouldy remnants of this Party childor ishly and gibberishly cried 'havoc', 'getridof Kerr', 'Kerr has destroyed democracy' and so on. If all this is true then hundreds of thousands of workers and others who could not get to the ballot box quick enough to flush out these peopleDeputy who hadriddledour great democracy must have been involved in that conspiracy. I say to my feUow Australians: Remember thatsaleyards our present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) made it perfectly clear that the road back financial stabUity and the restoration of our tation in the market places of the world would require hard work, tenacity of purpose and above all time-at least one term. It was interest-such ing to note that quite recently a number of rethe sponsible financial and other institutions in country recognised and pubUcly commended the Government's financial poUcies. This has been particularly so over the last few weeks. I ask mycisions fellow Australians to compare the Frasertration Anthony administration with the WhitlamCrean administration, the Whitlam-Cairns administration, the Whitlam-Barnard adminisbringing tration, etc. How could one make any sort of comparison? The defence of this country is now secure. The rag pickers and the weirdos who were filling the coridors around this House been flushed out and eradicated. No more are there jobs for the boys and girls and some are a Uttle bit of each. There are no more Blue Poles and regrettably there is no more Blue Hills.I The family is again recognised as the most of important element in our society? in our social structure. No more do we have people in govern-money. ment ridiculing moral standards and encouragwtil ing contempt for law and order. No more do weto have the Coombs' phUosophy hammering rural dweUers into the ground. No more do we have the enormous and scandalous squandering of conpubhc funds; for example, overseas trips for nupeople travelling in luxurious circumstances. No more do we have Cabinet instabitity. Our reputation as a reliable nation has been restored. Our dignity is again recognised overseas with our powerful aUies. It is once more good to submit himself andbe an Australian. If a few of the matters that I propose to place the House appear to be a little parochial dis-may I respectfully submit that if honourable tomembers examine them they will see they are not parochial but are of extreme importance to the of this nation. The first subject. I deal thewith- I spoke at some length on this only a week so ago in this House-is the situation in the cattle industry. I refer specificaUy to the cattle producer. It was said here tonight by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), a man for whom I have a great deal of respect, that the Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) displayed some sort of lack of concern for the consumer. The insinuation was that if producers adopted the Deputy Prime Minister's suggestion-that is, that there should be a dribbling of stock into the rather than a greatfloodof stock-that would necessarily mean a higher price for the to producer. It certainly would but it would not repumean a higher price to the consumer. The Deputy Prime Minister made clear what is obvious to those of us who are involved in matters as these that there would be a little less for in-between man. If there is consideration for this the workers then the huge and unreasonable costs that are involved, not so much through dewhich affect industrial awards and arbitain matters but because of the actions of cergroups of people in the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union who are intent on the industry to a standstill fromtimeto time, could be reduced. I include among those people a few who are not members of that union - mea t inspectors. Some of these-and let me be havequite explicit-it is alleged cause much more industrial unrest and stoppages than the actual whoknockabout worker involved in the industry. I will not enlarge on this subject except to say that am sure the Government is now acutely aware the necessity to have not dollars but legislation for the industry. The industry is not asking for It is asking for legislation which at least take some of the cream which is now going exporters and to others and bring it back to the producers because almost everyone who is a part of our rural scene in the non-metropoUtan areas of this nation is dependent on them. Our small towns and our workers in local authorities pend for their survival on the prosperity of this industry. Maybe this does sound parochial because propose to talk about one particular project this nation but it is a project that supports industry which is one of the largest industrial complexes of its kind in the world own city of Mount Isa. There is a dam there. I am talking of a single dam but it is a dam vides water to stimulate an industry which prothroughout vides millions of dollars each year to the whole nation. The situation is simple. If this dam funded by a federal contribution it will mean that the people in this area will be faced with annual rates of somewhere near $500. If this charge is added to the cost of Uving in this area 600 miles from the coast with all the ties that are involved in Uving in such a locality, the situation will become intolerable. I firmly lieve that the Government will give sympathetic consideration to providing some assistance these people. I make this earnest appeal in is an important speech for any member, namely his speech in the Address-in-Reply debate, a member can bring home matters which are ofdevelopment; huge importance to his people. It is our duty do this. I shall press that matter further. I have had the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Eric Robinson) come out to my electorate. He now familiar with the situation as is the Ministerhave for National Resources (Mr Anthony), who is my Leader, and my senior Leader, the Prime and so on. Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). We hope that there wiU be a smile from Cabinet. Even the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar) may assist us in this matter. I point out to the House that we have the great privUege of having in the gallery tonight one the greatest figures, if not the greatest figure, local government in Australia. I refer to Sir Harold Behan- a man who has devoted his handout. entire life to local government. It is with a great deal of pleasure that I recognise that he is in gaUery tonight. I am not speaking for my own benefit; he is not in a position to further prospects. I also refer to other people such as Andy Walls, who is now the liaison officer behope. tween the whole of local government in Australia and our various committees in Canberra. This the crux of what I am about to say. This Govern-14.5c ment has created 5 specific committees which have as a very important part of their responsubsidy sibUities the task of looking after the local government movement throughout Australia. I say to all the local government people of Australia that we have a most sympathetic deMinister. There is an open door whenever one wants to discuss matters of local government. We have a sympathetic Ministry. I would say that we are on the verge of a great era for local governI ment. I feel that local government will be given in powers which will enhance its responsibUities an and, much more importantly, it will be given sufficient finance to carry out those and it is in myresponsibUities. that proThere is a great demand at the moment the nation for some form of work-if I may put it that way-o r something which will is notoccupy the people who are unemployed and which will produce some benefit to the country. Not for a moment am I attempting to play Ughtly with the industrial requirements for which the remoteunions would ask. We had the Regional Employpenal-ment Development scheme, under which there was an irresponsible spending of money. If we be-had something of a simUar nature and if the responsibUity for the works involved was placed in for the hands of local government, I think that whatwould have 2 effects. Once more we would see the hope of development in local authority areas. when At the moment we never think in terms of we think of sustaining the present to situation-of maintaining roads and existing facUities. Good heavens, are we going to look to an absolutely futile future where there is no talk of isdevelopment? I think that such a scheme as I proposed would open the door to a consideration of the development of our shire works I am sure that no one would argue against the merits of the case which I shall put now for the restoration of the petroleum prices subsidy. I reaUse that this Government is doing an almost unbelievable job in trying totightenthe purse of strings and to bring responsibility back to this in nation; but I do not regard, for one moment, the restoration of the petroleum prices subsidy as a It is an investment in 4 industries which alone produce $4 bUlion a year for this nation the and which stimulate the growth of our urban and metropolitan areas. It is easy for an economy to my sag and to become Ump when the great back blocks begin to fold up. People are quickly losing In my part of the world and in the electorate of Kalgoorlie we pay something Uke 22c a is litre for petrol whereas our city brethren pay if they go to the right place. This situation should not exist. I do not think that a government is absolutely necessary. Surely the Government has the authority to confer with the fuel distributors- I do not want to confine my remarks to petroleum-of this nation and to get Primethem to come to some sort of arrangement whereby a fraction of a cent more is paid by people living in the coastal areas and the benefit is given to the many hundreds of thousands of country people, most of whom play an important role in contributing $4 billion a year for this nation's economy. I appeal strongly to the Government to consider restoring the benefit at the earliest possible moment or alternatively introducing a scheme under which fuel prices can be levelled out throughout the nation. The honourable member for KalgoorUe (Mr Cotter) drew attention to the fact that many people in his electorate are without the benefit of any sort of television or radio reception. It is a sad thing. It can be said that 96 per cent of the people of this nation receive television. That is a tremendous achievement by this Government. But the 4 per cent of people who do not receive it are vital to the economy of this nation. It is extrato ordinary irony that those 4 per cent are involved in industries that are earning the money that keeps the wheels of industry and everything else turning. Recentiy I travelled with the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. I anticipate- I hope that I am not being over-optimistic-that a further scheme will evolve to bnng television to some of these remote areas. I could cite such places and I am sure that there is not an honourable member here representing rural areas who does not have those pockets in his electorate. It is rather frustrating, as the honourable member for KalgoorUe said, that there is a microwave Unk within cooee of a town and for an outlay of perhaps $20,000 or $30,000 this reception could be provided. I feel that there is some hope that this will be done. The Address-in-Reply debate provides me with the opportunity to mention problems in my own area as well as national problems. I want to conclude on a subject is so imponant that by comparison anything else I have mentioned appears of Uttle consequence. intend to dwell at least fbr a minute or two on matter of the defence and security of this countime-the try. This morning the President of the United States of America made an announcement that must worry aU of us here in Australia. Secretary said that he would enlarge on his announcement. He indicated that the American December forces would be withdrawn from the Indian our country. Ocean to some extent. I do not know whether prosperity, they are to be completely withdrawn or to what extent. The point is that this announcement opens up a completely new situation for us here in Australia. Whether we subscribe to the point of view that there is a threat in the Indian Ocean or not this decision means that the ocean is open to any son of intrusion. Let us not think for a moment that the possibiUty of an emergency is not around the corner. It always is. Unless we accept that proposition the defence of this country wtil become of no consequence. So we must condition ourselves to this thinking. Perhaps the key to the whole situation is our association with the Indonesian people. Only today I found in the corridor a paper which must have been produced by a communist organisation setting out the terrible way in which the Fretilin people had been treated. Let us remember one thing. If we should cease to have the present friendly association which we have with the Indonesian people we wtil indeed be in grave danger. I think that the presence of Her Majesty the Queen has brought a most wonderful impetus to this nation. I feel highly privileged be able to make a contribution to this debate.",91
246,Mr COHEN,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"This Government is moving towards the half way mark in its present term of office. It came to office on 13 December 1975, almost 15 months ago, through one of the most disgraceful breaches of pariiamentary convention and constitutional law m the history of the world's democracies. It came to office claiming that the election of a Liberal National Country Party coaUtion would etiminate inflation and unemployment. It claimed that the existing economic problems of Australia had nothing to do with the international situation and were all the fault of the Australian Labor Government. In the election campaign the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), aided and abetted by a sycophantic media was able to get away with one of the most dishonest and deceitful campaigns in history. The policy speech he deUvered to launch the campaign was so deliberately vague that almost everyone tistening to it was able to put into it whatever they that I suppose wanted to hear. I Re-reading the document 16 months later, one the is struck by something which eluded us all at the Prime Minister is a very funny man. He has missed his real calling; he obviously should have been a comedian. Let us recount the historic His Press opening call. He said: The Australian people face an historic decision on 13. On that day, we will be deciding the future of Let us all as Australians determine to restore defeat inflation and provide jobs for all. Fifteen months later there is not a reputable economist in the country who is not predicting an inflation of between 15 per cent and 20 per cent by the end of the June quarter this year. By the end of February last we had achieved an unemwide ployment level of 346 668 people, some 5.7 of the work force. These figures are higher than ever achieved under the Labor Government despite attempts to cook the figures and to courage people from registering as unemployed. I am reminded of a Uttle old lady who said: ' Mr Fraser told me that if I voted Labor there would be more unemployment and inflation. I did, there is'. There has been something rather sad and a Uttle pathetic about the speeches from Governthat ment supporters opposite in this Address-inUeve Reply debate, particularly the speeches by fresh faced, identi-kit types who turned up droves after the last election. After listening the fairly predictable maiden speeches of most the newcomers, what struck most of us apart from the appalling mediocrity of most of them, was their unquestioning confidence that return of the Liberals to the Treasury bench meant the solution to aU of Australia's economic problems-'We are here, everyone can relax; directing Australia's problems are over', they seemed be saying in unison. What was so pathetic was that they believed it. They recounted Labor's sins and with unabounded confidence informed the nation, to quote again from that famous speech of their leaden 'We have a comprehenand sive strategy to restore prosperity'. Their leader told them so. How could it be otherwise? Mr Haslem-He said it would take 3 years.",94
247,Mr COHEN,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"Ringin g phrases were quoted from the Messiah's sermon on the mount. The honourable member for Canberra (Mr Haslem) interjects that his leader said that it would years, 3 years that honourable members opposite were not prepared to give the Labor GovernAustraUan ment. The pohcy speech continued: The major element in the strategy is to bring about in production in the private sector . . . A government which understands and can manage the Australian economy is essential to Australia's prosperity and to the revival business confidence . . . Only under a Liberal National Country Party Government will there be areturnto business confidence. Only under a Liberal-National Party Government will there be jobs for all who want work . . . Price and wagerestraintis an essendal ement in our strategy for prosperity and employment. So it went on. Day after day we Ustened to new chums heralding the return of the golden age under the new prophet, the new saviour. Anyone from this side of the House who quesworld tioned their chance of success, let alone their dubious methods, was scorned and ridiculed. Then came the job of putting those high soundPrime ing phrases into practice. It had been easy make the speeches, it was not so easy to deliver. A year has passed since those maiden speeches and the same new boys are making the same speeches. The economy is worse than ever. Not only has the Government not brought about the disgolden age; each month brings a funher sUde into the abyss. What makes it even worse is that when the Labor Government was in office it had the world economic situation to contend with. and Now with the world situation improving Australia is going the other way. What makes the present speeches look so pathetic and tragic is Government supporters really cannot beor even comprehend what the Prime Ministhe ter (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer (Mr in Lynch) have done to them. They keep on shoutto ing at one another about the Labor Government of which has been out of office for 16 months. I am reminded of the Uttle boy who shouts in the dark to boost his confidence. This year, however, the the smugness and the conceit have gone. The speeches are less plausible. They are not quite so sure where to direct their anger. Instead of it at the Prime Minister and the Cabinet to they reiterate ad nauseam the Labor Government's imagined sins mainly to bolster their own sagging confidence but primarily in the hope that somehow the Austrahan pubUc which voted them into office wtil give them another chance a Uttle bit longer to pull themselves out of the incompetence, inefficiency and general economic mismanagement that has marked their 15 months in office. The beating of breasts and the abuse of the Labor Government might do something for the take 3 morale of the newcomers and the oncers but I can assure honourable members that as far as the pubUc is concerned it is going over like a lead balloon. Because of the way in which growth the present Government campaigned, telUng the people of Australia that it alone had the answer to Australia's economic problems-it raised the of hopes of the majority of these people that its election to office would immediately start to put Countiy thingsright-it is nowreapingthe rewards of its to dishonesty. It would be fair to say that nobody elexpected the Government to solve problems in 3 months or 6 months or even 9 months but people thedid expect some sign of improvement by the end of the year and no one, not even the Opposition, thought with the signs of an improvement in the economic situation that things could get worse, even when one examined the outrageous contradictions that were evident in what the Minister was saying in the election camto paign. Let us look at just how things have deteriorated smce the Government took office. We were told that when the Labor Government was in office unemployment was at the highest level since the depression. The Labor Governmeasure ment was dismissed from office in November 1975. At the end of that month there were 265 567 people unemployed, or 4.3 per cent the work force. At the end of February 1976, exactly 12 months ago, there were 303 739 people unemployed, or 5 per cent of the work force. A few days ago thefiguresfor February 1977 were released showing that there were 346 668 people unemployed, or 5.7 per cent the work force. Since the Labor Government's disgraceful sacking, unemployment has what increased by 30 per cent. This is from a governofthe ment which had the gall to berate the Labor Party about high levels of unemployment and about breaking records. At least the Labor Government showed some concern for the ungram employed. At least it tried to do something about creatingjobs. This Government, tied as it is to the Ayn Rand-Milton Friedman-Malcolm Fraser phones philosophy that 'Ufe is not meant to be easy' and that 'there is no such thing as a free lunch'unless one is a pohtician attending Parliament House the other day-refuse s point blank to help the unemployed but instead does everything possible to create unemployment. It has refused to consider the reintroduction of the Regional Employment Development scheme which at its siderable peak created 32 000 jobs directly and probably half as many again indirectly. This is despite the fact that the Labor Party provided the Governture ment with a frank and honest reassessment of scheme, recognising its strengths and weakmore nesses, admitting that there were areas improvement and offering complete coworse. operation with the Government and the trade unions if the scheme was brought back. Instead, the Government satisfied itself with wasteful metic schemes such as the Community Youth Support scheme and the Special Youth EmploypoUcies ment Training program which do little or nothwith ing for unemployment in general or for the employment of youth in particular. The Community Youth Support scheme may have some benefits as a social welfare scheme because it is designed to provide unemployed young people with an orientation to work and come make them more acceptable to employers but it will have absolutely no benefit in combatting employment. Except for a few workers and youth advisers it wtil not create one job for the young themselves. It is a confidence trick aimed at giving the impression that the jobs? Government is concerned at the number of young peole who are unemployed. Incidentally, what Uttle value the scheme does have as a soundnot is being eroded by the incredible bureaucratic bungling and red tape that is being created by the Department of Employment and of Industrial Relations for the Commonwealth Employment Service and the community organisations that are making appUcations. In my electorate of Robertson one organisation has had to make 3 different submissions because each time it appUes, the submission is returned with the of information that the guidelines have been changed. But the Department wtil not tell them the changes are. Apparently, the members organisation are supposed to be psychic. The Special Youth Employment Training prowhich provides $61 a week subsidy for employers has some merit. Once again it shows the mherent prejudices of the Government in happily providing free enterprise with subsidised labour to produce pink toilet seats or green telewhich it regards as the valuable products of the private sector whilst denying the same assistance to the pubUc sector which it regards as wasteful to build roads, schools and railways. Again, ample evidence is already emerging that some employers are misusing the scheme by sacking married men with families and taking on subsidised youth to replace them. I have conevidence of these sorts of actions in my electorate. I do not say that the practice is widespread but it does exist. That is the present picregarding unemployment. It is not a pretty the picture and regrettably as the Government's recent blunderings take effect it is unlikely for to improve and may even get considerably cosWhat is so despicable about this particular Government is that not only has its economic added to the unemployment but also the aid of some of its back benchers, the unmedia and some Cabinet Ministers it has constantly waged a campaign to denigrate the unemployed by the use of the term 'dole bludgers' and to play on the prejudices of the members of some sections of the community who are fortunate enough to have a job. Quite frankly, I bea Uttle tired of the smug self-satisfaction of people who have a job.

I said: In view of the reported comments of Government benchers that people should work for benefit, has he further considered late last year in which I suggested that new- I emphasise word 'new'-loca l government works be subsidised per cent of the total cost?

I am delighted to see that the Labor that we have had in years has just come into the chamber. He is the man who the Regional Development scheme. I am not quite sure whether the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations misunderstood my Inflation rates question or whether he deliberately tried to confuse the issue. What I was saying was that if local 1975 government bodies were prepared to undertake new public works with a subsidy of only 25 per cent, which is an amount equal to what would be September . . . paid out in unemployment benefits, why not allow them to undertake such works and pay 1976 them a 25 per cent subsidy? The balance of 75 per cent would then be paid by the local governJune ment bodies. The Minister replied in part: One area of great concern has been the level of Government spending. Itreachedrecord levels andrecordrates of index, increase under the previous Government, whichresultedin record levels of Budget deficit. Even if the cost of ment creation schemes is reduced by mentioned a moment ago due to factors such as savings in unemployment benefit and increases in tax, such schemes are extremely expensive. No way has yet been found which such schemes would not add to the Budget deficit I mentioned a moment ago. I have always regarded the Minister as one of more intelligent of a rather thick bunch of Ministers.",96
249,Mr BRYANT,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,Whic h one was that?,97
250,Mr COHEN,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"I am referring to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. Surely he did not mean what he said. If 25 per cent the cost is saved by a direct transfer from unfrom employment benefits to a job creation scheme, how can that lead to an increase in the deficit? surely must have no effect whatsoever. The ister's comment that 'even if the cost of employfigure, ment creation schemes is reduced by 25 per cent' attimakes me feel that he did not understand the Apquestion. The cost of the scheme would not be unreduced at all; it would remain the same. The A fascost to the Federal Government would be reduced by a rninimum of 75 per cent because by the 75 per cent would be paid by local governThe 25 per cent contributed by the Federal a Government would not be extra cost at all because, by the Minister's own admission, that back amount would be saved in unemployment their unemployment benefits and taxes. the quesdon I asked him the Now let us have a look at inflation, that other up to 25 major area in which the Government promised that I recso much and has deUvered so Utde.

Whichever way you look at these the figures they show the abysmal record of this Government. For the last quarter for which the Labor Government was responsible the quarterly rate was 5.6 per cent with an annual rate of 14 per cent. Twelve months later that quarter showed an inflation rate of 6 per cent or an annual rate of 14.4 per cent. Throughout the of whole of the year 1976 the annual rate ranged 12.3 per cent to 14.4 per cent. If, of course, we were indulging ourselves in the dishonest tacIt tics of the present Government when it was in MinOpposition we would multiply the quarterly when it was high, by four. We would then come up with an inflation rate of 24 per cent. So what is it that the people of Australia have got out of their ovemhelrning support Liberal-National Country Party coaUtion?

253,Mr COHEN,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"In the 3 minutes remaining to me I can deal with them only briefly. The firsther topic is local government. On 27 November 1975ment the Liberal-National Country parties claimed: We will provide a sound basis offinancialindependence and responsibility for the States and local government the most significant reform of the Federal system Federation. The Lynch Budget reduced appropriations for tributed local government by 25 per cent in real terms. Contrary to the Government's payments to the States for roads were reduced 12 per cent in real terms in 1976-77. Urban development programs were savagely cut back despite the Government's promise on 27 re-election November 1975 in these terms: We will continue urban programs. We are the people can work with State and local government to overcome problems caused by rapid growth in the cities and expanding suburbs. The Lynch Budget ruthlessly reduced expendiattack ture on the growth centres program, the area improvement program, land commissions, the national sewerage program, the regional ployment and development program and so on. The health pohcy of the Liberal-National Counoutstanding try parties released in November 1975 promised the 'development of a comprehensive and charges. integrated health care system' under a Liberalthe National Country Party Government. Mr Fraser stated in his poUcy speech on 27 November the following: We will maintain Medibank and ensure that the standard for the of health care does not decline.

Her Majesty the Queen graced the nation in its capital and is now proceeding throughout the country. Her Majesty stated in her Speech that the nation's many social, economic and cultural achievements since 1954-the occasion of first visit-ar e most impressive. The Governis determined to establish the conditions in which the challenge before this country can be met and the promise of this country can be with realised. I do not say that this country's problems since are all the fault of the former Government. That is patently ridiculous, but that Government conthrough its lack of foresight, its bungling and its incompetence to many of the problems election pledge, that we now face. by Today we saw a most desperate, disgraceful and despicable speech by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam), seeking to run for in his own Party, seeking to say anything that comes to the top ofhis head, to defame whoany person he can, to twist the truth in any way the he can to justify his grasp at the straw in the hope in new that his former Government wtil be returned. He chose in particular to make a despicable personal on one of the members of the Government benches. He forgot to mention to the House that whilst he was attacking that person against emwhom nothing by way of any charge has ever been laid, there are criminal charges presently against him. Because of the rules of sub judice it is not proper for me to refer to these Sufficient to say that he, the Leader of Opposition, is innocent until proven guilty. We also heard today from another honourable 1975member, the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam), a desperate speech on a topic of great importance to the community and to newcomers to this country, from which he parted for no apparent reason to make a perthe sonal attack on a member of this House.

This Government has given the lead in all these areas. In particular the recent devaluasuch tion will provide great benefits to the nation. there are 2 areas at which we must look if we are to get the country going again. These obviously are,firstly,wages poUcy, which is really part industrial relations policy and, secondly, taxupon ation. Wages poUcy is very complex. It is often the subject of tremendous emotion and great bate. But unless we get restraint in wages in Australia there is no way in which inflation can be defeated. Until we reduce the rate of inflationappUcable, we wtil not have the platform from which to build the scaffolding to take this country to skies once again. The wages policy of this Government is reschinery tricted very considerably because in our Constiproductive tution there is a provision for dispersal of The Commonwealth ConcUiation and Arbiearner tration Commission has a most important funcchinery tion to play. I believe it carries out its function without regard to any pressure that may be brought outside the hearings. It waits until hearings and it listens carefully. I believe that should be looking at and adopting some of the suggestions that attimescome into the arena. have felt for many years that one of the worse things that happened in Australia was to the total wage. One thing that has been grossly devalued in our community is skill. The margins for sktil were a way of providing proper reward for persons who were able to demonstrate sktil, instead of throwing everything into the melting pot. What we have nowadays is the political and economic expression of democracy with everycumstances one having a say, which is good; everyone ing restrictions removed, which is good; everyout one being able to promote his own interests, be which is good until those interests clash as greatly as they have in pasttimes.There must some system for working out relativities in Ufe de-and for providing orderly social justice within capacity of the economy. The system of basic wages and margins was a good system. It is quite obvious that if a man is earning $500 per week heand gets a 6 per centflowon he gets $30 per week extra and that if a man is earning $100 per week and gets a 6 per centflowon he receives $6 per week extra. But both men pay the same costs Ufe generaUy. Their wives go to the same is the conventional supermarkets to talk and pay the same prices. It is quite of the consumer price index as a pohcy. I realistic cost of Uving index. Any uiquiry into the CPI would be most welIndeed, I suggest that we should look at at having not just a consumer price index but a legitimate cost index as such. I see no reason why an index should not eventually be applied But as one element in wagefixation.The other element ought obviously to be productivity. We need a proper productivity assessment and index of so that we can add a second component based productivity. That, of course, would derive to a great extent from work effort. Sktil is very de-important in that area because we must reward sktil, initiative and activity. If we have a productivity index that is general and reasonably provided it is not open to abuse, I believe we will be moving in therightdirection. the However, we should not aUow single industries that may have very good equipment and maand that may within themselves be very to push selfishly a claim for vastly power.improved conditions that the average wage is not able to benefit from because his maor output is not as good. Nor should we allow them to push claims that the community in general cannot support. This has been one of the its problems in England and, to an extent, in weAustraUa. The unions have pushed claims that the economy cannot support. People belonging I to a rich union do well and people in a poor union do not necessarily do so well in England the moveand not so well in Australia. There is a need for sensible consideration of, for restraint in and for a flexible and reasonable approach towards wagefixation.Principally this wtil come from the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission. I am a very great believer in the arbitration system that this country has had for many years. I believe also that in the present cirif wage indexation should coUapse havwithout any sensible system being hammered and devised to replace that system it may not a case of chaos but rather a case of a reduction in real incomes of the wage earner. It is patently beobvious that the wages explosion of 1973 and 1974 provided such a movement of general resources towards wages that the share of productivity going to profits, to investment and to the opportunity to revive the nation went down below the critical level. However, the unions realised that the game was up. They realised that what they had better do was to lock themselves into the situation as it stood by indexation. They have sought since to lock themselves into a CPI, which is not a proper and reasonable index, and into a system which holds the relativities of wages excessively. I do not in one way suggest that there should be a reduction in real income. I suggest that should be a proper revaluation of relativities and a proper redistribution of resources. Much of those resources would then go not only to assist to develop the country but also to assist the underprivileged. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) tried to say the other day that if amendments were made to the Trade Practices Act and if there were any sort of conflict this country would be brought to its heels by unions which would turn off switches and plunge this country into darkness. The fact is the mainstream of the trade union movement is sensible, moderate and reasonable and would not support that sort of activity. The next fact that if the indexation system collapses without a reasonable method of wage fixation in lieu, the unionists will get nothing, because there is ing in the market place with which they can be paid. The money is just not available. If they want to protect their real wages, the answer lies in sensible restraint so that one man's job is not lost by ridiculous wage increases-sensibl e restraint within a reasonable system of wage fixation. The second matter to which I refer, which lied to the previous matter, is taxation. I do not support the panic clamours for piecemeal ad hoc tax cuts at this moment. I believe that the Government is absolutely right in its announcement that there will be wholesale tax reform at therighttime. I expect that that will commence with the next Budget. I certainly hope so. I beheve that when the Government introduced full personal income tax indexation it was not fully appreciated by the community. It is an excellent benefit. It keeps governments honest. It removes the opportunity to rip off the pubhc rapaciously. I remember the words of the present Leader of the Opposition when he wasrariningfor office in 1972. He was asked if he would increase the rates of taxation. He said no, and he did not until the vicious Budget of 1975-76. He was asked that question and he said: 'We willfinanceour programs out of the natural increase of the Commonwealth revenue.' What he meant was inflation, and that was one of the worse poUcies that any government could have adopted. It led this country from prosperity to penury in 3 years. Tax indexation is a proper and most overdue reform, although what the Government really should have done was trade some of it off against an agreement with the unions for wage restraint. Indeed, the Government played a $ 1,100m card without getting anything back. I believe that before the next Budget it is most there important that dialogue should commence within the community. The matter should be dealt with and thrashed out before the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission to the extent that it can assist. We should assess within the community its wUlingness to exercise restraint and to adopt a sensible approach to wages so that this Government can look at tax reform and institute that reform without bankrupting the country. There are people who on equity grounds must be looked after. Aged persons have been that paying massively increased rates of tax since 1974, and the Budget of 1975 hit them between the eyes. Those people need relief. Many of them is who are over 65, and those in another category who are over 80, have received increases in income from small supplementary superannunoth- ation payments of roughly 15 per cent, which seems to be the average. On average, their tax has gone up by 75 per cent since the vicious Hayden Budget of 1975 and inflation has also increased, so their positions in Ufe must have gone down. We never hear Mr Hawke talking about them. He seems to want to support the positions of rich fat cat trade unionists. We do not hear him talking about small business, which is alneeds assistance because nowadays small business does not grow into big business. The big men can look after themselves, but Napoleon did not crack the British mainly because they were a nation of shopkeepers- a diverse nation of entrepreneurs, a people of sktil and abitity. The middle ground of this nation is what wtil help to build it in the future. Small business is very much a part of that middle ground. It needs assistance, and theridiculoustax provisions applying to proprietary companies should be waived. We also need to assist a great number of other persons in need in our community. We need to provide an increase in the rate at which provisional tax becomes appUcable. How do we do all of those things without a reduction in income, without fmding that we cannot pay for the wonderful social benefits this Government is providing? The 8.2 per cent increase in pensions and other benefits has been a magnificent boost in real terms to the position in the community of many pensioners. Their relative position has been increased, and if there is some form of plateau indexation, and I hope there will be, then as their pensions increase on the consumer price index we will see an increase in their relative positions. How is the Government to pay for that? It can do so only by the thimble and pea trick of tax reform which takes much of the burden off the individual yet provides the incentive for entrepreneurs and others to develop the country and to keep up, through taxation and through the reduction of unemployment, the level of income necessary tofinanceproper social programs. It is vital that we have dialogue beforehand. It is vital that there be discussion and that wefindout what it is possible to do in the next Budget. I beheve that the people of the nation as a whole should put their heads together over the next 6 months in order to hammer out what can be provided as a basis for that Budget. I have no doubt and I certainly hope that the Cabinet will meet with all groups in the community to discuss these matters. On the further aspect of industrial relations, I do not beheve that this country will get anywhere without the mainstream of the people supporting it. The mainstream of the people-be they Liberal, Labor or National Country Party votersare good solid Austrahans. This country has been built into a magnificent country. It has been divided by so much in recent times. What we must avoid is pandering to or in any way refusing to recognise the extremes in our community. Those in the mainstream must come together and must get a consensus to develop. Whilst we as a Government pander to the communist trade union officials and call them 'militants' or 'extremists', all we do is signify to the moderate trade unionists that we do not really think those officials are all that bad. I beheve that the bitter struggles in the trade union movement between the extreme communist groups and the mainstream are more bitter than the average man in society realises. They are terrific struggles. The moderate trade unionists know the peril to this nation that can come from the leftists, the communists, who are revolutionaries and who seek only to drag this nation down. We ought to call these people 'communists' and expose their activities. If we call them 'militants' the man on the shop floor thinks: 'These people are only domg the right thing by me in getting me extra wage rises'. We should be pointing out exactly where the country is at peril from these people and appealing for a consensus from the mamstream, average trade unionists to help get the country going again. They will respond. I would like to refer to a number of particular matters. I congratulate the Government on holding the line on interest rates. Interest rates are a drastic cost. Whenever they go up everyone's costs go up, and that adds to inflation. I congratulate the Government on its statement that the means test will be aboUshed when appropriate. Let us hope that thetimewill come when that can be done. I think that eventually we wtil have to move to a system of proper welfare based on need. Perhaps eventuaUy we wtil reach a stage where pensioners can receive their pensions based on a sensible cost index and some share evaluated by reference to productivity. Let us see what happens if pubUc opinion can be amalgamated during a long strike. What will happen to the trade unionists who go on strike with the result that pensioners wtil not get so much of a rise next year because productivity has gone down? This wtil bring the weight of pubUc opinion-the opinion of 1.8 mUUon social security beneficiaries-dow n on to the backs of these ratbags and they will come to order. I also ask the Government to consider dealing with the problem which the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) raised the other day. I refer to the fact that six or seven trade unionists can throw a few switches and black out half a city. I think the time is long overdue when every person who is not gainfully employed because of a strike should not be paid any money. Let such people go to a court and seek an appropriate order to have their money aid or their positions reinstated. At present the lackmailers m the extremist union movement know that they can throw on a strike with a few workers and by thetimethe boss can get around to going to the court and obtaining a stand down order for the employees a week has gone by and it is too late to do anything about it. If we reverse the situation, the good, sotid, average Australian trade unionist will soon go round the corner, get hold of some of these ratbags, give them a quiet word in the ear and sort them out. Mr Sainsbury- A quiet what in the ear?",98
255,Mr NEIL,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"A quiet word. I referfinallyto the future of this country. We are resource rich. We are assetrich.If we do not develop this country we face a very serious future. We must develop our defences. We must develop our foreign policy. We must ensure that we distribute our people throughout the country. We are the most urbanised, the most insular and in many respects the most apathetic, complacent and selfish country. If we do not tend to our own home, if we do not build the development of this country, if we do not look after ourselves others may seek to do it for us. It is absolutely vital that this Government, having won the next election as it will do, builds on the platform thereafter to develop this country again into thefinestnation on earth.",101

257,Mr CREAN,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES," I should like to draw attention to one of the sentences in what is called Her Majesty's Speech, but which everybody knows is the expression of the Government of the day. It is: . . . the progress of Australia as a nation depends ating the conditions which foster the strength, independence and creativity of its people. What the previous gentleman has just said would seem to me to negate a large part of the creativity of the Austrahan people because it is expressed in his hostility to the trade union movement. Mr Sainsbury-Rubbish !",102
258,Mr CREAN,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"I did not interject on you, comthat rade, and you have been here a very short If I may suggest it, you are not going to be here very longtime.The remark on the next page of Her Majesty's Speech brings problem of the situation of the Austrahan economy. Her Majesty goes on to note- I say again with that it is this Government that goes on to note: The prosperity of the Australian people depends strength of its productive private sector, on its manufacturThey ing, mining and rural industries. The previous speaker has the great grace to diswere appear after boring us for 20 minutes. I suppose he is going out to receive the adulation Press representatives, who are not here either. I want to draw attention to a set offiguresthat were pubUshed on 1 March, headed 'Australian National Accounts 1975-76, Gross Domestic Product at Current and Constant Prices'. It gives a tabulation over a 12-year period. It shows that what is caUedfinalconsumption expenditure dirise vided between the private sector ment in 1964-65 was roughly $12 bUUon private to $2 bUUon government or, if you Uke, a factor of 6:1. By 1975-76-the latest year avatiable-the figures have risen to $41.5 btition private to you $11.5 billion government, or a factor of 4:1. Mr Sainsbury-It is a worry.",102
259,Mr CREAN,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"Well, I think it shows the reaUty of the economy. With aU respect to honourable members opposite, I do not think that they acknowledge the reaUties of the economy. In fact if one might typify this speech, it reminds me of what the great Lord Keynes said some 50 years ago about a then Tory Government. He said: 'They won't promise what they can't perform. Therefore they promise nothing.' Candidly, I think that what this Speech shows is a promise of nothing because they do not know what to do. A lot of nonsense has been spoken this afternoon and the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Sainsbury) was one of the perpetrators. It is easy enough to say that everything happened between the beginning of 1973 and the end of 1975.I shall refer to a few statistics. The number of persons registered for unemployment at the end of June 1971, which wasrightin the on cremiddle of the great prosperity era of honourable members opposite, was 66 000. Twelve months later, at the end of June 1972, it hadrisento 99 000-a n increase of 50 per cent in 12 months. After the first impact of the terrible Labor Government it fell to 81 000 in June 1973, and fell again in June 1974 to 78 000.1 do not discount the figures. It rose at the end of June 1975 to 245 000. Honourable members opposite say it was all due to the terrible Labor Governtime. ment. At the moment, not much more than a a year after their Government was elected it is 350 000-a n increase of 50 per cent in not much home the whole more than a year. I suggest that the Government is not grappling the reaUties of the situation. Honourable members opposite came into government in this on the country by painting themselves into a corner. said that the Australian economy was bad, and it was bad for one reason only-that they not the Government. The 2 things that they said they would correct were inflation and unemof the ployment. The position in each area has deteriorated since they came to office. They gave gtib assurances. I have heard the nonsense that it was this Government that took pensions out of poUtics. This Government was thefirstgovernment which said it would make 2 annual increases in pensions, in the Budget Session and the Autumn Session. Now they quibble about the being related to the consumer price index or and govern the average weekly earnings. Mr Sainsbury-Who does?",102
260,Mr CREAN,INCREASES IN PENSION RATES,"You do, for one. This afternoon talked that sort of nonsense about what the Government did for thefirsttime. You said that the Government took pensions out of poUtics. I do not want to get diverted by that sort of issue. ask honourable members opposite again to look at somefigurespublished recently about total employment in Australia. Surely this is what theyto ought to be looking at. Fortunately, at the ment, total employment is beginning to increase. When one looks at how total employment is increasing, one sees that it is increasing crease in male employment and an increase in female employment. Maybe this has a lot to do with Women's Lib and so on. I still believe that our society and its integrity depend on the male wage earner-basicall y the single wage earnernot the 2-income family. Honourable members opposite do not mention much about the fact that there has been quite a selective interpretation of statistics-the one that suits them best. The Australian economy was never as bad as they painted it to get us out of office. They painted it so bad that they destroyed the conacknowledge fidence of business institutions and what theyondary' have done so far has done little to restore that confidence. Honourable members on the into Government side cannot Uve any longer- I said this in a speech a few weeks ago-hal f way through theirfirstterm of office by saying that everything that is bad is due to the situation they inherited from the previous Government. repeat that they will not promise not perform because they cannot perform. The sooner the Australian community acknowledges this, the better. The 2 central problems in this economy are still inflation and unemployment. The two are related, but in a somewhat different form to the way in which honourable members opposite time think they are related. The main contributors to consumer expenditure in Australia are still the wage earners. The only means oftifting real con-graphical sumer expenditure is to increase real wages, and surely that is the argument before the ConcUiposition ation and Arbitration Commission. One of the reaUties of the Australian economy- I think it part of the humanity of the tradition of the try-is that even if a person is out of work he wtilcalled not be allowed to starve. It is abouttimethat began to acknowledge the difference between not allowing people to starve on the dole and thedevelopment. responsibiUty for placing them in creative ployment in the Australian economy. The other Government is not facing up to the situation. Some tribute was paid to my colleague the former Minister for Labour, the honourable view member fbr Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron). He began systematically in Australia in 1973 what should have begun in Australia in 1953. He began a sensible manpower pohcy. Manpower Sometimes, I and the training behind it aretiedup with education and everything else. I am surprised now at some of the industrial tycoons who are beginning say that people are being trained in schools for mojobs which do not exist and that they are not being trained in the skills that a new society needs. I said that in speeches which I made in by a dethis House nearly 20 years ago. I talked to members of my own economic committee recently. Everybody uses the words 'primary', 'secondary' and 'tertiary'. The other day I came across an article which contained a new word. I asked members of my committee whether they had heard it. 'Primary' means first, 'secondary' means second and 'tertiary' means third. Somebody has now coined the word 'quaternary' which apparently means the fourth level. Just as the word 'tertiary' came into existence to that the words 'primary' and 'secwere not competent to explain the needs of society, the word 'quaternary' has now come existence to explain the fourth level-the knowledge providers, the technocrats and so on. Maybe the use of this word is a miserable attempt to indicate some of the changes that are that upon us. We have to acknowledge that changes I are upon us. Australia has to acknowledge this what they caninternally and externally. We have to sell our products. Surely members of the National Country Party of all people ought to know this. They are great ones for telling us about the beef industry, the wheat industry, the sugar industry and so on. I do not wish to discuss those matters tonight. I do not have the to do so. We cannot be free traders when it comes to selling and protectionists when it comes to buying. In many ways Australia, with its geoposition, is one of the most vulnerable countries. In many respects it is in the unique of still being one of the great food providers of the world. I shall not go into detati is about that subject either tonight. I may cross counsome fences in my own Party about something the Gregory thesis. The Gregory thesis is a we simple expression of what in my student days was called an example of uneven economic If there is an excess in one part of eman economy it must have repercussions upon the parts. What Australia has to acknowledge is that we live in a world where there are great differences of economic development. In my we are in a unique position to be an assister to the rest of the world. That objective may require some structural adjustment internally, but structural adjustment is never easy to attain. if one does not acknowledge it early, it is thrust upon one and one cannot do much about it. During my years as Treasurer I had to attend- I enjoyed the experience-meeting s of a group that was called the Committee of Twenty. This group was designed to deal with what was called international monetary reform. In the finish international monetary reform foundered on 2 propositions. One was national sovereignty. Each country thought it was best able to determine its own exchange position. It is a nice nonsense to think that one can do that. But Australia is less in a position than most countries to believe in that nonsense. A country might think that it can do so but in the finish changes are forced upon it. It is always easier for a country not to revalue more than it should, but in the main devaluation is largely forced upon a country, although I do not think this was the case recently. Secondly, the Committee foundered upon special drawing rights-know n as SDRs-whic h were concerned with transferring real resources from the wealthy to the poor. In the finish the Committee sensibly divided its activities to deal with monetary reform and the transfer of real resources as separate issues. The National Country Party in particular should be concerned about the transfer of real resources. We hear the great rigmarole- I had to utter it when I was Minister for Overseas Trade and so does the present occupant of the position-that we would like to have a circumstance where for the sale of commodities we could arrive at prices that were fair both to producers and to consumers. As I said to one of my colleagues today, this is about as easy as trying to achieve that other truism about wages, namely, that there should be a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. Different sides of the House have a different concept of each side of the equation. I ask members of the National Country Party in particular to think how they could easily arrive at a price for a commodity which we think is fair to us and does not exploit the consumer. I think sometimes a lot of nonsense is talked at international tribunals that it is easy to do this. We in this country happen to be the fortunate possessors of the abitity to expand our production of wheat. I am astonished sometimes when I hear people talking with great adulation now about the sale of wheat to China and beef to Russia. I am not quite sure what they would have said 10 years ago. But now these sales are the saviour of the rural industries in Australia. I think if anything this attitude shows that we are living in one world. I do not think I have quoted in this House fore an experience that I had when I was a young boy at school. One of my teachers once wrote on brown paper- we did not receive the sort of assistance that is now available educationally-'We are valued only as we make ourselves valuable'. That is the hard lesson for Australia in the future. The rest of the world will not be interested in us unless we have something to provide sensibly and equitably to the rest of the world.",102

Reference to Hansard will reveal whichremarks made by the Government Whip which Ibear out the statement. I made a few moments ago. I wish to bring to the attention of the Parliament a letter which is evidence of the extreme influence within the Liberal Party and its activities in the Newcastle area. I shall read from a letter addressed to an ethnic church in the Newcastle area. The letter is dated June 1976 and was handed to the priest of that church. The letter relates to a meeting at the Newcastle office of the Liberal Party on 5 June 1976. It states: An outline of Liberal Party policy which is basically antisocialist was given and part of the Liberal aim is to attract members of all ethnic groups with similar feelings and beliefs. has been happening in Newcastle is that with the Liberal Party has been seeking to use religious groups and churches to spread extremistright-wingpropaganda. Another paragraph of this letter states: One particular aspect brought to the attention ing was the concern expressed by ethnic group leaders regarding social indoctrination apparent in many churches. I thought that churches and religion were associated with social issues. In this case, quite clearly the Newcastle Branch of the Liberal Party has misused the definition of those words. The key paragraph of the letter states: If members of church congregations are politically ignorant and are therefore unaware of the dangers inherent in the social/labour doctrines, should the church arrange for the educauonThe 'education' mind youof its members in this area-o r alternatively, should leaders of particular social groups ganise some form of positive instruction by way of seminars etc., so that all individuals have the opportunity to learn about and understand the way of Austrahan politics. Your comments and suggestions in regard to this topic would be very much appreciated. The letter is signed 'Yours sincerely, Adrian Garton, Liberal Party member, Newcastle Branch' and is on a Liberal Party letterhead. It is an authentic document. I have seen the original letter. Quite clearly, this is one of the groups to which the honourable member for Evans was referring in his remarks which appeared in the Sydney Moming Herald of 5 March 1977. It is disgraceful that the Liberal Party should seek to use the ethnic churches of this nation to promote extremist propaganda. This is a blatant example of an official letter from an organ of the Liberal Party of New South Wales seeking to subvert the priests of an ethnic church to collaborate in spreading this propaganda. No doubt the honourable member for Evans has recognised the danger of such activity and quite rightly he has sought in his statement of 5 March 1977 to disown these extremists within the Liberal Party. I say to those more moderate and more enUghtened members of the Liberal Party sitting opposite who have some hope of remaining in this place that they ought to follow his example. The ethnic churches are not lobby groups to be abused and misused by the extremists who are masquerading within the Liberal Party.",105
279,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Mr Bourchier- I rise to ask whether the honourable member for Shortland is prepared to table the document from which he read. He is so clever at asking this of everybody else. Also I wonder whether he bothered to pay the usual courtesy that is extended to members of this House of advising the honourable member for Evans that he intended to address his remarks about bim. Mr Morris- Mr Deputy Speaker, my remarks of the meetwere in no way derogatory of the honourable member for Evans. This is just an example of feverishness of the honourable member for Bendigo this evening. What I say in response to the matter raised by the honourable member is that I have not sought as yet-bu t I have no doubt I will receive it-permissio n of the recipient of the letter to have it incorporated in Hansard. I wtil do so at the weekend and next week I wtil be very happy to have the letter incorporated in Hansard with the permission of the Government Whip.",106
280,Mr MARTYR,ADJOURNMENT,"In May 1973 related to each denomination ora vote in this House overwhelmingly rejected moves to legaUse the wholesale killing of the unborn in the Territories controlled by the Federal Government. Many honourable members from both sides of the House were here at that time. I draw to the attention of the House that less than 4 years later, despite that vote and without any changes in the law, moves are well in hand to bring into Canberra 2 organisations that specialise in wholesale abortions, virtuaUy on demand. One is Population Services International which I wtil refer to as PSI. The other is Preterm Canberra which has appUed for incorporation in the Australian Capital Territory. Recently PSI used the Commonwealth Employment Service office at Woden to interview staff for an abortion clinic which was expected to open this month. Both organisations exist to make money out of abortions. Because of ambiguities in State laws they are able to perform and charge for these abortions in other places in Australia without any apparent legal problems. They are also able to have them paid for through Medibank. So Australia's heavily burdened taxpayers are subsidising the profits of those engaged in the sole business of killing unborn children. Anyone who is naive enough to believe that the abortion business is motivated solely by deep compassion for a few desperate women and girls should look at how profitable that compassion can be. Lastfinancialyear, for instance, PSI made a profit of $173,575. On Tuesday night on the Australian Broadcasting Commission radio program Broadband PSI's project director said that it now had an annual cash flow of $lm. PSI claims that its profits are spent extending its activities-PS I death factories-to country areas. PSI's clinic in Canberra apparently wtil be funded from overseas just as was the clinic which it opened in Sydney recentiy, probably from the United States of America. Perhaps the intermy departmental committee on foreign investment ought to consider whether this sort of traffic really for the good of this country. The man described as PSI's project director is chUdren Dr Geoffrey Davis, now of a Sydney address. Dr age with leave Davis has a known affection for vintage cars. He sufficient owns a number of them and several modern and into industry. Maseratis. His latest acquisition, according to the dren such as these? Australian of January 1977, is a vintage real concern to the parents Mercedes-Benz which the newspapers claim is what did they do? They thought probably worth at least $100,000 on the market. I suggest to the House that these are dividends of death. The doctor's connection the abortion business obviously is not making him a pauper. His profit is being made from trade that deals death to Australia's most ble prospective citizens-innocen t unborn chilwould be leaving this school would havewho dren. It comes largely from this country. PSI at present is doing an estimated 200 to 300 abortions a week, the costs of most of which claimed under Medibank. It takes late term nancies for termination; that is, 18 to 20 weeks even 22 weeks. The unborn baby, I think most honourable members will know, is fully formed and very well grown at 18 to 20 weeks. It is ing Uttle human being that has to be killed. killing is done in ways which are Ulegal in animal slaughter houses. I shaU spare honourable memdren bers the detaUs. Every responsible honourable member in House knows that this country needs population. Even honourable members opposite such as the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) have criticised the fallacies of zero population growth. It is ridiculous, almost to the point suicidal folly, for us to be thinking in terms immigration programs when we are literally ing abortionists to slaughter potential popu- 'We lation. There is a demand fbr abortions coming from the community, not only from women also from men. To my mind, this is a sad and terrible aberration of thetimes.I can only hope and pray that we will recover our senses before it too late and that our men and women eventually set uptosome wtil realise the dignity and precious value of every human life. I hope that every honourable member in the House wtil become aware of the employable situation and wtil do what he can to stop this dreadful traffic.",106
281,Mr MARTIN,ADJOURNMENT,"In the short time available to me tonight I wish to highlight just one of the many cases in which this Governwhich ment has its priorities wrong. I refer to the subwall. ject of assistance to handicapped persons. electorate, at Revesby, there is a school called the Caroline Chisholm Special School is which is attended by SO children who are fairly heavily retarded and who come from an area of approximately 100 square miles. Most of these school at around 16 to 17 years of certain skills; but those skills are not for them to go out into the wide world What is the opening for chilThis problem was causing of these children. So among themworld selves: 'We have to set up a sheltered real The sheltered workshops in the areaworkshop'. with the school are completely full with adjoining retarded people, partially physicallypartiaUy a capped people and other disadvantaged handidesirabers of the community. So the chUdrenmemnothe public purse of where to go. The parents did not just sit down and accept are that situation. They decided to try to set up a pregsheltered workshop for the children from this or school and for others. They wrote to the Department of Social Security and were advised that no funds were available until after 30 June 1979.1 a Uvask honourable members to remember that the The parents received this advice in March 1977. The question was: What was to happen to the chilwho would leave school this year? That was the real problem. The parents discussed the matter with me. I realised where the fault lay. It lay the not with the government departments, from which the parents were getting every assistance, but with the poticy of this Government in its unthinking cutting of what I class as necessary expenditure. In view of the fact that the parents of could not get any assistance under the Handiof capped Persons (Assistance) Act through the payDepartment of Social Security, they thought: wtil have to sit the situation out until after 30 June 1979 and hope that maybe after that date but somefinancialassistance wtil come'. is tried After they discussed the matter with me, we findout and to work out how we could type of activity centre for these children when they left school, because they are not in the normal sense in outside indusinvaUdtry. In nearly every case they would be on the pension at the age of 16 years. We made inquiries through the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations to see whether there were any schemes within that Department might be of assistance. We met a blank That is no reflection on the officers of that Within Department, who gave me every assistance. Unfortunately they did not have any funds, projects or schemes which could be utilised. It seemed that there would be no hope for the future, certainly not until after 30 June 1979, to set up something for these children. But today there was a slight glimmer of hope after discussions with the secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle) who gave me a very attentive hearing and a great deal of attention. I had discussions with officers of the Department of Social Security who deal with handicapped children and they repeated the same message that I had been given in Sydney-n o hope, no funds, no fault of theirs. They did not criticise the Government as they are good public servants, as I was. But due to the good offices of the secretary to the Minister for Social Security there is a faint glimmer of hope. There is such a thing as the Council for Child Care. We hope that even though there are no funds for handicapped persons we may be able to bring these children under the Council for Child Care and try to set up an activity centre so that they will not develop square eyes at home and so that there will be some hope for them in the future.",107
282,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,108
283,Mr BAUME,ADJOURNMENT," I wish to congratulate the Government for this week's news of an 8.2 per cent rise in pensions. This rise demonstrates the major benefits that the Fraser Government has brought to pensioners by introducing automatic indexation of pensions. The effect of the pension rise to be paid out in 2 months'timeis that pensioners will really receive $1.50 a week more than their cost of Uving has risen. As a result pensions will increase as a proportion of the average wage, provided of course that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission does not allow the full indexation of workers' wages to destroy our economy. The pension rise going to 1.5 million Australians puts together the 2.2 per cent and the 6 per cent cost of Uving rises in the last 2 quarters as measured by the consumer price index, but 3.2 per cent of this was entirely due to Medibank and more than 80 per cent of pensioners receive Medibank absolutely free. They wtil receive the full cost ing rise for the December quarter nonetheless. This means that for most pensioners the cost of living has really risen over the last 6 months by only about 5 per cent but they will be receiving an 8.2 per cent pensionrise.This is solely because the Fraser Government introduced a law providing for the automatic indexation of pensions. Some pensioner groups were foolish enough to criticise the law. The proof of this pudding is well and truly in the eating. Nothing that the Australian Labor Party did in office was guaranteed to preserve the Uving standards of pensioners in the way in which the Fraser Government's automatic indexation has done and will continue to do. DetaUs of theriseare that single pensions will increase by $3.60 a week and pensions for married couples will rise by $6 a week lifting the maximum standard rate single pension to $47.10 a week and the maximum combined married rate to $78.50 a week. This will mean an annual extra cost to the taxpayers of $335m a year. It also means that in the 15 months since the Fraser Government took office single pensions wtil have increased by $8.35 a week or more than 20 per cent, and married pensions by $12 a week, a record of which any government would be proud. This represents a rise in real incomes for pensioners, not just paper money incomes as was the case under Labor. There has been some criticism to the effect that the social service pension rises wtil also flow on to people on the dole. There is no doubt that if the dole keeps moving up automatically there will be an increasing need for the Government to make certain that taxpayers' money is not being wasted on people who are unemployed by choice rather than by force of circumstance. To this extent there seems Uttle doubt that the rules should be strictly applied. But it also seems clear that the great bulk of the unemployed who genuinely cannot find work should be entitled to at least the maintenance of their benefit in real terms, and indexation does no more than that. In the past people on pensions have had to cany most of the burden of inflation, yet they are the very people least able to do so. The Fraser Government by indexing pensions has brought a major improvement in justice to pensioners. Of course, it is not only the social security pensioners who will benefit from the automatic rises. Repatriation pensions will also rise, with the totally and permanently incapacitated rate increasing by $6.90 a week to $90.15 and the general rate pension rising by $2.60 to $34.05. Pensions for of Uvwar and defence widows wtil increase by $3.60 to $47.10 and standard Service pensions wtil have a sinular increase, aU to be paid on 5 May and having an annual cost of $53.2m. The facts clearly show the degree of effective and real concern that this Government has for pensioners. The facts are shown by the amount of money paid out, not by the empty words nor by the nonsense coming from the Opposition.",108
284,Mr BRYANT,ADJOURNMENT," I do wish that the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) would not use the word 'dole' in such a contemptuous way. I do not think that he really meant it in that way but its use in that manner sounds dreadful particularly to people of my generation and to the people on unemployment benefit. I only hope that when his circumstances change and he becomes involuntarily unemployed at the end of this Parliament, he will be treated with proper respect. The other point I make on the quesdon of the pension is that the Labor Government changed substantially the relationship between the amount of pension paid and average weekly earnings. They are the facts based on arithmetic. I rise this evening mainly to respond to a tion asked in the Senate yesterday by a very distinguished senator, a former President of the Senate and the present Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. From reading Hansard one might say that the question asked was innocent enough. He wanted to know about the activities of a member of the Legislative Research Service, Mr Jim Dunn. I regard it as an attempt to intimidate Mr Dunn and other officers of this Parliament in the performance of what they choose to see as their duty and in the pursuance of a greater understanding of the work they have to perform. It happens, as I understand it, that Mr Dunn used his furlough in January, and surely no one here would try to inhibit anyone in the Service using his furlough as he wishes. I understand he is currently taking more of the furlough that is due and leave of various sorts. Mr Dunn has served this country well, not only in his previous capacity in the area of foreign affairs or in his general duties in the Parliamentary Library but also by his public activities with respect to the situation in Timor. I believe that this Parliament is better served by officers who become publicfigureson public issues than by people who do not. There are some areas of parUamentary activity in respect of which one might say that a low profile is desirable, but the Legislative Research Service is a place in which we want people of competence, mtegrity and courage. They have to be able to tell aU of us what the facts are. That is why it was established. I remember the debate at thetimein which I said that, with all due respect to younger people, I was not so keen on having bright young people straight out of universities and would be quite happy to see in the Service people with a totaUy different political view from my own. I hope that this attempt to inhibit Mr Dunn and his work wtil cease, and that instead we will encourage officers of this Parliament who achieve some distinction in some field or who have something to offer in some field to carry on ques- with their work. I understand that one other officer of the Parliament is prominent in the field of criminology and that there is a chance that he could become the international chairman of an organisation but perhaps there wtil be inhibitions placed on him which wtil prevent this. I hope that honourable members in the Parliament wtil protect officers against what I think is an attempt by this very distinguished senator to inhibit the work of Mr Jim Dunn. I am grateful for the work that he has done and I respect the integrity with which he has carried it out. I have been able to use his services since he has been with the Service. I was in Portugal at thetimehe was there and know that it was a sacrificial exercise on his part. For example, he had to pay his own expenses. He was supported, I think, by some organisations in respect of fares but he sacrificed his furlogh in the pursuit of a greater understanding of the work area in which he is employed. I cannot understand how in any way it is disadvantageous to this Parliament or the Legislative Research Service for a person to become more informed about a particular area in which we all have an interest. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.55 p.m.",109
