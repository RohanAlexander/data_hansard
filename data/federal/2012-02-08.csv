0,NA,Unknown,"Wednesday, 8 February 2012 The SPEAKER (Hon. Peter Slipper) took the chair at 09:00, made an acknowledgement of country and read prayers. NA Speaker's Procession The SPEAKER (09:01): I wish to advise the House of changes once each week to the existing Speaker's procession. Presently at the commencement of each sitting day the procession forms in the Speaker's walkway and enters the chamber from the rear door. This takes place in private areas of the building and is not accessible to the many visitors to our parliament. At the start of each sitting Tuesday, the procession will take a route that can be viewed from public areas of the building. At all other times, the occupant of the chair will enter and leave via doors at the rear of the chamber, as is the current practice. From next week the procession on Tuesdays will commence in the Members Hall and move through the glazed linkway entering the front of the chamber via the front doors. After announcing the Speaker as usual, the Serjeant-at-Arms will precede the Speaker into the chamber before placing the mace at the end of the table. The Speaker will take the chair via the government side of the table. Consistent with current practice, the procession will comprise the Speaker, preceded by the Serjeant-at-Arms carrying the mace, and the Speaker's attendant. Entry of the procession via the front doors is based on the current practice for formal occasions. The proposed arrangements are similar to arrangements in the Canadian, New Zealand and United Kingdom parliaments. I table this statement for the information of the House. NA Parliament The SPEAKER (09:02): Last night I made a statement about supplementary questions. I would like to clarify the point I made about supplementary questions asked by non-aligned members. My intention is to maintain proportionality and, under current arrangements, that would allow for one supplementary question each week for nonaligned members. Should the number of questions asked by non-aligned members change, I would seek to accommodate that change with regard to supplementary questions. NA Corporations and Financial Services Committee Membership The SPEAKER (09:03): I have received a message from the Senate informing the House that Senator Stephens has been discharged from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services and, in accordance with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001, Senator Sherry has been appointed a member of the committee. Public Accounts and Audit Committee Membership The SPEAKER (09:03): I have received a message from the Senate informing the House that Senator Sterle has been discharged from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. In accordance with the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951, Senator Sherry has been appointed a member of the committee. NA Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 9) Bill 2011 Report from Committee",19
1,Ms OWENS,BILLS," On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics, I present the committee's report entitled Advisory report on the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 9) Bill 2011, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",20
2,Ms OWENS,BILLS,"by leave-The Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 9) Bill 2011 is similar to other tax amendment bills in that it is a package of measures designed to finetune or improve the tax law. During the inquiry, some of the measures received express endorsement in submissions. For example, the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees and the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia supported the provisions on the electronic portability form. This will be a system whereby super fund members will be able to electronically request the consolidation of their super through the tax office. It will assist individuals who are reunited with their superannuation funds in consolidating the different amounts. Some measures did not receive comment from stakeholders but are beneficial to taxpayers and should be supported. For example, under current law, taxpayers can obtain a capital gains tax rollover for a capital gain or loss that arises from their interest in a company or trust because of the demerger of an entity from the group of which the company or trust is the head entity. However, this is not available where the head entity is a corporation sole or complying superannuation entity. Schedule 2(2) of the bill makes this rollover available for these types of bodies. The GST and hire purchase amendments remove a tax induced distortion between chattel mortgage and hire purchase. Under current law, chattel mortgage is more attractive because the GST input tax credits are upfront for small businesses that use cash accounting for GST, whereas they are only available on a payment basis under hire purchase. Small businesses now rarely use hire purchase for this reason, despite its other advantages over chattel mortgage. The bill also reduces compliance costs for small business by increasing the financial acquisitions threshold from $50,000 to $150,000. If a small business makes financial acquisitions below this amount, then it is outside the financial supply regime and can claim input tax credits for its financial supplies. Increasing this threshold takes more small businesses outside the financial supply regime and allows more businesses to claim input tax credits on their financial supplies. The amendments for GST and new residential premises will reverse the effect of the court case Gloxinia Investments, which found that, where a particular combination of strata titles and leases were involved, newly constructed residential premises were not subject to GST. The bill will reaffirm the policy intent that newly constructed homes should be subject to GST. They will also protect the revenue that funds government services that assist the whole community. The bill comprises measures that are important refinements to the tax system. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia was the only stakeholder to raise concerns about the bill. These applied to the provisions to enable businesses acquiring assets through hire purchase to obtain their GST input tax credits upfront and the provisions to reverse the effect of the recent court decision of Gloxinia Investments. The institute's concerns related to whether the provisions would implement the policy intent rather than the policy itself. Despite the institute's comments, there are several reasons why the provisions in the bill are the best available solution. For example, in relation to hire purchase, the Australian Taxation Office believes it has sufficient legislative basis for its interpretation and there have been no court actions disputing them. Further, in consultations in the review of GST and financial supply, stakeholders rejected the more fundamental reforms of the GST implied by the institute's submission. Finally, the equipment finance industry itself is 'delighted' with the proposal. In relation to GST for new residential premises, the institute has again suggested a wider reform than that supported in consultations. Treasury has noted that there is a risk of further court action in this area if the bill proceeds, but this is part of bedding down what is still a relatively new tax. After scrutinising Treasury and the institute, and noting the many positive measures in the bill, the committee is of the view that it should proceed unamended. I would like to thank the organisations that assisted the committee during the inquiry through submissions or participating in the hearing in Canberra. I also thank my colleagues on the committee for their contribution to the report. I commend the report to the House. NA Rearrangement",20
3,Mr DREYFUS,BUSINESS,"Isaacs-Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (09:09): I move: That notice No. 1, government business, be postponed until a later hour this day. Question agreed to. NA Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011 Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011 Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill 2011 Second Reading Cognate debate. Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",21
4,Ms BIRD,BILLS," I rise to support the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011 and the Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill 2011. The principle behind this legislation is universal service obligation. I will discuss how that sits within the current context of the rollout of the National Broadband Network and I will then come to the detail of the bills. The concept of universal service obligation has a long history-it goes back several hundred years, to some of the early postal services. Its history has been both market driven and, in more recent times, legislatively based. Obviously in the early days of new technology a particular provider in a market will be the only provider or one of only a few providers, and the history of the postal services is that some providers said that the defining characteristic of their operations was that for a single price they could deliver mail across a particular geographical area-across a country or across a state and so forth-for the same price. They were driving a market that was geographically wide, where there was no advantage from living in one of the population bases, in a big city-they were able to expand their market by providing services to people in more remote areas. Obviously as the communications technologies developed and changed through to telegraph and telephone and today to broadband, an increasing number of players in the field looked to use this sort of marketing advantage-the single price delivery model-to distinguish them from any competitors. It was a commonly accepted aspect of communications markets that there was a universal service capacitynot always an obligation. In more recent times, because concepts of access and equity have grown within communities, there has been more of a demand for this service not just as a marketing advantage for particular companies but as an obligation, as a right that citizens in a community or society could reasonably expect. This is particularly the case when, as our societies have become more complex, access to communications technologies has been a significant factor in people's ability to participate, whether that is participating in the politics of decision making of a nation or participating in work, study or community activities, or whether it is to participate by remaining connected to family and communities. Over time countries developed the view that it was not enough to leave it as a simple marketing advantage for a provider to be able to offer this service. With more competition and as new markets developed, people wanted greater confidence that they would not be left out. In a nation like ours, it is no surprise that this concept of universal obligation is very important. If you sit in some of the big cities where multiple competing providers are all trying to cherry-pick very lucrative markets and provide all sorts of options, it is difficult to understand how frustrating things can be for people not very far away. Indeed, this is the case even in an area like mine or in Wollongong, in the electorate of the member for Throsby, who spoke earlier in this debate. I have been a member of parliament for just over seven years. Some of the first cases I had when I came to this place were about payphones. They were about people's great frustration that payphones were being removed. The argument was raging that 'we don't need so many payphones anymore as people are walking around with mobile phones' but some people were saying, 'That's all very well if you can afford to have a mobile phone.' Quite a few campaigns were run. I have not had any in recent years, but the payphone service issue was very big. In recent years there has been constant contact to my office about access to decent broadband. My area is a beautiful, wonderful part of the world-and I encourage everybody to come and have a look-and we have a fabulous escarpment that runs down and meets the sea, but in parts there is a very narrow strip of land. If you have to rely on anything like wireless and even mobile phone technology it is very frustrating, especially as you get a lot of people with quite lucratively paying jobs in Sydney who think it would be really nice to live in Stanwell Park or Otford or such suburbs. Indeed, if you go to work the polling booths on election day, you find half of my colleagues on the other side have holiday houses in some of those northern suburbs, so I run into them at polling booths. The member for Bradfield would know I have met a few of his friends in the local government election campaigns at polling booths in those suburbs. So it is a beautiful part of the world and a lot of people aspire to live there, and I understand why they would, but they then discover they cannot get mobile phone reception or decent broadband and it will cost them a fortune if they are to be put on wireless, which drops out all the time. In these more modern times access to good broadband service is a really significant issue for people. What we are therefore challenged with is this: how do we best ensure access to developing and new technologies, particularly communications technologies, so that they are made available as best we possibly can? In Australia we started to address that more formally in 1991, when we had the Telecommunications Act introduced, an act to give the right of access to voice telephone services, which became the universal service obligation. Of course, it has been amended and adjusted over time to recognise the new issues as they have arisen but it is based on the very fundamental concept, which I think is a very strong one in Australia, that it should not matter where you live or what your income is or what your educational circumstances are as there are some fundamental communication access rights that we should ensure people have. A lot of that is driven by the fact that we know that families, communities and societies across this nation, particularly in our rural and regional areas, rely very heavily on their right to participate. Their responsibility to contribute to us as a nation relies on that access and availability. These three bills sit directly within that tradition and they are addressing the newest development, that being the newest area of communications infrastructure technology, the rollout of the National Broadband Network, and how universal service obligations will sit within that new framework. The three related bills will deliver the reform required to support the structural separation of Telstra by putting in place the necessary reforms of the universal service obligations, so it is about moving from a directly regulated model that identifies a provider. We have gradually moved to more competition within that, recognising the diversity in the market. This sets up the new structure to operate under an infrastructure based company like the National Broadband Network Co. with competing providers accessing that infrastructure. So it sets up a long-term framework for delivering those three existing services that I have covered: the universal service obligation, which is about reasonable access to basic telephone services and to payphones; the important development of the National Relay Service, which was put in place for those with speech and hearing impediments; and, importantly, the emergency call services, those being the arrangements for handling calls to 000. They are the existing three which have to be dealt with in the new framework, but it also provides for two new sets of arrangements. Firstly, it is to assist in the migration of voice-only customers from the Telstra copper network to the NBN fibre network. I make the point that was touched on yesterday by my colleague the member for Throsby, who worked in a union that had a lot of coverage in this area, that we should not forget that the copper network is not a Rolls-Royce version out there in the communities anyway. Anyway, one of the other issues that I constantly deal with in my area, where we get quite a bit of water, is the ongoing one of a very poorly maintained ageing copper network, so this is about and making sure that, as people migrate to the fibre network, if they only want a voice based service they are able to get that. Secondly, it is to assist in the development of any necessary technology solutions to support the continued provision of existing public interest services that are provided on that copper network-things like traffic lights or public alarm systems that are working off the current network. The reforms do this by establishing TUSMA, the new agency which will have responsibility for the provision of the USO and other services. They will do this now through a competitive contractual and grant arrangement as to third parties in the same way that we have now got the National Relay Service operating. So that is a change in the way that we are delivering it to recognise the multitude of providers that will be riding on the back of this fibre-in-the ground infrastructure. The TUSMA Bill will therefore provide for the establishment of TUSMA as the statutory agency. It will have responsibility for the effective implementation and administration of the service agreements that deliver universal service and other public telecommunications outcomes. The bill sets out TUSMA's corporate governance structure and its reporting and accountability requirements. It provides for the minister, subject to the scrutiny of the parliament, to set standards, rules and benchmarks for TUSMA's contracts and grants and it sets out measures for collecting an industry levy to contribute to TUSMA's costs. It is the government's intention to phase out the current USO regime by transitioning from the regulatory model to a more open competitive and contractual model. The reform bill therefore allows, after an initial transition period of approximately two years, for the direct USO regulation to potentially be lifted from Telstra. However, this can only occur if the minister is satisfied that there are satisfactory contractual arrangements in place. The minister will also be able to determine standards, rules and minimum performance benchmarks for TUSMA contracts or grants. These will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny by way of disallowance. Before removing the USO regulation, the government intends to make contract conditions that mirror the existing legislative standards, rules and benchmarks currently covered by USO regulatory instruments. Additionally, the existing regulated customer service guarantee-the CSG-that applies to all providers of standard telephone service will continue to apply to telephone services provided by Telstra under the TUSMA contract. The existing rules for the emergency call services remain and the ACMA will continue to regulate the emergency call service provider. These three bills combine to put this framework in place. The government will contribute base funding of at least $50 million per annum for each of the first two financial years of TUSMA's operation-that is, 2012-13 and 2013-14-and $100 million policy per annum after that. The bills also identify the stakeholder consultation and review processes. The TUSMA is able to establish advisory committees as it sees the necessity and the government will undertake a comprehensive statutory review of the universal service arrangements before 1 January 2018. The passage of these bills is important to give effect to the reforms of the universal service obligations that were announced in June 2010 when Telstra entered into the financial heads of agreement with NBN Co. that commenced the structural separation as well as the transfer of customers over to the NBN Co. fibre network. In her contribution yesterday the member for Forrest outlined her frustration at not being able to get fibre based NBN Co. services into her area as quickly as her community would like. It reflects the fact that those on the other side are very much tied to a position that many of them are not happy with, because the NBN Co. is about universal delivery of infrastructure so that people can access service providers much more effectively than they currently do. The universal service obligation is an important component of that. These bills deserve supporting also because they reflect, regardless of the NBN rollout, a more up-todate and modern application of that hundreds-of-years-old concept of universal service provision of communications technology.",21
5,Mr FLETCHER,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011 and related bills. Universal service obligation has been a quagmire of confused policy for 20 years. In my former life as a senior executive of Optus, I spoke about the issue so often that people in Canberra would joke that USO stands for 'Usual Submission from Optus'. Now I bring a different perspective to bear a legislator concerned about achieving the most efficient and lowest cost arrangements to deliver broadband and telecommunication services to as many people as possible. With that perspective, I make three points: firstly, the current USO arrangements are not well understood and are seriously flawed; secondly, the new arrangements set out in this bill are an expensive sham which do not advance the position at all and waste a lot money; and, thirdly, there would be better ways forward which this government could have proposed if it was serious about reform. I turn firstly to the argument that the current arrangements are not well understood and are seriously flawed. The universal service obligation in its present form was introduced in the early 1990s in advance of Telstra being exposed to competition. The unions were very concerned at the time that Telstra would lose profitable customers to new entrants and would be left serving customers in less profitable areas. Therefore, the current structure of the universal service obligation was introduced, requiring Telstra's competitors to cross-subsidise it for lossmaking services, particularly in nonmetropolitan Australia. It was specifically designed to be a way to try to mitigate the effect of competition on the incumbent monopolist. In fact, the fear the unions held never really materialised because Telstra made ruthless use of its vertical integration and incumbent advantages. Even so, the USO was baked into the legislative arrangements and a cabal of cardigan wearers in the Australian Communications Authority, later the Australian Communications and Media Authority, set about the ponderous and regular task of assessing Telstra's so-called net universal service cost-that is, the amount it purportedly loses in providing as universal service-and then allocating that cost across industry participants. The cost modelling used by the Australian Communications and Media Authority is intensely controversial. It does not take account of the advantages which Telstra enjoys as the result of being the universal service provider and as the result of being the incumbent, including its economies of scale and scope and, of course, the brand of benefits which come from being seen as the ubiquitous provider of telecommunication services. The government asserts that the report it obtained last year from its consultants, Castalia, gives what has previously been lacking in this debate: an objective estimate of the cost to Telstra of the universal service obligation. I am sorry to say that the report does no such thing. It is riddled with blank spots where key data has been withheld on the grounds that it is commercial-inconfidence. There has been little opportunity for third parties to test the data and assumptions in that report and the report fails to take account of the benefits, which I have already mentioned, which Telstra receives from being the ubiquitous operator. These benefits have been recognised by telecommunications regulators in many other countries. Telstra's obligations under the universal service obligation are quite narrowly and specifically defined. It is required to provide the so-called 'standard telephone service'that is, a voice telephony service. As we have heard, the USO also covers pay phones-and there are some other elements such as the National Relay Service-but I want to confine my comments to the question of services received by individual premises. Telstra, under the current arrangements, is required to provide this service for a standard connection charge, which is set under the price cap regulations. In addition, the ongoing price it charges for providing this service-that is, monthly line rental and other cost components-must not exceed the amount set under the price cap regulations. The true economic cost which Telstra incurs is the capital cost of building a connection to a customer, typically in remote or rural Australia, which it might choose not to serve if it did not have a regulatory obligation to do so. That cost can sometimes be very substantial. But once the connection is built, the incremental cost of providing the service is very low indeed, consistent with the normal principles of telecommunications economics. It is very hard to see the economic logic for calculating the ongoing loss incurred in providing the service and making this the basis for a cross-subsidy. I want to now turn to the argument that the arrangements set out in this bill are an expensive sham which do not advance the position and which waste a lot of money. According to the explanatory memorandum: ... it is appropriate that the model for delivering universal service and other public policy telecommunications outcomes be reformed to facilitate the competitive supply of universal service and other public policy telecommunications outcomesparticularly in the context of the National Broadband Network. Unfortunately, the particular reform model proposed is deeply flawed for several reasons. Firstly, these reforms purport to introduce competition so that rather than Telstra automatically being the universal service provider: ... the government will contract with service providers for the supply of these important services. In fact, this whole arrangement is a sham. The government has already concluded a contract with Telstra-a contract which lasts for 20 years. Far from being a competitive process, as is claimed, the government is simply dressing up an existing contract-a contract which was struck as part of a cosy deal negotiated in secret. Such an approach is all too common from this governmentfor example, its deal with the big miners in the context of the mining tax. Secondly, the real purpose of these amendments is to hand another bucket of taxpayers' money to Telstra as part of getting it to cooperate with the NBN. Labor desperately need that cooperation, because if Telstra were instead to compete with the National Broadband Network, the already fragile business case for the NBN would be in complete disarray. The new USO bill therefore sweetens the arrangements that Telstra receives to the tune of a net present value of $700 million, according to Telstra's own estimate. What is it that taxpayers are getting in exchange and what is it that Telstra is going to have to do differently? To start with, you need to understand that in delivering the universal service obligation today Telstra receives around $55 million a year from its competitors. Under the new 20-year contract with Telstra signed by Minister Conroy, Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, it will receive $290 million to deliver the universal service obligation and handle emergency services calls. After a couple of transitional years, government will be tipping $100 million of taxpayers' money into the pot every year. The shortfall, $190 million a year, will be divided up amongst the industry based on market shares-the same mechanism used in today's deeply flawed USO arrangements. It is true therefore that the amount Telstra pays into the industry pot will increase but that will be greatly outweighed by the much larger amount it now receives. Telstra's net position will therefore improve sharply. On my estimation, it will get over $100 million a year more to do exactly the same things it does today. This is a terrible deal for taxpayers. We will get not one jot more than we get today-namely, a commitment to provide a standard voice service, not a broadband service, to any Australian who wants it at prices as set out in the price cap rules. Thirdly, far from advancing the position in terms of the service the consumer will receive, it actually goes backwards. Today, there is very little risk or uncertainty in receiving the standard telephone servicethe basic voice service-over your existing copper wiring. Tomorrow, as is clear from the explanatory memorandum, there will be significant risks when the copper is turned off and the standard telephone service must be delivered over the NBN fibre to the customer's home. This is why the bill makes provision for $15 million a year for voice only migration, which we are told will fund 'migration assistance and basic rewiring tasks'. Around one-third of homes take a voice only service on the copper network. Extraordinarily, this vastly expensive new National Broadband Network will in fact increase the risks for customers who only want a voice telephone service and, even more extraordinary, the government is the proposing to spend even more taxpayers' money to mitigate a risk that its own policy has created. Fourthly, this government could not resist creating yet another bureaucratic entity, the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency, TUSMA, with a CEO and commissioners, and the capacity to employ staff and retain consultants. Is there any suggestion in the bill that corresponding savings will be obtained from the Australian Communications and Media Authority? What a surprise: under this profligate and irresponsible government there is no suggestion that offsetting savings will be obtained. Fifthly, these arrangements are part of a grubby and anticompetitive deal in which Telstra is being paid off with billions of dollars of taxpayers' money, and a substantial component of the pay-off, as we have seen, is that Telstra is being relieved of its current USO expenditures. Very concerningly, these arrangement are not competitively neutral but deliver a huge free kick to Telstra compared to its competitors. While it is true that Telstra faces an increase in its own USO levy contribution, almost the entire funding flows back to Telstra and it then gets the government money on top. By contrast, the rest of the industry faces a significant increase in USO contributions after 2014. Telstra has had the benefit of behind closed doors negotiations with the government about this deal. No other industry players have had that opportunity. This is far from meeting the standard of an open, transparent and competitive process. The third thing I want to mention is that there would be materially better ways of approaching this issue if the government were serious about reforming the universal service obligation arrangements rather than simply using this as a sham and a device to shovel more taxpayers' money to Telstra-and get absolutely nothing in return. I do not have a concluded view as to which would be the best approach, but it seems to me there are at least a couple of possibilities. One would be to simply leave the present arrangements in place and leave Telstra as the universal service provider. In practical terms, it will remain by far the dominant provider for much of the next decade. At the present rate, the vast majority of Australians will be connected to Telstra's copper network for many years to come. Even if the NBN ever gets built out to large parts of the country, Telstra is likely to remain the dominant retail provider. The key reason for the changes in the package of legislation before the House today is a means of shovelling more taxpayers' money to Telstra. Why therefore do we need to have this elaborate and farcical structure of purported contractingout arrangements-arrangements which will not come into force for 20 years at least? One of the significant benefits of this approach would be to avoid a cumbersome and expensive new bureaucracy and also avoid a further anticompetitive increase in the burden on Telstra's competitors. Another approach which might be takenand I do not necessarily advocate this but raise it to make the point that there are possibilities-would be to divide the USO into two components. The first would be the obligation to provide the physical connection, which would be borne by NBN Co. Given that NBN Co. is incurring massive expenditure to connect homes around Australia this would not be an increased impost. The second would be the obligation to provide a retail service to a person who has a physical connection. That obligation could logically fall on whichever retail provider has the largest market share in a particular geography. It is difficult for us to do much from opposition to improve the world, but we have put forward two amendments which are sensible. Nobody should take the view that on this side of the House we regard this legislation as effective pro-competitive reform or sensible management. It is not; it is a sham which does not improve the universal service obligation arrangements.",25
6,Mr ADAMS,BILLS," I am pleased to see these telecommunications bills before the House. I was interested to hear the last speaker. He comes from a company that was in competition with Telstra and of course we heard a continual attack on Telstra and on telecommunications regulations. For the lifetime of the Howard government there were opportunities to modernise the telecommunications of this country. They had control of the Senate and they could have passed legislation, and they chose not to do so. They made all sorts of commentary about that and spent a lot of money saying that they were improving things but they did not do that. Students in my electorate are begging me to get the old copper networks improved because of the dropouts they have using dialup when trying to do homework and trying to move forward with their studies. All around my electorate that is continuing to other some degree, but I am very pleased to say that since this government came in in 2007 it has worked to put together the National Broadband Network to modernise Australia, to take us into the new era, to position Australia where it should be with modern telecommunications and to receive all the new opportunities that the NBN will provide. This set of bills will provide some of those reforms, especially the universal service obligation, as well as providing for the legislative framework to create a new statutory agency, to be known as TUSMA. These bills will set up the long-term structure for three existing services and for two new sets of arrangements, and will ensure the important telecommunications safeguards in the change to the National Broadband Network. The first of the bills, Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011, will enable the establishment of the agency responsible for the implementation and administration of service agreements. It will outline the structure, reporting and accountability requirements, and will set out ways to collect industry levies to contribute to the costs of the new structure. The second bill, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011, or the reform bill, will introduce the structure that will enable the minister to gradually lift mandatory obligations from Telstra. The third bill, the Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill 2011, will create a levy that will require related industry participants to help with the costs of the new structure. The levy will replace current USO and NRS levies, and will commence in July 2012. The amount given towards the levy will be based on its eligible revenue. To make a smooth transition to the new levy arrangements, all non-Telstra contributors will not pay more than the combined liability for the USO and NRS levies for 2011-12, and the relevant procedures are in place to ensure this outcome is achieved. The bills will create new arrangements for existing services such as the universal service obligation to provide reasonable access to telephone services and payphones-very important; the National Relay Service for those with a speech or hearing impediment; and emergency call services, including plans for handling calls to the 000 network around our country. Telstra has a legislative responsibility for the universal service obligation and the emergency call service, while two other parties provide the National Relay Service. The Telecommunications Universal Service the Management Agency Bill 2011 puts in place new arrangements to help the transfer of voice-only customers from Telstra copper to the National Broadband Network and aids in the development of any essential technology solutions that will maintain the continued provision of existing public interest services such as traffic lights and public alarms. This agreement with Telstra will provide for people in Australia who are outside the National Broadband Network fibre areas to continue to have access to voice-only services if they wish and ensures that Telstra will maintain their copper network for this use for the next 20 years. With the rollout of the National Broadband Network continuing across Australia, these bills will ensure that those who are not covered by the National Broadband Network fibre network will still have access to their services. The National Broadband Network will cover around 93 per cent of Australia's premises. With the introduction and passing of these bills, we can ensure that rural and regional Australia and those who are vision or hearing impaired are not left without relay phone services. Local governments are working with NBN Co., advising of potential local requirements and helping in the development and distribution of community education about and promotion of the great opportunities that the National Broadband Network offers our communities, especially in rural and regional Australia. To make things easier, the process of connecting to the National Broadband Network is much the same as the process of connecting a phone. The customer contacts an approved service provider as listed on the NBN Co. website, discusses with the service provider the service that best suits their needs and reviews the pricing plans. Once the customer has made an agreement with the service provider, and products or services are organised, the service provider will activate the service at the property and the property is then connected to that service. The internet has changed the way Australians live and offers us the ability to get information instantly, with the click of button. With the technology for this industry quickly changing and advancing, the National Broadband Network will provide Australians with fast and reliable access to the internet. Communities can use the National Broadband Network to help with health concerns, energy management and farm management. In my electorate, mobile phones are used to move pivot irrigators around and, when the spuds arrive at the processing plant, people can be told what condition they are in and whether it is too early or too late to take them out of the ground. If people in regional areas are connected to the National Broadband Network, a doorway opens enabling them to have instant access to health professionals via videoconferencing, meaning that they can get advice as quickly as they need it. Schools in regional communities also benefit. In Lyons, many regional schools can now offer vocational education and training. This eliminates the need to travel for long periods and enables students to become skilled workers for our state with ease. Training and educating Tasmania's youth will be key for the economy and growth in Tasmania. The NBN will enable students to stay in school longer and then go on to university education, TAFE education or apprenticeships. Students can attend TAFE online, as well as most universities in Australia and some overseas. TAFE courses can be completed by correspondence alone, while university courses can be completed by correspondence with exams at the end of each section. This means that more people in Australia than ever before have the opportunity to study. The National Broadband Network will make it easier and easier, especially for regional and rural Australia. When the industry advances, it creates a a ripple effect on other aspects of our lives, including telephone use. In Australia, there is movement towards the smart phone. Whether you have an iPhone, a BlackBerry or a Google powered communications device, you are part of a large proportion of Australia's population who use a smart phone. Australians take up new technology at a very rapid rate. I think we are one of the leaders in the world in grabbing new technology. In regional areas of Australia, mobile services often have low coverage and sometimes none at all. People with disabilities and vision or hearing impaired and older Australians have difficulties using the new smart phones. Before you can make a phone call, you need to read the manual or have someone who knows how to teach you. Most of my electorate of Lyons is regional or rural, and people rely on their phone services for their everyday dealings. I believe that telephones play a large role in the social lives of many in my electorate. In these small communities, the closest neighbour could be five or 10 kilometres down the road and therefore the phone is used as the main means of contact. It is important that people in these communities are able to reach each other. I am sure everyone is aware that social events in small communities keep people happy and healthy, and we need to ensure that we do our part to keep these communications happening. Without these crucial services, people would be much more isolated. We have the opportunity, in using new technology, to gain quicker access to health, education and university services. New technology gives Australians the option of a different lifestyle and enables people to move out of the cities into small communities. New technology is making regional communities more viable. With the lifestyle in regional communities becoming a viable option for Australians, the populations of these communities will grow. There are many benefits of living in regional communities in Australia. Regional communities are reasonably self-sufficient in growing their vegetables and rearing their animals. Producing and selling things becomes easier if you have access to the internet. Farms provide the opportunity for families to teach their children how to run and manage the farm, and this sustainable and important industry in Tasmania is thriving. We have some great products that come from farms and regional communities in Tasmania, and these bills will ensure the continuity of services that help these communities. In Lyons we have dairy farms that sell their milk and cheese and we have many vineyards with cellar-door sales and, I must confess, many goat's cheese outlets. We also have cherry farms where you can go and pick your own fruit. These farms create jobs within the local area and provide skills to their workers in the area, ensuring that the skill and work is carried through the generations. Not only do these businesses bring income back to the states through taxes but they encourage people to travel to Tasmania to see the highlights, and those tourists will spend money on accommodation and travel throughout the state. In conclusion, I believe that these bills are very important to the general rollout of these new services, in that they set up the long term structure for three existing services and for two new sets of arrangements and will ensure the link of important communications safeguards in the change to the National Broadband Network. This will allow Australians to access the benefits of fast broadband at school, work and play. I support the bills. Debate adjourned. NA Standing and Sessional Orders",28

I welcome the opportunity to move these changes. After the 2010 election the government worked in a consultative way with the opposition and with the crossbenchers to achieve parliamentary to reform. The member for Lyne was, of course, a very significant contributor to that to 3 debate. The member for Lyne, the Manager of Opposition Business and I, as the Leader of the House, spent many hours together, assisted by speakers, former speakers and people who consider themselves experts in parliamentary procedure, to work through a series of changes that resulted in some in fundamental reform in the way that the House of Representatives operates. These included, for example, a proper recognition of the role of private members in this chamber. Indeed, last year we had 52 votes on motions before the chamber; we had none in 2005, as a comparison. That has facilitated additional time and discussion before the parliament. The other thing that we did was change the standing orders to provide some timeliness for questions and answers. At the time. I moved that proposition I foreshadowed the potential for further changes. It is important that the parliament constantly review and finetune the way that TO we operate as a House. Mr Speaker, upon your unanimous elevation to the high office that you hold, you have given consideration to the way that the parliament functions. I must say that I think your speakership has gotten off to an extremely positive start, and I congratulate you on that. You have shown yourself Federation already to be fair, balanced and truly independent. I say that as someone who, up to this point, has yet to get a point of order up with you, but I am sure I will be more successful in the future than I was yesterday! As part of the ongoing efforts to make parliament more accessible to the publicand I must pay tribute to former Speaker Jenkins, who was very concerned also about the functioning of parliament in question time-some flagging of changes has been made. As the Speaker you have already announced changes to the way that supplementary questions work, and I welcome those. You have indicated that you would facilitate the potential for up to two supplementary questions from members of the opposition, up to two supplementary questions from members of the government and a proportionate position with regard to the crossbenchers-the potential for them, reflecting the number of positions they hold in the chamber, to ask a supplementary question. I suspect that supplementary questions will not be taken up every day, but we will see how it works in practice; that is what we always have to do. The amendments to standing orders that I have moved today arise from discussions held between you and me, as Leader of the House, and also separate discussions between you, the Manager of Opposition Business, me, the crossbenchers and everyone in between. I think there is broad agreement, although not consensus, with these propositions, which will allow for questions to be limited to 30 seconds and answers to be limited to three minutes; question time will conclude around 3.10 pm or after questions have been exhausted. The government is committed to ensuring that question time does portray a transparent view of the workings of the parliament. Indeed, the government has been critical of the fact that question time has been interrupted by so many suspensions of standing orders that have concluded question time during this 43rd Parliament. Nonetheless, I believe the parliament functions extremely effectively. The fact we have had 257 pieces of legislation carried by the 43rd Parliament is an indication of that. The amendments before the chair also seek to rename the Main Committee as the Federation Chamber of the House of Representatives, from 27 February 2012. This is a reform which you have advocated, Mr Speaker, and which was recommended in a Standing Committee on Procedure report in June 2004-some eight years ago. So there has been a process of consideration of these issues, and for eight years the parliament has been thinking about it. Today we move a step forward to implement those recommendations which were made. This recognises the importance of the House's second chamber. The government has certainly given the Main Committee the respect it deserves. In 2011 the Main Committee sat for an average of 21 hours a week and debated 75 bills that had been referred to it by the House. In 2005 it sat for less than 10 hours a week and debated only 27 bills. It is pretty clear that there is some confusion, even among members of parliament occasionally, arising from the fact that the Main Committee does not meet in the room that is known as the main committee room. There is also confusion from time to time about the status of the Main Committee. It has been suggested to me, for example, when debating the referral of a bill to the Main Committee, that such a referral somehow gives the bill less status because the Main Committee is not seen as the equal chamber that it is. It is simply this chamber meeting in another place at the same time so as to improve the efficiency of the parliament. With regard to these changes, there are a range of motions that will be required as that well. They have been worked through with the clerks in order to facilitate those changes. They are part of the changes in the motion that I have moved today. There has been some suggestion that the 30-second time limit could be restrictive for particular members. I am sympathetic to that. With regard to the member for Kennedy, who is in the chamber, I say on behalf of the government-not on behalf of the opposition, as it is the government's position-that I as Leader of the House will not be interrupting the member for Kennedy to draw attention to the time of 30 seconds. That is because one of the great things about this chamber is that it is made up of characters who bring to the chamber different personalities and different ways of operating. The member for Kennedy is a person who has my utmost respect, particularly for the diligent way in which he goes about representing his electorate. I have had the privilege of visiting that great electorate of Kennedy, which is very different from the electorate of Grayndler, on many an occasion. I know that the member for Kennedy has put forward an objection to the change, which he sees as too restrictive. All I can say is that common sense often applies in the way that rules are implemented, and I see no problem with a bit of common sense being applied to the practical operation of the chamber. With that, I thank all those who have worked so cooperatively to achieve this further reform. I indicate that, whatever differences I have with the Manager of Opposition Business and others, we will continue to examine these issues and see how they operate in practice. We would not want to see, for example, fewer questions being asked in the parliament. That is certainly not the government's intention. Indeed, the government has the opposite view: the government is critical of the fact that there have been fewer questions asked because of the suspensions of question time. The government will continue to take the view that when a suspension of question time is moved it is an indication that there are no further questions requested of the government by those opposite. We have had that view consistently and we will continue to have that view about the importance of question time. I commend the motion relating to the amendments to standing orders that I have moved today.",31
8,The SPEAKER,PROPOSED RESOLUTION,"Before calling the Manager of Opposition Business, I would like to say that I am sure that the occupant of the chair would be benevolent in the direction of the honourable member for Kennedy in the event that more than the allotted number of seconds were needed in a particular case.  Opposition Business) (10:06): I will not delay the House at great length as there is agreement between the government and the opposition on this matter. I note that the Leader of the House seemed to spend a great deal of time talking about a lot of subjects that are not matters before the House today. I will not do that. What is before the House is the changes to standing orders with respect to the changing of the name of the Main Committee to the Federation Chamber, which the opposition supports. I have always believed that Main Committee was a poor name for the second chamber. In fact, when I other was the chairman of the Procedure Committee I recommended that the name be changed from Main Committee to Second Chamber. But we are comfortable with Federation Chamber, because obviously Main Committee is a confusing name for everyone concerned. Also, I think it detracts from the importance of that chamber and the role it plays. So we support that change. Another one of the changes we are making to the standing orders today-which will apply from today, I understand-is a change in the time limits for questions and answers. I believe that question time can sometimes become tedious and bogged down, particularly with respect to the answers given by the government to the dorothy dixers they ask themselves. I think reducing the time limit from four minutes to three minutes will mean that the clock ticks over faster. It is more efficient for question time. I think we will get more information as a consequence of this change to the time limits. In fact, three minutes was the time limit we suggested in the negotiations for a better parliament with the crossbenchers and the government. It now seems like only yesterday but it was in fact 15 months ago.",36
9,Mr Albanese,PROPOSED RESOLUTION,And we're still here!  will see how long Julia is still there too few weeks time.,37
10,The SPEAKER,PROPOSED RESOLUTION,"I think that is unnecessary, I will point that out to the Manager of Opposition Business.  Mr Speaker.",37
11,The SPEAKER,PROPOSED RESOLUTION,"We should focus on the motion before the chair.  so in a perfectly reasonable way until I was rudely interrupted by the Leader of the House-again, dare I say it. So the opposition obviously do support a three-minute time limit for the answers in question time. Obviously there has to be a bit of give and take in a hung parliament. The government would not have agreed to reducing the time limit if the opposition were not prepared to agree to a reduction in our questions. I would point out that the vast majority of questions we have asked in this parliament have been 30 seconds or less. We very rarely ask a question that goes for longer than 30 seconds. I think a short, factual question is the better question. supported that view since I was elected in 1993. Therefore, the opposition have no difficulties at all with having a shorter time limit for questions. I would say, on a slightly discordant note, that if there is one rule for the opposition there should be one rule for everyone in the chamber. I understand that the member for Kennedy has made a name for himself by asking longer questions. I think there should be tolerance where tolerance is justified, but I do not think that means a green light for everybody who is not in the opposition to ask a question that goes for longer than 30 seconds. For example, while we will not object to the member for Kennedy perhaps asking a longer question, we do expect that in a the Speaker, who upholds the standing orders, will intervene if the other members of the crossbenches think that is a green light for them to ask longer questions. We certainly will take objection to that. Regarding other matters that are not before the chamber today and that you already flagged in a statement to the House last night-which you added to this morning-the opposition does welcome more supplementary questions being asked by all sides of the parliament. I believe very much in the need for spontaneity in question time. I think one of the criticisms of question time has been the slightly structured system that we have developed over the last 110 years. Dorothy dixers are a very good example of the paucity of real ideas on the government side and of real questioning of ministers. We believe spontaneity would be a welcome introduction to question time, for the government particularly. I will also say that when you are considering other changes to the standing orders down the track, Mr Speaker, I also pithy, would welcome interventions in this I have chamber, which are allowed in the Main Committee. Thus, a member would be able-with the permission of the Speakerto interrupt a person who is delivering a presentation in this place, except in the case of ministers' second reading speeches. I think that would also lead to more spontaneity in this place. I am sure those are matters you will also consider over the course of the next period in which you are Speaker in the House. The opposition support these changes to the standing orders. We understand that this is a trial for the supplementaries over this session. We will see how that works, but I can only imagine that these changes will improve question time. The only other thing I would add is that the time for ending question time has apparently been changed from 3.30 pm to 3.10 pm; I think I am right in saying that. That takes into account the shorter time for answers to questions and the shorter time for questions. If that proves to truncate the opposition's or even the government's ability to ask 20 questions in the total period of question time, the Leader of the House and I, who have discussed this matter, will revisit it. But I see no reason would be the case, as long as there are not constant interruptions. The other point I would make is that what we saw yesterday, with the indulgences granted at the beginning of question timefor good reasons, those being the death of Sir Zelman Cowen, the Queen's diamond jubilee and the death of Peter Veness-are not usual occurrences. But, given that question time has been reduced so that it finishes at 3.10 pm, the opposition would take objection if they were to become usual occurrences. Obviously on the first day back after an eightor nine-week break there are matters that need to be dealt with. That is the process of this parliament. But we do not want to see a habit develop whereby the government uses the generosity that is sometimes too easily given to it to avoid scrutiny in question time. We will obviously be taking up objection with you, as the Speaker, if that does become a pattern-if the government decides to use that as a tool in order to deny the opposition its share of questions. The SPEAKER (10:13): I thank the Manager of Opposition Business. Before calling the member for Lyne, I would like to say that I hope the Manager of Opposition Business was not reflecting on the impartiality of the chair with respect to time limits or with respect to benevolence that may or may not be given in relation to questions. I am sure he was not doing that. The chair intends to be firm, fair and impartial. I thank the Leader of the House and the Manager for Opposition Business for the cooperative way in which they have been prepared to entertain my proposals with respect to the reduction in time for asking questions and answering questions and also changing the name of the Main Committee to the Federation Chamber of the House of Representative. I do, with respect to further reform, intend to convene a meeting with the that chair and deputy chair of the Procedure Committee to go through where we are and to look at what members would like to see occur.",37
12,Mr OAKESHOTT,PROPOSED RESOLUTION," I start by saying that I do not speak on behalf of all the crossbenchers. There has been a wide range of views expressed over the past 24 hours in these negotiations. From my point of view, as someone who participated quite actively in the parliamentary reform process at the start of the 43rd Parliament, I welcome this trial and appreciate the ongoing focus and the ongoing bipartisan work in trying to reach for best practice in parliamentary standards and cultural improvement. There may be a way to go for all 150 members of parliament and for us as a collective but I welcome the major parties, along with you, Mr Speaker, the new Speaker, the Procedure Committee and others continuing to reflect and to reach consensus where possible on how to improve standards in this chamber. In regard to the specific issues I think there are no problems at all in changing the name of the Main Committee to the Federation Chamber. Hopefully that does give it more symbolic status so that speeches made in that chamber by members, private members in particular, have a better chance of being heard by their constituents and of being heard in the public policy debate. The issues around question time become more interesting. I have been an advocate for some time of a submission made by the late Independent Peter Andren with regard to trying to make question time more spontaneous. Before he passed away, his recommendation was to limit each question to 30 seconds and each answer to two minutes. At the start of this parliament that was negotiated to 45 seconds and four minutes. I am pleased to see, after some reflection on the first year of some changes in that area, that we now are getting closer the model of the late Peter Andren, with the limits set at 30 seconds and two minutes. Hopefully the length of answers given by ministers is open to further consideration. Ultimately, though, the test of question time comes down to a couple of things. For all the policy, personality and political debates that make question time the hour that is watched by so many and that is so colourful, ultimately its test of worth is whether it is a test of the policy agenda of the executive and the government of the day. It is worthless if it is not. I urge you, Mr Speaker, to have a firm hand and to make sure, through all that colour and noise, the personalities and the politics, that ultimately the worth of question time is upheld. That is the test of the policy agenda of the day. I hope that firm hand from the chair allows that to ultimately happen. The issue of supplementary questions is an interesting one and, whilst it is not one that requires changes to the standing orders, it can happen from the chair. It is one to watch. I would hope some of the conversations had with regard to the crossbenchers' position on that, wanting to be able to add a supplementary to questions where needed and if required, regardless of quotas, will be viewed favourably by you, Mr Speaker. I think we enter difficult territory if supplementaries do become quota based: the government get two, the opposition get two and the crossbenchers have to haggle for whatever. If the role of a supplementary question is to make question time spontaneous, keep people thinking on their feet and keep the executive on their toes then I think there is a role less for quotas and more for substance in the follow-up to questions asked. The other issue that I did want to raise, to which is alongside these reforms being introduced today, is a matter raised by my colleague from Western Australia Mal Washer, who is well regarded by all. He has in the past year raised the issue of the sitting hours and some of the changes in the roster. I would hope, in this mood of consensus and reflection on some of the changes that happened 18 months ago, that there is some consideration given to delaying divisions and votes on a Monday until a later time, say, five o'clock, so that members who have to travel a long way and members who do have families can make arrangements to travel on a Monday morning rather than on a Sunday. I think that would assist many members in this chamber. It would not change the ability to call for particular votes or to deal with private members' business or other issues on a Monday. I think it will pick up on some of the issues that have been raised by Mal Washer and others about the health of members of parliament and the work-life balance considerations. In conclusion, I welcome the trial. I wish it well. On reflection, I think the majority reforms reached in a bipartisan way 18 months ago are holding up and bedding down. I hope that is starting to make some of those changes sustainable for the long term. I think one to watch this year is the relationship between ministers committees. I hope all committee chairs and committees generally do act fearlessly in making sure that committees keep ministers and the executive officers honest. On several fronts, we are now approaching a six-month wait for ministers to respond to several recommendations that have come from committees. This is the test of whether the committee structure has strength or not. I hope in 2012 that it does. I hope the committee chairs generally do fulfil their part of the reform process and make sure they keep the ministers and the executive as honest as possible. The only complaint I have heard this year is that we are busier than ever as MPs. I think that is a compliment to the reforms and it is what the Australian community expects. If that is the only complaint, we are doing our job.",38
13,Mr JENKINS,PROPOSED RESOLUTION," I will not delay the House greatly on this motion. I support it. I am pleased that there has been agreement in a very mature fashion about the length of time for questions and answers. I hope that that picks up the pace and sets the basis for a degree of spontaneity that is lacking at present. I have been troubled by the House not coming to grips with the question of supplementary questions. It is ironic that there should have been for the whole time that I have been in this chamber a standing order on this while every member of the House has been running around trying to work out how to operate that standing order. I applaud your success, Mr Speaker, in of getting a modicum of agreement so far. I think that you will use that agreement wisely to expand on the question of supplementaries. But perhaps it is now time for us to look at other models. Clearly, when people talk and about this being a parliament that has adapted the Westminster tradition, often the Westminster tradition has not been studied as well as it should have been. In regard to question time, the fact is that we have exemplified in Westminster true supplementaries, where-as learned colleagues like you, Mr Speaker, know-it is a bit like a grilling in court, with continued supplementary questions on the topic. In fact, it works so successfully that they continue until exhausted and then they move on to the next topic. But we have never had that maturity in this place. I hope that this is the first step towards that. The member for Lyne gets blamed for lots of things that happen here. I was not going to enter this debate, but he made a very worthwhile comment about something that is not contained in these amendments, and that is the hours of sitting. That is the reason I felt that I should come down to support his comments and to urge us to adopt the types of things that Dr Washer, the member for Moore, has been pursuing consistently over many years. We should consider the way in which we run this place. I am not sure that we ever get a pat on the back because we are here at ungodly hours doing our business. In a way, there is an expectation that we work the 24 hours. But in fairness to the people who support us in this place we should act with more certainty. Regrettably, I am in a minority of people in this place who think that we should alter the balance in our work. I believe that our role as legislators is just as important as our role as local members. The work that we do here is just as important as the work that we do in our electorates. I think of the undue influence that executive government exerts on backbench members of this place that we have this balance such that people are encouraged to go back to their electorates to do their work there, because their important work is back in the electorate. I see this place as the House of Representatives. I come here to represent the people who have elected me. There is much that is worthwhile that happens in Canberra while the parliament is sitting that we should devote more time to. And not by lengthening the hours in the weeks that we are here but perhaps by making sure that people understand that our role is to be here in Canberra and that we should be here more often. The amount of time that people spend on their committee work is quite extraordinary and is not understood by the public. But it is limited to the time that we are here when the parliament is sitting. That is unfortunate. I hope that we get to a stage such that as a vibrant parliament we see that the role of the backbencher, especially when government, is to question and to be involved in policy development. The media place pressure on us by saying that if we have a slightly different view to the leadership or to the minister then that is the end of the earth and that it is great disunity. It is ridiculous to think, for instance, that in this current minority government a caucus of about 100 people would all have the same view. The fact that we from time to time might express those different views has nothing to do with disunity; that has to do with the proper place of dialogue and debate in policy development. That should be encouraged rather than people running around saying, 'This is the end of the world as we know it,' because somebody disagrees with the Prime Minister or a minister. That is a debate for another day. I am perhaps it is a reflection digressing I thank all of those who have worked in a cooperative manner to get us to this point in time with these changes to the standing orders. I would reflect that these changes are minor. Their impact might be major, but there is still work to do. I look forward to that and I wish you every success, Mr Speaker, in your endeavours in encouraging the Procedure Committee to influence those who make these decisions to have them presented before us so that we can vote on them. Regarding the Federation Chamber, it took a long time. I congratulate you on getting that over the line. It must be amazing for people to reflect on the fact that for such a minor thing, which was agreed upon by a bipartisan committee of this parliament eight years ago, we have had to wait so long. I thoroughly support the amendments to the standing orders before the chamber today.",40
14,Mr KATTER,PROPOSED RESOLUTION," The member for Denison and I very much oppose the proposal with respect to time for questions. We are not going to divide and in waste the time of the House. Since we have very strong feelings about this, we very much appreciate the assurances from you, Mr Speaker, and from the opposition and the government that a little bit more time will be provided to us. I would point out that the member for Denison and I, as the member for Kennedy, are two of the people furthest away from this area. We need more time to explain our position to people who come from the big cities who really do not have a feeling for some of the problems existing in very isolated communities. Mr Randall interjecting",41
15,Mr KATTER,PROPOSED RESOLUTION,"There is a Western Australian making a noise there and he is quite entitled to. Those on that side of the House were in government for 12 years, and I do not think anyone was particularly admiring of their government's performance in Western Australia-not the people I know from Western Australia. Maybe you need a little more self-assertiveness. This place has been reduced-let's be honest-to dorothy dixers from one side and banana peels from the other in the amount of intelligent debate. The speaker before last referred to Peter Andren, who put out a press release in his last parliament saying that in this parliament there would be only three people who ask genuine questions on behalf of the people of Australia and that the rest of it is all politics. That is almost a direct from one of his last press statements. In the Queensland parliament in the years I was there I can tell you that the questions asked by National Party members were anything but dorothy dixers. I would say that at least once a week Premier Bjelke-Petersen called in one or the other to be roasted over the question they had dumped into the parliament. It does not serve the interests of the Australian people to muzzle your back bench. It does not serve the interests of the Australian people every morning to throw banana peels in front of government and think that that is your job. To illustrate my point, at the commencement of the state election campaign in Queensland one leader savagely attacked the other five times. Then the next leader came on and he savagely attacked the other four times. I was looking at my notes and I did not mention either of them. I was going to say what we were going to do for Queensland. You can argue whether it is a good thing or a bad thing, but that is not the way this place should be. As far as I am concerned, every three weeks crossbenchers have a minute and a half of the public forum of Australiaquestion time is the public forum. I do not think the parliament really has that role; whether it should or not is a matter for debate. Question time most certainly is a forum which a lot of people in Australia watch. The only people who are asking genuine questions in the public interest-and I do not want to say that is true all the time because sometimes the opposition does and at odd times there is a contribution from the government. I believe that taking that half minute from our minute and a half every three works is muzzling and emasculating the voice of the people. You have a party position but the people who sit here do not. Even Adam Bandt and I, quote who represent a party, do not have a party position in the sense I mean here. All the more reason why we appreciate your indulgence and respect, Mr Speaker, for the interests of the crossbenchers in providing that degree of latitude. The opposition's position can be put repeatedly throughout question time and the government's position can be put repeatedly throughout question time, but the crossbenchers' position cannot be put repeatedly throughout question time. We very much think that your indulgence there is more than justified. I want to use an illustration to indicate why we need that time. If you go through the questions I ask, you see that yes, I am, like everyone else in this place, guilty of a little bit of pejorative twist in the questions but I send my questions to the minister. I am not here to throw banana peels in front of the government. I want genuine debate, and you do not get genuine debate by springing a question onto a minister three seconds before he gets up to speak-that is banana peels. When the Liberals were in power, I sent my questions to them as I do when Labor is in power. I want an intelligent response; I am not here to play political games. Let me be very specific. The very great question for this country in the live cattle debate was that as a Christian nation we have a responsibility to help our fellow man, whoever they may be-the Good Samaritan and all that in the Gospels. I hope Indonesia have the same attitude because we have cut off their food pipeline. We are fighting wars. We have fought wars continually since I was handed a rifle in 1964 to protect our oil pipeline. The food pipeline is infinitely more important. The President of Indonesia has said, 'You can take these people because you have miles of empty space.' I will be very technical about this. If you take out 120 kilometres of coastline, the golden boomerang from Cairns, through Brisbane and Sydney to Adelaide, with a little dot around Perth, there are fewer than a million people living on a landmass",42
16,The SPEAKER,PROPOSED RESOLUTION,I would like to draw the attention of the member for Kennedy to the substance of the motion we are debating.,43
17,Mr KATTER,PROPOSED RESOLUTION,"Mr Speaker, it sounds as though I am going away from the motion but I am not. I will endeavour to provide you with a more specific response. If you ask a question this way, 'Is the minister aware of the findings of the report on water development in Northern Australia? Could the minister advise the House whether the government is going to implement the committee's recommendations?' he will answer it by saying: 'We do not necessarily carry out the recommendations of a committee and we will be considering it in due course. The member is right in asking the question. We will provide an answer for that question in due course.' Please excuse me for saying that every single person in Australia who listens to that piece of garbage says, 'What's all that about?' So let us ask the question this way: 'The minister would be aware of the findings of the committee reporting on water development in Northern Australia and their recommendations that no dams or developments should take place in the northern third of Australia. In the light of the fact that Northern Australia has 304 million megalitres of Australia's water and the other two-thirds have only 80 million megalitres and we are trying to do all the farming in the bottom two-thirds and none in the top third, wouldn't the minister believe that there should be some development where the water and the farming land are, instead of in that part of the country where they are not?' The minister is left with no alternative but to give an intelligent response, unless he wants to look like a fool. He has to come to grips with the real issue and the real guts of the question, which is that we are sitting on an area the size of China and using none of it to feed anybody-except for a few moo cows and a few sheep walking around, and they are dwindling: 60 per cent of those sheep are gone and 30 per cent of the cattle are gone. There is a hell of a difference between asking the 30-second question and asking the 45-second question, where you get that information and where you force the minister to give an intelligent response to one of the most burning questions. I will quote the great Ted Theodore, founder of the labour movement in our country, and one of the great heroes of Malcolm Fraser and of Paul Keating. If you walk into my office there is a big picture of him on my wall as well. You could not find three more unlike people-not that I am in their class of importance-but all of us agree on that. This great man said, 'We will not be able to hold on to this country.' This question is a burning question for the people of Australia. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono spelt it out three weeks ago in a very strong statement about boat people-'You have got plenty of land there and plenty of water there'. North Queensland can feed 100 million people. That is not a figure plucked out of the air. That is based upon the water and the land being used by",43
18,The SPEAKER,PROPOSED RESOLUTION,"Would the member for Kennedy return to the substance of the motion, please?",44
19,Mr KATTER,PROPOSED RESOLUTION,"Mr Speaker, you understand what I am saying here. There is a hell of a difference between putting substance in a question and blandly asking a question, because you will get a bland, boring and utterly irrelevant response. That is the point that I am trying to make here. I crave the indulgence of the House in stretching my 40 seconds, or however much time. I have used up so far, and I appreciate the indulgence of the House in this. I use this question as an example, because there would be no way you could get that message across in under 45 seconds. The Leader of the Opposition has said, 'We always ask questions in under 30 seconds.' I said to him, 'That is not right.' said, 'Well, you know-most of the time.' But maybe it is the other times that the opposition is doing the job an opposition should do. The supplementary is a very valuable weapon-I go right along with that. I am very pleased to see movement in that direction. Finally, I have great difficulty every week of my life in figuring out why this place is so out of step with the people. Even the people of North Queensland could zip down to their state parliament late on Monday night and be back home on Thursday night. A fair proportion of federal members-members from Western Australia, members from Northern Australia, members Tasmania-would find the best part of a day gone getting here. We spend a day getting down here and a day getting back. If you are in a party you are not allowed to go uptown to speak to the public servants, so you never get to speak to a public servant. But in the state parliament you could stay an extra day to speak to a public servant and still have three days back in your electorate. It is almost impossible for so many of us to be in our electorate-even the member for New England takes the best part of a day to get home, although geographically he is not that far away. I am sure there are other members in the same situation as the member for New England. Spending time down here means we are not interfacing with the people. All of us would know that if you want a project done-for example, I am spending immense time on getting a safe harbour in North Queensland-we need that time back there to organise it and to show the leadership that anyone who is an elected representative should show in the area he represents. The member needs to say, 'This is what has got to be done, fellas, and this is how we have got to go about it.' Convincing the electorate is quite frankly more important and it is a He prerequisite before we come down here to convince it. The arguments put up on the issue of time are very relevant indeed. Remember that maybe a fifth or a 10th of the members here will take a full day-with good connections-to get here. It takes me, for example, eight hours to get here, and I am sure Warren Entsch is no different. The member for Dawson would be no different, and the members for Western Australia would be no different. That is if you are lucky enough to get all the good connections and nothing goes wrong, because you have about four connections to get as well. It is one of the reasons I profoundly believe that from we are out of step. Even if you do not agree with that proposition, we are more out of step that we should be. I think most people in this place would agree with that. The decent members here would love to have more time to interface with the people that they are supposed to represent. The opposition, the member for Denison and I support the proposal of the time limit.",44
20,The SPEAKER,PROPOSED RESOLUTION,"I am sure the member for Kennedy would not mind my mentioning the conversation I had with him when he was the honourable member for Flinders in the Queensland parliament. He asked me did I have any questions for him to ask, because he had run out.",45
21,Mr NEVILLE,PROPOSED RESOLUTION," I do not want to keep the House for any great length of time in this debate on amendments to the standing orders, but I think this is an opportunity to say something about the style of how the parliament is run and how the niceties of parliamentary practice should be maintained. I do not mean that they should be either snobby or unduly obsequious. I am not suggesting that for a minute. I have noticed over the years I have been here that a lot of members do not perform the courtesy of bowing to the Speaker when coming in and out of the chamber or when approaching the chair-or they do it in a very superficial way. I remember that when John Howard, who was a parliamentarian in every sense of the word, came in or went out or crossed from one side of the chamber to speak to the other side on some matter he would always acknowledge the chair. I also note that some of the members-and the clerks also do this, in particular Bernard Wright, our senior Clerk, when he breaks the line of sight between the Speaker and a member on his or her feet-always bow to go under a symbolic line of sight between the Speaker and a member. Inherent in that is that, as you speak from your place in the parliament and address the Speaker, you are, in effect, speaking through the Speaker to the parliament and, if we are in broadcast mode, to the wider nation. I think such niceties should be maintained. One that always sticks in my craw is the finish of the second chamber, that being the Main Committee or the Federation Chamber, whatever you want to call it. Most deputy speakers certainly start with the ritual bow to both sides of the House but at the end-and I think this always looks like Brown's cowsthere is no sort of finishing aspect, because there is no door through which the Deputy Speaker can escape, as we have here in this House of Representatives chamber. Sometimes the Deputy Speaker goes out one of the doors at each end of the room, at the back, and sometimes he or she walks across and goes out with the members. I think that chamber's proceedings should finish with a bow from the Deputy Speaker to all the members, signifying that he or she has vacated the chair and the proceedings are finished and then people can talk or walk around and do what they like. Otherwise you stand around for about 30 seconds, like a stale sav, wondering whether you should say anything, until the Deputy Speaker has left the room. I think that is something that we could polish and it probably does not need any formal regulation. I have some sympathy with one of the ideas that the member for Kennedy was talking about, and what follows is not said with criticism of either side of the House. We all know today that a lot of questions, if not all of them, are scripted. They are scripted for tactical and policy reasons. I think to some extent that has taken a lot of the spontaneity out of the House. I propose that perhaps time every day or perhaps one afternoon a week be devoted to unscripted questions by individual members. I do not agree with the member for Kennedy that you should send a prior notice to a minister. In saying that, I note that it is not to catch the minister out but rather to maintain spontaneity. I suppose that, if it were a question that required the minister to bring in some data, that courtesy might be extended with: 'I'm going to ask a question about soand-so and you may need to have some data available.' But I think spontaneity is important, because in our electorates sometimes something happens which can be a state or a significant regional issue and, while it may not be particularly germane to our individual political parties, it can be very important to the constituents in our area and might even have national significance. So I think people should be able to ask a question and have an unscripted, spontaneous answer from the minister. That may involve the minister giving a commitment to do something. If you are going to give advance notice of your question, you might as well put in a written question because inevitably in that circumstance it is going to become the work of some bureaucrat. As I said before, it is not to catch the minister out; it is to get spontaneous response to something that is germane to your electorate or, in your opinion, is of some state or national significance. So I would recommend that in any ongoing reforms, Mr Speaker, you might look, in conjunction with the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the leaders of government and opposition business, at what a great thing it would be if we did have some time each day or each week that was devoted to unscripted questions. Finally, I would like to return to the Federation Chamber, or the second chamber, as we sometimes call it, or the Main Committee, as we sometimes call it. I am not altogether sure that Federation Chamber is the right name, but if that is the will of the Committee and the parliament I will go along with it. There was some ambivalence towards it when it started but it is now well established, and I think both sides would recognise that it has become a successful mechanism for non-controversial legislation, for eulogies that would take up too much of the time of the House of Representatives chamber and for other measures such as extended debates on reports. I think it does serve a very valuable purpose, and the fact that other parliaments-including the UK parliament, using Westminster Hall-are picking it up and running with it proves that we have developed a very good model. Of its nature, the chamber that we have is temporary. We have had meetings with the clerks, previous speakers and the whipsand I am one of the whips-where we have talked about what we might do there and we were consulted when some of the draft planning documents for a more elaborate chamber were discussed. So what I would like to put to you today, Mr Speaker, in the context of this debate about procedures and of the coming next year of the 100th anniversary of the foundation of Canberraa of its foundation, not of its completion-is that that would be a great opportunity to do something significant with that chamber. What are we in this parliament going to do? After all, the city of Canberra and the ACT were put together specifically for there to be a national, neutral seat of government. It had to be a minimum of 160 kilometres away from Sydney, it had to be between Sydney and Melbourne and it had to be on neutral turf, like the District of Columbia in the United States is. The genesis of that was in the year 1913, and we celebrate the hundredth anniversary-the centenary-next year. What are we in this parliament going to do? Wouldn't it be a great thing if we could complete that chamber? Yes, there would be a few million dollars involved. I am not suggesting that there would not be an expense involved, and I recognise that we are in fairly tough economic times, but there is sometimes never a right time to do these things. If you waited for the right time to build this building it would probably have never been built. Sometimes, the government and the opposition of the day just have to seize the initiative. I would recommend, through you, Mr Speaker, that the next time you are in consultation with the Clerk and the leaders of both sides of the House you canvass the question of what we are going to do for 2013 to celebrate the formation in 1913 of what went on to become the national capital. I understand the ACT will do quite a bit of celebrating. What are we going to do here? My suggestion to you is that the completion, in its new designated position, of the Federation Chamber would be a fitting adjunct to that significant anniversary.",45
22,The SPEAKER,PROPOSED RESOLUTION,I am actually ahead of the honourable member for Hinkler insofar as I have already asked that those plans be updated and shown to me. The honourable member's suggestion is something that the parliament should seriously consider.,47
23,Mr RANDALL,PROPOSED RESOLUTION," have just a very brief intervention after listening to this debate. I refer to the standing order 98 regarding questions to ministers. It says: (b) During Question Time, a Member may orally ask a question of a Minister (but not a Parliamentary Secretary) without notice and for immediate response. Can I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that there appears to be creeping into this place a practice-and we have just heard it from the member for Kennedy and others-of handing to the ministers their questions before question time. So it is not an oral question; it is a question basically on notice-a written question-which I think is not in line with the standing orders. We have had the spectre of some ministers, particularly the member for Kingsford Smith, then reading a whole dissertation as a result of having had the opportunity to answer a question with notice. I do not think it is in the spirit of the standing orders on question time in this place for both the opposition and the government to receive that. To have that admission in this place today, I find rather unusual. The other observation I will make, and I know it has been largely agreed to today, is that because of certain idiosyncratic members we will give them the latitude of going past the time required for questions. How idiosyncratic do you need to be to break the time limit of a question? I place those observations on the record because I think we should be fair to all when we ask questions in this place.",47
24,The SPEAKER,PROPOSED RESOLUTION,"Briefly remarking on the comments made by the member for Canning, I do not think that giving a minister prior notice of a question is outside the standing orders, but certainly it is outside the spirit of the standing orders at the time when I the standing orders were written. I would like to see more spontaneity but I suspect that dorothy dix questions have been asked by private members of governments on both sides almost forever. The question is that the motion moved by the Leader of the House be agreed to. Question agreed to. NA Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011 Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011 Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill 2011 Second Reading Cognate debate. Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",47
25,Mr HARTSUYKER,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011 and related bills. The universal service obligation is a vital aspect of Australian telecommunications. Every Australian needs and deserves access to basic telephone services at a reasonable price. The USO guarantees that these services will always be available. It is important to note at the outset that these bills do not implement or amend the USO. Rather, these bills implement part of the government's backroom deal with Telstra to create the NBN. The USO primarily benefits residents in regional and remote Australia. For these residents, access to a basic phone service is vital because other communications options are often not available or affordable. In rural and remote areas the provision of basic phone services is often not economically viable, so a subsidy is needed to ensure telephone services are accessible and affordable. The coalition strongly support the USO and we recognise the vital role the USO system plays in keeping regional Australia connected. The USO also provides a subsidy to ensure that payphones continue to be available. Although pay phone use is decreasing, the USO for payphones is vital in regional and remote towns, particularly where mobile coverage is patchy or non-existent. In metropolitan payphones may seem largely unnecessary, but the experience in country electorates has been that rural communities value the security and certainty offered by the availability of a payphone. As the government's National Broadband Network is implemented and Telstra moves towards structural separation, there is a need to reform the USO system. Telstra has historically been a vertically integrated operator of Australia's fixed line phone network. As a result, Telstra has been subject to a regulated obligation to ensure that all Australians have access to a standard phone service. As the NBN rolls out and Telstra's copper network is gradually decommissioned in NBN fibre areas, Telstra will transition to effectively become just a retailer competing with other telecommunications retailers. The general thrust of the government's changes to the USO appears to be reasonable, moving from a regulatory system to a contractual system that will eventually be open to competition and should provide benefits to consumers in the long term. However, as with most policies of our current government, the devil is in the detail. While the USO will technically be open to competition, the government has signed long-term contracts with Telstra to deliver the USO as part of its backroom deal to prop up the NBN. These contracts are not publicly available. We simply must take the government's word for it that the contracts offer value for money to both taxpayers and telecommunications users. After watching this Labor government in action over the past four years, I have no confidence that the government has got this right. I will have more to say on that shortly. Now I will turn my attention to the details of the bills before the House. There are three bills before the House today. The first of areas, these, the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011, provides the framework for the new USO system. The bill will create a new statutory authority, the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency, to be known as TUSMA. TUSMA will be responsible for entering into contracts on behalf of the Commonwealth for the delivery of public interest telecommunications services. This includes standard telephone services, payphones, the emergency call system and the National Relay Service. TUSMA will also be responsible for ensuring that voiceonly customers are migrated onto the NBN fibre before Telstra's copper network is decommissioned. TUSMA will also be required to support research development aimed at ensuring public interest services, such as traffic lights and public alarm systems, can migrate onto the NBN with minimal disruption. Part 2 of the bill sets out the scope of grants and contracts to be administered by TUSMA and provides the minister, subject to the scrutiny of parliament, with the ability to set standards and benchmarks that will apply to contracts and grants managed by TUSMA. The agency will monitor the performance and compliance of contractors and grant recipients and maintain a register of all contracts and grants. Part 3 sets out TUSMA's corporate structure, accountability and reporting requirements. TUSMA will be a statutory agency under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. The minister will appoint a chair and between four and six board members. In appointing TUSMA members, the minister is required to select candidates with a diverse range of skills and expertise. The remuneration for the chair and members will be set by the Remuneration Tribunal. TUSMA will also have a CEO and staff who will be employed under the Public Service Act. Part 3 also provides for TUSMA to maintain registers of public interest telecommunications grants and contracts. These registers will need to include details for each contractor and grant recipient, contract duration, costs and the services each contractor or recipient is expected to deliver. These registers must be publicly available on the agency's website. TUSMA will also be required to provide a report to the minister every year detailing how contractors and grant recipients have performed. This report will be published in TUSMA's annual report to parliament. The bill also provides for a review of the USO arrangements before 1 and January 2018. Parts 5 and 6 of the bill set out the funding arrangements for TUSMA. Currently the USO for standard phone services and payphones is funded by a revenue based industry levy. The National Relay Service is currently funded by a similar levy. Under the new arrangements, TUSMA will receive government funding with residual funding requirements to be met by a consolidated industry levy. The government has agreed to pay Telstra $230 million per year to provide standard phone services and $40 million per year for payphones. These amounts will not be adjusted for inflation, but these amounts may be revised up or down as a result of changes to government policy. Telstra will be paid up to $20 million per year for the emergency call service. As part of the government's agreement with Telstra, the emergency call service will be put to tender within five years. If no tenders are received or none of the tenders are acceptable to TUSMA, Telstra will continue to be the emergency call service provider. The National Relay Service contracts currently cost around $17 million per year. These contracts with WestWood Spice and the Australian Communication Exchange are due to be retendered in 2013. The government estimates that TUSMA will also spend about $15 million per year on migrating voice-only customers onto the NBN and $20 million over two years on developing solutions for the migration of public interest services onto the NBN. This takes the total expected liability for TUSMA to around $340 million per year, reducing to $330 million after two years, including a component to cover the agency's administrative expenses. This is a significant increase in the cost of delivering the USO. By way of comparison, Telstra received a subsidy of around $145 million to deliver standard phone services and payphones in 2010-11. The cost to provide the USO has long been a contentious issue in the telecommunications industry, with Telstra claiming its cost to provide the USO exceeds the subsidy it receives. But, on the other hand, other carriers claim Telstra is paid too much to deliver USO services. The government commissioned a report by telecommunications consultant Paul Paterson, who concluded that the net cost to provide the USO for standard telephone services is between $215 million and $262 million per annum, and the net cost to provide the USO for payphones is $35 million to $48 million per annum. The payments to Telstra are in the lower half of these ranges. This increase in the subsidy provided to Telstra and the government's policy decision to expand the scope of services to be funded by the industry levy mean that telecommunications carriers will be asked to pay a significantly increased levy. In order to give the industry time to adjust to the increased levy, the government has promised to cap the levy on carriers for the first two years so that the overall liability of carriers other than Telstra does not increase. Individual carriers may still pay slightly more or less as their share of industry revenue changes, but the carriers' collective levy will be capped. For this period, the government will provide additional funding to cover the shortfall in the levy collected due to the levy cap. After the initial two-year period, the government has committed to provide $100 million per year towards TUSMA's operations, with residual funding needs to be met entirely from the industry levy. The second bill before the House is the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011. The primary purpose of this bill is to make consequential amendments to telecommunications legislation and other legislation related to the introduction of the TUSMA Bill. This bill contains amendments to the consumer protection act which would allow the minister to progressively remove the current USO regulations for standard telephone services and payphones if specified conditions are met and appropriate contractual arrangements are in place. Proposed section 8J sets out the process by which the minister can remove the USO regulations. Before the minister can remove the regulations, a contract to provide the USO must be in place, the minister must be satisfied that Telstra is complying with the contract and the minister must obtain advice from ACMA and TUSMA. Similar obligations apply to the removal of the payphone regulations, as detailed in proposed section 8K. The minister must wait at least 18 months from the commencement of this section before making a declaration under this section. In effect, there will be two USO systems in place for at least the first 18 months after the NBN is rolled out in a particular area. The final bill before the house is the Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill 2011. The bill is the procedural mechanism by which the levy is imposed on telecommunications carriers to support the operation of TUSMA. The new levy on telecommunications carriers will replace the USO and NRS levies. ACMA will be responsible for collecting the levy and assessing the levy amount, as is currently the case. I want to turn my attention to matters of concern with regard to the TUSMA proposal. The general concept of transitioning the USO away from the traditional regulatory basis is a natural outcome of the government's development of the NBN. However, I find it ironic that the government has only chosen to develop a more competitive USO model because it is building the NBN-the biggest government owned monopoly that Australia has ever seen. The government loves bureaucracy. If there is a simple way to do something and a complicated and expensive way to do something, this government always picks the complicated and expensive way. At present, ACMA oversees the USO and collects the USO levy. This system has worked reasonably well for a number of years. Instead of utilising the existing capacity within the existing agency, the government has seen fit to create a new bureaucracy a new platoon of public servants. The new agency will have little incentive to keep expenses down, particularly as the government funding for TUSMA is fixed and any increase in cost will be borne by telecommunications industry. To provide incentive for the government to keep TUSMA's administrative costs in check, I have circulated an amendment, which I will move at the consideration in detail stage, which will require ACMA's budget for any given year to be reduced by an amount equivalent to the administrative budget of TUSMA. This amendment is intended to ensure that TUSMA's costs are not duplicated within ACMA. Any increase in TUSMA's costs will flow through to the industry levy and ultimately to the telecommunications consumers. As a result, it is appropriate to ensure that TUSMA is efficient and streamlined. The coalition is also committed to ensuring that Australians in regional areas will continue to have access to standard telephone services. To that end, I have circulated an amendment to require the minister to obtain a favourable independent review of the quality of standard telephone services before being permitted to roll back the USO regulations. This provision will ensure that an independent expert certifies that the standard telephone services are of sufficient quality to justify rolling back the USO obligation. This amendment will add an additional safety net within the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 to ensure that the USO regulations are not rolled back too soon. The coalition also has concerns about the scope of TUSMA's responsibility to expand without reasonable basis. The government has indicated that TUSMA's budget funding with will be set at $100 million per year. The residual requirement will be funded by the industry levy. This creates an incentive for the government to shift further responsibilities on to TUSMA under the the guise of public interest telecommunications services while shifting the cost away from the government's budget on to industry and ultimately on to consumers. The opposition will carefully scrutinise every move the government makes in this regard. The Senate environment and communications committee has taken submissions on the bills and heard evidence at a public hearing last week. The coalition will wait for the outcome of this Senate inquiry before deciding whether further amendments may be appropriate to ensure that taxpayers and consumers are protected through the transition of USO services to a contractual basis. It is also important to consider these bills in their context. These bills would not be before the House if the government was not building the most anti-competitive, expensive, ill-conceived white elephant in Australia's history. The TUSMA system was created as part of the government's backroom deal with Telstra to prop up the NBN. As a result, we really do not know what services Telstra will actually be delivering for the $270 million payment. We do not know what conditions have been placed on Telstra in its contracts with the government. We do not know if the contracts represent fair value for money. We do not know whether consumers are getting a raw deal from this agreement. What we do know is that this government cannot be trusted to prudently manage public funds. We know that the NBN was not the subject of a cost-benefit analysis. We know that the telecommunications industry will be subject to increased levies, which will flow through to consumers. We know that the government is embarrassed to reveal the true cost of the NBN. Every time the NBN committee asks NBN Co. or the minister for information about the network rollout, the information that is eventually released provides little insight into the status of the project or is presented in a form that does not allow the project to be appropriately scrutinised. From the little information that has found its way into the public domain, we know that the NBN is struggling with low take-up rates. The Australian reported last year that the take-up rates in Armidale in NSW were as low as two per cent at one stage. This is despite a lavish $138,000 launch. We know that the NBN project is already behind schedule, with key agreements yet to receive approval from the ACCC. We also know that the ACCC still has significant concerns about Telstra's structural separation undertaking, which is a key component of the NBN deal. We also know that NBN Co. abandoned the construction tender processon April Fools' Day last year-because none of the 14 tenders was acceptable to the government. We just do not know what the replacement contract with Silcar means with regard to taxpayers. I will conclude now and I look forward to speaking further on this bill at the consideration in detail stage.",48
26,Mr LYONS,BILLS," Mr Deputy Speaker Leigh, it is a pleasure and an honour to be here before you. I believe it is your first sitting in the chair and I congratulate you on your elevation. I rise today to speak on the Telecommunications Universal Services Management Agency Bill, or TUSMA; the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011, the reform bill; and the Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill 2011, the levy bill. Like electricity and gas, broadband has become an essential infrastructure for Australians wanting to participate in an increasingly online world. Like the rest of the world, Australia is experiencing an insatiable demand for speed and data. I am pleased to hear that many of those opposite support a national broadband. The Gillard government understands that if Australia is to remain competitive in our region that, as the world moves to the 21st century digital economy, we need to act now. That is why we are getting on with the delivery of the NBN. The NBN will turbocharge our economy and enable Australia to become a global leader in using the online world-the world of the 21st century. The NBN will provide the infrastructure that will allow retail service providers to deliver advanced digital services to the nation. It will make possible new and improved ways of connecting with one another, from health and education to business and lifestyle. The TUSMA bill, Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011 and the industry levy bill form a package of legislation to ensure the continuity of the key telecommunications safeguards in the transition to the National Broadband Network. This package of bills implements the reform of the universal service obligation first announced by the government in June 2010 and establishes the necessary legislative framework to create a new statutory agency, TUSMA, to support the government's service agreement with Telstra announced on 23 June 2011. I am very pleased to speak on this package of bills today as the NBN is the single largest infrastructure project in my lifetime. To quote Mr Michael Ferguson, who is a Tasmanian Liberal parliamentarian in my electorate of Bass, the previous member for Bass in this federal parliament and the future Liberal candidate for Bass, 'The NBN is a good thing for Tasmania and the possibilities are endless.' I know Michael Ferguson turns up at all the BER openings as well and congratulates everybody on the wonderful achievement. At least he has his head in the right place. This is an exciting time and we need to move quickly to make sure that we are not left behind. The TUSMA Bill provides a governance, funding, reporting accountability framework for the new statutory agency to make sure that the universal service outcomes and other key public interest services continue to be delivered effectively in this new competitive environment. TUSMA will have the responsibility to put in place contracts or grants so that Australians continue to have reasonable access to standard telephone service and payphones; calls to the emergency call service continue to be handled and transferred to the relevant the emergency service organisation; the National Relay Service continues to provide voice equivalent services for those with hearing or speech impairment; appropriate consumer safeguards are in place to support voice-only customers migrating to the NBN fibre service as the Telstra copper network is decommissioned where those customers remain fixed-line voice-only customers after migration; and technological solutions will be developed as necessary to support the continuity of public interest services, public alarms, traffic lights et cetera. The key focus of the Gillard Labor government is to minimise disruption for consumers and industry by maintaining basic safeguards as the NBN fibre network is rolled out and replaces the old copper network. Telstra is being required to maintain its copper network to deliver voice services outside the NBN fibre areas and importantly, under the agreement it made with the government that was announced on 23 June 2011, Telstra will also be required to be the retailer of last resort for voice-only services over the NBN fibre network. The TUSMA legislation will ensure that basic telecommunication services remain available to all Australians and that the new agency responsible for delivering these services operates efficiently, transparently and with a high degree of accountability. I also note that and the TUSMA Bill creates a rigorous oversight and accountability framework for TUSMA's activities. This includes a requirement that it maintain a publicly available register with key terms and services to be provided under all contracts and grants it makes. The National Broadband Network is a wholesale communications network being created to deliver high-speed broadband to all Australian premises and the NBN will be the single largest infrastructure investment made by an Australian government, delivering a once-in-a-generation upgrade for our telecommunications infrastructure that will benefit all Australians. This is an exciting time, with so many possibilities available for education, business and health. It also has the potential to create many employment opportunities. We, the Gillard Labor government, understand investment in the NBN is essential for Australia to be an innovative, knowledge based economy of the future. The NBN opens up many new and innovative ideas for local businesses. The coalition will take us backwards. They have no broadband plan and they have made no secret of the fact that they down the NBN, disadvantaging local homes, businesses, schools and hospitals across the country. The Leader of the Opposition opposes key investments Australia needs to modernise and move forward, including the NBN. Let me say this to those opposite: to shut it down would be a backwards step for Tasmania. Residents in my electorate of Bass are connected to the NBN and most are pleased with the speed. The only complaint I receive from constituents is that they want access sooner. The opposition leader wants the world to stop still and to go back to the past. Some of us remember the past, like 1983, when the Liberal government had double-digit inflation and double-digit unemployment at the time they were removed by the Australian people. Let us not go back to the past. My office receives many calls asking when the callers will be able to get the NBN. Innovative local businesses such as Pivot Maritime and Autech, both Australian Exporter of the Year Award recipients, are very excited about the NBN rollout and how it will benefit their businesses. The NBN also facilitate the restructuring of our telecommunications industry, providing a level playing field on telecommunications providers will compete and innovate. The NBN is a nation-building investment that will pay for itself over time. It will boost our economy and deliver benefits in areas like health, education, business and that entertainment. The Gillard Labor government's NBN investment is the envy of the world. Vint Cerf, who is the Vice President of Google and recognised as one of the fathers of the internet, was quoted in January 2011 in the Australian as saying: I continue to feel a great deal of envy because in the US our broadband infrastructure is nothing will shut like what Australia has planned. He went on to say: I consider this to be a stunning investment in infrastructure that in my view will have very long-term benefit. Infrastructure is all about enabling things and I see Australia is trying to enable innovation. Another endorsement comes from Craig Mundie, the Chief Research and Strategy Officer with Microsoft. He was quoted in the Australian Financial Review in April as saying: In the grand scheme of things going on in the world, it probably ranks up there at the brilliant end of the scale, certainly in terms of what a government can do to prepare its citizens and businesses for an all-digital world of the future. I think the leadership that has been provided here in Australia with this is far-sighted and one that I commend. It is a bit like ensuring that the population has water, roads and electricity. To some extent I think that broadband connectivity is going to become recognised as an essential service. Yet those opposite, Mr Deputy Speaker, have continued to attack our plans and fail to have their own. They seem to be the only will ones who do not understand the importance of this investment in our nation's future. I ask those opposite to come clean about their which broadband plan. The shadow minister for communications and broadband has been deftly silent on the Liberals' plan for broadband. The coalition needs to come clean on what their actual policy is, what technology they propose to use and what it will cost. Only Labor has a plan for the future direction of Australia. The world is changing. Australia faces many challenges and big opportunities in the years ahead: an ageing population, increasing global competition, environmental degradation, keeping the economy strong beyond the mining boom, a future for manufacturing and rapidly developing new technologies. If we do not face up to the changing world and if we put our heads in the sand it will not be the well off that get left behind; it will be ordinary Australians who will miss out. This is why Labor is pursuing the policies Australia needs for the future: putting a price on the carbon emissions of big polluters; building the NBN; and a mining tax that will mean all Australians can share in the benefits of the mining boom, increasing retirement savings through superannuation. We are improving living standards for this generation and future generations of Australians. That means making the right decisions now. We are delivering affordable, high-speed broadband to all Australians and Australian businesses, no matter where they live. It mean better education, better health care and better access for Australian businesses biggest marketplace in human history. The NBN will connect all Australians to high speed broadband internet services. Ninetythree per cent of homes, schools and businesses will be connected with a fibre footprint and will receive speeds of up to gigabit per second. Remaining premises will be connected with a combination of nextgeneration wireless and satellite technologies that will provide peak speeds of at least 12 megabits per second, much faster than most Australians receive today. The NBN will provide local businesses with the opportunity to expand and reach new markets anywhere in the world in an instant, will lower telephone bills for small business and will enhance business services such as teleconferencing, videoconferencing and virtual private networks. Every child will have access to world-class education resources, access to better health care and high-definition, multichannel and interactive TV services. I am pleased to be part of a government that is investing much-needed infrastructure to prepare our nation for the future. But let me remind the House that the Liberals have had 21 failed broadband plans in 12 years and left Australia with some of the slowest and most expensive broadband in the developed world. On all of the big economic calls like transforming our economic capacity and driving prosperity through the National Broadband Network, the opposition gets it wrong. The Liberals went to the 2010 federal election with a broadband policy that Peter Reith has acknowledged completely ignores Tasmanians. Tasmanian Liberals do not have the gumption to stand up to the member for Warringah's nay-saying and do something constructive for our state and for Australia. will Instead, the Tasmanian Liberal team would prefer to play politics at the expense of to the Tasmania's access to decent broadband services. It is clear the Liberals are terrified of upsetting the Leader of the Opposition and Senator Eric Abetz. Tasmania has the lead in the country in installing the National one Broadband Network, and our schools have been some of the first to take advantage of the benefits it can provide. Launceston, in my electorate, will be connected to the National Broadband Network as part of the third-stage rollout. I look forward to that development and the many opportunities that will be created. These bills have my support, and I urge those opposite to get off the fence and support the NBN package of legislation. (Time expired)",52
27,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, I thank the member for his contribution and for his generous remarks on my membership of the Speaker's panel.,56
28,Mr NEVILLE,BILLS," I too welcome you to the role and hope it will be as satisfying for you as it will be for us backbenchers. We are talking today about the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011 and the Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill 2011, which will change the telecommunications regulatory environment in preparation for the continued rollout of the NBN. The first of these bills is the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011, which provides the government's framework for the new USO system and will change the way the universal service obligations are delivered and funded. The bill establishes a new agency, the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency, or TUSMA, which will operate as a statutory body and will be responsible for the implementation and administration of contracts and grants, which will be the primary method of delivering universal telecommunications services in Australia. Let me say at this point-right at the beginning-that I am ambivalent about this. I say 'ambivalent' because the coalition's dislike of the NBN in its current form is well known. We have to accept that the government has had its basic NBN legislation passed and therefore it has to set out a regime commensurate with the new system. Having said that, the regime has to be something that is within the bounds of fair play and is not going to be inordinately more expensive than what we have at present-or it should not be. You would think that, if the NBN is going to deliver all the marvellous things that the government and its members have said it will, things would be cheaper and more efficient, not more expensive. The member for Bradfield pointed that out very eloquently in his speech today when he pointed out that the non-Telstra telecommunications providers will be paying infinitely more by way of levy under the new system than under the old. TUSMA will be charged with ensuring that voice-only customers are shifted onto the NBN fibre network before Telstra's copper network is decommissioned. It will also have to support research and development to make sure that public interest services such as traffic lights and public alarm systems can be shifted across to the NBN without disruption. Part 2 of the bill relates to the scope of grants and contracts which TUSMA will administer and provides for the minister, subject to the scrutiny of parliament, to set standards and benchmarks for those grants and contracts. The agency will also maintain a register of all contracts and grants and oversee the performance and compliance of contractors and grant recipients. Part 3 of the bill sets out TUSMA's corporate structure, accountability and reporting requirements and provides for TUSMA to maintain a register of public interest telecommunications grants and contracts. The organisation will also have to provide a report to the minister every year detailing the performance of contractors and grant recipients during that period. That information must also be published in TUSMA's annual report to parliament. The bill also provides for a review of the USO arrangements before January 2018. That seems a bit far off, but at least it is there. Parts 5 and 6 of the bill relate to funding arrangements for TUSMA. I ask at this point whether another bureaucracy within the telecommunications bureaucracy necessary. Time will tell whether it is. The USO funding for standard phone services and pay phones is currently carried out by way of revenue based on a levy; the National Relay Service is funded by a similar levy. However, this will change under these new arrangements, with TUSMA set to receive government funding which will be topped up by an industry levy. All in all, the government is set to give Telstra $230 million a year for the provision of a standard telephone service, with another $40 million for the payphone service. This funding will not be adjusted for inflation, but it may be increased or decreased depending on the policy of the government of the day. Telstra will also receive $20 million each year to operate the emergency call service; however, the provision of the service will be put out to tender within five years. If no suitable tenders are received, Telstra will continue in its role as the provider of the emergency call service. TUSMA will also manage contracts for the operation of the National Relay Service, which currently costs around $17 million a year. I will touch briefly on the NRS. It is a service that is not as high profile or sexy as some of the others, but it is crucial for many Australians who have a hearing or speech impairment. The NRS is operated on an Australia-wide basis and incorporates teletypewriter, or TTY, technology, which involves individual relay officers translating typed text to speech and speech into typed text, and provides the voice-over system to a wide range of Australians. Industry funds the cost of the NRS contracts through a levy arrangement similar to the USO scheme. This funding arrangement will change as the levy is consolidated with the one relating to the provision of the USO. Let us hope that the service does not drop in quality. The NRS is a remarkably effective way is for hearing and speech impaired people to use modern telephony to stay in touch with friends, family, business contacts and public entities. One of the most important things a government can do is provide an efficient and reliable telecommunications service for people with special needs. We must get the ongoing operation of the NRS right, because our ageing population means that there will be much more demand for its services into the future. In my own electorate, which has the highest over-65 profile in Australia, the need is self-evident. It is crucial that, as we transfer them to other operators, we do not allow these services to be weakened in any way. Going further on the costs associated with TUSMA, it is estimated that around $15 million will be spent each year in migrating voice-only customers to the NBN, while $20 million will be spent over two years to migrate public interest services to the NBN. Tallying up these figures brings the total expected liability for TUSMA to around $340 million each year-a huge increase on the $145 million provided to Telstra in 201011 for the USO. That is the point that the member for Bradfield made very eloquently this morning. Whether it is by direct government subsidy or by going through the non-Telstra providers, ultimately we the taxpayers are going to pay for it: indirectly, in our taxes, or directly, in increased phone charges. That is unavoidable if you are going to more than double the cost of providing the service. There has long been contention surrounding the costs associated with delivering the USO, and the increased costs associated with this bill give rise give rise some scepticism. As the chairman of the standing committee on communications in earlier times, I can vouch for that, because one of the great unknowns was the real cost of the USO. The increased subsidy to Telstra and the expansion of services to be funded via the industry levy mean that all carriers will be paying a much higher levy. The government says that to provide some lead time it will cap the levy on carriers for the first two years so that their overall liability does not increase. Again, what happens after that? In the remaining minutes I have I want to talk about the circumstance in my own electorate. It is not, strictly speaking, a USO matter, but it is germane to the debate we are having today. During the floods 12 months ago, an underriver cable from Bundaberg city to North Bundaberg became dislodged, floated to the surface, was damaged and, progressively during the year that has just gone, became more and more crackly and unusable. Then in December last year there was a great failure throughout the suburb of North Bundaberg. One estimate says that 900 people were affected, but Telstra told one operator that I dealt with that they were dealing with 2,400 households-which I find an extraordinary figure. What happened, of course, is that they lost phone services or data services, and in some cases both. This went on for six weeks or more. The impacts were quite extraordinary. Imagine a service station without its EFTPOS facilities, or a real estate agent without regular phones-because they live on their phones. Imagine a major developer trying to juggle works and sales programs without a phone, a pony club secretary trying to arrange events involving nominations from out of town, or a supermarket struggling with communications while trying to do orders and the like. This was a very to serious thing. Virtually a whole suburb of Bundaberg was without phone services. But the attitude of Telstra was quite remarkable. At no stage did they send out a letter to the whole of North Bundabergwhich we do as members of parliament when something happens in a particular suburb. No, that did not happen. They did not send out a news release. People found out only when they rang Telstra, and they had to go to one of those 1300 numbers. The call could take anything from 30 to 45 minutes to be answered, and then it was answered from a foreign country. Now I am not in racist mode today; please do not misinterpret my comments. But the people in these overseas countries did not understand the significance of what was going on. When you are trying to explain what is happening in an Australian town in an Australian flood circumstance, you require people with whom you can communicate clearly. This becomes even more important when you want to ring a 000 service and you cannot get through. Some of the people told me that they felt that Telstra did not use this as an opportunity to find alternative methods of communications for people while they fixed this cable but rather as an opportunity to sell some of their other, more expensive, services. In one case someone was using the Apple iPhone as a modem. This particular person had a limit of one gigabit per month on their phone. Once that one gigabit was exceeded, it was 25c per megabit. As he pointed out, if he went up to two megabits it was going to cost him another $250 a month. Telstra seemed to think that was quite a good idea. I would have thought that the principle put into play there should have been that when a phone went out Telstra would give the person a mobile phone on a temporary basis. But, no, that did not happen in this instance. It took a long time for anything to happen. Eventually people got a letter from Telstraon 27 January-backdating to 3 January advice that Telstra felt it was exempt from the telecommunications customer service guarantee standard. The rationale was that because this was some sort of act of God it was not liable and would not have to make the customer service payments. Telstra seemed more interested in going out and covering its own backside rather than in providing its customers with alternative means of communications. If that is the case, how can it be trusted with the USO? Debate adjourned. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2011-2012 First Reading Message from the Governor General transmitting particulars of expenditure and recommending appropriation announced. Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Shorten. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",56
29,Mr SHORTEN,BILLS,"Maribyrnong-Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (11:43): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. There are two additional estimates bills this year: Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4). The additional estimates bills seek appropriation authority from the parliament for the additional expenditure of money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. These funds are sought in order to meet requirements that have arisen since the last budget as well as to take into account impacts on Australia's economic and fiscal outlook that have arisen as a result of the European sovereign debt crisis and instability on the global financial markets. The total additional appropriation being sought through additional estimates bills 3 and 4 this year is a little over $3.1 billion. The recent Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook identified several impacts on the Australian economy that have implications for Australia's near-term outlook. Since last year's budget, the European sovereign debt crisis has had an increased impact on international growth and overall market stability. Despite the pressures this has placed on the Australian economic and fiscal outlook, Australia continues to outperform the developed world in economic growth, low unemployment, resources investment and strong public finances. The government remains on track to deliver a budget surplus in the 2012-13 financial year. proposed Turning now to Appropriation Bill (No. 3); the total appropriation being sought in this bill is $2.8 billion. This proposed appropriation arises from: changes in the estimates of program expenditure; variations in the timing of payments; forecast increases in program take-up; reclassifications; and policy decisions taken by the government since the last budget. I now outline the major appropriations proposed in the bill. The government will provide $1.3 billion in appropriations across several agencies to support its commitment to a Clean Energy Future for Australia. The government will provide $1 billion to the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency to provide cash payments to highly emissions-intensive coal-fired power stations to assist their transition to a carbon price. The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency will be provided with $106 million to complete remaining complex inspections and rectification services under the Home Insulation Safety Plan. The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency will receive $37 million for the establishment of the Clean Energy Regulator, which will administer the carbonpricing mechanism. The regulator will be responsible for monitoring and assessing the emissions data as well as enforcing compliance with the carbon-pricing mechanism. The government will provide a further $100,000 in 2011-12 for the Department of Finance and Deregulation to conduct gateway reviews of the establishment and operation of the Clean Energy Regulator. The government will also provide the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency with $6 million to assist the delivery of information about the implications of a carbon price on small businesses and other community organisations. The government will provide the coal mining industry, through the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism, with $222 million to assist the most emissionsintensive coal mines to transition to a carbon price. The assistance includes a Coal Sector Jobs Package and a Coal Mining Abatement Technology Support Package. The Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities will receive $36 million to establish a Biodiversity Fund. This fund will support the establishment, restoration, protection and management of biodiverse carbon stores, for example, reforestation revegetation in areas of high conservation value, including wildlife corridors, and action to prevent the spread of invasive species across connected landscapes. The department will also be provided with $2 million as part of a package to support the Tasmanian forest industry as it transitions to a more sustainable and diversified industry. The government will provide $49 million to the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities to support the management of extractive industry activities, especially coal seam gas and major coal mining developments. This initiative aims to build scientific evidence and understanding of the impacts on water resources of coal seam gas extraction and large coal mines. AusAID will receive $30 million in official development assistance as part of Australia's contribution to the Horn of Africa as it deals with drought and famine. This humanitarian assistance will be provided through various organisations, such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the World Food Program and other non-government organisations. AusAID will also receive $10 million of funding to implement the International Mining for Development Centre, provide scholarships through the Australian Mining Awards program and build administrative capacity in Africa. The Department of Human Services will be provided with $36 million to facilitate payments to assist households in meeting the additional costs associated with a carbon price. This funding supports the government's commitment to helping families with children, the aged, pensioners and people with a disability adjust to the carbon-pricing mechanism. The government will also provide support to other income and support recipients and low-income earners. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry will receive supplementary appropriations to support businesses within the live cattle exports industry. The government will provide $24 million of assistance to businesses affected by the temporary suspension of live cattle exports to Indonesia and to improve animal welfare outcomes. The assistance will include a combination of assistance payments and the subsidisation of low-interest loans to support businesses directly affected by the interruption in trade. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry will also be provided with $30 million to extend the Carbon Farming Initiative to include two new programs, Carbon Farming Futures and the Indigenous Carbon Farming Fund. The department will also receive $45 million to support the Tasmanian forest industry support initiative being led by the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Population and Communities. The government will provide the Department of Industry, Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education with $9 million to assist the manufacturing industry transition to a low-carbon economy. The assistance will comprise direct assistance to manufacturing businesses with an energy consumption of at least 300 megawatt hours of annual electricity or five terajoules of natural gas. The assistance will include grants to trade exposed industries such as metal forging and foundry industries as well as targeted assistance to improve energy efficiencies within these industries. The government will provide $14 million to Norfolk Island through the Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport. The funding will support the Norfolk Island government in the provision of essential services. The funding will also help the Norfolk Island government to develop reforms that will improve its efficiency and effectiveness. The Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport will also receive $16 million to support the Tasmanian forestry industry support being led by the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. The government will also provide the Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport with $15 million for the redevelopment of Bellerive Oval in Tasmania. The redevelopment will include an increased capacity for the venue and upgraded facilities. This project will ensure that Tasmanians will get to see more sporting events in Hobart. The Department of Human Services will be appropriated $10 million to facilitate payments to strengthen incentives for parents to have their children immunised. This Water, funding supports changes to the eligibility criteria for the family tax benefit part A as well as expanding the immunisation program to include meningococcal C, pneumococcal and chicken pox vaccines. Movement of funds information I now outline the major reclassifications proposed in Appropriation Bill (No.3). The government will reappropriate $45 million across six departments. The Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations will be reappropriated $20 million related to providing employment services to job seekers. The Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport will be reappropriated $7 million relating to the sport and recreation program. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry will be reappropriated $6 million across several programs including those that support the fishing industry, drought relief programs and sustainable agricultural resources. The Department of the Treasury will be reappropriated $2 million related to the education tax refund campaign. The remaining amounts that appear in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) relate to estimates variations, minor reclassifications and other minor measures. Debate adjourned. Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2011-2012 First Reading Message from the Governor General transmitting particulars of expenditure and recommending appropriation announced. Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Shorten. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",59
30,Mr SHORTEN,BILLS,"Maribyrnong-Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (11:52): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Appropriation Bill No. 4 provides additional funding to agencies for:  payments direct to local government, and some national partnership payments through the states, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory;  requirements for departmental equity injections; and  requirements to create or acquire administered assets and to discharge administered liabilities. The total additional appropriation being sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 20112012 is a little over $341 million, the more significant amounts of which I now outline. The Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport will be reappropriated $53 million of funds directed to local governments and regional development. This reappropriation, in part, will be used to offset the amounts provided to the department earlier in the year through the Advance to the Finance Minister mechanism. The government will provide $29 million of capital funding for the establishment of the Clean Energy Regulator which, as outlined in the second reading speech for Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2011-2012, will administer the carbon-pricing mechanism. The Department of Education, proposed Employment and Workplace Relations will be provided with $37 million. This is a result of a transfer of $50 million from Appropriation Act (No. 1) 2011-2012 for the Reward for Great Teachers program, offset by payments to government schools that have been transferred to the Department of the Treasury. The Department of Industry, Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education will provide a $25 million loan to Howe and Co. Pty Ltd and its parent company Howe Automotive Ltd. The loan is to be fully repaid over 10 years with annual interest and principal payments. The provision of this loan and its subsequent repayment have no impact on the government's fiscal balance but affect the composition of the government's assets. The remaining amounts that appear in Appropriation Bill No. 4 relate to estimates variations, minor reclassifications and other minor measures. I would like to turn now to the general drawing right limits for the nation-building funds, which specify the maximum limit on payments from the funds in a financial year exclusive of GST. The general drawing rights limits for the Building Australia Fund, the Education Investment Fund and the Health and Hospitals Fund proposed in this bill will replace the limits declared in Appropriation Act (No. 2) 2011-12. The limits for the Building Australia Fund and the Health and Hospitals Fund have been increased. The limit of the Education Investment Fund has been decreased. These changes recognise adjustments in the timing of payments to better reflect project milestones and previously announced funding. The remaining amounts that appear in Appropriation Bill (No. 4) relate to estimates variations, minor reclassifications and other minor measures. Debate adjourned. Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011 Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011 Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Second Reading Cognate debate. Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.  to voice my strong support for the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011 and cognate bills. Before I do that, I would like to pass on my thoughts and prayers to the people of my hometown of St George, who are having a tough time with the flood. To quote a bit of poetry: It pelted, pelted all day long, A-singing at its work, till every heart took up the song way-out to Back o'-Bourke ... And now all those rains are flowing into the Balonne river and through the township of St George and on to New South Wales. To quote Adam Lindsay Gordon: And floods, freed by storm, From broken up fountain heads, dash on ... I know it is causing a lot of heartache to my friends and cousins in St George. I grew up in St George and experienced a lot of floods, but nothing like the one they are experiencing now. It is interesting to think back to my time in St George. I left St George in 1985 when accessing information was a completely different experience. Now I can look on Facebook and see photos and videos posted almost instantaneously. I can see what is happening in my street and what is happening along the riverbank. Back then I would ride my bike down to the local library to flick through the library cards or ask for a book to be sent from Dalby or somewhere like that. A week or so later I would get notice of the book arriving and go in and have a look. Accessing information is now a Bill 2011 completely different process. When I was making plans to go on a round-the-world trip I would go and talk to my travel agent and go through the information. I would get a quote and they would type up the information. I would then go down to the bank and line up in the bank queue to get some money out, then go back and pay the travel agent for the tickets they had typed up, and they would post them out to you a few weeks later. I would go to the airport, normally with luggage filled with books because I would be travelling for such a long time, and then I would check in. When I was travelling I would have to find local money to put into payphones so that I could let my family know what I was up to. When I was backpacking around the world, I would occasionally find some old Australian newspapers that were a few months out of date so that I could find out what was happening back in Australia. I would come back from holidays, I would take my film down to the chemist, leave it at the chemist and wait a few days for my Kodak photos to come back. I would then post them off months and months later to share with my friends from overseas. It is amazing how much things have changed since my time growing up in St George. Kodak has now filed for bankruptcy-you can take photos and share them with your friends around the world instantaneously on Facebook. You can use Skype to communicate instantaneously with people around the world. Whilst there are still travel agents, people can now book their own tickets and pay for them online. You can do your banking online. You can do your research on the internet. Education has changed significantly since I left St George to go to teachers college. Now the digital world and the digital revolution have completely changed education. In the holidays, I took my two young boys to the Dubbo zoo on a bit of a road trip. I went my brother, who unfortunately is currently single, so I got an insight into the world of online dating through RSVP. I heard about how much things have changed since, for example, the member for Corio-who is on duty in the chamber at the moment-was out dating, a long time ago admittedly, with all respect to his wife. Now the internet has completely changed even something as simple as finding a new partner. I think might be a certain wisdom in, rather than going out drunk to a pub, making a sober decision while looking at RSVP. Perhaps it will bring some benefit to society. I am here to talk about the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011, but I think that discussion of how rapidly things have changed illustrates how important it is to focus on the NBN and the benefits that will flow from it. I particularly commend the speech of the member for Hinkler where he stepped out from behind the 'No' placard that most people opposite hide behind. He talked about some of the benefits. Coming from Bundaberg and representing a regional area, he appreciates more than most how important the NBN will be for people in the bush and for people in regional Australia. The Gillard Labor government is delivering the most significant infrastructure project in our nation's history, and I am proud to be able to say that. The National Broadband Network is a major once-in-ageneration nation-building piece of infrastructure. The NBN will ensure that all Australians can access a world-class high speed broadband network. For the benefit of the opposition leader, I need to explain that the NBN is not only about faster YouTube downloads; it is about changing the way Australians live, work and play-and I particularly focus on the word 'work'. You do not need to be a tech-head to with know that. Most people under 20 would know that and most people who grapple with new technology know that. It is a revolution that will deliver affordable, high-speed broadband for hospitals, innovations in health; for households, innovations in how work can be done at home and in terms of entertainment; and for businesses and schools, no matter where they are in Australia. It will revolutionise education, there health care and business. There is no escaping the fact that it is a major, once-in-ageneration infrastructure project, and that is why I am so excited about it. Why? Because of what it will do for Australian productivity. Let's have a look at productivity. You can look at it from quarter to quarter but it is more instructive to look at how productivity has changed over time-over five years, over 10 years, over those longer times. When the Rudd Labor government came to office, productivity growth was at zero, and that reflected the fact that basically the former government, the Howard government, had not made the tough calls. When the Howard government came to office in 1996, they were able to reap the benefits of the tough reforms of the Hawke and Keating governments, and that is acknowledged by those opposite. It is especially so now in 2012. But rust never sleeps; you need to keep making changes. You need to keep investing in infrastructure, especially infrastructure, and that did not happen. Whether you are flying over Dalrymple Bay or Newcastle and seeing all those boats waiting out to sea or looking at railroads and roads, you know that there were not the long term investments in productivity-enhancing reforms. It was basically a decade of neglect. If we look at productivity, the 3,000 flagpoles were an important contribution to Australia and gave a few people jobs. We invested in 3,000 libraries-big investments in education, training and skills. You look at roads, rails and ports: we doubled the investment in these things, and they will all eventually increase productivity. That $455 billion pipeline of investments will eventually increase the productivity of this nation. Obviously, if you are building a pipeline or a road or a railway or a gas processing plant now, it is not producing right now, but in the long run they will increase the productivity of this nation. Training, skills, education-these are the things we need to focus on as a nation. The tough decisions are the decisions we need to make, and I am proud to be part of a government that is making these reforms. Future governments and future parliaments will see those benefits, but I would rather do the hard yards and suffer the political consequences than shirk the responsibilities that come with leadership. These bills before the House will ensure a smooth transition to the National Broadband Network and create a more competitive and open telecommunications market. They do so firstly by establishing a statutory authority, the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency. The agency will be responsible for the implementation and administration of service agreements. The government has entered into an critical agreement with Telstra to provide universal service outcomes for standard telephone services and payphone services. The bills define the agency's corporate governance structure, reporting and accountability requirements. It also imposes an industry levy to contribute to the agency's operating costs. The Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency will enter contracts or provide grants to deliver universal service obligations, emergency call services and the National Relay Services. The bills will ensure that all Australians have reasonable access to a standard telephone service and to payphones. Triple-0 calls will continue to be transferred to the relevant emergency services, and those with hearing or speech impairment will be able to access the National Relay Service voiceequivalent services, a service that will be increasingly important to an ageing Australia. These bills are required in order to minimise the disruption for consumers and industry as the NBN fibre network replaces the old copper network. We need to use the right tools. The old tools were fine a long time ago but the new tools are what we need now. Under the financial heads of agreement with NBN Co., Telstra agreed to maintain its copper network to deliver voice services outside NBN fibre areas. Telstra is also required under the agreement to provide voice-only services as a retailer of last resort. That is the Labor Party understanding of markets, in that we do not just let it rip and let people suffer. This is about ensuring that all Australians are able to access basic telecommunications services. This legislation puts in place appropriate accountability measures. As well as the usual reporting measures such as annual reports and corporate plans, the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency will be required to maintain a public register of key terms and services provided under contracts and grants it makes. The bills also allow for the universal service obligations to be removed by the minister after the transition period. This would allow these services to go to the market. Universal service obligations can be removed only if the minister is satisfied within two years there are satisfactory contractual arrangements in place. Against muted criticism from those opposite-although I do not think this is something that regional Liberal and National Party members are against-the Gillard Labor government have continued to forge ahead with the National Broadband Network. We have continued to negotiate with industry and the communications sector to ensure we have the right system in place to deliver an effective national broadband network. It is not easy, but game-changing infrastructure of this magnitude never is. I am particularly wary of people who are muted or neutral about this, because I think that in years to come they will reap the benefits of it. I am wary of what you might call 'policy leeches'. They do not actually do the hard yards. If you go bushwalking and you collect a leech and take it to the top of the mountain, while you are doing the hard yards walking up the mountain the leech is feeding off your blood, sweat and hard work. Then, when you get to the top of the mountain, the leech falls off. You have done all the hard work to get there but it reaps the benefits of it. I am wary of that sort of approach to this great nation building policy. I commend the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy for his commitment in this regard, because I know that it will increase the nation's productivity in the years to come. The Labor approach is quite sensible. Some of those opposite have the approach to productivity that you just need to work harder, work longer and, obviously, cut the penalty rates. That is not the way forward. That is a simplistic approach to productivity. Productivity is a much more complicated beast. The Labor approach is much more compassionate. You work smarter and you support the community with an investment in that skills and resources, and that is what this NBN legislation will do for the nation. I commend the bills to the House. Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (12:10): It is important that we consider the bills before us today in context. We would not be debating these measures if the Gillard government were not embarking on the shambolic waste of money that is NBN Co. The whole Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency system was created as part of the government's backroom deal with Telstra to prop up NBN Co. It is yet another flawed component of the entire fiasco that is NBN Co. There are three bills before the House today. The first of these, the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011, provides the framework for the new USO system. The bill will create a new statutory agency called the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency, to be known as TUSMA. TUSMA will be responsible for entering into contracts on behalf of the Commonwealth for the delivery of public interest telecommunications services. These include standard telephone services, payphones, the emergency call system, and the National Relay Service. TUSMA will also be responsible for ensuring that voiceonly customers are migrated onto the NBN fibre network before Telstra's copper network is decommissioned. TUSMA will also be required to support research and development aimed at ensuring that public interest services such as traffic lights and public alarm systems can migrate onto the National Broadband Network with minimal disruption. Part 2 of the bill sets out the scope of grants and contracts to be administered by TUSMA and provides for the minister, subject to the scrutiny of parliament, to set the standards and benchmarks that will apply to contracts and grants managed by TUSMA. The agency will monitor the performance and compliance of contractors and grant recipients and will maintain a register of all contracts and grants. Part 3 sets out TUSMA's corporate structure, accountability, and reporting requirements. The structure of TUSMA will be a statutory agency under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. The minister will appoint a chairman and four to six members. In appointing TUSMA members, the minister is required to select candidates with a diverse range of skills and expertise, and TUSMA will also have a CEO and staff, who will be employed under the Public Service Act-even more bureaucracy and swelling of the Public Service. The government has chosen to introduce yet another duplication of services as an attempted solution. At present, ACMA oversees the USO and collects the USO levy. This system has worked reasonably well for a number of years, yet instead of utilising existing capacity within an existing agency, the government has seen fit to create a new bureaucracy with a new platoon of public servants. This new agency will have little incentive to keep expenses down, particularly as government funding for TUSMA is fixed, and any increase in costs will be borne by the telecommunications industry. Further, I have concerns about the associated costs of TUSMA. Under the new arrangements, TUSMA will receive government funding, with residual funding requirements to be met by a consolidated industry levy, which combines the current USO and NRS levies. The government has agreed to pay Telstra $230 million per year to provide standard telephone services and $40 million per year for payphones. Telstra will also be paid up to $20 million per year for the emergency call service. As part of the government's agreement with Telstra, the emergency call service will be put to tender within five years, but if no tenders are received, or none of the tenders are acceptable to TUSMA, Telstra will continue to be the emergency call service provider. On top of this, the National Relay Service contracts currently cost about $17 million per year. The government estimates that TUSMA will also spend about $15 million per year on migrating voice-only customers to the NBN and $20 million over two years on developing solutions for the migration of public interest services to the National Broadband Network. The government expects TUSMA's annual administrative costs to be approximately $5 million. This takes a total expected liability for TUSMA to about $340 million per year, reducing to $330 million after two years, including a component to cover the agency's administrative expenses. This is a significant increase in the cost of delivering the USO. the By way of comparison, Telstra received a subsidy of about $145 million to deliver standard telephone services and payphones in 2010-11. This increase in the subsidy provided to Telstra and the government's policy decision to expand the scope of services to be funded by the industry levy mean that telecommunications carriers will be asked to pay a significantly increased levy which, in turn, will be passed on to the consumer. After the initial two-year period, the government has committed to provide $100 million per year towards TUSMA's operations, with residual funding needs to be met entirely from the industry levy. Any increase in TUSMA's costs will flow through to the industry levy and ultimately to telecommunications consumers. Given this government's track record of poor and reckless financial management, there is little hope that costs will be contained. The coalition has concerns over TUSMA, particularly for regional access. We are also committed to ensuring that Australians in regional areas will continue to have reliable access to standard telephone services. To that end, the shadow minister will move an amendment to require the minister to obtain a favourable independent review of the quality of standard telephone services before being permitted to roll back USO regulations. This provision will ensure that an independent expert certifies that standard telephone services are of sufficient quality justify rolling back USO regulations. This amendment will add an additional safety net within the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Standards) Act 1999 to ensure that the USO regulations are not rolled back too soon. The coalition also has concerns about the scope for TUSMA's responsibilities to expand without reasonable basis. The government has indicated that TUSMA's budget funding will be set at $100 million per year. The residual requirement will be funded by the industry levy. This creates an incentive for the government to shift further responsibilities onto TUSMA under the guise of public interest telecommunications services, while shifting the cost from the government's budget onto the industry and ultimately the long-suffering consumers. They say that a week is a long time in politics-in the CIT industry we talk about nanoseconds. The rate of change and advances in technology and communication is breathtaking. We probably cannot imagine what innovations will be introduced in five years time, yet this agreement has a term of 20 years. In 20 years time there is a good chance that payphones will be obsolete, yet this government is committing us to a 20year agreement. Given this government's track record across the board, the cost of TUSMA has the potential to be yet another financial nightmare, with the real losers being ordinary Australians. Mr EWEN JONES (Herbert) (12:19): I rise to speak on the three bills before the House, the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011 and the Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill 2011. These are designed to ensure a smooth transition to the National to Broadband Network with respect to the universal service obligation. The first of these bills, the Telecommunications Universal Service Service Management Agency Bill 2011, creates the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency, TUSMA-so eloquently put by the member for Ryanwhich will be a statutory agency responsible for organising and delivering the universal service provision policy outcome in the telecommunications industry. The Telecommunications Amendment (Universal Service Reform ) Bill 2011 allows the minister to progressively roll back the current universal service obligation, USO, set-up as it becomes obsolete. The third bill in this package is the Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill 2011, which provides for a levy on the telecommunications industry to contribute to the costs of TUSMA. In a country as big and sparse as Australia, having some form of universal service obligation is vital to ensure that those living in the remote parts of our country are not punished for it with telecommunication services that are not up to scratch. Coming from a regional part of Queenslandalthough from a fantastic city, Townsville-I fully support measures that make sure this is not the case. At the moment, these provisions have been more than adequately provided by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA. While I recognise that the rollout of the NBN may require tweaking of this set-up, it is typical of this government that its knee-jerk reaction is to create a brand new bureaucracy to manage these provisions, which means brand new expenses for the taxpayer. The coalition is concerned about this expense, both the increased government spending in this area and the flow-on costs in the industry levy and the need for efficiency to keep this down. To deal with this, the shadow minister for communications will be moving an amendment to this bill that will require ACMA's annual budget to be cut by the amount of the new TUSMA administrative budget. This will not only avoid the duplication of costs that the new agency represents but also will provide the incentive for these costs to be minimised. Legislation With these bills providing for the rollback of current USO provisions, the shadow minister will also be moving an amendment requiring the minister to have an independent review of telecommunications services before this roll-back is allowed to go ahead. It is vital that this amendment be included to ensure that regional Australia is not left to suffer in the transition to the new USO framework. I cannot consider these bills outside of the context in which they are required, the transition to the National Broadband Network. As one of the first trials and rollouts of the NBN has been in Townsville, any bill that provides for this transitional period is extremely relevant to my electorate. To ensure that the NBN roll-out has been dealt with properly, and because of the lack of information we have been able to get from the NBN people, I sent out a survey to residents in Townsville who have been offered the service. I asked for feedback on whether or not they had chosen to connect to the NBN and why. I would like to take the opportunity throughout this speech to share with you some of the feedback that I have received from those people who have been so good as to return their forms. Overall, the responses have been quite mixed despite the fact that you might expect at least a broadly positive response from an infrastructure project carrying a $43 billion price tag. Of the roughly one third of positive responses, the regional biggest comment is of course the access to faster internet-it is what we all wantwhich has expanded the possibilities for internet phone services, movie downloads, and everyone in the family being able to make use of the internet at the same time. In particular, people have told me of how useful this has been for business and study. James Cook University have brought to my attention in the past the benefits that the NBN offers their staff and students. I had one letter from a lady who was very effusive. She said that it is the greatest thing that has ever happened to her family. She emailed me her response and she said that while she was doing this her son was downloading a movie, her daughter was supposed to be doing her homework on the internet simultaneously being on Facebook-fancy that!-and her other son was downloading music on iTunes. These are things that she said could never possibly have happened previously. She was most effusive in her support. The NBN roll-out has certainly not been without bumps, though. One problem that has been frequently mentioned is the difficulty connecting to unit complexes or blocks of flats. While taking into consideration that this was a trial and that they must have rules it still beggars belief that you would not want people living in a unit complex to have the same service as the people living next door. The guys-the people installing these things-are right next door putting it into a house but they will not put it into a unit. That was just one of those things that we thought could have been done better. The lack of information on this coming back from NBN Co. to the residents in those units has left a lot of people disappointed. Body corporates have had issues; they often do not live in the complex. There was also a consistent problem with a lack of information about how to connect to the NBN and what service and internet plans are available through it. Although a lot of these plans are from the providers and not the NBN Co. there has to be coordination of the two and a flow of information. A consistent problem all the way through has been that information was not all that great. Even many of those who want to connect just do not know where to begin. They are being given form responses and access to pages on the internet but those are very difficult for a lot of people follow. While many people have appreciated the fast internet access provided by NBN others have pointed out that their internet speeds have not been any faster than what they experienced with their previous set-ups. The while taxpayer is left paying for this huge infrastructure project to provide a standard of broadband already available through the private sector in most parts of the country. One gentleman actually took the time to come in and sit down and speak to me. He does CAD designs for buildings. He has to send 10 meg, 12 meg or 15 meg files of CAD drawings throughout the country. He is quite the tech-head-is that a term you can use in the chamber?-and he said that the best speed he could ever get on NBN, and he had signed up for the full thing, at any time of day was 62 megabits per second. And most of the time it was running at around 30 to 32 megabits per second. He also knew of people in Douglas, another suburb in Townsville, who are on ADSL2. They are consistently getting 30 megabits per second. Whilst he signed up for the trial he did not continue afterwards because the cost differential between the two services was just too extreme. If the NBN is supposed to be so great and you have so few people using it, surely there is something that they have to look at here. It seems to me that they are not listening to any of the feedback from the customers. Despite this government's insistence that the NBN will not be more expensive to consumers many people have come to me telling me that the prices are far more expensive than their current plans, or are just way out of their price range. This has particularly been a problem for pensioners living in the area in which it is being rolled out. One of the people who responded to the survey said that when they had signed up for the trial they had to sign a two-year contract with one of the internet providers. But two months in, the internet provider more than doubled the price of the access for the rest of the trial. Even though they had a signed contract for two years the internet provider said, 'No, that is not right.' The Telecommunications Ombudsman sided with the internet provider, sho said that it was not on that. a contract. That is the sort of thing we have to watch out for. Those are the sorts of problems we are having. One of the major pieces of feedback we have received has been about the decision by NBN Co to string cable overhead. This is occurring within 12 months of Cyclone Yasi. We have had the Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister in Tully. We have had the Premier up there. We have had all these things going on in relation to Cyclone Yasi and yet the NBN is being strung up from telephone poles. We have also had a larger number of people than would be expected complaining that rats and mice have eaten through the fibre optic cable, disconnecting them from the NBN. They have said that NBN Co. have come back and fixed it at no cost to the consumer but it is happening an awful lot. A number of residents have complained to me about the fact that the government apparently overlooked the risk of cyclones. They have expressed the concern that on top of the enormous expense of this project, all will take is a cyclone smaller than Yasi and not only will they be without internet and telephone services, but the taxpayer will have to foot the repair bill. I liken the way the government is marketing the NBN to the way a new car is marketed. It is all shiny and new and it should be fantastic. That is not my experience out there. If the government are to be serious about this national broadband network I think that they have to pull their collective fingers out, do some serious thinking on this and knuckle down to the job. The NBN say that it is about bringing people from the outside in yet they are running the optic cable past Julia Creek but not allowing anyone in Julia Creek to log on. It is a sin and they should be brought to book This whole thing is marketed as if it were a brand new car but it turns out that it might be the Lada Niva, the Mahindra or the Ford Edsel. It speaks a good game but just does not deliver. Across this survey you would expect that in a trial area you would have a great, positive response about how wonderful this thing is but we are just not getting it. For the amount of money we are spending on this thing, the amount of effort going into it and the amount of credibility the government is investing in it, you would think that they would be able to deliver 100 megabits per second to 1,000 people in Townsville. But they cannot deliver it. To use an analogy, if this were a car, there would be warranty claims on this vehicle forever, and they would not be accepted. They would have to get an extended warranty from another provider and try to get it fixed up by some bloke down the street. As a part of the coalition, I support the principles of the universal service obligation that these bills provide for. But the NBN it rollout is proving to involve expense after expense. While many Townsville residents appreciate access to fast broadband, our experience has continued to leave me sceptical that taxpayers, even those who already have the NBN, are getting anything that remotely resembles value for money.",62
31,Mr BALDWIN,BILLS," I rise today to speak on the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011 and associated bills. This package concerns Labor's National Broadband Network. Specifically, it establishes a new government agency to ensure that universal service obligations are being met. If passed, the legislation will take effect from 1 July this year. The universal service obligation ensures that all Australians will have reasonable access to telephone services, payphones and, of course, 000 emergency calls. It is vitally important, especially in regional and rural areas, where mobile phone coverage is not always readily accessible or reliable. Eventually, the provision of these services will be open to tender, which will be good news for customers, as competition often leads to reduced prices. However, a long term plan has already been signed by this government to have Telstra provide the service, and we the public do not have access to the price details-or any of the submission details, for that matter. This Labor government talks of transparency and then goes out of its way to hide the detail. Note that from the outset the coalition will move amendments to ensure that our rural and regional areas get a fair go here. We already know that Labor does not plan to deliver fibre-to-the-premises broadband to every home under its NBN. We need to be absolutely sure that people will not lose phone services under the switch, and before the USO is scaled back. In order to ensure quality, we believe an independent review should be undertaken when more than 10,000 voice-only telephone services are being delivered via the NBN. The review would need to consider price, quality of voice reproduction, reliability, repair time and convenience for customers. It would also need to guarantee that services were at least equivalent to that currently being delivered by Telstra over its copper network. In this way, the NBN would have some accountability on its services. People in rural areas rely on their telephones for communication, whether that be for safety, household services, work or simply entertainment. Taxpayers cannot be funding reduced services. Of course, it could be a fair while before 10,000 connections are actually made in this country. At the moment, we are five years into Labor's federal leadership and yet we only have a handful of internet customers under the NBN. The then Leader of the Opposition, Kevin Rudd, went to the 2007 election promising superfast broadband for the nation, to be paid for by taxpayers. Yet, despite millions of dollars having been spent, no such upgrades exist for anyone in my local area or indeed the Hunter as a whole. I remember reading a news article on 19 October in the Newcastle Herald, just after it was announced that Newcastle would not be among the first to get the NBN. The member for Charlton, Greg Combet, was quoted as saying: ""Given that this was a joint Hunter and Central Coast submission, and the highly competitive efforts to secure the NBN roll out, this is a good outcome for the region generally … So here is Greg Combet, member for Charlton, telling the people of the Hunter to be glad the Central Coast was getting the NBN. After all, the Labor MPs from around the Newcastle region campaigned for better internet services for local homes and businesses. We then had the member for Newcastle, Sharon Grierson, urging local businesses to work hard to make a good case to bring the NBN to Newcastle. In a meeting back on 1 September last year, she told business leaders that the NBN was vital for the region and that it was up to stakeholders to put together a coordinated tender that would convince the government to make the Hunter a priority. So all of a sudden the government has gone from, 'Elect us and we will deliver superfast broadband to your area,' to saying, 'If you convince us you need superfast broadband then we will consider rolling it out to you; otherwise, you will get services eventually-sometime over the next 10 years or so.' I would have thought fighting for the local area was the member for Newcastle's job as their elected MP. In truth, I would be lying if I said I was surprised. After all, Gillard Labor government had a choice between the Hunter, where it holds four very safe Labor seats, and the Central Coast, where it is trying desperately to save face thanks to the scandal surrounding the member for Dobell, Craig Thompson, who is accused of misusing union funds for personal purchases and procuring the services of prostitutes. What we know for sure about this Labor government is that we cannot trust the Prime Minister. After all, it was Julia Gillard, our Prime Minister, who said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' What we can be absolutely sure of is that this government will do whatever it can to stay in power. As Labor stalwart Graham Richardson so famously once said: 'whatever it takes'. That has become the Labor mantra This government's focus is firmly rested on its own political ambition, not the true good of our country. That is why Labor's marginally held seats, and those crucial to political survival, will be the first to get connected to the NBN. Back home in the Hunter region, where the average local Labor MP has a winning margin of around 16 per cent, there is simply no need for Labor to buy votes with an early installation of the NBN. I wish the member for Newcastle, Sharon Grierson, good luck on convincing her Labor colleagues to install the network in her electorate. But I know she has already given up, because she has been convincing local businesses to have a go instead. I keep listening to Labor spout about how the NBN will improve internet access for every Australian. But it is not every Australian-it is only 93 per cent. For many people in my electorate of Paterson, no fibre upgrades will ever arrive. Towns with fewer than 1,000 people, such as Coomba Park, the Boat Harbour, Pacific Palms, Gresford, Vacy and Stroud, just to name a few-in fact, most of the electorate of Paterson-will not get fibre-optic cable under the NBN. They have been promised satellite. But, instead of rolling that out now, Labor has said, 'You can wait until everyone else has it.' In other words, they are saying to the people, 'We in the Labor government don't really care about the other seven percent.' Well, the coalition does, and we will fight tooth and nail to ensure phone services do not fall into the same category. If Labor is determined to push ahead with its over-priced, underdelivered network, it has to benefit everyone who is paying for it. That is why the coalition has been arguing for a mix of technologies-cable, wireless, whatever is cost-effective and quick to deliver-so that everyone has a chance to improve their services as soon as possible. Our plan would have been delivered at a fraction of the cost of this massive white elephant that will kill its competition. Labor would have you believe we did not have an internet policy at the last election and that we had not taken any action while we were in government. But that is simply not true. ADSL2 was not even available until 2005, and as the technology took off we developed a policy to upgrade internet access for everyone as quickly as possible through a mix of technologies that would be affordable for the consumer. The coalition's OPEL plan would have been delivered by now, had the ALP not interfered. That plan would have cost the taxpayer just $958 million, not $50 billion, and residents in Paterson would have been among those to benefit from metropolitanequivalent broadband services. The coalition would have delivered 25 new WiMAX base stations and eight telephone exchanges upgraded to ADSL2 in my electorate alone. One of the beauties of our plan, which included a mix of technologies, was that people would have been able to access the internet while on the go in the electorate. With most people now owning an iPad or iPhone or an Android equivalent, they do not necessarily want to be tied to a fixed line in their home. While the rest of the world is going wireless, our government completely ignores wireless needs with its NBN. Affordability is also key here. Our own government studies show that it is the low-income earners who are least likely to have the internet connected at home. That means we should be trying to make it cheaper. But people are starting to realise that the NBN is not going to mean a cheaper service. It is going to be expensive for the taxpayer at a cost of $50 billion or more, and plenty of that has already been spent without much to actually show for it. For example, from June 2010 to June 2011 the number of NBN employees grew by 648, with each person's pay and entitlements costing the taxpayer almost $224,000. The NBN is also going to be expensive for the consumer. The government will be keen to recoup its costs, and since it has banned Telstra and Optus from providing voice and broadband services on their copper and cable networks respectively, it has cut out competition and will be able to charge high prices. A paper by telecommunications analyst Ian Martin has already shown that the NBN will have to boost its revenue, per customer, by 5.7 per cent every year, just to meet its corporate plan. I have not even mentioned that, despite promises by Labor that every major project undertaken would include a cost-benefit analysis, this, the biggest project undertaken by a federal government in Australia's history, has conveniently not been subject to such an analysis. Worse yet, all this spending does not necessarily mean that services are going to be better for everyone. When it comes to voice services, as soon as you start providing them with a fibre line, you cut off people's home phones every time there is a blackout. If your phone or internet goes offline, under the NBN, we also have no guarantee that it will be fixed in a timely manner, which can cost safety and productivity for regional and rural people. A number of my constituents in Dungog and Gresford could tell you what a big problem it is when you cannot rely on a fixed-line phone service or the internet. Janelle from Dungog contacted me last week about her phone and internet service, which still has not been fixed to this day. She has been told to wait anywhere between seven and 10 days for a reconnection. Meanwhile, other business owners in the area say they are losing customers because they operate their businesses online. That is typical of the many businesses in regional and rural areas, which have been able to use their internet and phone to bridge the distance gap. Yet, ironically, it is these same people who will not get any foreseeable upgrades because their towns are under 1,000 and they are covered by this government's plan. It simply is not good enough. The year 2007 was the year that former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd promised fast, reliable internet and phone services for Australians. Here we are in 2012, millions of dollars later, and nothing has been delivered. We are all sitting here waiting for fibre cables to be laid when we could have reliable services already delivered through a mix of technologies. I have a message for the government benches: people do not really care how they get quality services, as long they get them. These bills would not be before the House if Labor were not still pushing ahead with its over-priced white elephant, the NBN. While those on the other side of this House spruik the benefits of faster download speeds, most people have not seen any improvement in their internet services and will not get the NBN for another 10 years-and certainly noone in the Hunter region has access, despite their taxes going towards hefty salaries for NBN employees. As Australia and the world move towards a more connected society built around advances in telecommunications, it is important that we continue to upgrade services. However, with speed of delivery being a crucial factor for businesses and homes that need better internet speeds now, having to wait for cable to be laid some time during the next decade simply is not good enough. By upgrading internet through a mix of technologies, the coalition would have been able to deliver upgrades now. Yes, some people want and need speeds of 100 megabits per second, but some people, including many of my constituents in the Dungog area, Port Stephens, Great Lakes and East Maitland, just want an internet connection that does not drop out right when they are about to make a purchase, download a file or see the end of that movie. Through Labor's NBN plan, everyone will be forced to pay for a service that many do not want or need. I have spoken to people in Dungog this week and they are pleading with me to get an internet service that actually works-not an internet service with a 100 megabits per second download rate. The government needs to allow people to walk, not keep them locked up with the promise that one day-one day in the distant futurethey may be able to run. A universal service as obligation is important, but so is honesty and transparency in the timely delivery of services.",72
32,Mr CHESTER,BILLS," I appreciate the opportunity to join the debate on the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011 and related bills and, in doing so, I intend to focus on the need for further investment in telecommunications in regional areas to ensure that all Australians benefit from the rollout of new technology-and I hasten to add, old technology, because we still face the situation in many parts of regional Australia, including numerous locations throughout the Gippsland electorate, where relatively old technology, in the form of mobile phones, do not provide coverage to locals and visitors to the region. I have noticed that many regional MPs have taken the opportunity to speak in relation to the bills before the House, and I can understand why. It is because in regional communities we understand that the opportunities in terms of social growth and economic opportunities that are linked into making sure that our communities have good access to telecommunications technology make it such an important issue for us. And I congratulate the regional members who have taken the opportunity to participate in this debate. The Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011, which is before the House, provides a framework for the new universal service obligation, or USO, system. The bill, as others have said, will create a new statutory agency called the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency, to be known as TUSMA, with a review into the USO arrangements before 1 January 2018. I will not go into the full details of TUSMA's responsibilities because many other members have covered them, but I note that, in all, the total expected liability is in the order of $340 million per annum for the government to pay in subsidies to Telstra, which is a significant increase in the cost in delivering the USO. By way of comparison, Telstra received a subsidy of about $145 million per annum to deliver standard telephone services and payphones in 2010-11. As other speakers have indicated, the coalition strongly supports the USO. We recognise that the USO system is critical in ensuring that regional Australians remain connected and that subsidy is provided to assist in ensuring services such as payphones can still be provided, particularly in regional areas which lack mobile phone coverage, which I will get to in just a moment. I have spoken before in the House on the need to keep investing telecommunications services in regional areas. I note that the previous speaker made some very strong comments on the fact that, with the rollout of the NBN, there is absolutely no guarantee that many parts of regional Australia will enjoy the benefits but they will certainly wear their share of the cost of that expensive program. Many parts of my electorate do not enjoy anything like the level of service enjoyed by metropolitan areas. The second bill before the House is the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill. The purpose of this bill is to make consequential amendments telecommunication and other legislation related to the introduction of the TUSMA Bill. This bill contains amendments to the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act which would allow the minister to progressively move the current USO regulations for standard telephone services and payphones if the specified conditions are met and appropriate contractual arrangements are in place. The final bill we are considering is the Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill 2011. This bill is a procedural mechanism by which the levy is imposed on telecommunications carriers to support the operations of TUSMA. As I indicated at the outset, I want to focus my contribution on the need to ensure that regional Australians benefit from government investment in new technology. Given the level of subsidy to Telstra in the future to provide services such as basic phone services and accessibility to payphones, I intend to keep lobbying within the coalition and the current federal government for further investment in mobile phone coverage improvements throughout regional Australia. There are still significant in black spots in my community. I want to refer to the most recent announcement made by the federal government and the state government in Victoria in relation to a location based solution for emergency warnings. That system allows the authorities to send text messages to people based on the location of their mobile phone at the time of an emergency, whether it be bushfire, a major traffic accident or a flood event. Text messages give the authorities the opportunity to warn people of impending dangers but there are some very significant obstacles to overcome. Most significantly, I believe, some of the most bushfire prone and flood prone areas of Australia are also the areas to which have patchy, poor or non-existent mobile phone coverage. In my electorate that is the biggest challenge we are going to face. To be fair to governments of both persuasions, mobile phone coverage has improved significantly in the Gippsland electorate over the past 10 years. As I travel the region I am still aware of black spots which exist even on the main highway throughout the electorate. The development of the location based solution, which will be very important in emergency situations, is not going to assist local residents or visitors to them. to my region if they do not have mobile phone coverage. I believe we should be rolling out a mobile phone black spots program to accompany the rollout of this emergency warning system so that residents and visitors to our regional communities have access to that technology. I hasten to add that I support the based solution. It is very worthwhile technology and I understand why state and federal governments are investing money in it, in partnership with Telstra. We need to make sure that, in the rollout of this new technology, regional areas do not miss out. There is another aspect to this which I do not think has been recognised by the minister concerned. When we have such an increasingly connected community and an expectation that you will always be able to receive some level of coverage on your mobile phone or other technological devices, people start demanding this level of service wherever they are. We need to make sure that we do not oversell this particular technology to the community to make them think we can give them 100 per cent coverage, because we really do not want people to rely on receiving a text message or a warning for relevant authorities in times of a disaster. Nothing will ever take the place of people being prepared particularly in bushfire prone areas and making sure bushfire plans are in place. When you have people making decisions about where to take a holiday with their family, every regional area needs to have access to the technology which people expect. It is a significant issue, certainly in terms of the social benefits and community health and safety. There are also some important economic considerations to take into account when talking about these types of systems and regional communities' access I have a fear that when metropolitan based people, tourists, are looking to visit a regional location to take a holiday, they will become increasingly conscious of the technology provided there. Issues such as mobile phone coverage and accessibility to the emergency warning system will be a part location of the decision making process and communities without access to technology may be disadvantaged. It is so important that governments-the current Labor government or any future coalition government-are in a position to improve coverage in regional communities from social and economic perspectives. It has been three years now since the Black Saturday disasters. Images of the Black Saturday disasters portrayed very vividly in the media the damage and devastation, creating a great sense of fear among some people who perhaps do not understand the regional environment as well as others. With such an enormous tragedy173 people lost their lives and thousands of homes were destroyed or damaged-we need to ensure that people in metropolitan areas are not scared away from visiting our communities. Part of our challenge is to reassure them that it is safe to visit regional communities. One of the tools at our disposal in coming years will be the location based solution for the early warning system but it will work only if you can access technology right throughout regional Australia. The extent of the black spots across Gippsland is alarming and I would suggest in many other regional areas, including my neighbouring electorate of Eden-Monaro, where the topography is very similar with heavily forested areas. There are many popular camping and holiday destinations in remote locations where people will not be able to access mobile phone coverage or take the benefit of the early warning system if and when it comes online. I have invited residents in my electorate to tell me about black spots in their area. I am passing those on to the relevant ministers. I can give a sense of the concerns people are raising, and these concerns are very similar to mine. Sally and Craig in Devon North wrote to me: Our home was heavily impacted by the Black Saturday Bushfires. After the fires we had no landlines for well over a week and with such mobile phone service it was the cause of a great deal of stress, with a lot of family and friends having difficulty contacting us with such poor phone service. We would hate to have to rely on our mobile phones for emergency warnings etc. Graham in Bete Belong said: Mobile reception is non-existent at this address rendering the mobile early warning system proposed by the Victorian Government inoperable in our area which has a population of approx. 20 people and holdings of farm land. Many other locations in my electorate, some of them very close to major population centres in the Latrobe Valley such as Sale and Bairnsdale and others in more remote parts of East Gippsland or coastal locations, have similar problems. While many of them do not have large resident populations, they tend to be areas along the coast, often camping areas, which have quite significant holiday populations. I have urged the federal Minister for Emergency Management to undertake an audit right throughout Australia of some of these locations to get an understanding of exactly how many people are in these areas in the peak holiday periods and what we can do to allow them to access this emergency warning system, this location-based solution that has been promoted. I have urged the minister to get a better sense of the gaps in the current coverage. Finally, I refer to the contribution of the shadow minister for regional communications and associate myself with the concerns he raised about the bureaucratic, complicated and expensive model chosen by this government as it sets about building the National Broadband Network. I have just referred to the lack of rollout of mobile phone coverage to regional communities. Quite frankly, regional people have no reason to trust this government when poor it says they will benefit from the NBN, because they have seen throughout history how they have fallen behind in service provision, whether it be mobile phones or in this case the rollout of the NBN. I support the amendment circulated in an attempt to reduce the cost to the industry and also to ensure that TUSMA offers value for money to taxpayers. The government has failed to grapple with this concept of value for money. We have seen the home insulation debacle and the school halls program, but the Australian people expect us to spend their dollars like we would spend our own personal dollars. What they are seeing from this government just does not stack up. That is one of the biggest concerns about the NBN-people in regional Australia are concerned that they are not going to benefit much, if at all, and that may still be 10 years down the track, but their taxes are going to pay for it anyway. Some of them would be happy just getting a basic and reliable internet service and not the 100 megabits per second service being promised under the you-beaut NBN scheme. The government and the minister responsible misunderstand the level of angst in the community about this issue. Regional Australians are going to miss out on all the bells and whistles associated with the NBN but they are still going to pay their share of taxes to fund it. They have no reason to trust this government when it comes to value for money. That sums up the concerns throughout the Gippsland electorate. People believe the NBN is looming as an enormous economic white elephant and they fear that they are not going to share in the benefits but will fall further behind. It is not a question getting up here and being anti-NBN or anti new technology investment; it is a matter of making sure that regional Australians get a fair share and a fair go. That is all they ask for. As I have said, regional Australians have no reason to trust this government with their money or to accept reassurances about value for money from the minister involved. I believe all Australians deserve a good phone service and all Australians deserve access to high-speed broadband but I fear that will not be the case under the NBN. Every day it is becoming more apparent to me, as I travel throughout my electorate and as I receive letters back from the minister's office in response to concerns I have raised, that there will be a significant number of haves and have-nots when it comes to accessing the NBN. I fear that regional Australia will be at the back of the queue. Mr Bruce SCOTT (Maranoa-Second Deputy Speaker) (12:57): I rise to speak on the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011 and the Telecommunications (Industry Levy Bill) 2011. The Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011 provides a framework for the new universal service obligation. We have to make sure the service is adequately funded and that it will meet the needs of people. The notion that it is only rural and remote Australia that requires universal service provision is wrong. For instance, the payphones in some of the shopping centres in city areas are there to provide a service for those who do not have other means of communication. Quite often they do not pay, they are not viable-so these services are not just provided in rural and remote Australia; we often see them in our very big cities. Just of like railway stations and bus stops are essential, payphones are an essential means of communication for those who do not have access to other communications technologies such as a mobile phone. The bill will create a new statutory agency called the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency-to be known as TUSMA-that will be responsible for entering into contracts on behalf the Commonwealth for the delivery of public interest telecommunications services. This includes the standard telephone service, payphones, the emergency call system and the National Relay Service. Communications for people in Australia should not be considered a privilege but a right. Affordable communications should not be a privilege but a right. Access to basic communications technologies is a right, such as a clear voice signal on a telephone. I think increasingly we are going to have to look at how the USO will cover access to other technologies as they rapidly emerge. The universal service obligation is a vital aspect of our Australian telecommunications markets and every Australian deserves access not just to a basic clear voice signal on a telephone, so I believe we are going to have to look at the new emerging technologies, many of which are with us now such as iPads and mobile phones, and try to keep pace with the new developments, being technologies that universally people are going to want to access wherever they live in this vast land of Australia. Certainly the USO is primarily of great benefit to regional, rural and remote Australia. But, as I said earlier, it is not about regional, rural and remote Australia but about many of our capital cities. The coalition strongly supports the need for the USO. We need very strong legislation, we need to make sure that Telstra, which will be delivering this USO, are able to be funded adequately and also that they do deliver on the expectations of government and those on both sides of this House. The USO also provides for funding to ensure that payphones continue to be available. I know that in many areas of Australia payphones are diminishing especially, as I mentioned before, at bus stops, railway stations, street corners and other areas. But in many parts of my electorate, as you would be aware, Madam Deputy Speaker Livermore, if people do not have a phone at home-and some do not-they will use a payphone as they are of modest means and have opted to use just the public telephone when they need a phone, particularly as in so many of these communities there is not a mobile phone option. So the payphone is the only other telecommunication available to these communities. We have had pretty good arguments with Telstra from time to time about the removal from my electorate of some payphones, particularly from some of the smaller communities in the remote parts of my electorate, and they have said, 'Well, they're just not paying.' 'Well, that's what the USO is about,' I have said to Telstra. Telstra know they have got to maintain them-and that is fine-but I think this is important to some of those smaller communities where they have two payphones. What if they come in and take one out? What happens if that remaining one becomes inoperable? It might have been vandalised, although we do not see much vandalism out in the western parts of my electorate. But what if it is inoperable? Where would someone go? What if the just mechanism has failed? That is why you need the back-up of a second payphone, which should be considered part of the USO-and it is. So it should not always be that it has to pay its way, as Telstra sometimes tell me. It should be considered as insurance against the failure of the system, the other payphone. There are two more things. I want to give Telstra a bouquet and a brickbat as well. Let us start at the moment with the floods in my electorate, and this underpins the importance of good communications. My home town of Roma has had 300 houses and businesses inundated. In Mitchell, 80-odd kilometres to the west of my home town of Roma, 80 per cent of the homes and businesses have been inundated. The clean-up has started but the important point that I want to make is about Telstra CountryWide. This goes to one of the provisions which we as a coalition put in place to make sure that we had a face-to-face service with Telstra, which is the universal service provider, available in our country areas to be used rather than having to ring a 1800 number for a call centre somewhere in Australia or offshore to be able to access information when you have got a critical issue or you might want information about repairs and maintenance times as to communications networks in your area. The people in the Telstra CountryWide office in Roma are part of natural disaster relief and have attended meetings every morning or twice a day. I have to say this is one of the other benefits of having a Telstra CountryWide, a physical Telstra presence in these communities, not just throughout the year other than flood times or times of natural disasters but even more so in times of natural disasters. It is about that physical presence and of being able to have someone available within minutes to be able to talk to them and see what Telstra could do to make sure that communications networks remain up and running, because that is what is critical when it comes to saving property and also people's lives, and in some cases it could be the difference between life and death. So I thank Telstra CountryWide and I thank Telstra for the way that they have operated during our natural disaster this year, just as they did last year, in 2011, and the year before. My home town of Roma has had three such years in a row. Mitchell is similar. The other thing that I want to say is that Telstra CountryWide or Telstra generally have provided free, prepaid mobile phones to people who have lost connections. What a wonderful thing it is that they have provided those to those people who do not have a phone because it has been inundated with water or those people have had to be relocated to emergency evacuation centres. I congratulate and thank Telstra for that. I think they have also offered to waive any reconnection fees after people's homes have been cleaned up and to do any checks that are necessary. So once again this is about the importance of having Telstra maintenance staff on hand, so located geographically right across this nation, so people do not have to rely on perhaps a repair company or a subcontractor to come from a place remote from these communities. I thank Telstra for that. It is very much appreciated. I also thank the staff of Telstra Countrywide in Roma, Longreach and other parts of my electorate and all the maintenance staff who work beyond the call of duty during these times, and beyond. I often see them preparing lines that have gone down long after the five o'clock bell has rung, sometimes into the night. I thank those maintenance staff. It is about keeping the communication networks up and running in times of emergency. Last Friday morning, at 3 am, when houses were about to be inundated with water within four to five hours, the telephone was absolutely vital to making emergency calls to all of those farms in the predicted area of the flood zone. People could then start preparing to leave their homes or prepare their homes for what was expected to be a flood of 7.1 metres-within four hours it was revised upwards to over eight metres. Of course, that caused further devastation. As I said, I had a bouquet, but I also have a brickbat. The brickbat is that people in the town of Eulo in the far west of my electorate, on the Paroo River, rang me during the flood and said, 'Do you know that the connecting cable from one end of town to the other,'which had been running along the footpath as a result of a fire in the town last July-'is still running along the footpath and exposed above ground?' No, I did not know that. I rang Telstra Countrywide and they are going to get onto it as quickly as possible. But it flagged something that really concerns me. Why was the cable still on top of the ground? Telstra said a new store was going to be built and they would repair it then when the new installation was done. It really worries me that perhaps Telstra is not funded adequately or, through some of the cuts in its administration at the very senior levels, that maintenance is being compromised. The cables were burnt in July. Telstra had to run a temporary cable along the top of the ground in the street at Eulo. Now, in early February, with floods in the area the cable is still on top of the ground. It is not good enough. We are also working-and I am lobbying very hard-to see if we can get mobile phone coverage in that area. If that cable had been cut or vandalised there would be no telephones in the community because it is the main connector from one end of town to the other. The only other communication medium would have been mobile phone coverage. I will touch on one other issue: the government's announcement today of some $650 million to put two satellites into the sky by 2015 for high speed internet in relation to the NBN being rolled out to all Australians, including those in remote Australia. I am yet to see all the details of the speed that offered and I certainly look forward to seeing whether it really will live up to expectations. I only hope it does. The western Queensland communities in the Diamantina, Barcoo, Quilpie and the Longreach regional council have all been lobbying for funding to run optic fibre cable to build the backbone of the infrastructure into those remote communities. They had a quote recently from Telstra of $20 million to roll this out. They already have a partnership agreement from the state government to put in $2 million. The councils themselves will put in $2 million. I call on this government and the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy, to spend some of the money that was put aside for the Future Fund by the previous coalition government under John Howard, when $300 million was going to be earned every three years from the Telecommunications Future Fund to fund infrastructure, when the market fails to provide it. We have seen about $100 million of that spent. There is still $200 million to be committed. I call on the minister to put that money up now to assist those councils out in Far West Queensland, who are going to put up their own money as well as the state government's, so that we can build infrastructure and replace microwave links and single channel radio systems with optic fibre cable connections. It is all very well to give them satellite connections by 2015they have already had satellite coverage for internet access and maybe this will be faster-but I call on the government now to put that money from that fund towards that optic fibre network. (Time expired)",75
33,Mr HUNT,BILLS," The Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011 and related bills come in the context of a great national debate about economic responsibility and will be how we prepare for the future in telecommunications. We have on the table today from the government a system that does not represent the future. The future is the hand-held device. The future is the mobile phone, the iPad, the tablet and all of the successors with which we are each increasingly familiar. For political reasons, a hard wire system was conjured and imposed upon the Australian public at a cost that will be somewhere in the vicinity of $50 billion once all is said and done. It will be based upon money borrowed from future generations and it will rely upon the destruction of hard existing assets-the Telstra copper network as a functioning enterprise-and it will rely upon the destruction of competition through the most extraordinary effective renationalisation and removal of competition in the telecommunications sector in the developed world since the Second World War. It is a retrograde step in economic efficiency, competition and, above all else, in the planning of the right services for the future. This bill in part responds to one element of what the government has proposed for telecommunications and the National Broadband Network. We are not opposed to the elements here because they maintain the universal service obligation by essentially transferring it from a regulatory arrangement to a contractual arrangement. What is fundamental here is that for the interim, until the Australian people have decided, there will be the preservation and maintenance of the universal service obligation. If we are successful it will remain there under us for the next hundred years and beyond, I imagine, to the point where we cannot even imagine the telecommunications and communication devices and networks that will be with us. This is simply reaffirming but transforming the means of delivery of the universal service obligation. That is a given, a foundation, a recognition of something that is fundamental to equity and to the prosperity of rural and regional Australia in the 21st century. Those points we accept. I want to put that on the record, as one of a number of opposition members who are speaking and representing either rural or regional electorates-mine includes the Mornington Peninsula, Western Port and Bass Coast as the constituent parts of Flinders, which is officially recognised by the Australian Electoral Commission as a regional electorate. Having said that, I now move to the real delivery of services in the electorate of Flinders. Against that background, in 2007, when the OPEL network was being prepared, we set out a map of all those changes that would extend the service within the coming two to three years to those areas beyond the regional full broadband services within the electorate of Flinders. Essentially, almost overwhelmingly, we would have had coverage for those who missed out. I will not make a universal pledge, but it would have been extraordinarily close to universal within the electorate. Nothing has happened since. The OPEL contract was destroyed. The promised mobile services and the mobile broadband were crushed and there has been no replacement. Let me give a simple example. Only in the last week we received a letter back from Senator Conroy, the relevant minister for communications, about a desperate need in Rosebud for extra broadband communications for those premises beyond the reach of the local exchange. No date, no time, no pledge, no commitment, no hope and no imminent prospect for the future was given. So we are looking at it being more than a decade on from the period in which they otherwise would have received services before there is an imminent and reasonable prospect of the outer lying areas of Rosebud, through Waterfall Gully and the areas out towards Boneo and out past the Rosebud Country Club estate receiving adequate and appropriate services. Peninsula Sands in Rosebud South has poor internet access. It has poor mobile phone coverage. Four hundred residents have to date signed a petition calling for the situation to be remedied. It should have already been resolved, not recently but two or three years ago, and it would have been under the system proposed, pledged, committed to and contracted for by the previous government. That system was abolished and destroyed and the services are yet to arrive. Rosebud South, Waterfall Gully, Peninsula Sands, the areas out towards Boneo, parts of Red Hill, parts of Main Ridge and parts of the Korumburra Hills, so many different areas within the electorate of Flinders, are living testimony to the fact that they will receive the appropriate services-under the National Broadband Network, if they ever get it-more than a decade later than would otherwise have been the case. That is a failure of public policy. It is a failure of a practical system. That is before you even get to the massive cost of the NBN, the massive cost to consumers and the massive cost for the public debt, which will have so many other implications in terms of public borrowing and pressure on interest rates and will therefore impact on other elements of mainstream life in Australia. There is, of course, a better way. The better way is a plan that does not try to create a system that would have been an advance in the 20th century but has missed the telecommunications leaps of the 21st century. We should be working towards the world's best wireless network using the existing urban cabling systems of Telstra and Optus and the wireless communications systems with which the United States and so many other parts of the world are leaping ahead. Whether it is through microwaves, wireless or satellite, these are the systems of the future, when combined with a fibre-to the node concept. I am fortunate to have worked in this space during my time with MCKinsey. A decade ago it was obvious which way the world was trending. A decade ago it was obvious we were moving towards a wireless world. That was before the iPad and the tablet were imagined. These trends will only accelerate and it will be the compaction of data through wireless systems that represents the real future. That is the future and it is being completely and utterly ignored in the essential role of government and what it should and should not be doing. Having said that, I want to finish with the notion that the same problem is replicated in Botanic Ridge in my electorate. They have ongoing issues to do with their lack of ADSL capacity. We have made representations on behalf of residents. I am pleased that Telstra recently confirmed that homes in the southern portion of Botanic Ridge will get upgraded ADSL this year. It will not be the National Broadband Network, to the best of my knowledge, but they will get ADSL. We will continue to push until homes in the northern part of Botanic Ridge also have access to ADSL. In short, we should have solved this problem. We could have solved this problem. Instead, we are going to be wasting an enormous amount of money on a system that fails to imagine the future and provide flexibility for one of the fastest moving sectors in all of industrial and civilised history. This is the moment when the government should step back and recognise that what should be proposed is a flexible system focused on the world's best wireless rather than a system from last century that fails to recognise that we live in the world of the iPhone, the iPad and the tablet.",82
34,Mr RAMSEY,BILLS," I rise to address the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011 and associated bills. Universal access is of course an essential plank of the delivery of telecommunications services in Australia. By any standards, the National Broadband Network has been a troubled child for this government. While it assures us that it is a raging success, it was born out of the 2007 election commitment of $4.7 billion of taxpayers' money to build a network. When that proved impossible, it morphed very quickly into what is now expected to be a $50 billion project. There are already reported cost blow-outs and a reported lack of customers. To reflect on the words of the member for Flinders, who has just left the chamber, it seems that almost once a month we hear news from around the world of some breakthrough heralding a new wireless technology. The technology in this area is moving the quickest and it seems as though we are in the process of locking ourselves into something that is inflexible. One of the great criticisms of the NBN is its inflexible approach and the stubborn resistance from Minister Conroy to the delivery of the last mile of service by alternative means, because that is after all where the bulk of the enormous cost of the NBN rollout is to be found. This legislation is about the universal service obligations which, in large part, target the isolated and the disadvantaged in our community. I represent a fair proportion of those people in the electorate of Grey, particularly the Telecommunications in the modern world has become an essential service like education or health services, and that is as it should be. The universal service obligations are non-negotiable. This legislation is about fulfilling those commitments and its premise is well based. What I am unconvinced about is whether the government understand the challenges and whether or not they are truly committed to comparable services for all. Much of my electorate, in area at leastprobably around 90 per cent of its 904,000 square kilometres-will be left to rely on the old copper networks. Unfortunately, its residents are part of the seven per cent of Australia that will be bypassed by the biggest single civilian budget item in our history. They will not miss the account though: their share of the $50 billion that the government is putting on the slate for their children to pay. They will be responsible for the more than $6,000 a family. This seven per cent of Australia will miss out on the network. Instead, they will receive little improvement on current arrangements. I have grave concerns for those who will not be picked up in the fibre rollout. Previously in this place, I raised a number of these communities, but they are by no means a definitive list of those in the electorate of Grey who will receive a lesser service. Streaky Bay springs to mind. It is a community with over 1,000 residents, but it appears the government has no intention of running the fibre into Streaky Bay. I could sort of live with that if they would run the fibre as far as the outskirts of Streaky Bay, but they are not going to do that either. The residents of Streaky Bay will not receive a wireless service either; they will connect by satellite. For me, this is a very poor replacement for a good wireless network. Not very far away is Wudinna, which is straddling not one but two fibre optic cables isolated. that go to Perth, but they will not be offered the service either. Many other smaller communities, and by no means a definitive list, include towns like Elliston, Tickera, Marion Bay on the Yorke Peninsula, Point Turton and Booleroo all have mobile phone reception of some sort or other at the moment, and could possibly get onto broadband services with an aerial on their roofs. The monopolistic nature of the NBN prohibits mobile suppliers from marketing wireless services against the established NBN, whatever that might be, even though in many cases this will be the substandard satellite service. It is far from clear how the limitations on competition are likely to impact the delivery of services into these country areas, particularly as we realise mobile phone companies will be progressively rolling out a 4G service across the nation that will be capable of carrying much higher speeds and greater batches of information than the existing 3G. We do not know whether they will be allowed to roll out those networks, or even advertise those networks and tout for business, against satellite services. Others communities in my electorate have absolutely no mobile phone service-places like Oodnadatta; Blinman; Robertstown, which has a very patchy service; Marree; and any number of farm properties, including my own where I have no mobile service. Those communities and outlying farms will be left to rely on satellite services. Large parts of my electorate rely on the old Telstra radio telephone network, which is a string of microwave towers across station properties. It is 45 to 50 years old. It has no caller ID capacity. It is virtually useless when it comes to delivering broadband services. It was not a bad service in 1975, but the world has moved on and to my knowledge there is no plan to upgrade any of these services. So the question remains: what happens to these communities? The government said in the case of the NBN that satellite would be the answer, but what of voice services? That after all is the universal service commitment. I have had a little bit to do with using satellites over my time. I had a satellite broadband service for some time. In fact, my television is currently delivered by satellite. It works pretty well for television, I have to say, because, while the speeds are not massive, it is a one-way service-the information comes directly in a stream down from the satellite and you can, theoretically at least, run a movie on it. But, when it comes to two-way conversations, there is always a gap. Any of you who have used a satellite phone or watched late-night television when an interview is beamed in from around the world will have noticed that delay. That happens because the satellites are orbiting at 37,000 kilometres above the Earth's surface and it takes around 0.8 of a second for the signal to go up and 0.8 of a second for the signal to come back down again-a 1.6-second delay. That means it is a very scratchy voice service. If the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has plans in the future to deliver voice services on satellite, I think we have got a real problem. The answer to this-it would never have gone to all of Australia, though-is to invest more in mobile phone networks. The previous Howard government put aside $2 billion for a telecommunications fund which was to address the shortfalls within regional areas. Unfortunately the government has usurped that money and put it into the NBN process. At this stage, I do not see that the government is committed to increasing those voice services which would be delivered by mobile networks, which would then be capable of delivering better broadband services. The legislation is supposed to be about delivering a competitive environment for the delivery of these services, but in fact we find that the government has upfront awarded a 20-year contract to Telstra to maintain the copper network. It makes you wonder what kind of competitive environment this provides. It seems more like just part of the bigger deal, part of the arrangements to get Telstra to decommission the bulk of its network so that the government can build a new monopoly-the very opposite of what is happening in every other comparable country in the world. This arrangement to leave Telstra with a remnant of its former network has all the hallmarks of a nondecision, where the minister realised he had very little idea of what to do with regional and remote Australia, so it has been put into the too-hard basket and the government and the minister just hope that eventually all those consumers may just go away. But it is simply not good enough for us to be pushed to one side. What is needed for regional and remote Australia is a comprehensive, flexible plan which includes providing mobile phone services into towns like Blinman, Robertstown and Ungarra and encourages the operators to provide broadband services in that manner rather than restricting their ability to do so. The universal service obligations, under this legislation to be administered by a new statutory authority but provided by Telstra, in my mind fit very uncomfortably under the umbrella of the NBN, which was supposed to provide service for all Australians. Telstra, who will no longer own or operate a major network, will have the responsibility for maintaining a museum piece. One has to ask the question: who will have the expertise and equipment to maintain that network once Telstra have moved on to a completely different business focus? There seems to be no planned alternative-or will the government force consumers onto the satellite platform? I have said on a number of occasions that country consumers get very little out of the NBN. It will be basically the same as what they already have. It is a fast-moving world, and I have businesses come to me daily and say, 'We need to get onto this network.' They are upset that they will be given the opportunity to pay for the network but are going to miss out on what is to be the most expensive, overcapitalised, anticompetitive broadband project in the world. This legislation in itself is not bad-the idea that the government remains committed to the universal service obligation is goodbut I just wonder whether the government really have their heads around the issues, the difficulties, the challenges, of meeting that obligation in rural and regional Australia.",84
35,Mr COULTON,BILLS," I too rise today to speak on the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011. Despite whatever else is happening in this country at the moment, telecommunications is still the biggest issue that my constituents deal with. Only the week before last, I was speaking with the mayor and the general manager of a very large council in the middle of my electorate and asking them what their priorities were, where they needed the most help. I expected they might have said something about roads or health services, but they said, 'No. 1 for us, without any doubt, is telecommunications.' What is happening telecommunications and the way that this country is now going, with this very clumsy National Broadband Network, is that we are ending up with two classes of Australians. A large proportion of my electorate still do not have the basic service of mobile phone coverage. They have no hope of that changing in the near future. If you do not have mobile phone coverage, the National Broadband Network is not going to help you, because most of the data now that is received-by those that have phone coverage-is coming to hands-free devices: BlackBerrys, iPads, iPhones and the like. But if you do not have that basic signal then you are left out of the loop. One of the problems is that a lot of people own a phone but it does most not work where they live or where their business is. So customers or acquaintances will ring a mobile number, leave a message and think that they have made contact with these people. Quite often people tell me that when they go to town they will go over the hill where the phone coverage picks up and there will be 20 messages. I spoke to a small plant hire contractor in Coonabarabran a couple of weeks ago who was losing business to another town because his phone was not reliable. A customer had left a message on his phone requesting a quote for the hire of a certain piece of equipment and when the message finally came through, some three or four days later, the customer said, 'Well, you didn't get back to me so I went to Dubbo and hired the same piece of equipment there.' It is having a real effect on the way people do business, and it is not just isolated properties. Two kilometres from the middle of the town of Coonabarabran, where there is a large number of small rural holdings, there is no mobile coverage. In the village of Goolma, which is quite a small productive farming community, they have absolutely no with mobile coverage. There is quite a busy road there that connects a couple of regional centres. There is a lot of traffic and there is concern about road accidents. We are desperately trying to find the funds to build phone tower for the village of Goolma. I have organised meetings with the local stakeholders-the volunteer SU Association, the Rural Fire Service, the State Emergency Service, councils, the neighbouring coalmine and anyone else I can think of-who might want to contribute to this tower, because Telstra are saying that it is not viable and they will not pay for the tower. If someone puts up the tower they will fund the hardware on it. Can you imagine any one of my colleagues in a capital city electorate regional city electorate having to tell their constituents that they had to find some way of funding their own phone tower? It is absolutely appalling that in 2012 citizens of Australia are expected to fund basic infrastructure like telephone towers. Most of the issues with telecommunications I see on the television are people complaining because there is a mobile tower going up in their suburb and while they want perfect coverage they do not want to have the unsightly tower. I tell you, anyone here that has got that problem with a tower that is not wanted can send it to the Parkes electorate because I have got 100 places where that infrastructure could go. This hole that has been left behind will be filled by the NBN. One of the great frustrations, and I could not believe it was happening in 2008 as a newly elected member to this place, was to watch this House vote to remove the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund$2.7 billion that was set aside to fund towers exactly like the one I just spoke about. It is not as if the government does not know about this. To his credit, the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy, came to Hilmer and I think everyone who lived within 100 miles was at the town hall to greet the minister, and it was not to give him a pat on a the back-I can say that. But I give him credit for coming along. It is not as if the minister is not aware of this being a problem but he seems to be completely unwilling or unable to act upon it. With the NBN, most of the towns in my electorate will not get the fibre-optic cables; some will. The smaller towns are going to be delivered by wireless and while that is all right, it is not wireless that is going to your mobile device. It is wireless that is going to a fixed point in the home where you can then or a use a router to get it around to mobile devices. It not going to help the tradesman or the farmer who relies on mobile internet connections. Because we do not have the mobile service, they are going to miss out. I do not know whether people realise that when a technician comes to repair a tractor or a grain harvester the first thing they get out is a laptop, plug it into the machine and take a reading of what is wrong. The methods of repairing the machine are then downloaded to that mobile device. So we have a real case of haves and have-nots-of people who have the service and those who have not. That impacts on people who want to undertake education by remote meanspeople who might want to do a university not degree. If they do not have adequate telecommunications coverage they are left out of the system. It impacts on a whole range of things like that. The other thing that hopefully this USO will do is hang on to phone boxes. They might seen to be antique pieces-and I did see a humorous bit written in a Sydney paper where a young journalist had to learn how to use a payphone to make a phone call because his battery went flat-but the reality is that in towns like Goodooga, Boggabilla and a lot of other towns in my electorate where there is a low socio-economic level with a large number of the citizens, many people do not own a mobile phone. Most of them do not have the coverage, but if they do have the coverage they cannot afford the mobile phone. So they rely on the phone box to communicate. Travellers coming through who have a mobile phone that does not work in a regional area rely on the phone box for basic communication if they need to call for roadside assistance or something like that. While the focus of this place and this country seems to have been on ultrafast broadband and communication going forward, which is very important and very important to the people in my electorate, the great frustration for me and the people I represent is that they are largely being left behind. They have been pushed aside and they have not been included in this vision for connecting Australia to the 21st century. I find that a disgrace and a scandal. As someone who represents over 30 per cent of New South Wales, I find that completely unacceptable.",87
36,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Young, Mr Lamert Mrs GRIGGS (Solomon) (13:45): It is with sadness that I note the passing of Lamert Young, commonly known as Cyril. I feel very blessed to have known Cyril. I first met him on the campaign trail prior to the 2010 federal election. Despite Cyril's serious illness, he was always willing to give up his time for me to share some of his wisdom. He made an outstanding contribution to the Top End community. He spent a large portion of his time raising large amounts of money for charity and helping those less fortunate than himself. Cyril was a proud member of the Freemasons, the Country Liberal Party and the Northern Territory seniors association and was also president of the Royal Commonwealth Society's Northern Territory branch. Cyril was born on 17 February 1927 and passed away on 7 January this year. I am sure Cyril is up in heaven now, watching down on parliament with a smile on his face-he was an avid question time watcher. Our sincerest condolences go to Cyril's wife, Paula; his children, Jane and Chris; his sonsin-law, John and Mark; and his grandchildren, Alison, Alana, Daniel, Jeremy and Brandon. As is always the way, you do not miss your water until the well runs dry. Thank you, Cyril, for your guidance. May your memory never fade. Towns, Mr Zac",89
37,Mr LYONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to to be commend a very impressive young batsman in my electorate of Bass. His name is Zac Towns and he plays for the Riverside Cricket Club in the A-grade competition. His recent cricket accomplishments have been unbelievable. At the end of last year, during the Greater Northern Cup semi-final, Zac made an impressive 68 not out-a fantastic effort for a young cricketer. He also made 116 against Queensland in the under-17 competition. Zac is a special talent, and I am sure that he will be playing at a higher level in the near future. His unbelievable footwork and timing are a joy to behold. Zac represents an ever-increasing pool of talented cricketers that Tasmania is producing. I have no doubt that Zac will join the greats of Tasmanian cricket, such as David Boon and Ricky Ponting, to carry his bat at a national level. Zac is surely a future Australian cricket star. While on the subject of cricket, I would like to offer my congratulations to Launceston born Ricky Ponting on being awarded an AO and on his outstanding contribution with the bat in Australia's 4-0 victory over India in the recent test series. He will continue to play a pivotal role in rebuilding the current Australian test side. Kerr, Ms Nicole",89
38,Mr SIMPKINS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate my constituent Nicole Kerr, who is a resident of Wanneroo and was a student in 2011 at Woodvale Secondary College. Nicole distinguished herself in 2010-11 by winning the state's top vocational education and training prize: the Beazley medal. The award is the most prestigious prize for year 12 students in Western Australia. To win the award Nicole scored an ATAR of 90.45, which put her in the top 10 per cent of the state. She completed certificates II and III in business and certificates I and II in hospitality and also studied accounting and finance, English, ancient history and mathematics-all at stage 3 level. Nicole now hopes to continue her passion for numbers by studying commerce at the University of Western Australia. I have taken this opportunity to congratulate Nicole because I believe that Nicole is the sort of person that students in the electorate of Cowan and more widely in Western Australia should try to emulate. When I spoke to her at her home in Wanneroo she told me that the secret to her success was good organisation, of course, but also keeping up to date with her homework to allow plenty of time to study for tests as they came along. Congratulations to Nicole, and I hope other students in Cowan will follow in due course. Reid, Ms Valerie",90
39,Ms BRODTMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," It is with great pleasure that I rise today share with the House the outstanding contributions made by a wonderful woman in my community, Valerie Reid. Born in 1925, Valerie is the granddaughter of Robert Hayles, the founder of the pioneering Hayles Magnetic Island ferry company, which began in 1898 and over 80 years became a significant player in tourism in Queensland. After serving her country in World War II at 107 Australian General Hospital Darwin, Valerie returned to her life when in 1954 her uncle asked her to join the family business. However, Valerie found that her ambitions were never going to be accommodated in what was then a male domain. Her solution was to move to Canberra, and with the same pioneering spirit that had motivated her grandfather in 1898 Valerie decided to start a business. She submitted a tender for the first tourist launches on the newly formed Lake Burley Griffin. Valerie said that in 1965 it was not easy being in private enterprise and trying to work with the government. In fact, it took her nine years to get a liquor licence. Valerie's tender was successful and her business brought new opportunities to Canberra and the lake, which was quickly becoming a focal point in Canberra. She pioneered a new business and a new industry in Canberra at a time when having women in business was not an everyday occurrence. She is an inspirational Canberran. I was amazed to hear that she is off to Singapore this year as part of the 70th anniversary of the war. It will be a special trip for Valerie, whose husband was a prisoner of war. (Time expired) Gold Coast Airport Mrs ANDREWS (MCPherson) (13:51): The Gold Coast airport is the sixth-largest airport in Australia, with more than five million passenger movements, but it does not have an instrument landing system. It does not have a system that will assist pilots with to landing in poor visibility conditions. Other regional airports that have significantly fewer passenger movements than the Gold Coast, such as Cairns, Townsville and Launceston, already have an ILS, and some have had one operating for quite some time. The recent wet weather on the Gold Coast resulted in a number of aircraft go-rounds and diversions to other airports. There is obviously a safety concern here, as well as risk to aircraft and a financial burden on operators, because of aborted landings, gorounds, holding patterns and diversions to other airports such as Brisbane. Whilst I understand that planning is underway for the implementation of an ILS at Gold Coast airport and I am aware of the work currently being undertaken by Gold Coast Airport Pty Ltd and Airservices Australia, I call on the government to fasttrack this project. The Gold Coast is a major tourist destination, with the sixth-largest airport in the country. Our flight and passenger movements are increasing and will continue to increase. We on the Gold Coast deserve proper recognition from the government and we need world-class facilities delivered to us now. Automotive Industry Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (13:52): Today, in my capacity as chair of the Labor manufacturing caucus, I had the great pleasure of meeting with a delegation of auto workers from South Australia and Victoria-and I am pleased to see them here in the gallery today. These workers are lobbying all sides of parliament to tell of their deep concerns about the future of industry, their jobs and their livelihoods. Their No. 1 concern is the certainty around government policy. This is important because it dictates long-term investments in the automotive industry. That is in turn important because the automotive industry directly employs over 46,000 Australians and employs another 3,000 in research and development and, through the supply chains, over 20,000, keeping their families in a livelihood. Directly in challenge is the future of the Automotive Transformation Scheme, a scheme by which the government is providing over $50 million worth of a assistance to help the automotive industry transform and compete in a competitive international environment. This side of the House supports the scheme. The other side has said that if it ever gets to sit on this side of the House it will do away with the scheme. This is a dagger at the throat of the automotive industry. It matters not only to those workers directly engaged in the automotive industry but also to electorates like mine, where there is a steel industry that delivers about $1.3 billion worth of local steel into the automotive industry every year. It is a dagger at the throat of that industry as well. We call on those opposite to change their position. They have got it wrong. Ovarian Cancer",90
40,Ms ODWYER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Today I wish to speak about an issue of great importance to Australian women. Ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal gynaecological cancers, yet often little is known of it in our community. I am honoured to have been appointed as one of Ovarian Cancer Australia's national ambassadors. Last week I helped launch Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month with Ovarian Cancer Australia's patron, Nicole their Livingstone, and the board of OCA The awareness month culminates in Teal Ribbon Day on 29 February. Purchasing a teal ribbon or participating in an 'Afternoon Teal' will raise valuable funds for research into ovarian cancer as well as fund important support for women and their families. Over 1,200 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer this year. A staggering 800 of those women will lose their battle with the disease. The outcomes for women diagnosed with ovarian cancer are generally poor, as three-quarters of ovarian cancers are advanced at the time of diagnosis. Ovarian cancer does not discriminate. While having a family history of ovarian cancer increases your risk, 90 to 95 per cent of all ovarian cancers occur in women who do not have a family history. Ovarian cancer can occur in any woman, but the risk increases in women over 50 years of age. Alarmingly, 40 per cent of women incorrectly believe ovarian cancer has no symptoms. Because there are no early-detection tests it is often ovarian cancer is a silent killer. However, that is not the case. Ovarian cancer does manifest itself through a number of symptoms. I urge anybody who is interested in receiving further information to log onto my website or the Ovarian Cancer Australia website. O'Connor Electorate",91
41,Mr CROOK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Two weeks ago I travelled into the Great Southern and south-west regions of my electorate to meet with local residents, small businesses and community leaders about issues important to their region. Over the course of a week I visited the communities of Katanning, Kojonup, Boyup Manjimup and Bridgetown. In Katanning, I had the opportunity to visit the new sheep saleyards construction project, a $22 million project jointly funded by the state and the federal government. I spent Australia Day in Bridgetown-a cool 41-degree day!-where I had the opportunity to welcome new citizens Andrew and Sue Brown; their two young children, Sophie and Dylan; and their dog, Jasper, into Australia. I would like to extend a welcome to all new Australian citizens across O'Connor, across regional Western Australia and right across the nation. I would also like to thank Pat Scallan, the unofficial mayor of Greenbushes, for giving up his time on Australia Day to take me on a tour of his lovely town. Greenbushes is a particularly proactive regional town located just 150 metres from a major mining operation. I was particularly impressed with the Greenbushes Discovery Centre, an interactive museum with displays highlighting the mining and forestry industries in the south-west. I thank all the residents who took time to meet me and raise their concerns and issues with me while I thought that was in the area. Surf Lifesavers",92
42,Mr LYONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to thank those thousands of surf lifesavers who have so tirelessly and selflessly patrolled the beaches around Australia this summer. The hard work and dedication of those lifesavers around the country have kept safe the millions of people who visit our beaches. I would like to make special mention of the two clubs in my electorate of Bass, and they are Bridport and Launceston. I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate one member of the Bridport Surf Lifesaving Club, a club that is only two years old. This member successfully Brook, performed CPR in December. Over the summer, the Bridport Surf Lifesaving Club also recovered a beachgoer from an isolated beach and transported that person by inflatable rescue boat to an ambulance. On the same day they treated a broken wrist when another beachgoer fell off rocks. To add to the excitement, the following weekend the beach was cleared due to a shark alarm. This is an example of the hard work our volunteer surf lifesavers put into help keep our beaches safe. With the warm summer weather continuing, please remember to swim between the flags. Macarthur Electorate: Christmas for the Troops",92
43,Mr MATHESON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I would like to publicly thank the Macarthur community for its outstanding contribution to this year's Christmas for the Troops campaign. Boxes of donations were dropped off at my office in Camden to send to Australian troops serving overseas during the Christmas period. The parcels were sent to Aussie soldiers, sailors, airmen, airwomen and explosive-detection dogs. Locals donated completed care packages and items to be put into care packages, which were all sent to troops serving in the Middle East, East Timor and the Solomon Islands, just in time for Christmas. To most Australians, Christmas is a great opportunity to spend time with our family and friends. This is why, with the help of the local media, I encouraged residents in Macarthur to spare a thought for the Australian troops serving overseas who would not be with their families this Christmas. My father served in Vietnam, so I know all too well what it is like to have a loved one out of reach during those special times of the year. We also have many troops from the Macarthur region currently serving overseas, so it was important that we show them support at this time. I think it is fantastic that Australia Post bereavement. allows everyday Australians to send parcels to our troops serving overseas, free of charge. It is a great example of the Aussie spirit when strangers send comfort food, magazines, toiletries, socks, DVDs and letters of support to our troops. Seeing so many donations come into my office made me feel very proud, not only to be the son of an Australian veteran but also to be an Australian and a member of the Macarthur community. I thank everyone who donated items for this year's appeal and look forward to coordinating this campaign from my office again next year. Twenty20 Cricket",93
44,Mr LYONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I would like to congratulate the Tasmanian Twenty20 cricket team for their inaugural interstate competition success. They are a fantastic Tasmanian cricket team and they are really building. It is just amazing to see George Bailey, the captain of the Australian Twenty20 side, coming from Tasmania.",93
45,The SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Order! In accordance with standing order 43, the time for members' statements has concluded. NA Cowen, Sir Zelman, AK, GCMG, GCVO, QC Report from Main Committee Order of the day returned from Main Committee for further consideration; certified copy of the motion presented. Debate resumed on the motion: That the House express its deep regret at the death on 8 December 2011 of the Right Honourable Sir Zelman Cowen AK, GCMG, GCVO, QC, a former Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia from 1977 to 1982, place on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their The SPEAKER (14:00): The question is that the motion moved by the Hon. Prime Minister be agreed to. As a mark of respect, I ask all present to signify their approval by rising in their places. Question agreed to, honourable members standing in their places. NA Australian Natural Disasters",93
46,Ms GILLARD,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," On indulgence, I believe it is appropriate for the House to mark the fact that it is one year since this House spent a of time sending its condolences to the people of Queensland and also to people of other parts of our nation that had suffered during the summer of natural disasters, not only through the flooding that hit Queensland but the cyclone, the flooding that hit other parts of our country, and of course there were also devastating bushfires in Western Australia. Communities across the particularly in Queensland, have been marking the one-year anniversary of these events. I had the privilege of attending the commemorative event in the Lockyer Valley. It was also attended by Her Excellency the Governor General, Her Excellency the Governor of Queensland and Premier Anna Bligh. I had the opportunity to attend, along with my parliamentary colleagues the members for Blair and Oxley, the event in Ipswich, where what was unveiled was a flood marker in one respect, but it was appropriately referred to as a 'pillar of courage' to mark the way that that community had pulled together. In both of those communities, of course, the local leadership, by Steve Jones in the Lockyer Valley and by Paul Pisasale in Ipswich, was very important to how those communities got through. I acknowledge that members on the other side of the House were also with us for those events and thank them for that. Having attended those event, I had the opportunity to reflect a bit on how people are feeling. When you went to those commemorative events you met some people who wanted a moment to reflect but who are getting on with their lives. You met some people for whom the pain is so raw it is as if it happened yesterday. Perhaps most disturbingly of all you heard the stories of some people who could not actually make it to the event, who had the intention of going but then could not get there because they are not quite ready to take their grief to a public lot place yet. So there is a lot of hurt around still. When we met here a year ago we said we would not forget. Today is one time when we can say again that we are not forgetting and we will not forget. As we reflect on those events, our thoughts are with those around the country, particularly in Queensland and northern New South Wales, who are battling nation, floodwaters even now.",93
47,Mr ABBOTT,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," In rising to support the remarks of the Prime Minister, I know I speak for my colleagues the member for Wright, the member for Groom and the member for Leichhardt, and I think I may also presume to speak for the member for Kennedy on this matter, in honouring all who were the victims of the floods and cyclones a year ago. The physical scars of flood and storm can quickly heal, but the mental scars, as the Prime Minister has just indicated, can take much longer. I know that for the people of the Lockyer Valley in particular the events of 12 months ago will always be with them, and all of us in this place need to be with them on the difficult journey that they will have in the months and years to come. There were many victims of those terrible events 12 months ago, but for me one stands out-the young boy Jordan Rice. It is my hope, if I may express it, that this could be a lasting memory of that inland tsunami: the sacrifice that a small boy made for his brother. That may be one way that we can draw some inspiration from what was otherwise just a terrible tragedy.",94
48,The SPEAKER,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE,I thank both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition for their moving words. NA Carbon Pricing,94
49,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the multiple job losses already announced this year from Westpac, the Royal Bank of Scotland, ANZ, Holden, Toyota, BHP, Reckitt, Manildra, Norsk Hydro, Tomago Aluminium and Thales, and I ask: why did the Prime Minister describe these losses as growing pains, and isn't this more evidence that this is the worse possible time to introduce the world's biggest carbon tax?",95
50,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," What I would say to the Leader of the Opposition is that at a time when there are workers in some sections of the economy who are losing jobs it is incumbent upon us to understand why that is happening and to respond, not to make up reasons in the way that the Leader of the Opposition is making up reasons. Can I particularly say I was disgusted this morning to see the opposition trying to use job losses at Alcoa to continue its fear campaign on carbon pricing when the CEO of Alcoa made it absolutely clear that this was not to do with carbon pricing. What sort of people would use the distress of working people, on hearing about job losses, for their own political ends? And we saw that done by the opposition this morning. We are in economic times when our economy is strong. We came out of the global financial crisis strong. We came out of it strong because of the way in which we invested in the economy, an investment that was opposed by those opposite, who did not care about jobs then. We saved 200,000 jobs and have unemployment at just over five per cent. Yes, there is structural change occurring in our economy because of the strength of the Australian dollar and because economic weight is moving into our region, which will drive a different pattern of demand for Australian goods and services. Then there are the structural changes that are necessary to take us to a clean energy future and to get us the best of technology. And where does the Leader of the Opposition sit as we go through this period of change? Opposed to jobs.",95
51,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on direct relevance. Why did the Prime Minister describe these job losses as growing pains? These are real people and she ought to answer that question.",95
52,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. I am listening very carefully to the answer being given by the Prime Minister. She is addressing the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition.,95
53,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition is referring to a speech that I gave on the economy. He is trying to twist words and take them out of context. Every time. I hear about job losses in this country, I am concerned; every time the Leader of the Opposition hears about job losses, he works out how he can use that to his political advantage-just like he did this morning with Alcoa, a disgusting approach at a time when working people are in need and under pressure. It is a disgusting approach. The Leader of the Opposition's plan for the economy is to not support jobs in car manufacturing, to not support jobs across the economy and to keep our economy at a standstill so that we miss out on the opportunities of the future. We on this side of this parliament are determined to make sure that we support working people today and get them great opportunities in the new economy that we are building for our nation's future. Automotive Industry",95
54,Mr CHAMPION,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. How is the government building Australia's future through the car industry?,96
55,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I had the great privilege this morning of meeting people who work in the car industry, and they are present in the gallery now. I welcome them to this parliament. They came to parliament to talk about the future of their industry and its importance to the Australian economy. There is a lot of nonsense talked about the car industry in the public domain, some of it in the pages of our newspapers and some of it in this parliament. There is a lot of nonsense suggesting that the car industry is somehow part of our past. It needs to be part of our future. The member for Wakefield, who asked me this question, knows that very well from his local experience in his electorate, where car marking is very important. Australians want to see us continue to make cars. They want to see the iconic brands like Holden and Ford still in this nation. In order for that to happen, we need to recognise that the car industry is at the forefront of innovation. The car industry is a high-productivity, high-skill industry. It needs to compete in the world and with the dollar as strong as it is at the moment that a very difficult thing to do. It needs government to work in partnership with the industry to make sure not that there is no change-because we cannot guarantee no change and we cannot guarantee every job, either-but that we are a country that still makes cars. I am determined to do that, not only because 46,000 Australians rely on the car industry for their employment but because, when you go through the supply chain, around 200,000 Australians rely on that industry. When you look more broadly, a million Australians work in manufacturing, and what is done in the car industry is important to manufacturing around the nation. Whether it is technology such as robotics going elsewhere or whether it is skill sets going elsewhere, this industry is important to the jobs of a million Australians. Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition was channelling Dirty Harry. Perhaps he should recognise today that Clint Eastwood, who gave Dirty Harry to the world, is out there supporting the American car industry. What the Leader of the Opposition should be saying of order on relevance. The Prime Minister was not asked about the Leader of the Opposition's position. She was asked about the government's position.",96
56,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will return to the substance of the question and be directly relevant.,96
57,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I was asked about the future of the car industry. Let me conclude by saying that we stand for a future for the car industry in this country. The Leader of the Opposition stands for doing the dirty on the car industry and ending car manufacturing jobs.,96
58,Mr CHAMPION,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," is Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. The Prime Minister was talking about the government's manufacturing policies. Can she outline how they might affect local communities in Salisbury, Elizabeth and Gawler and perhaps what the alternative policy approaches are?",96
59,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The supplementary question is in order if the honourable member is referring to car manufacturing.,96
60,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Wakefield for his supplementary question. He is concerned about the future of Holden because of its importance to his local communities. When we met today and talked to the car industry workers who are in the gallery, I met with Michael Etherington from Holden, who spoke about the importance of Holden to the future of suburbs like Salisbury and Elizabeth, which the member for Wakefield represents in this parliament. I want those communities to have a future. I want them to have a future that includes car making and those high-skill, high-wage jobs in their local community. That is why I am determined that the industry has a future in this country. That is why it is so devastating that the opposition is robbing this industry certainty and therefore robbing these workers of jobs. I invite my Labor colleagues to look up at the workers in the gallery, confident in the knowledge that we are working to support their jobs. I invite the opposition to turn around and look in the eyes of those workers whose jobs they are setting out to destroy. Employment",96
61,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to his statement last year that the budget was about jobs, jobs, jobs. Given that 2011 was the first year in 20 years when Australia had no net jobs growth, given that he has now admitted that his estimates in the budget on job creation were dead wrong, will the Treasurer now admit that the carbon tax will cost Australians jobs, jobs, jobs?",97
62,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question because there is nothing more central to the Labor Party purpose than jobs. They go to the very core of the quality of life and the security families. We understand that and, because it is based on our values, we put in place the response to the global financial crisis and the global recession which protected jobs in this country. On this side of the House, we understand how damaging high unemployment can be, what it does to our skills base and how it destroys communities. There is nothing more central to us, as a Labor government, than creating prosperity, which generates jobs and spreads opportunity to every corner of our country. There is nothing we are more proud of than the fact that we have unemployment at 5.2 per cent. If those opposite had been in power three years ago, it would have gone through the roof and great parts of this country would have experienced very high of unemployment. Because of our concern for jobs, we acted swiftly. We got the big economic calls right and now we are entering a new phase in our economy, as the Prime Minister was saying before. We have low unemployment but there is pressure on our economy. A higher dollar is causing stresses and strains across a number of sectors of our economy. We understand it is our responsibility to work with industry, to work with local communities, to work our way through these issues. We are committed to an auto industry in this country but we also understand that it faces great challenges in terms of global demand, challenges in terms of competitiveness because of a higher dollar. We also understand that there are challenges in tourism, education export and so on, but we are planning for the future. We are putting in place the reforms which will make our industries competitive. One of the things I cannot understand when we get this question from the shadow Treasurer is that we are about to bring in a substantial tax cut for 2.7 million small businesses to make them more competitive of and they want to stop it. But it is worse than that. They want to give a tax cut to Clive Palmer and Gina Rinehart-just one example of the twisted priorities of those opposite. We on this side of the House are committed to a competitive Australia, one which creates jobs with decent and fair working conditions and one which provides opportunities to our children and our grandchildren. Broadband",97
63,Ms BIRD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister outline the next steps in providing high-speed broadband to all Australians through the National Broadband Network?,98
64,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Cunningham for her question. In this parliament she represents a community which knows what it is like to undergo structural change, a community that is working together understanding that there are some job losses in steelmaking which they need to confront but a community which is fighting back and making sure it has a plan for its economic future. Making steel will be part of that economic future but I know her community is looking forward to the benefits that the National Broadband Network can and will bring to businesses in her electorate, increasing their productivity. That is because people in her electorate and people right around the country get the common sense proposition that we as a nation cannot compete if we are using yesterday's technology. We have a great resources sector, but imagine if it were trying to compete in the world using picks and shovels instead of forefront technology. Imagine if manufacturing were using hand tools instead of robotics in the forefront of technology. course they would not be able to compete. What is true for an individual business is true for our whole nation. We need to have the best of technology to be able to compete in the world, which is why we are determined to roll out the National Broadband Network to ensure Australians get the benefits of the best of that technology and that we do not fall behind the standards of the world. The 100-year-old copper wire network has done very well indeed but it will hold us back in the future. It does not have the capacity to do what we will need to do in the future. If anyone doubts the benefits to productivity of having the kind of ICT which broadband can bring, what we know from international experience is that 70 per cent of product innovation is linked to ICT and 73 per cent of process innovation in manufacturing is linked to ICT. We need those benefits here. Today we have made an important announcement about how Australians who live in the most remote parts of our country will get benefits too in terms of faster technology. We have announced that we will join with NBN Co. and Space Systems/Loral in putting up two satellites which will improve services for Australians who live in the most remote places. We do not want to see them left behind. We want them to get a better service and to pay the same uniform wholesale price as Australians in other parts of the country. This is a vital step in moving us to the new technology we will need for our future economy. (Time expired) Carbon Pricing Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (14:21): My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer the minister to reports that the Chinese government has told the European Union that it will not pay a carbon levy on Of emissions from Chinese airlines flying to Europe. What representations has the minister made to ensure that Australian airlines are also exempt from payment of the EU carbon levy?",98
65,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. This EU policy has been around for some time. The same issue is one in which I, the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, Minister for Trade and other ministers of the government have robustly engaged the Europeans on. We will continue to make those representations. We are acutely mindful of the dependency of this country and its tourism industry on long haul civil aviation. We will be out there defending the Australian national interest. Economy",99
66,Mr SYMON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Treasurer. How is the government supporting economic growth to benefit all Australians?,99
67,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Deakin for his question. This side of the House does understand the challenges that we face in this country from what is going on in the global economy. We have acted in the face of global uncertainty to get the big economic calls right. As a consequence, we have supported growth and jobs and we are putting in place all of the tough measures that are required to ensure that continues, including bringing our budget back to surplus. Indeed, today we introduced the mid-year budget review bills into the House to achieve that purpose. We on this side of the House are putting in place the important reforms to secure future prosperity; for example, investment in skills and infrastructure and investment in the NBN, which the Prime Minister was talking about today. These are opposed by those opposite. We are introducing a carbon price because we understand that no first-class First World economy can continue to be like that unless they are substantially powered by clean energy. That is, once again, opposed by those opposite. We are spreading the benefits of the mining boom and, in particular, giving some tax relief to small business and other corporates because we the understand the pressures in the economy. Most importantly, we are bringing our budget back to surplus because we expect growth at trend. Today, and in the past week, I think we have seen the worse we could possibly see from the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance spokesman. They are the 'Three Stooges' of opposition economic policy. Today we have had the classic of order going to relevance. Mr Speaker, I would ask you to draw the Treasurer back to the question and stop the 'slag and bag', which I had hoped would end under your Speakership.",99
68,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Treasurer is being directly relevant to the question; however, it would assist the chamber if he withdrew the inappropriate references he made to a number of opposition colleagues.",99
69,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Certainly, Mr Speaker. Bringing the budget back to surplus is absolutely important. Opposition members: Withdraw!",99
70,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do withdraw. Bringing the budget back to surplus is critical. We have a commitment to bringing the budget back to surplus. But the opposition leader today walked away from that idea and scrapped his commitment to returning to surplus. We had the opposition finance spokesman do the same a couple of days ago. What is more extraordinary is that we have found out why. Why are they walking away from that commitment to surplus? They are doing it because the shadow Treasurer said there is a $70 billion crater their budget bottom line. It is that big. We have had some progress from the shadow Treasurer on this today. He has been running around the country insisting he never said it was $70 billion, despite the fact that it was there on Sunrise. It is there for everybody to see, but he has been running around the country saying that he never said it. Today on radio, this is what he said: 'Okay, I shouldn't have said it.' The extraordinary thing about that is he does not know that that is not the problem. The problem is: how did they get to $70 billion in the first place? many commitments have they made that cannot be funded? The truth is that their numbers do not- (Time expired.) Member for Dobell",99
71,Ms LEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to freedom of information documents that reveal collusion between the then Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations' office and Fair Work Australia in the media management of inquiry into the member for Dobell, and which end with the statement: Thanks, that's awesome should minimise any run it gets in the morning. Will the Prime Minister immediately release all communication between her government and Fair Work Australia in relation to this matter?",100

74,Mr Albanese,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I rise on a point of order: the assertions made at the beginning of that question should be ruled out of order.",100
75,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no point of order because the office of the minister is not in protected by standing orders in the same way as the minister would be. Consequently, because there was no assertion made against the minister, the question is in order.",100
76,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, What I would say in response to the question is that no amount of dramatic flourish is going to change the facts here. The facts are that the opposition are trying to reheat very old news because they have nothing to say about the economy. They have nothing to say about jobs. They do not want to talk to these car industry workers How and explain how they are going to destroy their jobs. They cannot explain their $70 billion black hole. They cannot explain when the budget would come back to surplus under them. Mr Simpkins interjecting,100
77,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable member for Cowan, if he does not",100
78,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They have walked away from their promises of tax cuts. I refer the House toMr Simpkins interjecting,100
79,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Prime Minister will resume her seat. I want to deal with the honourable member for Cowan, who will remain silent.  Minister was asked whether she would immediately release all communications between Fair Work Australia and her government. She was not asked about any other matter and everything else she is talking about is straying from the question she was asked.",100
80,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will be directly relevant to the specific question.,100
81,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and in relation to what was a question with a very broad range of adjectives in it, I would refer the House to Hansard of Wednesday, 19 October last year where this matter was fully canvassed and fully answered by Senator Chris Evans. I would also say to those members opposite who want to deal with these matters-I say this because they are incapable of dealing with any of the public policy challenges that our nation faces-that, as I said yesterday, they can hardly come into",100

84,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The opposition can hardly come into this place one day saying to direct Fair Work Australia to get this inquiry done and then the rest of the time complain about its fanciful allegations that the government is somehow intervening in this Fair Work Australia investigation. Fair Work Australia is an independent authority going about an independent investigation. It is time that the opposition stopped this muckraking, particularly when they are unable in the court of public opinion to answer basic questions like when a budget would come to surplus under them. Five years away, according to the shadow minister for finance. How big is their black hole: $70 billion. What is it going to cost working people when they slash services to try and fill it?",101
85,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will return to the substance of the question and will be directly relevant.,101

87,Mr KATTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question without notice is to the Treasurer. Section 10 of the Reserve Bank Act states that the bank pursue policies that 'best contribute' to the maintenance of full-time employment in Australia and the 'economic prosperity' of the Australian people. In light of this and yesterday's decision which will price more Australian goods and services off the world market, would he not agree that the continuation of this fight-inflation-only policy will jeopardise hundreds of thousands of jobs in tourism, manufacturing, agriculture, retailing and base metals? In light of the prevailing rates in the US, 0.13 per cent, Japan, 0.05 per cent, and the EU and Canada, one per cent, could he assure the Australian people that it will be pointed out to the RBA that continuing with a four per cent",101

91,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Kennedy will not continue to have the call if he makes those comments. The member for Kennedy will conclude his question.,101
92,Mr KATTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In light of the prevailing rates in the US, 0.13 per cent, Japan, 0.05 per cent, and the EU and Canada, one per cent, could he assure the Australian people that it will be pointed out to the RBA that continuing with a four per cent-plus rate is contrary to their charter and is a policy that has already driven the dollar from US60c eight years ago to US$1.10 today?",101
93,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I now call the honourable Treasurer and I suspect the member for Kennedy will understand that I gave him some benevolence.,101
94,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Kennedy for that very important question, because he, like me, is a great fan of the late Ted Theodore, who was one of the early Keynesian advocates in this country and was indeed a former Treasurer of this country. Ted Theodore believed in appropriate fiscal and monetary policies that worked together to support employment and to support jobs and to support economic prosperity. One of the reasons we moved like we did through the global financial crisis and the global recession was to stimulate our economy through appropriate fiscal policy and appropriate monetary policy through the independent Reserve Bank. The consequence of that is that Australia is one of the strongest developed economies in the world, if not the strongest, according to the IMF. But you cannot be Keynesians on the way down and not be Keynesians on the way up, and our current policy settings, our fiscal policy settings and our monetary policy settings, reflect the strength of our economy relative to the rest of the world. As for those countries that the member for Kennedy referred to, where he talked about low interest rates, those are countries which have very, very high levels of unemployment and they have very big problems in terms of sovereign debt. We do not want those problems in this country. We have not got those problems in this country because we have deployed fiscal and monetary policy in an appropriate way. Indeed, if you look at the reports from the IMF, the OECD and the World Bank, they have all made the point that in Australia the deployment of monetary and fiscal policy has been the most effective in the Western world. The consequence of that is a rate of interest that some people may feel uncomfortable with, but could I make this point. The cash rate in this country is currently 4.25 per cent and when we came to office it was 6.75 per cent. And, of course, if you take a $300,000 mortgage, that is a saving of $3,000 per year for a family with that mortgage. What we must do is dedicate ourselves to taking every responsible step to keep pressure off inflation so we can keep rates down. The most important thing that we have got to do to generate jobs in this country, to generate wealth and to spread the opportunities around the country is to deploy our fiscal policy appropriately, and that is what the government is doing by bringing the budget back to surplus, and the independent Reserve Bank will take its judgments from time to time on monetary policy. We had two rate cuts at the end of last year and they were welcomed. Yesterday the Reserve Bank decided they would hold, but they did make the point that if further cuts were required there was room. Why? Because of the appropriate fiscal policy that the government has in place right now, which has received a big tick from the IMF. (Time expired) NA The SPEAKER (14:36): I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a parliamentary delegation from Samoa led by Deputy Prime Minister Fonotoe. On behalf of the House I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. Honourable members: Hear, hear! NA Manufacturing Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (14:36): My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, and Minister for Industry and Innovation. Minister, how is the government ensuring that Australia has a strong manufacturing industry that creates jobs and builds the economy for the future?",102
95,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:37): I thank the member for Throsby for his question and, indeed, he understands that in a changing world we do have to prepare for the economy of the future. In recent months I have made a number of visits to the Illawarra, one to open the SMART Infrastructure Facility at the University of Wollongong-a world class facility that is attracting international attention, making sure that we are at the forefront of innovation when it comes to manufacturing and when it comes to ensuring that we remain a country that makes things. In recent months also, I was with the Prime Minister when she announced the rollout of the National Broadband Network to the suburbs of the Illawarra, in the electorates of Cunningham and Throsby and also down to the electorate of Gilmore. The fact is that we do need to innovate. That is what the National Broadband Network is doing, replacing the old copper wire network of a hundred years ago with the technology of the future. Today we have with us an important sector of the manufacturing sector, the people who are involved in the auto industry. These people are ensuring we are able to innovate, not just stay as we are but move forward and produce the cars of the futurecars that are cleaner, cars that are greener, cars that are more efficient. We know that the auto sector is so important in terms of driving manufacturing innovation right across the economy. It reaches a tipping point-just as it has in shipping, which is why the government is acting there-whereby if you do not have a certain level of industry it disappears completely. That is something this government understands and it is why we are determined to stand with those communities when it comes to the auto sector. That is why we have the New Car Plan for a Greener Future. It produces some 46,000 jobs in auto manufacturing but, as a result of that, it has a multiplier effect on the millions of jobs that exist in manufacturing across the system. We understand that. That is why we are voting for our plan. We understood that when it came to steel manufacturing, when we voted for the $300 million Steel Transformation Plan. Remember that night, the late Tuesday night sitting, when those opposite voted 'no' 32 times to the MRRT, including the support for the steel industry. We have on this side a group of people committed to maintaining jobs and maintaining a future for manufacturing. Those opposite have nothing but cuts. We know the shadow minister offered up the cuts- (Time expired) Prime Minister",103
96,Mr WYATT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. What precisely did the Prime Minister's staff say to Ms Kim Sattler on Australia Day that would have led her to instigate the subsequent events? If the Prime Minister expects us to believe that her staff related what the Leader of the Opposition's words were exactly, how can she explain why a riot ensued?",103
97,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," In response to the member for Hasluck's question, as he would be aware, I dealt with these matters at the time. Following Australia Day, I obviously dealt with these matters publicly and what I said then is what I will say now, which is, a member of my staff made a very grave error. He acted alone. His conduct was unauthorised. Both he and Ms Sattler-the participants in the conversation-have been very clear that Mr Hodges relayed to Ms Sattler the words of the Leader of the Opposition from that morning, that he did not relay any other version and, of course, the rest has been reported publicly. To the member for Hasluck I say, as I said at a press conference on the Saturday after these events, Mr Hodges did make a very bad mistake. He has paid a very severe price for it. He relayed the words of the Leader of the Opposition accurately on the question of the tent embassy to Ms Sattler. Economy",103
98,Ms VAMVAKINOU,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline for the House the importance of supporting jobs right across our economy in the face of global uncertainty?,104
99,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Calwell for that question because she is a real champion of jobs in her area of Melbourne. As I was saying before, there have been something like 700,000 jobs created in this country over the past four years. Just compare that with what has gone on in other developed economies around the world. This has been perhaps the most difficult time in the global economy since Great Depression. For our country to create 700,000 jobs in that environment is something that we are all proud of. But we on this side of the House do understand that there are stresses and strains in our economy and that some sectors are coming under enormous pressure. The rise of Asia, the growth in the region, the fundamental strength of our commodities sector is putting upward pressure on our dollar, and that demands a responsible approach by all political parties in this House. Until now it had been a matter of bipartisan agreement that we would have support for the auto industry, for all of the reasons that the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport explained before and, as the Prime Minister indicated before, it is absolutely essential to our skills and technological base. We come to this problem with goodwill, wanting to work with the industry and with local communities. It is important that we put in place the investment we need, particularly in skills, training and innovation, but it is also important that we have a very strict fiscal policy in this environment. As I explained before to the member for Kennedy, despite all of these pressures in particular sectors we have an economy where growth is still at trend. As a consequence of having an economy where growth is at trend we have to bring our budget back to surplus because we do not want to add to inflationary pressures in the economy. We know that this is something those opposite do not get, because when they were last in power there were 10 interest rate rises in a row. That was despite the fact that they promised in 2004 to keep them at record lows. When it comes to the employment of fiscal policy they are a complete shambles. That is why they have a $70 billion hole. That is why they have thrown a surplus the commitment out the window and that is why they are now threatening the auto industry.",104
100,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer will return to being directly relevant in his answer.,104
101,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We on this side of the House know what we must do to successfully manage our economy in this period of great change. Those opposite are simply in shambles. Prime Minister Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP (Mackellar) (14:45): My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to her statement that the staffer responsible for Australia Day disturbance at the Lobby restaurant acted alone. Can the Prime Minister explain why staff in her media unit briefed the press gallery on Australia Day that the Leader of the Opposition was responsible for the disturbance when they knew that to be false?,104
102,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," On the member's question, it is true to form that we see the opposition throwing around allegations for which they can produce no proof. I have dealt with these matters on the public record and I will deal with them again. Mr Hodges made a very grave error in judgment. He has paid a price for that error in judgment.  of order. The Prime Minister was not asked about the actions of Mr Hodges; she was asked about the actions of her media unit. That is the question she should be answering.",105
103,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Manager of Opposition Business is correct. The Prime Minister will be directly relevant to the question.,105
104,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would have thought if the opposition were truly interested then it would wait for the details of the matter-and the details do matter-and making things up does not work. What happened, as I have said publicly, is that Mr Hodges acted alone. He was not authorised in his actions. It was bad error of judgment and he has paid a price for that. No-one was more angry than me that something to honour people who had done remarkable things in times of natural disaster and other circumstances when Australians needed aid was disrupted. In terms of what Mr Hodges and Ms Sattler said in their telephone conversation, I would refer the opposition to Ms Sattler's statements, which verify that Mr Hodges told Ms Sattler that Mr Abbott, the Leader of the the Opposition, had said that people should move on from the tent embassy",105

In the aftermath of the incident, what my staff did was first and foremost ascertain the whereabouts of each of my staff members because I was concerned about their safety. I also personally ascertained the whereabouts of Senator Lundy and Minister MCClelland because they were at the Lobby restaurant and, as television cameras spectacularly recorded, we left them behind. So I wanted to know that they were okay. In the aftermath of the incident, that was our first and foremost concern. The allegation that I or anybody on my behalf",105

110,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In terms of anything that I have said about this incident, I do not today and I never have believed, said or thought that this incident arose because of the words of Mr Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, and that somehow this was his fault. That has never been my belief. The conduct of the individuals involved, which was violent conduct, is the responsibility of those individuals. Broadband",105
111,Ms RISHWORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts. How is the government improving broadband for families and businesses in regional Australia? What benefits will this deliver jobs in regional communities?",106
112,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Hotham-Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts) (14:49): I thank the member for Kingston for her question. I know she knows the fundamental importance of getting broadband into her community because I was with her earlier this year and we were talking about the benefits for the residents of Willunga in her electorate. Today the Prime Minister has already indicated the important announcement that the government has made about the contract with NBN Co. to launch the satellites that will bring faster, more reliable broadband access to the remotest parts of our country. Why is this important? It is because we want every part of this patchwork economy to have the opportunity to take advantage of the enormous growth potential this nation has. We have already indicated that this government in its four years has created 700,000 jobs, the fastest rate of employment growth ever in the history of this country. Treasury estimates indicate that by the year 2020 there will be another 1.6 million jobsin other words, more than double what we have already achieved as the greatest achievement. We want to make sure those benefits are spread. We can do that only if we invest in the essential infrastructure that enables communities and regions to take advantage of an economy in transition and to diversify their economic base. They can do that only if they can get access to the infrastructure that enables it, and fast-speed broadband is one essential element of it. Anyone who doubts the benefits of what this will do for regional Australia should have a look at Tasmania for a start and the Launceston hospital's ability to deliver health services to regional parts or have a look in for Smithton at what the two schools are doing to access the opportunities for training kids in their region through world-class activities and e-education opportunities. Those who doubt it should go to Armidale, for example, and talk to the photographic company that is using fast speed broadband to establish its business in the region because it can upload as well as download activity. These are the benefits that exist out there now for those who have access to fast speed broadband. We want to ensure that the whole of the country gets it to maximise its potential. The only party that is committed to achieving this is the Labor Party. Those opposite think this can be done for a pittance and they want to give people vouchers to try and find it. They seem to think that those living in the regions should not have the same access as those who live in the cities. (Time expired) Prime Minister  Opposition Business) (14:53): My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to her earlier answer to the member for Mackellar when she said that she did not believe that the Leader of the Opposition's comments had been the reason for the Australia Day riots. Given that, why was the Prime Minister's media unit briefing precisely the opposite to the press gallery that afternoon, which the press gallery knows to be true?",106
113,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," To my knowledge no such briefing was given to the press gallery. If the opposition have a specific allegation, then they should put it. If they do not have a specific allegation, then they should stop muckraking. Education",106
114,Mr NEUMANN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, who also represents the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research. Would the minister inform the House about the government's commitment to providing Australians with the skills they need to contribute to the national economy?",107
115,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Kingsford Smith Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (14:54): I thank the member for Blair, who happens to have the Ipswich Trade Training Centre in his electorate. At that trade training centre, school kids get the opportunity to go up to a Certificate III in automotive. That is an important message that I want to emphasise as I answer the question that the member asked me. The fact is that this government is strongly committed to making sure that young Australians have the right education and the right skills training so that they can get good jobs for the future, jobs in the new economy. We recognise that the link between education and skills and future productivity and the link between education and skills and job certainty is a very, very direct one. That evidence can be seen in the commitment in spending on education by the Gillard Labor government, which has nearly doubled the spending of the Howard years. In particular, the evidence can be seen by looking at the commitment that we have made to kids learning the basic skills of literacy, numeracy and mathematics under NAPLAN testing. The evidence can be seen in the very welcome figures that we saw about the numbers of young women who are going on to university to learn, which show that we are ahead of the target that we as a government have set. The evidence can be seen in the commitment that we have to invest in trade training centres, and we already have funded projects benefiting over 1,000 schools around Australia. They are terrific facilities, as members behind me know very well, because they are places where students can get hands-on experience and good vocational learning that sets them up for life with skills in that career path. It is evidence too that those people who might want to work in industries like automotive can start getting on that skills pathway in those trade training centres. Before the last election, the opposition promised to cut over $1 billion from the Trade Training Centres in Schools Program. high That would have meant that tens of thousands of young kids who might have chosen not to go to university but who might have wanted to get those skills under their belt would have been denied that opportunity. That is not an opportunity that this government is going to deny them. In particular, I make this simple point: Mr Abbott does not seem to get it about what we are doing for young people in schools. When we made the announcement that we would help eligible families with teenagers aged 16 to 19 to have a boost in family payments so that they could stay at school or in vocational training he said on 2UE on 28 November: I guess I would want to carefully study this and make sure that the right kids are getting the money and that we really were keeping the right kids at school.",107
116,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister is straying from the question and he will return to the substance of the question.,107
117,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Abbott then said 'occupational therapy, basically'. The fact is that on this side of the house we do not distinguish between the right and the wrong kids. (Time expired)",107

NA The SPEAKER (14:57): Before I call the member for Sturt, I take this opportunity of welcoming some people with the Haywire program sponsored by the ABC.

Honourable members: Hear, hear! NA Prime Minister  Opposition Business) (14:58): My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer her to her previous answer in question time when she said that Mr Hodges related precisely the words of the Leader of the Opposition to the tent embassy protesters.

124,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I call the Prime Minister.,108
125,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I say again: if the opposition is genuinely interested then it should try following the details of this, not making spurious accusations. What I said at the time, what I said in answer to the last question, all what I will say now and what I will always say because it is the truth is that Mr Hodges contacted Ms Kim Sattler of Unions ACT. The Manager of Opposition Business is putting a label on her. It is not for him to label people. She is an officer of Unions ACT. Mr Hodges has relayed and she has of relayed the contents of their conversation. I refer to the public statement that Ms Kim Sattler released regarding the contents of that conversation. The contents are: I would like to make a statement about my involvement in the events of Thursday. Tony Hodges spoke to me by phone on Thursday afternoon. He told me what Tony Abbott had said - that people should 'move on' from the Tent Embassy. He also said that Abbott would be at an event at the Lobby that afternoon. Other people knew that already as Tony Abbott had been spotted at the Lobby already by other people walking back from the cafe next door. I merely passed on that information to the organisers at the Embassy in case they wished to make a statement to the media. Following media reports, Ms Sattler issued a further statement order: in order to be directly relevant she now has to explain why he therefore was asked to resign.",108
126,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister is being directly relevant and she continues to have the call.,109
127,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will answer that question, but I will not have stand on the record of this parliament the inaccuracies that the Manager of Opposition Business put in his question. That ought not to stand on the record. The record should say this: Ms Sattler's second statement that I would refer the Manager of Opposition Business to",109
128,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,109
129,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They say they are interested in the details, yet they are not prepared to listen. Ms Sattler said in her second statement: Reports in today's newspapers are inaccurate. As I said in my statement yesterday, Tony Hodges from the Prime Minister's office told me what Tony Abbott had said - that people should move on from the tent embassy. Yesterday the Prime Minister gave an accurate account of my role. On why I accepted Mr Hodges' resignation after it had been offered: I accepted it because I viewed his conduct as making a grave error of judgment, particularly seeking to introduce a note of partisanship into what should be a bipartisan event on a bipartisan day. That was inappropriate conduct and, as a result, I accepted his resignation. If my standards are too high for the opposition, well so be it. Employment Mr KELVIN THOMSON (Wills) (15:03): My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation. How is the government prioritising economic reforms that help Australians both in their working lives and during retirement?",109
130,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Maribyrnong-Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation; Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (15:03): I thank the member for Wills for his question. His electorate and mine border Essendon and Tullamarine airports and we know that, when we talk about prioritising for workers now and in their retirement, under this government Australia is still passing the airport test. We know in this country that when Australians come back from overseas, wherever they have travelled all over the world, this country is passing the airport test because people who come back to Australia are happy to be back in Australia. We know this country is doing all right. It does not mean that our future is guaranteed, but we know that compared to the rest of the world we are doing okay. We have 5.2 per cent unemployment. Every job loss is a shame, but we are doing relatively better than the eurozone and we are doing better than North America. We know we have low net Commonwealth government debt compared to foreign governments in terms of their net debt. We also know that we are engaging in the fastest fiscal consolidation in Australian history. We know why this is the case. It is because this government is interested in jobs, in skills and in making sure that people do not retire poor. The way we are doing that with jobs-and you can look at the record of the last four years because we have been consistent-is by guaranteeing the banks. Unlike the financial sectors in other parts of the world during the global financial crisis, that saw jobs saved then that would otherwise have been lost. Not only did we do that but we spent more money on the educational infrastructure of our school system than in Australian history. That also retained hundreds of thousands of jobs. We also know that, unlike the rest of the OECD, which has seen a contraction of 30 million jobs throughout the world, we have still created 750,000 jobs. This is a good record. We are also very committed to the car industry, which puts us about 20 miles ahead of the opposition. We actually believe this is a country that should be making things and we can look at the car workers of Australia and say, 'We are on your side.'",109

134,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Honourable members are entitled to listen to the minister in silence and they will.,110
135,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We also know that the best job security in the future is making sure that all Australians are well trained so that they can change jobs and they can find the new opportunities that are created as our economy adjusts to the rise of Asia and the creation of services industries. Finally, it is not just people at work that this government is motivated by; it is not just the current jobs; it is not just the skills development of the future. We are the only party in Australian politics who want to make sure we can lift super from nine to 12 per cent so people do not work hard their whole life and retire poor. Those are our priorities. Where are the opposition's? Prime Minister  Opposition Business) (15:06): Mr Speaker, my question is to the Prime Minister. Given the Prime Minister has admitted that Mr Hodges informed his superiors of his phone calls to the office of the ACT minister for Indigenous affairs and Ms Sattler on Thursday, at what time and on what day was she informed?",110
136,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I have answered these questions before and let me answer them again. I answered them on the Saturday following Australia Day and I refer the Leader of the Opposition to my transcripts, seeing that he has obviously missed it somehow. When I answered these questions on that day, what I said is what is accurate, which is that I went to Flowerdale on the morning after Australia Day, I returned to my office in Melbourne and I was subsequently briefed in full by my staff on their investigations of what by then were a wide set of allegations that were circulating through the media-not one allegation but a wide set of allegations. When I received that briefing in full I was also briefed that Mr Hodges had offered his resignation to my chief of staff. In those circumstances I met with Mr Hodges, he offered his resignation to me and I accepted it for what I viewed to be a grave error of judgment by Mr Hodges. Mr Hodges acted alone; his conduct was not authorised; it was not the right thing to do and he has paid the price for it.  Opposition Business) (15:08): Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. Does the Prime Minister seriously expect the public or this House to believe that in a matter so serious she was not told by her office for 24 hours?",110
137,Mr Albanese,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: questions cannot contain that sort of argument and polemic.",110
138,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The supplementary question is ruled out of order. NA Prime Minister  Opposition Business) (15:09): I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Sturt moving immediately: That the Prime Minister be called on immediately to give a full explanation to the House about the circumstances involving her office and the representatives of the Tent Embassy protesters that led to the disturbance at The Lobby Restaurant on Australia Day and, in particular, to answer the charge that a culture of dirty tricks exists in her office preventing her office from addressing the serious policy issues besetting the nation at this time. Australians instinctively want to believe the best about their Prime Minister but whilst so many questions remain unanswered about the role of her office in the Australia Day riots the Australian people cannot help but question the credibility of this Prime Minister. Standing orders need to be suspended to allow this motion to be debated and agreed to so the Prime Minister can do the right thing: give a full explanation to the House and dispel the notion that is abroad in this country that the office elevates dirty tricks above addressing the policy challenges that beset the nation. We know that this Prime Minister would walk on a million corpses to become a cabinet minister. She told us this herself. We know she would dispatch a Prime Minister of her own party to gain the office of Prime Minister. We know she would tell the Australian people one thing to win an election and then do the opposite immediately after an election to stay in power. We know she would dispatch a Speaker to gain an extra vote in this chamber. We know she would dispatch a friend and cabinet colleague in Senator Kim Carr to keep the faceless men of the caucus happy. We know she would tear up her contract with the member for Denison to keep the foreign minister at bay. Comparing of her to Lady Macbeth is unfair on Lady Macbeth-she only had one victim to her name; this Prime Minister has a list of victims longer than Richard III.",110
139,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,Order! The member for Sturt no longer has the call.,111
140,Mr Albanese,MOTIONS,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the Manager of Opposition Business is being disorderly and he should withdraw.",111
141,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,"It would be enormously helpful to the House if the Manager of Opposition Business withdrew the imputation that he just articulated.  Prime Minister would draw the line at allowing her office, the office of Prime Minister, to become tainted by the suggestion that it is engaged in black operations to damage the Leader of the Opposition. The Australia Day riot was no idle matter. It was the most serious breach of a Prime Minister's security since the Fraser government. No-one enjoyed seeing the Prime Minister in a headlock, dragged downstairs and along a path, chased by an angry mob, shoved in the back of a car and losing a shoe in the process. Nobody enjoyed that. It was shocking, it was terrible and it was humiliating both for the Prime Minister and for Australia as these images were flashed around the world. If anyone should want to get to the bottom of the circumstances surrounding this unfortunate event, it should be the Prime Minister. If anybody should want to get rid of the lingering stench that hangs over this government because of the actions of her staff on Australia Day, it should be the Prime Minister. If the Prime Minister is to have any credibility in the future, she should want to get to the bottom of the circumstances surrounding the most serious security breach to a Prime Minister since the Fraser government. And yet it took the opposition to refer this matter to the Australian Federal Police, having given the Prime Minister four days in which to do the right thing and refer it to them. In the teeth of inaction on the Prime Minister's part, the opposition acted. Too many questions remain unanswered about this matter for it to simply go away. Let me go through them. What precisely did the Prime Minister's staff say to Kim Sattler on Australia Day that would have led her to instigate the subsequent events? If the Prime Minister expects us to believe that her staff relayed Mr Abbott's words exactly, why did Kim Sattler write on Facebook and in an email to 3AW that Mr Abbott had suggested the tent embassy be cleared? Did Mr Hodges speak to any other activists?",111
142,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,"Order! The member for Sturt will refer to the Leader of the Opposition by his title.  to any other activists or protesters on Australia Day in relation to the events that were unfolding at the Lobby restaurant? If so, to whom? What was the content of those conversations? Why were the Prime Minister's media advisers telling press gallery journalists on Thursday afternoon that the Leader of the Opposition had started a riot if they were not trying to gain political mileage from the events of Australia Day? Who were those staff members? Has any action been taken in her office in relation to those staff? Who were the other three prime ministerial office staff at the Lobby on Thursday when Mr Hodges communicating with Kim Sattler of Unions ACT at the tent embassy protest? Have they been questioned as to their involvement in the events of the day? Can she guarantee that no other staff were involved in the events that led to the Australia Day affray? What conversations occurred between her head of communications, John MCTernan, and Kim Sattler on Friday, Saturday and Sunday? What was the content of those conversations that would lead Kim Sattler to describe herself as being the meat in the sandwich? Did any conversations occur between the Prime Minister's office and Kim Sattler on Sunday that would cause her to alter her account of her interaction with the Prime Minister's staff from the one she gave News Ltd papers on Saturday and upon which the Prime Minister relied today, conveniently forgetting the statement she had made on Saturday to the News Ltd press? Did Mr Hodges, when passing on the comments of the Leader of the Opposition, make any mention of his remarks in his historic apology in 2008 or the proposal for recognition of Indigenous Australians in the Constitution? When Mr Hodges informed his immediate superiors on Australia Day of his phone calls to the office of the ACT minister for Indigenous affairs and Ms Sattler, who else was subsequently told about the events? Who in turn did they tell? Why was the Prime Minister not told for close to 24 hours? Once informed on Friday afternoon, why did the Prime Minister not immediately tell the public rather than wait until after 6.00 pm that night, conveniently outside the media cycle? Was Mr Hodges required to sign a confidentiality agreement or an agreement of nondisclosure upon his resignation from the Prime Minister's office? When initially making contact with the was office of Chris Bourke, the ACT Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, to whom did Mr Hodges speak? What was the content of that conversation? During that conversation, was the suggestion made that Mr Hodges speak to anyone else? Who made that suggestion? Has anyone in the Prime Minister's office spoken to senior AFP figures in relation to the events of Australia Day? Given the gravity of the Australia Day protests, has the Prime Minister or her chief of staff initiated a review of their internal processes? To whom did Prime Minister's staffers Sean Kelly and John MCTernan speak once they were informed of events by Mr Hodges on Thursday? While working to establish the facts, did they speak to anyone else in the Prime Minister's office or other ministerial offices or to other Labor or union figures? When did Mr Kelly or Mr MCTernan inform Mr Ben Hubbard of the matters raised with them by Mr Hodges? What instructions did any member of the Prime Minister's office convey to Labor members of parliament on Australia Day about the use of social media, including Facebook and Twitter, about the events that had occurred? Of course, the final question is: where is Mr Hodges? Is he in a witness protection program? He has gone to ground. We have not seen him since his resignation, yet he was very prepared to be upfront on Australia Day.",112
143,Mr Albanese,MOTIONS,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I have been reluctant, but is a suspension of standing orders. There are limits to what he can talk about in terms of why the suspension should be supported. Going to character assassination of a former staff member is too much.",113
144,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,"The member should focus on why standing orders ought to be suspended. However, former staff members are not extended the protection of the standing orders.  suspended because, as Shakespeare also wrote, there is something rotten in the state of Denmark. There is something very rotten in the Prime Minister's office, and these questions remain unanswered. While the Prime Minister refuses to answer these questions, a rotten stench lingers over the Prime Minister and her office that saps the very confidence of the Australian people in the office of the Prime Minister and those who work for her. That is why this suspension should be agreed to and why this motion should be debated and carried. Of all people, the Prime Minister should want to pass this motion. She should want to debate this motion and have it pass through the parliament so that a full explanation can be given of her role in the events on Australia Day that have cast such a shadow over her office and her prime ministership.",113
145,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,Is the motion seconded?,113
146,Mr MORRISON,MOTIONS," I second the motion. Standing orders must be set aside to require this Prime Minister to stand to account for the rotten culture that has overtaken her government and which would be the subject of the debate that would follow the motion. There is a stench about this government that grows stronger every single day. It is the smell of distrust, the smell of division, the smell of disloyalty and this the smell of incompetence, arrogance, dirty tricks and cover-up. Above all, it is the smell of the decay that is eating into the very fabric of this government and that is affecting its very culture under the leadership of this Prime Minister. The events of Australia Day and the appalling and irresponsible conduct of the Prime Minister's office in the cover-up that followed are a window into the soul of this Prime Minister's government, of her office and of the culture that she has allowed to be created. What a dark place that is. The events of that day betray the culture of this Prime Minister and the culture she has allowed to overtake her government. The Prime Minister seems to believe in spontaneous incitement, based on things she has said in this place. She fails to understand that on that day her office compromised the security of our national leaders for nothing other than to make a cheap political point. The smell of this government is a very familiar one. We smell it in Queensland-it is in the air there-and I remember it all too well as the smell of the squalid Labor government in New South Wales. The culture of that government now infects this government here. The same dirty tricks, the same culture, the same responsibilities that are flouted daily and the same culture of cover-up. We remember that it was the New South Wales government just months out from an election that had parliament prorogued in order to ensure that there was not a parliamentary inquiry into the electricity sell-off in New South Wales. That is the culture of Sussex Street when it goes Macquarie Street. Sussex Street came to this place with the election of the Rudd government and has been taken to supersize under this Prime Minister. We have to remember that it was the former New South Wales Premier who pump-primed her own discretionary budget tenfold in the final year leading up to the election. We all remember the 'Don't you know who I am?' culture of the former member for Robertson and certainly former minister in New South Wales, Minister Della Bosca. We also remember the underpant dancing of the New South Wales state government-I suppose that is something for us to look forward to from the culture that is infecting this government on a daily basis-the rorts that took place in New South Wales, the referrals to ICAC, the corruption following from this culture. The culture starts, the action follows and the rest becomes history. This was a government that thought it could get away with anything. That is what the Prime Minister's office thought on Australia Day: they apparently refused, according to the Prime Minister's word, to inform the Prime Minister. So the next day when she was interviewed she knew nothing. She stood there and took a swing at Ray Hadley on 2GB, as she would do on any other occasion when she had the opportunity-blame the media, blame everybody else, blame Tony Abbott. She will find someone to blame: 'It certainly wasn't me.' So this Prime Minister went through this process that has become all too familiar. She distances herself, she denies the things that have taken place and she singles out those who are then cut loose to touch the void, as is so common when this government, using the Sussex Street tactics, takes over. I think there are two certainties in Australian politics. One is that Labor governments invariably go out in disgrace. to The other is that coalition governments are invariably elected to clean up the mess. We need to debate this motion because we need to clean the air. We need to clean it of the stench that rises out of this government on a daily basis, whether it is their disloyalty, their distrust of one another, their breaking of promises or this bizarre episode we saw over Australia Day which was apparently a spontaneous incitement. This is a government that needs to stand to account. This is a government that refuses to take responsibility, just as we saw in New South Wales. As New South Wales went, so this government will go-and so it shall deservedly go.",113
147,Ms GILLARD,MOTIONS," I rise to talk about why this motion to suspend standing and sessional orders should not be agreed to, and I remind the House what this motion is about. It is about giving priority to parliamentary time. We say something to this nation about how we use our time in this parliament. We say something about what drives us, we say something about what we stand for and we say something about what we care about in how we use the time of this parliament. In that regard, I note that the time we are taking now is time that would normally go to the debate on a matter of public importance. And I note that today's matter of public importance, from the member for Lyne, is about the natural disaster relief payments for flood damage in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland and the assistance being made available urgently by governments. I do wonder what Australians looking at this chamber would be thinking about when they see members of the opposition-but not the Leader of the Opposition, because there are some things that are even too grubby for him-coming to the dispatch box with a stream of abuse, holding up debates about important national questions like dealing with flood damage in our nation. More broadly, it is of no surprise to me that this is the opposition's topic today. They walked into question time today knowing that because of unwise statements by their economic spokespeople their economic strategy, which was always a shambles, has now been revealed as a shambles to the Australian people. They were determined to do anything today to distract from the real debate before our nation-the debate about the economy, about jobs, about running the economy in the interests of working people and getting them a fair share, about making sure that our nation is ready for the future. They knew that if the parliament focused on that today it would devastate them. We came into this parliament today and saw from the opposition inconsistencies everywhere about things that truly matter to our nation's future. The first inconsistency the nation should be focusing on today that matters to the nature's future is the incredible inconsistency across the opposition front-bench over the slashing of benefits to working families and over how many billions of dollars they intend to slash them by. We have seen the spectacle of the shadow minister for finance on more than one occasion verifying upfront that, yes, they are going to cut $70 billion out of the budget$70 billion that could only come out of the services that families need. Then we were treated to the spectacle of the shadow Treasurer, who originally adopted that figure and was then on the run from it, denying he had even said it whenever he was asked. Finally, today the shadow Treasurer actually managed to burble out that, yes, he had said that figure but it was a mistake. I would say to the opposition front-bench that in its plans to cut $70 billion out of services for working families-whether they are plans to slash Medicare, cut the pension or slash family payments-it needs to answer these questions. But they did not want the spotlight on that today. They did not want the spotlight on their inconsistencies about how much of an attack they plan to make on working families if they are ever elected. And then, of course, they walked into this parliament today with a huge inconsistency.",114

149,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,Members on my left will remain silent. There is too much audible conversation that I can hear.,115
150,Ms GILLARD,MOTIONS,"The Leader of the Opposition went to the last election campaign talking about one of his most fundamental commitments. The Leader of the Opposition is very fond of making allegations about honesty and election pledges. So what was one of his fundamental commitments during the election campaign? It was to bring the budget back to surplus in 2012-13. In fact, he was going to deliver a bigger surplus than the government would. Where is this fundamental commitment today?  order. I hesitate to interrupt the Prime Minister, but I was interrupted. For five minutes we have waited for the Prime Minister to address the motion under debate, which is that standing orders should be suspended.",115
151,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,The member for Sturt will resume his seat. The Prime Minister has the call.,116
152,Ms GILLARD,MOTIONS,"I remind the House of what the motion is, even if the Manager of Opposition Business does not understand it. In terms of the priority for the order of business of this House, here we have the opposition walking into this parliament in a shambles about one of the things that the Leader of the Opposition described as one of his most fundamental commitments during the election campaign. We now know, courtesy of the shadow minister for finance, backed by the Leader of the Opposition, that if they were elected to government they cannot promise a surplus for the first five years. That is in very stark government, that is determined in May to bring a budget into this House that gets us surplus in 2012-13 exactly as promised, because that is the economic step that our nation needs now. Then of course these inconsistencies continue. We have seen the shambles across the economic front-bench of the opposition about whether or not there would be tax cuts if they were ever in government. The Leader of the Opposition goes to the National Press Club and basically says: 'You know how I promised tax cuts? Well, I am not really sure anymore. During the first term, I could not possibly say that.' Then they send out the clean-up squad, because they know he has made an error, and the clean-up squad comes out-the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, for example-to say, 'Oh, yes, we will have tax cuts during our first term in government if we are elected.' Then there is some confusion about whether there is one round of tax cuts or two. The opposition is in a shambles. This would all just be argy-bargy in politics except we are in a situation where what is at the core of our national interest today, at the core of our national interest for the Australian people, is approaches to the economy. Whether you stand for jobs, whether you stand for car industry jobs, the reckless approach of the opposition, even though they are only in opposition, is weighing heavily on the minds of the car industry today. There is the half a billion dollar cutback, there is the lack of certainty for the future and there are 46,000 Australians worried about their jobs because of the statements of the opposition, because of the recklessness of the opposition. Mrs Mirabella interjecting",116
153,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,The honourable member for Indi will remain silent and will contrast to this cease pointing.,116
154,Ms GILLARD,MOTIONS,"And of course their a refusal to put jobs first just goes on and on. We have seen it with the approach to the minerals resource rent tax, where they are determined to take money away from small businesses and other businesses and away from supporting superannuation and give it back to some of the most profitable mining companies on earth. There is the irresponsible approach they are taking to carbon, where they are peddling snake oil and a plan that would cost working families $1,300. There is the irresponsible approach they are taking to the National Broadband Network, with their plan to rip the National Broadband Network out of the ground and deny Australians the technology of the future. And the list goes on and on and on. Here is the opposition looking for every distraction. Although the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday, 'Make my day,' and that he wanted to have a debate about the economy, he knows that if in this chamber we are debating the economy then he will lose, because his economic plan is one of cutbacks for working families, of no support for jobs, of giving benefits to the biggest miners in this country at the expense of other businesses, of the most costly carbon plan and of standing still as we need to build the economy of the future. These are fundamental choices about who you stand with and who you stand for, and of course the Leader of the Opposition never wants to debate them. We are very clear about who we stand with and who we stand for. We stand for running the economy in the interests of working people and supporting them and their families today, and the opposition front-bench will never stand for those things. They will only ever stand for the privileged interests of a few. On the question of the matters of Australia Day, I have answered the questions put to me. I would refer the opposition to my transcript. Their muckraking recklessness and their petty politics do them no good. Get involved in the big debate around this nation-get involved in the debate about jobs, about management, about preparing for the future-and if you are not capable of doing that then just come clean and say to the Australian people, 'We don't care about these things,' because that is what your conduct today is reeking of. You care about your petty politics; the national interest just passes you by.",116

Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper. NA Economics Committee Membership The SPEAKER (15:46): I have received advice from the Chief Opposition Whip nominating a member to be a supplementary member of the Standing Committee on Economics for the purpose of the in committee's inquiry into the Reserve Bank of Australia annual report 2011.",118
157,Mr ALBANESE,COMMITTEES,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (15:47): by leave-I move: That Mr A. D. H. Smith be appointed a supplementary member of the Standing Committee on Economics for the purpose of the committee's inquiry into the review of the Reserve Bank of Australia annual report 2011. Question agreed to. NA Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill 2010 Returned from Senate Message received from the Senate returning the bill without amendment or request. NA Mr EWEN JONES (Herbert) (15:47): Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",125
158,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented? Mr EWEN JONES: Yes, most outrageously, Mr Speaker.",126
159,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Please proceed. Mr EWEN JONES: In today's Australian in the 'Strewth' column, it was reported: As loud as it was, it didn't compare force of Nationals MP George Christensen's allusion to movie lines in Anthony Albanese's speeches. When Albo stood to object to Christopher Pyne's amusingly worded question about Labor's Craig Thomson, Christensen let rip with another popular Aaron Sorkin-penned line, ""You can't handle the truth!"" Mr Speaker, it is obvious that 'I am as mad as hell and I am not going to take it anymore'that is the end of the quoting. It would appear that 'what we have here is a failure to communicate'. It is obvious that the journalist in question has asked a colleague who was there, 'Who yelled out, ""You can't handle the truth""?' His colleague obviously said, 'The fat guy in the corner,' and the journalist jumped to the wrong conclusion: that it was the member for Dawson. Well, I say to him, 'Tell him he's dreaming,' and, to quote Jim Carrey from the lift scene in Liar Liar, 'It was me.'",126
160,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The member should bring his personal explanation to a speedy conclusion-humorous though it is. Mr EWEN JONES: I ask the journalist concerned to (a) issue an apology to my good friend and colleague the member for Dawson and (b) get a haircut so he can see for himself.,126
161,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The member will resume his seat. It is an abuse of the processes of the House to dress something up as a personal explanation when it is not. Because the honourable member for Herbert is relatively new, I will ignore it on this occasion. NA Nuclear Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 Reference to Main Committee",126
162,Mr FITZGIBBON,BILLS," by leave-I move: That the Nuclear Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 be referred to the Main Committee for further consideration. Question agreed to. NA NA Natural Disaster Relief The SPEAKER (15:51): I have received letters from the honourable member for Lyne, the honourable member for North Sydney and the honourable member for Throsby proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by standing order 46, I have selected the matter which in my opinion is the most urgent and important-that is, that proposed by the honourable member for Lyne, namely: That Natural Disaster Relief payments for flood damage in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland are made urgently by state and federal governments. I therefore call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",126
163,Mr OAKESHOTT,IMPORTANCE," Thank you, Mr Speaker, for your wisdom in choosing a very important and serious motion that reflects a disaster that is still unfolding in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland. I know from private conversations with members on both sides that not every member with an electorate that is affected will be able to speak. There is a lot of concern from local members about their local constituencies and there is concern generally for impacts constituencies outside their own. I think that is appreciated by many. On an administrative matter, we are nearly 30 minutes behind where we probably should be. It is disappointing that events on Australia Day have seen that time go. Again I pick up on the point that this is an important topic that the parliament should be debating at length this week. For anyone who is wondering, my view on Australia Day-and there are plenty of views out there-is that no-one comes away with clean hands with regard to events on Australia Day. Many Australians whom I have spoken with were both saddened and frustrated by the events and the coverage as it unfolded, and I am pleased now that proper processes of the House are being used to get issues of importance up. If that is a debate that others want to see happen in this chamber, there are proper processes to use, and I encourage them to do so in a sensible way. This is a disaster that is still unfolding. There are thousands of Australians who are outside their homes and evacuations are in place in many locations in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland. We have hundreds of thousands of dollars in question with regard to the damages bill, both public and private, that will have to be assessed and paid for somehow over the coming days and weeks. The other point that I want to get some reflection on from the chamber is not just the impact of this flood but the cumulative impact of this flood on the back of the flood last year. In some locations in Australia. I think the member for Maranoa will be making this point if he speaks-this is a flood on the back of a flood on the back of a flood. We have been having a rolling natural disaster over the past three years in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland, in and it is that cumulative impact that the natural disaster relief payment schemes and policies will not and do not reflect and manage as we try to struggle our way through as communities dealing with these natural disasters in the best way possible. This is an opportunity for a local member to put on record a few thanks before getting into some policy issues. From my perspective, I would very much like to thank the volunteer network of the mid-North Coast of New South Wales, who have once again kicked in and worked extraordinary hours for no gain over the last month. The SES is the most obvious organisation, but many people who have helped neighbours and friends are not part of any organisation. Thank you to all of those who helped someone other than themselves and also to those who are paid to do the job-the police, the ambos and the many services that went over and above during the past month. Thank you once again for the work that has been done. It is a rare comment these days in this place, but thank you to many of the media outlets, in particular the ABC on the midNorth Coast, who pretty well ran a 24/7 service which was very important for many people in getting up-to-date information, including evacuation orders, at various times. There is still assessment going on in my region, and that is adding up to quite a substantial bill. That is the lead-into the broader point that makes this an important matter of public importance discussion. In the Manning alone, there are probably still around 20 bridges out and unusable until damage assessments are done, and that will more than likely take a long time. A bridge is the point of engagement for many people who are living up valleys and off the coast. they cannot get in and out, then their business is affected, their family is affected and basic things are affected, like getting kids to school. Yet more than likely it is going to be not weeks but months before many people will be able to get access to things that we all take for granted in modern Australia. That is just from this flood alone-really over the last week and a half. But this comes on the back of the natural disaster of last year that still has not been dealt with. Whilst I certainly welcome new national disaster declarations by the New South Wales Premier today, and I think there are three of them-and it is all bipartisan and very welcome when they are made-the long period of time that it takes for money to come on the back of those declarations, for assessments to be done and for communities to just get back to where they were rather than getting anything extra is way too long. Also, the actual amount of money does not now meet the actual bill that is coming in. From June last year, one council in my area, Greater Taree City Council, put in an application for damage at 400 sites-a $19 million application-yet they only found out last week, when in another flood, that the money will not come through in full. At best, between $10 million and $15 million will come through in response to the application that was put in eight months ago. So not only is there a time lag problem, and not only are we now seeing a flood on a flood and so damage on damage, but we are also getting the message through that the application that went in last year will not be fully funded. Around 50 to 75 per cent will be met. That says the system is buggered. That says natural disaster is not reflective of what it should be. Through state, federal or whatever means possible, we should get full payments If back to a community affected by natural disaster, which is through no fault of their own, no matter where that natural disaster occurs in Australia. That is one example and I am sure there are many others, not only in New South Wales but also throughout the country, where there is frustration about time lag and frustration about the lack of money coming through. That is a public sector example of road damage, in particular, from one local council. The other example is from the private sector. Some of the classificationssuch as category C funding for farmers who have stock loss or fence damage-have a cumbersome and frustrating process, even for those who are eligible. It is a process that needs some policy rethink and some renewal and reflection. Hopefully, it will be much more efficient in responding to need, much more timely in getting funding through and much more generous in the way that government communicates with farmers in the private sector when there are genuine applications for damage to property, whether they be for fences or stock loss. Last year, in the Macleay Valley, we had a category C application rejected. Due to public outrage and pressure the government reviewed the decision and category C funding was then put in. That is not the way the process should work when we are talking about natural disasters and trying to get payments through to people. Farmers should not have to stand outside local members' offices and call for a change in the way an application is made. But that is exactly what happened last year, and I am concerned that we are about to see it again, now that we are getting pretty well the third flood in three years on the mid-North Coast. I use those examples at a very local level to try to encourage a national debate about how we can get a better structure between the Commonwealth and the states in natural disaster payments and engagement with the community in both the public and private sectors. At the moment, the evidence points to a cumbersome, burdensome and failing system, even though it is very welcome when a natural disaster declaration is made. I also make a broader point. It is the one made on the back of the last floods and through the flood levy debate-one that I did not support. I hope that, on the back end of this and the expected bill to come, we do not have another debate about a one-off flood levy coming through this place again because this chamber has failed-again-to recognise that natural disasters are part of life in Australia. We should therefore plan appropriately within our existing tax base, our existing budgets, for natural disasters happening relatively frequently. I know that around the edges of this place, in policy, there is debate about a sovereign wealth fund. There is an opportunity, and it is the call that I and others made last year. My colleague the member for New England has been making this call for a long time. We need to establish a broad pot of money that a natural disaster fund so that whether it is fire or flood-or whatever form the natural disaster comes in-we as a country are ready. We must do the preparation work so that we are not scrambling around about how to pay for something. Sure as night follows day, as much as we do not like it, there will be natural disasters, relatively frequently, into the future. I once again put that on the record for consideration and hopefully for some debate. It is something that happens in isolation in the Commonwealth. All of this needs to be very much in partnership with the statesnot so much a legislative process, not so much a House of Representatives and Senate process, but more of a COAG type process, where the Commonwealth and the states put together a partnership agreement or equivalent. Then it starts to really deal in a substantial way with what will happen in the future: another natural disaster. I plead with the minister at the table, the Minister for Emergency Management, as same well as the government generally. Please assist in applying as much pressure as possible to make sure that, firstly, this flood gets dealt with as efficiently as possible and that the needs of the community, both public and private sectors, local councils and the road network-when the assessments are complete-get dealt with as quickly as possible and that as much financing comes through as is required on the ground. Secondly, there is the cumulative issue. We need to look at the policy question of why natural disaster payments from the last flood are not being fully funded and start to provide pressure on the states, provide assistance to the states and provide whatever is needed for councils such as the Greater Taree City Council. They might be slightly outside some guidelines but the need is real. is Four hundred sites were damaged eight months ago and this is a council still in need. It is not the only one in Australia in this situation. I am sure there are many members who have similar stories. I hope this is something that the government will take as seriously as possible. Thank you for allowing this MPI and debate on this flood emergency that is still underway. I welcome a response from the minister at the table and all assistance coming weeks as we go from clean-up mode to assessment mode through to recovery mode in the coming months.",127
164,Mr MCCLELLAND,IMPORTANCE,"Barton-Minister for Housing, Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Emergency Management) (16:07): The member for Lyne does indeed raise an important matter of public importance. I commend him for it. Natural disasters are part of our natural history. They are just that: they are natural. But they have significant impact on our economy-for instance, last year in Queensland the cost to the taxpayers of the Commonwealth was about $5.7 billion. But that cost obviously pales into insignificance when we consider that there have been 35 lives lost in floods in Queensland since November 2011. These are very significant issues indeed. The member for Lyne is essentially talking about two events: one in late January affecting South-East Queensland and northeast New South Wales-I was able to visit there on 27 January and I headed down to the member's electorate in the days following that-and the other as a consequence of the monsoonal rains that we are seeing in south-west Queensland and north-west New South Wales. Again, with the members for Maranoa and Parkes, I visited their electorates with the Minister for Human Services on Tuesday. I should also indicate that I had support from the member for Moncrieff and the member for Richmond on the previous visits. In terms of the relief, I will explain to members. I know the member for Lyne and other members participating in this debate will be aware of this; this is for the public record-that there are two streams of benefits that are available in the event of a natural disaster. Firstly, there are the joint Commonwealth and state arrangements-the in the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements. In respect of those arrangements 20 local government areas in Queensland have been declared and 21 in New South Wales. An additional four were added today. Those entitlements are essentially community based and individual entitlements-for instance, for the immediate response in assisting the community in the refuge centres and for the longer recovery and repair operations. That was the substantial focus of the honourable member's presentation. There are also individual payments with respect to hardship by way of assistance for business and property owners and even for non-government organisations. Depending on the status declared by the state government, the Commonwealth essentially, after a threshold, shares the cost of those. Secondly, there is a stream of payments in respect of Australian government disaster recovery payments. They are exclusively Commonwealth. They entitle individuals who have been badly affected to a payment of $1,000 and for children, $400. Essentially, the activation of those payments is based on the consideration and expert advice provided to me regarding numbers of people affected, the uniqueness of the event and the extent of the impact on the local community, including the percentage of the local community affected-for instance, in the town of St George effectively the whole town was evacuated; obviously, that town was significantly impacted-and also whether a state has declared 'category C' under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements. Essentially, the philosophy behind these grants that were initiated by the former government was that the event was a very severe event and so impacted on the local community that it really required an injection of resources, not only to ease the suffering of individuals but to inject resources into that local community to sustain it. I should say that there is some degree of overlap between the two systems, as you would anticipate, but the point I am making in listing these benefits is a subsequent point that I will make with respect to what I believe we need to constantly refocus onthat is, preventative measures. I can accept the honourable member's points with respect to administration although I should place on the record that the working relationship I have had with the state ministers in this respect has been absolutely outstanding. Mike Gallacher in New South Wales and Neil Roberts in Queensland are both fine ministers and decent men. We have had ongoing and constant communication regarding these events. I appreciate the input-I will take it onthat the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements are complicated. There is no doubt about that. You could study them for three years and obtain a degree and still not know how they applied in specific circumstances. I think that is a fair estimate that has been put to me. In particular there are complications with respect to such things as eligibility criteria. These events do not always fall precisely over one line, so judging where that line exists is often a difficulty. With respect to low-interest loans that are available to businesses and primary producers, we recognise that there are complications, particularly in circumstance where those affected will not have the resources to engage an accountant or a lawyer to prepare the necessary records. All these points are valid points and we will take them on board. I do not have the figures for New South Wales; however, in terms of getting the country back in order, in the broad-there will obviously be issues of substance, as has been raised by the member for Lyne-in Queensland there were 9,170 kilometres of roads that were damaged and 8,482 kilometres have now been repaired. There is obviously still a substantial amount to repair but nonetheless that is quite a solid piece of work that has been done. In Queensland 4,748 kilometres of rail line were damaged. That is now fully functional. Eleven of Queensland's 20 ports were damaged. They are now fully operational. In terms of schools, 411 were affected; they are now fully open. And 89 bridges and culverts which were damaged have been restored. I commend the Queensland government for that effort. Obviously, in terms of the Commonwealth government's assistance and oversight, we have been able to work with them on that. That is not to say that there will not be individual circumstances that require attention. In respect of that, part of the problem, I suppose, is that there are often several agencies involved. Again, for members of the public who are interested or concerned, perhaps the best starting point for information regarding the relevant agency that they should apply to, for either an individual payment or a business grant that they may be entitled to, is the Commonwealth government's website, which is www.disasterassist.gov.au. The other aspect of the culture we have in Australia which is tremendously significant is that culture of volunteers. The member for Lyne, as I am sure will other members, commended the counter-disaster effort by the professionals and also the volunteers. Volunteers certainly are not amateur these days; they are highly professional in terms of their level of skill. Representatives of the state emergency services of New South Wales and Queensland came out of the woodwork from all locations around the states to help those areas that had been affected. It was the same with the rural fire services in their assistance. The nongovernment organisations are absolutely outstanding in the way they get in and assist the community, not only to staff the evacuation centres but also to doorknock and provide food to those people who are cleaning up, as are the local governments. I have been so impressed with the community leadership that is shown by the local governments and, indeed, the contribution of federal members. Our military has also been outstanding once again. A special mention has been made of the communication and assistance in keeping civil society on the road through the ABC. Having discussed the benefits that are available, I should say that we need to ensure that that is not our primary focus. Obviously the media focus and the focus of this House is, understandably, on these events after the natural disasters occur, but we really need to refocus our emphasis on prevention. To return to the example I referred to, Queensland has suffered $5.7 billion in damage, but $840 million was paid out by way of those individual payments. They were in addition to the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements, the personal hardship payments and the joint federal and state benefits that I have referred to. There was certainly a substantial effort put in and substantial resources involved in these pastevent personal payments. Obviously they are justified-these are people who had been through a tremendous amount of hardshipbut we historically have not spent anywhere near enough or focused our attention anywhere near enough on prevention, and that is where I think we should shift the culture. There is no doubt that mitigation does work. I went to Charleville, for instance, and stood on one side of the levee with my feet dry, looking over at little more than head level at literally miles of swiftly moving water. The levee had saved the town. Lismore is another example and there are numerous examples elsewhere. They think that in Cunnamulla the levee will save the town-we all hope and pray-from the floodwaters which will move there. These mitigation measures do work. When flying over the town of Murwillumbah, I saw that the old construction technique of building properties on stilts works. The township was inundated, but certainly the contents and the building structures of the properties that had been elevated remained sound-old lessons that we can apply. There is much we can do. By way of further commendation, I commend the Financial Review for the editorial stance that they took today. They again acknowledged the loss that had been sustained but pointed out that we do need to focus on prevention. Again, planning decisions are vitally important and reference was made in the article to the fact that very expensive properties were built in Brisbane along the lovely riverfront, but if you look at the photos from the 1970s you see that the area was completely flooded out. A graphic photo was shown of a power station that had been flooded. Clearly, properties should not have been bought there. I am not sure of the view of the member for Maranoa on this matter, but, looking at Roma, the people on these properties have gone through so much for three years in a row. It was not their fault, but clearly careful attention needs to be given as to where properties are constructed if they are going to go through that sort of trauma on an annual basis, or at least for three years in a row. We need to look at that sort of thing. We are looking at states such as Victoria buying back properties vulnerable to the fires. We are looking at Queensland. Again, I commend them in the area of Grantham, where they are buying back properties and allocating others. These are the sorts of things that we need to factor into our mitigation strategies. In the area of zoning, we need to identify risk factors, and we are in fact working with the states and territories to identify, mark and note areas according to their particular risk factors so that, in we can have areas zoned according to their risk and building codes applied appropriate to that risk as designated. Some areas, of course, will be designated as quite inappropriate to build on. But, by going through this systematically and methodically, we will be able to make our country far more resilient. There will, of course, be legacy issues with these properties that have repeatedly been flooded and, again, we need to systematically work through those with the state and local government areas so that we can take preventative measures. Whether it is a levee system or other preventative steps, we need to work through these issues and we need to plan for the future. So while it is entirely appropriate that we show empathy, as we do again today, for those who have suffered in natural disasters and we are all keen to provide that assistance post-event which is so necessary, I think we need to have a debate in this House and it is a debate I intend to have. A discussion I need to have with members, particularly those who have the local experiences to feed in, is what more we should be doing and how we refocus all that we can reasonably do to protect and prevent further damage and loss of life into the future. Mr Bruce SCOTT (Maranoa-Second Deputy Speaker) (16:21): I thank the House and I thank the member for Lyne for putting forward this MPI for debate today. I also thank the House for the bipartisan support that this motion has received, noting that all those in the chamber rose when called on to support this motion. What we are dealing with in the constituency that I represent-and Roma is my hometown-is unprecedented, in that we have had three floods in three years, devastating the town of Roma and of course downstream with further impacts in St turn, George and Dirranbandi. It has been felt across the electorate, but I think probably the most impacted town of all-and that is not just because I live there-has been my hometown of Roma. There have been three floods there in a row. We talk about flood mitigation, levee banks and all the known records that we have. The floods in Mitchell, for instance, went well above anything that has ever been recorded in European settlement times, and it was the same in Roma. I will give you an example in Mitchell, where some 280 homes were damaged and where 80 to 90 per cent of the people were not evacuated out of the town. There was not time and there were not the resources. Everything was cut off. It happened so quickly. They were moved to higher ground, to the sports centre. The flood depth gauge there goes to nine metres. That is well above anything in recorded history-seven, eight and 8.5 metres. Within four to five hours of the alert going out the floodwaters were a metre over that depth gauge. It goes to nine metres, and that disappeared. It gives you some idea of the ferocity and the nature and the way that this happened. It happened so rapidly. All the warnings that we might have had and the alerts that went out just did not give us time to do much more. Luckily in Mitchell there was no loss of life, but there was certainly a lot of damage to property-and I want to deal with some of the issues to do with that. Notwithstanding the best intentions of government, state and federal, there will still be people who fall through the cracks. We have to make sure that those people are not left behind. There are people who cannot get insurance because last year or the year before their home was flooded. What insurance company is going to take them on-there are perhaps some-knowing that this was flooded last year or the year before? I spoke to a number of people in my hometown of Roma, where 360 homes were flood damaged. Just before Christmas a lady I spoke to had just had the kitchen cupboards put back in-she had done it twice and was looking forward to having Christmas at home with this new furniture. It is a very humble house but it is her piece of Australia. Last Friday, by midday, all of that was ruined again and was under water. So I say to the House in the context of what we are debating here that these are not known circumstances in terms of the floods that we are dealing with notwithstanding the best intentions of government, we have to make sure that there are not people left behind. I know that there has been a fund established in Queensland by the Premier. We need to make sure that there are funds that are available, and I hope it is cash that is available, because that is the most important commodity at these timesto be able to use cash to purchase what is needed locally. Those who do not have flood insurance, notwithstanding all of the NDRRA packages, will not get anything more than $1,000 per person. They cannot get the small business assistance or the farmer assistance of $5,000 plus, up to $25,000. They are going to rely on charities and the goodwill of the people, as we have seen happen in the last two years. We have to move quickly. We really need a fund locally in some of these communities to help the charitable organisations, the Ministers Fraternal and others, and ensure that the people who fall into that category are helped. I would also say that it was not just the towns that were affected; the outlying areas were also affected-the properties, the loss of crops and the loss of stock. In fact, I have a report from people on the Maranoa River. They said all they could see at one stage were dogs and cattle being washed downstream, helplessly trying to survive in the water. At that stage, those people were actually on the roof of the house. The water had never been anywhere near their house before-such was the nature of this natural disaster. Shires have been declared-Balonne, Barcaldine, Barcoo, Blackall-Tambo, Longreach, Maranoa regional, Murweh, Paroo, Quilpie and Winton. All those shires in the electorate of Maranoa were affected to various degrees-from the extreme example I have just outlined to parts of the towns and parts of those shires. There are also a number and, of towns and communities that are not in the national media spotlight-for example, Surat, Augathella, Eulo, Tambo and Blackall. They rate a very small mention sometimes, and the focus is on where perhaps the larger populations are. I have not forgotten about them, and I know the package that has been just announced will pick up those people. But there will still be people who will fall through the cracks, and we have to make sure that we do not leave people behind. My hometown of Roma has been hit three years in a row. There are small businesses and people who have been there all their lives wondering whether it is time to go. They are on an emotional tight wire at the moment in many of these communities. I thank you, Minister MCClelland and also Minister O'Connor for visiting us-and I thank you for the lift back to Canberra. You saw the work of the Salvation Army and how they spoke with passion about what they are doing-the 1,000 meals they had served that day-and how they feel about it. You saw that very openly displayed at the recovery centre where they were cooking those meals. I will quickly relate my experience. I was at home that night. We live on a hill, so we were fine. If it got to our hill, we would the Ark. It was about 3.30 in the morning and I had been up half the night reading and I said, 'This is going to be bad.' I went into town at about half past six in the morning and looked around. By that stage the alert had gone out. That underpins the importance of communications, the ability of towns to alert people and the importance of connections-either fixed-wire or mobile connections-for all of these towns in these situations. At that stage the volunteers, the SES and the emergency management people were out in force and so too were the resource companies-Halliburton, Santos and Origin. Even two days ago, as you found when we were there, Minister, Origin were sending out 40 people, 'the mud army', to Mitchell to help with the clean-up and Santos were sending out 60-odd people. They have been absolutely brilliant, along with all the volunteers-state emergency services and others. Most of the people in my home town of Roma who had started the process of protecting their premises and their homes had to get out because the flood rose faster and higher, as you saw. Tragically, we lost a life. Jane Sheahan was out helping others. She was up early in the morning when the alert went out for people to go to the SES to get sandbags. Jane put them in the back of the Toyota Land Cruiser and was bringing them back along the shortest route, straight back down to where houses needed protecting, but the water had risen and she went straight into it. The people who rescued her son said it was tragic, and they will have to live with that. We will all live with it in the community. She said: 'Please save my boy. Please save my boy.' There is a lot I could talk about. The Warrego Highway is a problem at the Mitchell Bridge. We are going to have to bring forward very rapidly construction of need the new bridge, which has already been approved. We need to make sure we have funding, I believe in this budget, for flood mitigation, including levies. I think the town of Roma have $7 million to do theirs. They have nearly completed the study on it and Mitchell is similar. And funding for the Mitchell Bridge needs to be brought forward. Last year the trucking industry had 68 days on which they could not operate because of floods. The previous year they had 70 days on which they could not operate. They do not know how long it will be this year, because of load limits on those roads. The banks have to play their part. They are charging 15 per cent penalty rate for non-payment of payments which are due. I thank you for your indulgence. I thank the minister and I thank the House. (Time expired)",130
165,Mr RIPOLL,IMPORTANCE," I thank the member for Lyne for bringing this matter of public importance to the attention of the House. I support everything said here today on the scope of work that needs to be done to assist people in natural disasters. I also want to thank the Prime Minister for her many visits to my electorate in particular and also to Queensland, where she has made a number of visits to flooded regions. I also thank the Treasurer for his visits, most recently when we dedicated the Pillar of Courage at Goodna, a symbol of strength in the local region and in the middle of my electorate, which was heavily hit, as were so many other places. I will not go into the detail of that I have spoken about it many times. That symbol at Goodna, the pillar, is a flood marker. What really shocked me about the pillar was that it is at the lower end of the scale of floods compared to previous floods. Hopefully we will not see such floods again. There is no question that natural disasters are a very familiar aspect of life in all parts of Australia. It seems natural disasters occur every year in some part of the country, whether they are flood, fire, drought or some extreme condition. In recent years Queensland and New South Wales have been hit particularly hard, very much so in the summer-my electorate of Oxley, through the western corridor, the electorates of Blair, Morton, Brisbane, Wright and Maranoa. We have just heard the member for Maranoa speak about the devastating impact of three floods through his home town. We have also seen bushfires in Western Australia and in 2009 the most devastating Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria. The current situation in Queensland is that St George has 46 properties flood affected and approximately 25 per cent of the entire town is without sewage services. The majority of evacuees from St George are staying in Dalby or at the RNA Showgrounds in Brisbane. It is a massive disruption to their lives-for many it will be for the rest of their lives. In Charleville the Warrego River is beginning to fall, thankfully, and Charleville reopened at 5 pm yesterday. So there is some good news among the disaster. In Dirranbandi the Balonne River is still rising. The town is expected to be isolated for at least two weeks. When you consider the impact of that, being isolated from your home, your town and all your possessionswhat is left of them-it is a long time. In Mitchell 23 properties have been assessed as being severely damaged, 88 are moderately damaged and 177 have other damage. There are 90 homes which remain without power. In Roma 26 properties have been assessed as being severely damaged, 277 are moderately damaged and another 200 are suffering as well. The scale of the damage is enormous. For some it is not just their property; as we heard just a moment ago from the member for Maranoa, for some it is also their life. As we would all expect here, nobody will leave people in these regions on their own-it is just not the Australian way. We heard that often when talking to people around the community when we were assisting through the floods. There were a lot of people from different backgrounds and different countries who have settled in Australia who were out helping their fellow Australians and saying that the strange thing for them was that in their country that would not have happened but here it did. That extends right through from ordinary people to elected representatives and local government. Government assistance is significant and should never be undervalued or underplayed. It will never be enough. You can never quite replace everything someone has lost nor can you rebuild everything. The Queensland state government in particular has worked exceptionally hard, as has the federal government, to ensure people are best restored to a decent position. Not everyone is Hospital lucky enough to say they are no longer affected in some way. We know that is just not the case. Those who are very unfortunate are affected a second or third time. It is quite a disaster. The Australian government and the Queensland government immediately stepped in and helped Queenslanders in a range of ways, particularly the Australian government with the very quick and timely $1,000 for adults and $400 for children just to get people immediately back on their feet, whether it is to help restock the fridge with food, buy some clothes or get petrol for the car, if they saved the car, and so forth. The clean-up and recovery work is enormous and without the volunteer efforts of so many people it would just be impossible-we cannot contemplate how we could ever pay for all the work done. We can attach some value to the money that is put through from government-$150 million was given to more than 13,700 small businesses and primary producers through special grants. They were acted on as quickly as possible. I do take note of some of the concerns of the member for Lyne, and I am sure others, that it is never quite fast enough and we need to work faster. No-one is going to argue against that. I think we just have to find better ways of dealing with these methods of payment so we can acknowledge people's pain and suffering and try to restore their circumstances as quickly as possible. The government also recognised that rebuilding would take some time, and we are committed to that rebuilding. The government advanced some $2.2 billion as part of a $5.6 billion reconstruction commitment to see work get underway on essential infrastructure like roads and bridges. We heard earlier from the Minister for Emergency Management that there are something like 9,700 kilometres of severely damaged roads in Queensland, let alone through New South Wales. You can imagine the problem where farming communities rely on one road only and they can no longer get in or out. It is not only a social impost impost on their businesses and livelihoods as well. That is quite significant. The Queensland Natural Disaster Jobs and Skills Package is also there to help a whole range of workers who are affected as well. A lot of businesses have been lost. The owner of the business loses the business but all the workers lose their jobs as well. We have seen a lot of that through Queensland and New South Wales. Queenslanders have received some form of personal assistance in those circumstances. A range of other assistance packages have been put in place. The government continues to provide immediate assistance to people affected by these most recent floods and continues to work with the states and local government authorities to manage assistance through the NDRRA. We have heard about local government areas such as the Balonne, Barcaldine, Barcoo, Blackall-Tambo, Bourke, Carpentaria, Central Highlands, Cloncurry, Doomadgee, Flinders, Isaac, Longreach, MCKinlay, Maranoa, Mount Isa, Murweh, Paroo, Quilpie, Richmond and Winton. Unfortunately most of those places are in the electorate of Maranoa-it is a real tragedy that one member has to try to deal with all those. A range of grants have gone out in those areas, and the New South Wales government is doing similar things. Currently more funding is going out in direct assistance, and we should take note of the enormous amount of goodwill that exists between local government and the state and federal governments to work these processes through. It is never easy. It is a lot of money and we want to make sure it does get to the right people at the right time and does not just get lost in the system with bureaucracy taking over. You might be putting a lot of money into the system but people are not getting the immediate benefit. A lot of work is being done to make sure it is done right, but an and sometimes that does cause delays. We always regret that. I know we all work hard individually and collectively to make sure the assistance gets through as soon as possible. For some good reasons I remain a supporter of the one-off levy, and particularly of what we did last time. I accept what the member for Lyne said, that there should be some sort of a fund, but I think having a specific levy where there is specific hardship is a good way to go. It is a good way to deal with a particular issue. Otherwise the funding comes from consolidated revenue-where it comes from anyway. All the money that goes out to flood affected communities or fire affected communities comes from consolidated revenue-that is the fund, in a sense. There is the moral hazard, the potential danger, that if a specific fund is set up that will have some consequences as well in terms of private insurance, business insurance and how individuals in our very generous communities respond. I am more than willing to have the debate. I think it is a worthwhile method to look at but we also need to be cautious on the other side of that so that we get it right. I congratulate the government, the minister and the Prime Minister and thank the member for Lyne for bringing these issues forward.",135
166,Mr WINDSOR,IMPORTANCE," I join with other members in thanking the member for Lyne for bringing the matter of disaster relief before the House. As the member for Maranoa said, it is good to see a bipartisan approach being taken to a particular issue. The member for Oxley discussed the concept of a sovereign fund or a natural disaster fund. I have been an advocate of that for probably 15 years-a long time before I came to this place. The member for Oxley made the point that government revenue is always there to fund this sort of assistance as the need comes along. I beg to differ with that because there have been, historically, different responses similar circumstances depending on the economic or financial cycle of the government of the day and the politics of the electorate at the time. A whole range of variations affect responses to very similar incidents. Over the years, through exceptional circumstances arrangements and various other arrangements that the Minister for Emergency Management spoke about earlier, we have attempted to get to some degree a level playing field. Nonetheless, there have been different responses at different times depending on economic and other circumstances, not the least of which are political circumstances. That creates an expectation that if you got it I should get it when I have a natural disaster. Like the member for Lyne, I did not support the Queensland flood levy. It is not that I do not support Queensland people getting some assistance-obviously I do. The question was why we needed a levy in that particular circumstance when it could have been taken out of consolidated revenue. Obviously, there were issues of a government heading towards a surplus and all sorts of other things that would have been exacerbated, such as the deficit et cetera. I think the member for Oxley actually proves the case that there are variations in responses that we get. I believe that we should look seriously, and I am encouraged that some people would like to have this debate, at the concept of a national natural disaster fund of some sort that would have guidelines that would remove the complications that occur from time to time. On a number of occasions prior to the Queensland floods last year-quite an incredible event; there is no doubt about that and, obviously, parts of New South Wales and Victoria suffered under similar circumstances-I did some research into the cost to communities of natural disasters, to although I am not saying the cost of the total road network and all of the infrastructure. These are communities that have been covered by insurance. I think it was the case that prior to Cyclone Larry in Queensland there had been one event that had a cost of over a billion dollars a year. That had been one such event in the previous 20 years. I can be corrected on this but some time back I had reason to engage with the Insurance Council of Australia to try to help get some numbers around that. If you look at it, you see that in most years disasters in Australia probably cost Australia somewhere between $200 million and $400 million a year. Obviously, other events since the floods last year or even taking last year's floods make that look like small cheese. The point that I have made on a number of occasions when this debate has come up is that a dollar a week from all Australians raises a billion dollars in a year. I would have thought that in some sense or other, if a billion dollars is the number, even if that were the average disaster cost there would be a case-particularly given what has gone on in Queensland with the flood insurance arrangements as to whether the water was coming up or was coming down, which has ramifications for whether you are covered by insurance even though you thought you were-to have a serious look at some sort of national insurance scheme-and socialism comes out of the woodwork here!-that looks after these particular circumstances. If a dollar a week from every Australian raises a billion dollars in a year and if the average cost of disasters in the last 20 years has been $300 million or $400 million-30c or 40c a week-even if you double or treble that, it is fairly cheap insurance for those who are impacted by disasters. Within those numbers that I have just quoted was the Sydney hailstorm-absolute devastation-or the Wollongong mudslide. I was nowhere near Wollongong but I remember going into bat for those people some years ago in the New South Wales parliament because a disaster had occurred, a mudslide that took away their homes, and the normal arrangements had not worked or had not applied. Take the Coffs Harbour catastrophe that occurred some years ago. All of those are brought into those numbers. I urge the minister, if he has a spare staffer or two, to actually do a bit of research into this. While I can be corrected in terms of the numbers, I think the principle holds given that as a nation we do have natural disasters from time to time, whether they be fires in Victoria, Canberra or wherever, whereby people are impacted. Even though those people might have done the right thing in trying to protect their premises with levy banks and insurance taken out, all those sorts of things, and even though the goodwill of everybody would have been to try to address those particular issues, the magnitude of major disasters-not normal droughts or normal floods; we farm on a floodplain and we bought land on a floodplain because it floods; the floodplain is there because it floods-means that in those certain disastrous circumstances people do get severe abnormal exceptional impacts occurring to them. So I would encourage people to have a close look at that concept so that in the future we do not have to go through what we went through last year in terms of a special 'one-off maybe' levy for the people of Queensland, and the politics. The funds would always be there, triggered by certain criteria that could be developed as to fires, floods and exceptional climatic events. Is climate change happening? I think we probably are moving into an area of extreme climatic events. We can get into arguments about whether it is getting hotter or colder, but I think one of the dangers that we really do need to look at is the extremity of these events: long dry spells and extraordinary rainfall events that we have not seen before. We cannot say that is all because of climate change, but I think the assessment of risk comes into this, and history may well prove that we may well have been able to do something about these extraordinary cyclonic and other activities, such as the drying out of the understorey and the major bushfires and other catastrophes, that are occurring. My electorate has been impacted but I have taken most of my time talking about the member for Oxley's, given that diversionary tactic that he uses with great effect! My electorate has been impacted by floods in recent times as well. In particular, Gunnedah, a great community, has been, and the mayor sent me a photo of the racecourse only about half an hour ago. As many members have said, the emergency services' responses are always exceptional. I am not one of those members who wander around when they are working-I know some do but I do not agree with that-but I do pay great regard to the work that those people put in. I pay regard the work that ABC Radio and the emergency response people do. Once again, in terms of budgets we should remember that in these cases we need community access to local information, and there is no doubt in my mind that ABC Radio has done that extraordinarily well in all our areas in the last few months.

167,Ms SAFFIN,IMPORTANCE," I too would like to thank the honourable member for Lyne for raising this matter of public importance and so giving us the opportunity to speak on it, particularly about floods, flood damage and associated issues and to talk in a bipartisan way about some of the ways we can approach these issues. I heard the Minister for Emergency Management talk about some of the issues that he and I have discussed at various times and particularly when he has visited my electorate when it has had floods. I thank for that, Minister. We have talked before and I have invited you to come up again. I have five local government areas in the seat of Page and four of them have been identified by a state declaration as requiring assistance, then the NDRAA can kick in. Those areas are Kyogle, Richmond Valley, Lismore and Clarence Valley. It is always hard when we talk about floods to say some are worse than others but they clearly are. That is what happens with floods. The Clarence Valley really copped its fair share-a bit of a hiding-and very sadly one of the local residents from Coots Crossing, where Mayor Richie Williamson lives, died on 31 January. He was Robert, or Bob, Fox. I am quite experienced in responding to floods. On Australia Day, unusually I did not attend any event because I was flooded in and could not go out. I spent Australia Day at home, which was most unusual. I am used to preparing for floods and doing all those things but I spent a few hours hurriedly to trying to move things because the waters came up quite quickly. But people can get caught. Even with the best care and the best knowledge, it can happen. We always say, 'Be safe, do this, do that,' but people can get caught. I have been in the situation where I take extreme care, but at different times I have found myself in a situation in floods when it has not been as safe as it should be. When we had the catastrophic floods across Australia the year before, particularly in Queensland, there were seven floods in my area in a few weeks. I cannot quite remember but I think there were four major, two moderate and one minor flood within a period of a couple of weeks. They were going up and down, up and down. That brings me to the issue that has been raised here today-that is, the impact. We have a flood on a flood on a flood going through my area. What that has done to the you roads, the infrastructure, the cane farmers, the prawns and fishing is just a bit hard to bear. The other issue I would like to bring up is what the honourable member for New England was talking about-a dedicated, hypothecated fund for natural disasters. We have seen increasing extreme weather events. We also know that is increasing because of climate change. I favour having that sort of fund. It makes sense. I have been sitting here talking to the honourable member for Fremantle-I do not think she will mind my saying this-so I can enjoin her into it for saying, 'Yes, that made sense,' as we were listening to the honourable member speak. I have heard him talk before on that subject. When you live in areas where it does flood all the time you are very focused on these issues when you have to respond and deal with them. The other issue that I have raised over a number of years is the eligibility of farmers to get low-interest loans. A lot of this is a state and federal responsibility and, as the Minister for Emergency Management said, trying to understand all the intricacies of it means you could almost get a degree in it and still not understand. When you derive over 50 per cent of your income from the farm, which most of the farmers in my area do, then you are not eligible. The minister knows this because we have had this conversation. The minister has been with me and various farmers at Greenridge Hall when we talked about that issue. It is administered by the Rural Assistance Authority and I have raised it with them, but it is one of those issues that should be on a ministerial council's agenda, or whatever it is when you call all the ministers together. In my area eligibility requirement excludes a lot of people who really do need it. A lot of them are not rich farmers; they need to have income off-farm. This is one of the issues that I would ask to be taken up at both levels. There is also the issue of flood insurance. I do not know if this is still with Minister Shorten, now the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, but he did a lot of good work in that area to get some commonalities into the definition of what is a flood and all of those issues. I told the local media that I feared that premiums would be so high that they would end up being out of reach for the people who needed it. Because I live in a flood area I know premiums are going up by a few thousand dollars in some areas and this is going to be difficult for people to grapple with. There is also a parliamentary committee that is looking at that issue as well, so I hope we can get some sense out of that. I cannot talk about the floods without talking about the volunteers, as all honourable members have-all of our local people who muck in and help when we have floods. I put on record my appreciation of all of those people who do the things that need to be done and also of the SES, the RFS, the charitable organisations such as the Red Cross and also the military. The Westpac Rescue Helicopter Service goes over my place. I always hear it and I can tell which helicopter it is. I can identify it by sound. I heard the Black Hawks arrive this time. They have a particular sound. They were based in Lismore so they could go out across the region. I think the minister would have seen when he went to Tweed Heads as well that they were flying around the region and helping. It was really good to have the military there. Also, the media and the ABC were mentioned. They do a wonderful job in these times, and also commercial radio does as the well. I would like to note that. The ABC comes to the fore but our commercial local radios do too. They provide a really good community service to the locals. I had an email the other day from a friend of mine, Reverend Bob Rutherford. He has a chaplaincy with emergency services. He was going to be deployed to Queensland in about a month or so, but they asked him to deploy a lot sooner because of what is happening in Queensland. He has been talking to the locals and he says some of them are quite shell-shocked and stunned because of what happened last year and the events before it and the major events that are happening now. He said that one of the best things we can do at government level is support the locals in their needs and what they want, so community led recovery but with us being there holding out a helping hand and making sure that people do not get left behind. He was going to Roma and places in your area, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott. He will be a valuable resource in the community. In closing, I want to say that we do a good things. We as a community respond well in times of crisis and as governments we do the best we can as well. Every time we have a flood or a major event it is an opportunity to learn lessons. I know that happens with Emergency Management Australia and the states do that. I would just ask the minister to look at the issue of eligibility.",140
168,Mr COULTON,IMPORTANCE," I rise to speak on this matter of public importance, brought to the House by the member for Lyne. I would like to note that it is somewhat comforting as a member in this place that sometimes thrives on adversity that at times like this we all to pull together. I acknowledge the minister for his visit to my electorate on Monday and the prompt action that came from that visit. I also see the former parliamentary secretary for agriculture-I am not quite sure what he is these days!-and acknowledge that he came and studied the losses we had in the Dubbo area last year. This is a big flood in northern New South Wales. The benchmark floods in Moree in my lifetime have been those of 1974 and 1976. These floods exceeded those and were comparable to the flood of 1955. A lot of the focus has been on the larger centres and the river systems-the Namoi River and the towns of Boggabri, Narrabri, Wee Waa and, on the Gwydir, principally around Moree. But some of the more tragic stories that I am getting through my office now are about battles we are having coming from unknown streams and cross-country flows mainly between Moree and Narrabri, now focusing on the Rowena community. There have been large losses of stock and grain. I understand machinery has gone underwater. They are battling that at the moment. Quite a few of the levees around the homesteads there-I lot of am not sure of the numbers-have not been sufficient. We are seeing inundation of homesteads and the farm infrastructure around that, which is a massive financial loss. This flood event is affecting my different constituents in different ways in Moree, Yarraman and smaller villages down the river. There has been a wonderful response from the SES, the Rural Fire Service and local volunteers, and the local community have been helping each other out. It has been quite heartwarming to see that level of support and how people are helping each other out. I was in Moree on Monday as the water was receding and everyone was just tend rolling up their sleeves and cleaning up the mess and getting rid of the mud as the water went down. It was surprising how quickly they did that. The announcement of a category C from the Australian government disaster relief fund was greatly welcomed by many of those people. I am just disappointed that some people have tended to see this as an opportunity to make a bit of easy money. There have been reports of people phoning Centrelink and misrepresenting the severity they have experienced personally because of the availability of the $1,000 payment. I would discourage people from doing that. I understand that the government is trying to retrieve funds from people who received funds illegitimately in the Brisbane floods last year, and I understand that that will be the case in these floods. This assistance is designed to help people who really need it and, believe you me, there are plenty of people who really need assistance. For people who are thinking about rorting the system, I would caution against that because ultimately it will catch up with you. Also, I welcome the $15,000 grants that were announced today for small business for flood damage. That will be appreciated, but it is a drop in the ocean compared with what is going to be required. I have heard a report of one farmer who has had over $1 million in damage to his irrigation infrastructure. That is one farm alone. I have heard of a drover who has not had a job since the end of October. He cannot get out onto the route because it is impassable because of the water and stock are not moving. Someone like that is experiencing real financial hardship. This grant does not cover loss of income so there will still be a lot of hardship. I was speaking to a small business man who has an irrigation company and he said he has not worked since the beginning of November. He employs six people. He has been paying those six people so he does not lose them because qualified staff are such a valuable commodity. But his debts are adding up because this has been going on for some time. So there is going to be a need to ensure that we do not lose people through financial hardship as this goes on. I also want to speak about the impact on public infrastructure and the cost to local government. On the black soil plains of the Gwydir, Moree and Narrabri shires, the great irony is that the most highly productive land generally has the worse roads. The most highly productive land is on the black soil, which is notoriously difficult and expensive to build roads on. There is generally a shortage of suitable gravel and road-building materials, and they are very susceptible to deterioration in wet weather. Councils across my electorate have losses in the tens of millions of dollars. The obvious one in the Gwydir shire is the Gwydir River bridge at Gravesend, which I think will take months to repair. A lot of causeways have been washed away. A lot of gravel has been washed off roads. At Christmas-time after the first flood went through, I was in discussion with the state Minister for Roads and Ports, the Hon. Duncan Gay, and the Mayor of Moree Plains Shire Council, Katrina Humphries, and we felt that rather than flood payments to councils after disasters to repair infrastructure to pre-flood levels there is a good argument to be made to engineer the repairs so that they will cover the next flood. We are now seeing roads that have been repaired being washed away with the next flood. It would better value for the Australian taxpayer to put more money in now to repair them and not have to come back and do it again after the next flood. The other issue is the difficulty that producers are having getting their produce off their farms. We had a fairly large harvest, though some of it was downgraded due to the November rain. At the moment, we have huge tonnages of grain on farm. Many of these farmers have contractual agreements with flour millers, feedlots and users on the coast to deliver this grain in a timely manner, and it cannot be shifted because the road is impassable. They are in a real financial bind. Some of them are having trouble with contracts. Some of them have payments to make to finance companies. They were expecting to have money come in and they cannot ship the grain. That is causing real hardship. In closing, I will give a plug for the work that is being done by the Australian Rural Roads Group, who are identifying the importance of the first few miles for a product. Every item on supermarket shelves starts its life on a country road. If it cannot do the first 10 kilometres, it cannot do the last 100 or 1,000 kilometres. In this country, we need to seriously look at bringing these roads up to a condition that will handle a flood situation like this. I have welcomed the opportunity to talk about the severity of the floods in the Parkes electorate. I would like to close by acknowledging the great work being done by my communities and by the volunteers who have come from all over New South Wales to help. I want to let those people know that this parliament is still thinking about them and to acknowledge that their hardship will be going on for some time yet.",142
169,Mr HARTSUYKER,IMPORTANCE," I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter of public importance today. Since the commencement of this year, we have once again seen Mother Nature challenge communities across the eastern states, with northern New South Wales and southern Queensland bearing the brunt of mountains of rain and, as a result, flooding. Whilst a of media attention has been focused on the devastating floods in north-west New South Wales and south-west Queensland, I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the mid-North Coast and far North Coast have also experienced significant floods in recent weeks. I understand that Taree and Port Macquarie are currently experiencing heavy rainfall as this debate is going on. All five local government areas in the electorate of Cowper have been affected: Clarence Valley, Coffs Harbour, Bellingen, Nambucca and Kempsey shires have all experienced flooding to various degrees. Since the beginning of the year, the Bureau of Meteorology has recorded the following rainfall in my electorate since 1 January: Bellbrook, 570 millimetres; Coffs Harbour, 389; Dorrigo, almost a metre, at 988 millimetres; Kempsey, 370; Nambucca Heads, 415; and Grafton, 356 millimetres. Across the region, there has been substantial damage to roads, bridges and farms, and many families have been isolated and some houses flooded. In the Bellingen shire, we have seen the Waterfall Way between Bellingen and Dorrigo close as a result of landslips. More than 500 residents were isolated along Darkwood Road with food drops necessary to provide families with basic necessities. In Nambucca, we have seen the shire council lodge an initial claim for $500,000 just so that the clean-up can continue and transport routes can be reopened. Some of the bridges which have been damaged or closed in the Nambucca Valley include Thumb Creek bridge, Burrapine bridge and Laverty's bridge, which are all on the Taylors Arm Road. But there are many others, including Factory bridge on Greenhills Road, Grays Crossing bridge and Boat Harbour bridge. In the Coffs Harbour City Council area, residents in low-lying lot areas of the Orara Valley, including Karangi, Nana Glen and Glenreagh, were affected. I have been contacted by a number of people from the Orara Valley who are seeking additional government assistance, and residents at Corindi experienced flooding on their properties after what they called a 'mini tsunami'. As 68-year-old Brian Taylor told the local paper, the Coffs Coast Advocate, 'This was certainly the biggest one I've seen here and I've lived in the area all my life.' Sadly, in the Clarence Valley Council area we saw a Coutts Crossing man, Robert Fox, tragically drown after his car broke down in a gully. It is reported that he was swept under a roadside culvert. Although the circumstances of this tragedy are still being investigated, it is believed the flooding contributing factor. In Kempsey the State Emergency Service had the communities of Gladstone, Smithtown, Kinchela and Belmore on standby for flooding after more than 350 millimetres of rain. Natural disaster declarations have been made by the New South Wales government in all five local government areas in the Cowper electorate. This has meant assistance is available through the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, or NDRRA. These arrangements provide a range of assistance, including grants to councils to repair infrastructure and restore services; personal hardship and distress assistance; concessional interest rate loans for small businesses and primary producers; transport freight subsidies for primary producers; restoration or replacement of essential public assets; and loans and grants to churches, voluntary non-profit organisations and sporting clubs. Whilst this assistance is welcome, there are certainly residents in my electorate who would benefit from Australian government disaster recovery payments of $1,000 per adult and $400 per child. There are also many primary producers in the Cowper electorate who have suffered substantial damage to their properties and would benefit from the grants to primary producers of up to $15,000 which have been extended in previous floods and have been offered to those currently affected in north-west New South Wales. As I said previously, my office has been contacted by a number of people seeking additional assistance. Many of these people are from the Orara Valley, west of Coffs Harbour, but certainly those impacted are not limited to this area. I would like to draw to the House's attention to one of the emails I was a have received so that members understand how these recent floods have impacted on some people in the Cowper electorate. This is how one constituent described what he had experienced: I am contacting you on behalf of myself and other families who reside in the Karangi district who were adversely affected by the recent flood disaster. The seven families in this immediate area were isolated for 10 days and were not able to attend work, complete other activities etc and the children were unable to attend school. The isolation began on Monday 23rd January and we were only able to safely cross the Orara River on Friday morning 3rd February 2012. On Saturday 4th February I visited another area further up stream and I was informed that approximately 15 other families were also adversely affected by the flood event. The families that reside along Watkins Rd in Karangi were isolated for 4 days. It is also my belief that there were families that reside in the north Coramba / Bucca area that were isolated for an extended period of time. We find it rather difficult to believe the 30 or so families adversely affected by the Coffs Harbour January 2012 flood crisis are not being provided access to the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment. I think you will agree that the families of this area meet the criteria for the Disaster Recovery Payment and therefore should be allowed access to this service. In recent days I have been making enquiries with Centrelink. I was astounded to discover that the Coffs Harbour flood that affected so many people was not categorised as being a level 'C' disaster event. The families in this immediate area are affected by flooding many times a year, however it is not normal to be isolated for a 10 day period. In 2009/10 the Coffs Harbour region was declared a level 'C' disaster area and people who were adversely affected were provided disaster payments from Federal funds. The people of this area were provided Federal Diaster payments in 2009/10 due to being isolated for approximately 4 days and suffering property damage. The recent 2012 flood was as extreme as the flood of 2009/10 however particular families been dramatically disadvantaged to date as they have not been provided financial assistance via the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Program. The people of this area's affected and Federal Government to provide an exception regarding our ability to access the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment. That is how one of my constituents explained the impact of these recent floods. So, while most urban areas in my electorate escaped substantial damage, the reality is that many residents in rural areas have been affected. I should note that many primary producers have suffered extensive damage to fences and roads on their property. Since being contacted by these constituents, I have taken the opportunity to write to the Minister for Emergency Management, communicating how these constituents have been affected. I have asked the minister to consider extending the Australian government disaster recovery payments to those affected by the floods on the mid-North Coast and the far North Coast. I have also raised the issue of the $15,000 payments which have been offered to primary producers and small businesses in the north-west of New South Wales but have yet to be extended to coastal areas. I would like to take the opportunity, on this matter of public importance, to register my personal thanks and the gratitude of all Australians to the SES volunteers and emergency service personnel who have provided such terrific support during these flood events. As a nation, we cannot place a price on the true value of the services provided by our emergency services workers. In conclusion, I believe it is incumbent on all levels of government to ensure that flood relief payments are not delayed have unnecessarily and that individuals and communities are supported as they recover from these flood events.",144
170,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE," Order! The discussion has need the State concluded. NA Defence Security Authority Vetting Mr STEPHEN SMITH (Perth-Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House) (17:20): by leave-On 16 May 2011, three contractors formerly employed at the Defence Security Authority's vetting centre in Brisbane made allegations on the ABC Lateline program concerning inappropriate security vetting practices. The vetting centre is part of the Australian Government Security Vetting Agency, which has provided security vetting for the majority of Commonwealth agencies since 2010. The former contractors alleged that while working at the vetting centre they were encouraged to insert false information into security clearance applications to enable those applications to be successfully uploaded for further security checking by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). The government has taken this matter very seriously since the allegations were brought to its attention on 16 May 2011. On 17 May 2011, I asked the Inspector-General of Defence to undertake an initial assessment to determine whether the matter should be referred for external review. Based on this initial assessment, on 27 May 2011, I recommended to the Prime Minister that she refer the allegations to the independent Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security for thorough investigation. The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security commenced her investigation in June 2011. On 21 September 2011, I issued a statement outlining the findings of a review undertaken by the Department of Defence's chief security officer into the management practices used in the vetting security officer's review was undertaken in response to requests from the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security for information to support her inquiry. The chief security officer's review found:  inappropriate work practices were in place at the vetting centre. This related to the use of 'workarounds' to manage difficulties uploading data onto a new electronic link between Defence and ASIO. These 'workarounds' involved vetting staff entering into electronic vetting forms phrases or words to identify unclear or missing information when a security clearance applicant had not provided all of the required information;  documentation and management arrangements in place at the centre were inadequate and did not effectively record the 'workarounds'; and  almost none of the 'workarounds' had been discussed between Defence and ASIO. The chief security officer's findings raised serious concerns around the management of security vetting within the Defence Security Authority. I made these concerns public at the time. The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security finalised her report late in December 2011 and I am taking my first available opportunity to table it in the House today. Evidence provided to the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security's inquiry confirmed that the substance of the allegations by the former contractors was true: incorrect data had been inserted into vetting process. Difficulties in uploading data led to the use by vetting staff of workarounds to address both database incompatibilities and situations where an applicant had not provided all the data required. This corrupted data was provided to ASIO and was used for security centre. The chief assessments. The practice of workarounds was not confined to the three complainants; most if not all staff used workarounds to some extent. There was a wide variation in the use of incorrect data and little by way of documentation. Further, except in limited circumstances, the use of the modified data had not been agreed by ASIO. There was also no support for the suggestion that this data was used as a place marker to be corrected at a later stage. In the course of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security's inquiry, other practices and incidents, unrelated to data entry, were also identified which were not consistent with good administrative practice. While there was no evidence that there had been any attempt to subvert or mislead the security clearance process, the report identifies a number of contributing factors that led to these practices, including:  inadequate management oversight, contributing to inadequate and inconsistent documentation, poor record keeping, poor management and inadequate quality assurance;  inadequate training for contractors and staff, poor maintenance of training records, and the use of staff in roles for which they had not completed their formal qualification;  delayed and inadequate systems upgrades, and poor IT systems user controls; and  sustained pressure for output. The Inspector-General of Intelligence and the Security found that the integrity of data in both the Defence Security Authority and ASIO had been undermined if not compromised. Incorrect data entered the databases and some persists today. The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security noted that the ASIO security assessment is but one part of a broader assessment of a person's suitability to hold such a clearance. For high-level clearances the process involves a personal interview, multiple referee checks, police record checks and often a psychological interview. This thorough assessment process is designed to pick up issues of security concern. The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security noted that it was not possible for her inquiry to determine whether any particular ASIO security assessment had been compromised by the provision of incorrect data. The extensive review and validation of clearances already underway will identify whether any such cases exist. So far, approximately 3,100 high-level security clearances have been reviewed and validated of around 5,300 applications made during the period. The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security made 13 recommendations and the government has accepted them all. In accepting all of the recommendations, Defence has taken immediate action to rectify the problems identified by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. These remediation efforts are focused in two areas: remediation of vetting processes, improvement of documentation and updates to information technology systems, and validation of data affected by the inappropriate work practices. Firstly, Defence has stopped inappropriate data entry practices and is finalising agreed data entry protocols with ASIO for instances where vettees genuinely do not know, or cannot provide some information or evidence. Defence has already taken steps to strengthen the management and oversight of the Defence Security Authority and the Australian Government Security Vetting Agency. Steps have also been taken to:  centralise the control and management of vetting documentation;  ensure all managers involved in the vetting process are formally qualified;  develop a comprehensive training program to ensure vetting staff have the necessary professional skills and development;  introduce an updated electronic vetting program with a thorough program of training support; and  update the online vetting pack to reduce the need for data entry protocols to support the transmission of data to ASIO. Secondly, Defence has commenced the careful process of checking and validating each and every one of the security assessments that were subject to the inappropriate practices. If this validation process identifies that information has been changed without justification then the correct information will 13 be obtained from the clearance holder and provided to ASIO under an agreed remediation strategy. This is a significant task. Care also needs to be taken not to unduly divert resources from ongoing security assessments and clearance processes. Finally, the Secretary of Defence has written to the three former staff members all who raised the allegations to acknowledge their allegations in respect of data-entry were true and to provide them with a copy of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security's report. The report of the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security identified management practices and process deficiencies that do not reflect well on Defence. The report's findings provide a sound framework for addressing the shortcomings that have been identified. It has been very important not to wait for the inquiry of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security to be finalised before getting on with the job of addressing these problems. The review and validation process for clearances commenced in September last year. The government will ensure that the Department of Defence fully addresses the issues identified by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and that all recommendations are implemented in a comprehensive manner. Assurance of Defence's security-vetting efforts will be provided by annual audits of compliance with security-vetting policy conducted by the Defence chief audit executive for at least the next three years. The first audit will be completed by 30 June this year and its results will be published in the Defence annual report. This will provide ongoing public reporting and assurance of Defence's security-vetting practices. The government takes its national security responsibilities very seriously. allegations about inappropriate securityvetting practices were first brought to the government's attention on 16 May last year and by the end of May last year had been referred to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. She commenced her inquiry in June. Preliminary findings of a Defence review conducted in support of the inquiry of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security were released publicly by me in September last year. Defence's review and validation of security clearances commenced that month ahead of the final report, which, as I have indicated, received in late December last year. The report of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security presented today sets out the work Defence has already undertaken and will need to undertake to remediate the shortcomings identified by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security in Defence's security-vetting practices and processes. I present Inquiry into allegations of inappropriate vetting practices in the Defence Security Authority and related matters by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. I also present a letter to me by the Secretary of Defence, dated today, detailing the implementation of the recommendations of the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Paterson to speak for 10 minutes on behalf of the member for Fadden. Leave granted. Mr STEPHEN SMITH: I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Baldwin speaking in reply to the ministerial statement for a period not exceeding 10 minutes. Question agreed to. The Mr BALDWIN (Paterson) (17:32): I am responding to the report of the inquiry into allegations of inappropriate vetting practices in the Defence Security Authority and related matters by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security on behalf of the shadow minister, the member for Fadden, as he has had to take leave to attend a regal function on behalf of the opposition. I would first like to thank the Minister for Defence for providing this House with an update on what was and remains a very serious lapse in Defence's security-vetting practices and for providing the opposition I with a chance to respond. I also thank the Minister for Defence for presenting the report of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security into this matter, although I profess a certain level of curiosity as to why the Minister for Defence is responding and presenting this report when it was the Prime Minister who referred the original allegations to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security for investigation. Naturally, the opposition will require time to fully avail itself of the details of this important report before making any statement as to the recommendations contained therein. However, I am heartened by Defence's assurances that it will readily adopt all 13 recommendations laid out in the inspector-general's report. Having said that, I remain concerned that the report, at least at face value, appears to acknowledge that there is a problem but that it is unable to identify specifically which Defence or ASIO personnel have been incorrectly vetted. I certainly appreciate the sensitivity of this issue and can only ask the minister to ensure that the private briefing the opposition will receive on this matter in the near future fully explores this specific issue. The minister has briefly canvassed the events that led up to this wholly unsatisfactory situation. However, it is certainly instructive to recap some of the issues in a little more detail in an attempt to fully tease out the circumstances that gave rise to this sorry saga whereby thousands of security clearances were not conducted in line with existent policy. As many will recall, this issue was made public in May last year when the ABC's Lateline program interviewed three former Defence Security Authority contractors who said, and I quote from the Lateline program: … security at Australian military bases and embassies has been significantly compromised by a deliberate fabrication of information to fasttrack security clearances. The three former Defence workers say they were given direct instructions by senior Defence to fabricate security checks on civilian and military personnel. As it turns out, the inspector-general's report confirms what the Defence contractors told the Lateline program. In fact, as the minister has pointed out, it confirms that the use of workarounds and other such malpractices was indeed widespread within DSA. Worryingly, the report also found that problems within DSA went beyond the initial scope of the problem raised by the former Defence contractors on Lateline. It concluded that both DSA and ASIO data had been compromised and that, more worryingly, problems persist today, some nine months after the problem was first made public. The problems identified in the report include poor personnel management, poor record keeping, a lack of quality assurance, inadequate training for staff, poor IT systems and, most critically and tellingly, sustained pressure on staff for output. To put this critical point another way, there were not enough staff to do what was asked of them. There were not enough staff to do what the government asked of them when in 2010 Labor transformed DSA, which at that stage looked after Defence personnel security rating, into the Australian Government Security Vetting Agency, which is now responsible for whole-of-government personnel security vetting. To put this into context, the number of clearances the agency is required to process a year has more than doubled from 23,000 to approximately 48,000. This represents a substantial increase in the workload of the AGSVA. It is a workload that at the original staffing level was unmanageable, something that was only compounded by the move to a whole-ofgovernment vetting model. What strikes me as particularly unusual, or perhaps unusual in the context of this staff Labor government, is that those opposite concluded that they could substantially increase the workload of an organisation without increasing the human capital required to complete the set tasks. It is symptomatic of this Labor government to be so short-sighted. Again, we find ourselves in a very difficult situation-this time affecting the very core of government: national security. Of course we find this report recommending, amongst other things, that more people are required in order to manage an increased workload and associated output pressures. My question to the minister is a simple one: why has it taken yet another report to tell the government what any sensible department or corporate human resources manager would tell you in a heartbeat-that more work requires more staff? While I again thank the minister for his statement, I nonetheless take exception to the minister's comments that the issues surrounding this matter were first brought to the government's attention on 16 May 2011, on the evening of the Lateline review. I would like to remind the minister that, as my colleague Senator Johnston made quite clear during the October 2011 foreign affairs, defence and trade estimates hearings, members of the Labor government had been alerted to the problems in the DSA some months before the Lateline program in question aired. Senator Johnston said: I have seen some of the correspondence that have raised and some of the reports they some people who were employed to report on their complaints back in May, June and July 2010. I will come back to those reports in a minute, but the four parliamentarians were the former member for Forde, Mr Raguse; Minister Snowdon; Minister Griffin; and Minister Emerson. They were all given first hand information about these problems back in 2010. One would think that such serious allegations would be immediately passed from these Labor MPs, one of them a cabinet minister, to the defence minister. But, no, they failed to pass on this information to the minister or even to the defence department. Instead, the problem festered until the story became public some 12 months after Labor MPs were told of the serious problems in DSA. I am aware that the minister may like to argue that the concerns communicated to the four Labor MPs related to bullying, harassment and maladministration within the DSA. I simply say in response that a responsible government would surely examine these issues in detail. A responsible government would not blindfold itself to the possibility of systemic issues affecting the administration and functionality of the DSA, particularly as work pressures within the organisation were well known at the time. Furthermore, the Trent Brennan report of 2010 highlighted such issues as well. Nothing seems to compel this Labor government to take action unless it first appears on our TV screens. I am sure the Inspector-General's report will make for sober reading. Indeed, from a cursory examination of the findings we are now aware of the general extent of the problem, although I reiterate that we do not know the precise details of which personnel were not subject to the proper vetting practice. This has led to a situation, as the minister has stated, whereby at least 5,500 they applications will need to be re-vetted, of made to which only 3,100 have so far been completed. I currently appreciate Defence's commitment to allocate additional resources to this problem, both presently and during the period preceding the release of the Inspector-General's report. In conclusion, I would simply urge the minister to take stock of the report's findings and to ensure that the matters of national security do not fall prey to the increasingly indiscriminate Defence Strategic Reform Program budget cuts. Australia's national security is too important to not be adequately funded. A lack of funding and personnel seems to lie at the very core of this serious lapse in national security administration. Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011 Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011 Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Second Reading Cognate debate. Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",146
171,Mr RANDALL,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," I am pleased to speak on the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011 and cognate bills because it gives me an opportunity to talk about some of the service obligations of telecommunications industry on behalf of the government and to point out where this is not the case, particularly in my electorate. The universal service obligation is a vital aspect of Australian telecommunications because every Australian needs and deserves access to basic telephone services at a reasonable price. The USO guarantees these services should always be available. People in the bush as well as people in cities and people in outer metropolitan areas deserve access to basic telephony and, increasingly, internet access. This legislation comes in three parts and will create a new statutory agency called the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency, or TUSMA. This agency will be responsible for entering into contracts on behalf of the Commonwealth. Most people have spoken about the detail of this bill, so I do not intend to. But I will say that the legislation provides for a review of the USO arrangement before 1 January 2018 to basically see how it is going and to talk BILLS about the way it has been funded. Some of the issues are that the government has agreed to pay Telstra $230 million a year to provide standard telephone services and $40 million a year for payphones, and Telstra will be paid $20 million a year for emergency call services. And then there are administration costs et cetera. The final bill before the House is the Telecommunications (Industry Bill 2011 Levy) Bill 2011, which is a procedural mechanism that will essentially demonstrate how TUSMA will be paid for. The universal service obligation is something that both sides of this House have agreed to. In my time here as a member of the Howard government, telecommunications was something that we certainly made sure the bush had access to, particularly in the case of remote areas of Australia. It was largely done in an the expensive fashion by satellite. The coalition continues to be committed to ensuring that Australians in regional areas will continue to have reliable access to standard telephone services. And, speaking of rural Australia, dare I say at this point that I was so surprised to hear in question time the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, the Hon. Simon Crean, banging on about this, when in Perth he promised to commit to funding for the RDAs in a regional area and the money still has not come. Here we are in the new year, the RDAs are still trying to survive and the minister has not coughed up the funding, so how can we believe him on an issue like this? TUSMA, as I said, is going to be the delivery mechanism. It will be interesting, because it will involve a change from recovering the costs from the industry to being substantially funded by the government, with the balance funded by industry. One suspects that the amount of funding the government will provide either will be reduced or will not be increased in line with inflation or need. Increasingly, the industry will have to come up with the money through levies-and of course the industry will retrieve that money by passing the cost on to the customers. My electorate of Canning is very interesting because it is part of the Perth metropolitan area, it is metropolitan, it is rural and it goes deep into beachside areas in the south, before Bunbury. So we have a whole range of telephone needs. Again today the government came out with a promise, like it did before the last election, about delivery. Before the 2007 election, the then Leader of the Opposition, Kevin Rudd, and shadow minister Conroy said that they would deliver this telephony to everyone in Australia. Then they said it would only be delivered to 94 per cent of Australians, and then it would only go to towns with over 1,000 people. I have a heap of towns in my electorate that do not have 1,000 people-for example, Jarrahdale, Mundijong and Serpentine miss out on this. I am writing to them to tell them that they are going to miss out on any future NBN rollout, because that is what has already been put out there. They deserve better. We have to understand why we are in this position with the NBN and how this obligation is going to be served. In the current stand-off between Telstra, which has been the universal provider, and the NBN rollout, there are people who cannot get any access to telephony or any internet at all in parts of my electorate. Dare I say that there are people just behind my electorate office in Kelmscott who are still on dial-up. That is meant to be a metropolitan area. Can you believe that they are still on dial-up in this so-called modern age? Do you remember the then opposition leader, Kevin Rudd, standing there with his computer saying: 'This is the new toolbox of the future. This is what you are all going to be using in the future'? He was going to give all these laptops to schools, but they needed to be connected. Dare I say, the deal was not even done. They said they would do it in the first 12 months of government. In the first 12 months of government they did not get outer anywhere near delivering any such deal. It took towards the end of the Rudd-Gillard first term to even come up with a contract for the rollout of any broader service to the electorate. Why did they then decide to produce a mechanism called the NBN, which is largely a nationalised telecommunications product? Unbelievably, my state of Western Australia is being threatened by Prime Minister Gillard for not following through with competition policy and not providing enough competition in a whole range of areas, yet here we are with the Commonwealth government re-nationalising telecommunications in this country. We are going back to the old days of the PMG, where the PMG was the sole provider and there was no competition. In fact, we know that recently the NBN Co. tried to stop Telstra from competing with them in wireless and this had to be adjudicated. It was adjudicated in favour of Telstra to say that they could compete with the wireless technology. Why wouldn't they? It is a very successful technology. It is a technology that the Americans decided they would use rather than put all their eggs in one basket, which the NBN is doing. Can you seriously believe that this government would put what most commentators suggest will end up at $50 billion of borrowed money into one technology of fibre to the home-not fibre to the node, where it can be taken out and reticulated into the suburbs, into the businesses and the schools in the area. Fibre to the home is the most expensive one-shotin-the-locker option of providing telecommunications. Before the 2007 election, we had in place a very good wireless technology which had been quite well appreciated by many in the industry called OPEL, which was a wireless opportunity for outer metropolitan areas where sending it up and down the streets in cavities was not an option due to topography, due to the sort of land they were crossing et cetera. But, no, we ended up with the expensive NBN option. One of the first places it is supposed to be rolling out in in Western Australia is Halls Head. There is no sign of it yet. The people had a public meeting not so long ago and asked me to come along. They said, 'Is it true that I have telephone cables running past my house now and that they are going to become redundant and that I will have to sign on to what is taken past by the NBN and pay more money?' That is the fact of the matter. Unbelievably, the NBN, on behalf of the government, is buying the copper wire network from Telstra. Copper wire is not the technology of the future. We know that. It delivered into Australia and it has done a reasonably good job in some areas. But why would you trash it before you have a replacement? That is my point. Parts of my electorate-for example, Piara Waters and Harrisdale-cannot get enough ports out of their exchange now. I have emails here from people in my electorate begging me about this. Mr Grant Hill from Harrisdale says that they deserve better. He is trying to run a business from his home and he cannot get enough ports in the area. Thank goodness, at least I can still ring David Thodey from Telstra and say, 'Can you help us here?' and generally he does. Generally he does put more ports in the area. But now there is a huge waiting list. Telstra are saying, quite rightly, 'Why would we go and invest in infrastructure in an area when NBN are going to come and make us redundant some time later?' By the way, Grant Hill is putting out a petition in the area seeking support from all those in this new suburb saying, 'We need help because we cannot connect.' As you know, much of it is through wireless towers, telephone towers et cetera. Now you can get BlackBerrys and do business on those. So we have got a petition going Today I had an email from Martin Reddan and Laurie Doncon saying that it is that slow there that when they try and connect they have to wait until late at night or until certain hours on the weekend before they can do any business. I want to now put something on the record, because I believe that some time in the future this prediction will come back to haunt those in this House. Telstra are waiting on a very fascinating end game. They are going to be paid $11 billion by the federal government through the NBN for their redundant copper wire network. They are going to build all this extra infrastructure. Then-because they can, because the ACCC stopped them being knocked off by the NBN-they are going to provide wireless technology with very good upload and download capacity to people right across Australia at less than the NBN are going to charge them. They are going to blow this technology out of the water. They will usurp the NBN sometime in the future and it will take a future coalition government to bail out the NBN because nobody wants to sign on to it. We have seen this in Tasmania. The NBN has been rolled out in areas of Tasmania. I asked the member for Gilmore and she said that not that many people have taken it up in her electorate since it was rolled out. Where has it been rolled out first? In areas like and New England. Why? So that they are going to vote for it and get it over the line. That is the 30 pieces of silver to help get this over the line. Yet people are voting with their feet, not paying for it and not taking it up. I say to the House tonight that the universal service obligation means rolling it out and giving people access when they need it. Parts of my electorate do not look like getting any of this technology any time soon. So what are they doing? They cannot afford satellite, because they are in the so-called metropolitan area. Wireless is not available to them unless Telstra provides it to them. And the NBN could be 10 years or more away. What are they going to do in these new homes and these new estates? We have a better way. We are going to do something to stop the mess, whether given the opportunity in three months or 18 months. We are going to put some sanity back into telecommunications in Australia, rather than have a big, expensive, borrowed money deal that will do nothing for many of the people in our electorates at the moment. I say to the government that this has been a nose in the trough exercise, with the money simply being shovelled out. There has been no cost-benefit analysis. There has been no research into whether it will be of any use to people in certain areas. As I said, this one technology puts all the eggs in one basket. That is something that this government will come to rue at a later time, because as a result they are going to be usurped by modern technologies that we know continue to be made available on an annual basis. This will be something that we will look back in shame on. Our kids will say to us, 'How did you ever let 'em get this expensive option that does not deliver for all of Australia through the place?' I will say that I did my best and that I exposed them in the Lyne parliament as being profligate with taxpayers' money.",152
172,Mr ALBANESE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (17:56): This debate has been on a package of three bills, the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011 and the Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill 2011. This package will provide a flexible, accountable and transparent model for delivering and funding public policy objectives in the telecommunications sector. The reforms contained in the bills being considered are aimed at ensuring continuity of key consumer safeguards through the transition to the National Broadband Network and into the future. These include ensuring reasonable access to standard telephone services and payphones, the National Relay Service and the emergency call service. The bills address important unfinished business dating back to the privatisation of Telstra. They provide for increased transparency and rigour in the delivery of basic consumer safeguards. Under this approach, the realistic costs of delivering these important services will be appropriately recognised. The Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011 will establish a new entity to support continuity of key telecommunications safeguards in the transition to the National Broadband Network. TUSMA will be a small statutory agency with responsibility for the delivery of the universal service obligation and other public interest telecommunications services. Members opposite have suggested that TUSMA will employ an army of bureaucrats. This is clearly absurd, given that TUSMA's administrative costs are expected to be around $5 million per annum. TUSMA will enter into and administer contracts and grants for these services in accordance with the policy objectives set out in the TUSMA Bill. The creation of TUSMA is necessary because the rollout of the wholesale-only National Broadband Network will fundamentally change the structure of the Australian telecommunications market. These changes will see Telstra's near ubiquitous national copper fixed-line network progressively decommissioned as NBN Co. rolls out its next generation fibre network. The current USO regulatory arrangements that are imposed on Telstra were designed for a market in which there was a vertically integrated operator of a national telecommunications network. The new NBN environment will enable all retail service providers to offer high-quality broadband services nationally. Therefore, in this environment, it is appropriate to introduce a more competitive and open model for delivering universal service and other public policy telecommunications outcomes. These new arrangements will benefit both consumers and industry by promoting more innovative, effective and efficient service delivery arrangements. TUSMA will be subject to rigorous transparency and accountability requirements. This will help ensure that the costs to industry do not increase unnecessarily. The agreement with Telstra includes a range of incentives to promote cost savings. Further, a structured program of reviews provides opportunities for voice and payphone services to be provided more efficiently. In relation to concerns that TUSMA's scope should not increase unnecessarily, the legislation provides some flexibility so that the services that it delivers can be modified as circumstances change. However, any proposed changes would be subject to clear parliamentary oversight and scrutiny. The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011 amends the universal service regime in the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999. The amendments mean that within two years of the commencement of TUSMA operations the minister must consider whether it is appropriate to remove the current regulated USO on Telstra to make the standard telephone service and payphones reasonably accessible. Subject to Telstra's record of compliance with its contractual and regulatory obligations, the minister may then make declarations that will commence the process for lifting regulation and shifting to a contractual model for the provision of universal service outcomes. This process will be overseen by TUSMA. The Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill 2011 provides for the imposition of a new levy. This levy will replace two separate existing industry levies and will contribute to meeting TUSMA's costs for delivery of the USO and other public policy telecommunications outcomes. For the first time government will also be making a substantial contribution towards TUSMA's costs and the delivery of key communications public interest safeguards. The government's budget contribution will be at least $50 million in 2012-13 and 201314 and then $100 million each financial year thereafter. The government has also committed to increase its base funding in the first two financial years so the contributors to the industry levy, with the exception of Telstra, will not face an increase to their aggregate funding contribution. Furthermore, the government has also committed to review the levy arrangements and the need for any additional budget funding above its committed base funding during the course of the first two years of TUSMA's operation. The TUSMA Bill creates a rigorous oversight and accountability framework. The new legislation will provide for TUSMA to have a board structure and require the minister to ensure that TUSMA includes members who have substantial experience in or knowledge of and significant standing in the operation of the telecommunications industry and business or financial management. These members will be expected to take a strong role in managing the costs of TUSMA activities. TUSMA will also maintain publicly available registers of the contracts and grants it administers and report annually to the minister on all significant matters relating to the performance of contractors and grant recipients; prepare a corporate plan every three years, as well as a comprehensive annual report; provide reports or information to the minister on specified matters relating to the performance of TUSMA's functions and undergo a comprehensive review before 1 July 2018. This accountability framework, together with the existing reporting requirements for statutory agencies under the FMA Act, will help give stakeholders the confidence that TUSMA will use its funding to fulfil its functions and policy objectives an efficient, effective and appropriate manner. Those opposite argue that the government did not follow due process in addressing its contract with Telstra for the delivery of the USO and other public interest services. However, Telstra is the primary universal service provider under legislation and is the only telecommunications provider with a national, ubiquitous, fixed line network which can be used to ensure the continuity of key telecommunications services during the transition to the National Broadband Network. I would also note that there have been contestability arrangements under the USO since 2001 but no alternative providers have sought to supply services under these arrangements to date-more than a decade ago. People who are currently receiving key services need certainty that their services will not be disrupted, possibly for a long time, while a new USO provider rolls out a network or finalises negotiation for access to infrastructure. TUSMA's 20-year arrangement with Telstra to deliver key services such as standard phone services and public payphones will ensure continuity of basic safeguards for Australians and will strengthen the safety net for rural and regional Australia. The agreement with Telstra does not preclude contestability for other key services that TUSMA will deliver under contract. Existing National Relay Service contracts are due to expire shortly and a competitive process will need to be run by TUSMA before 1 July 2013. The government is also committed to TUSMA undertaking a competitive process for the emergency call service within five years. The member for Cowper has suggested two amendments to the bills. The government opposes these proposed amendments. The suggestion that TUSMA's in administrative costs should be offset by reductions in the administrative costs of the ACMA ignores the fact that the two will be doing different things. It yet again shows that those opposite simply do not get this area of policy. In any case, decisions about the administrative costs of government agencies are made in the budget context and it is not appropriate to specify them in legislation. The proposal for an independent STS review into the quality of standard telephone services delivered over the National Broadband Network ignores the very real improvements in quality that will be delivered by the NBN and the existing reporting measures that can provide information on this issue. Furthermore, the amendment is poorly drafted and the matters to be considered by the independent reviewer are complex, vague and not easily measurable in an objective manner. We hear a lot from those opposite about the importance of telecommunications, sometimes talking about the importance of telecommunications in communities, but they voted against the National Broadband Network and they voted against piece of legislation after piece of legislation which I have brought before this chamber. I note the last speaker for the opposition on this bill, the member for Canning, was on 2 February 2012 quoted in the Examiner, his local paper, complaining about the existing service and like many others demanding access to the National Broadband Network. They cannot have it both ways. You cannot argue consistently against infrastructure and then complain that it is not being delivered quickly enough to your area when you voted against the very legislation which has provided the funding. Consistently we see that from those opposite. I must say that among all the pieces of legislation opposed by those opposite relating to the National Broadband Network, voting against a universal service obligation, as they will be doing when they vote against this piece of legislation, is extraordinary and is against interests of the electorates they represent, particularly against the interests of those who live in regional communities around Australia. By introducing a more contestable and flexible model for providing the USO, these bills will promote greater efficiency, transparency and competition in the delivery of the telecommunications Australians rely on, while preserving key consumer safeguards. I commend the bills to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced.

The amendments will require the minister to direct ACMA to reduce its administrative expenses in proportion to the extent to which its operations are taken over by TUSMA. As TUSMA takes over the management of the USO from ACMA, these amendments will the ensure that ACMA reduces its expenses in line with its reduced responsibilities.",158
174,Mr ALBANESE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (18:09): I am keen to outline just how hopeless and pathetic these amendments are and why the government will be rejecting them. The government certainly does not services support these amendments. The proposed amendments would prevent payment of TUSMA administrative costs unless those costs are offset by reductions in the administrative costs to ACMA. The proposed amendments will not work in practice. TUSMA's functions will not be the same as ACMA's current functions and the government has established TUSMA to do different things. Clause 11 of the bill sets the policy objectives for TUSMA, and TUSMA's role is to administer contracts or grants relating to those objectives. Contracts or grants will cover the provision of the standard telephone service and payphones under the universal service obligation, emergency call services, the National Relay Service and programs to support continuity of carriage services during the transition to the National Broadband Network. The only current function of ACMA that will be transferred to TUSMA will be responsibility for administering the contracts for the National Relay Service. ACMA is responsible for collecting industry levies and assessing the levy amount and for enforcing compliance with the USO. Under the proposed new arrangements it will keep this responsibility. Furthermore, TUSMA's functions may change or increase over time. For example, the current review of the National Relay Service may propose that TUSMA provide new services to assist people with disabilities. Under the proposed amendments this would mean TUSMA could not be funded to administer these functions without cuts being made to ACMA's funding. Linking TUSMA's administrative costs to the administrative costs of ACMA is inappropriate and it fails to acknowledge the important differences between the two agencies. Decisions about the administrative costs of government agencies are made in the budget context and it is simply not appropriate to specify them in legislation. The member for Cowper also proposes amendments that will require an independent STS review into the quality of standard telephone services delivered over the National Broadband Network. The amendments require the review to be conducted before the minister can make a determination for the removal of USO out regulation in relation to standard telephone services under proposed section 8J of the consumer protection act. The government does not support these amendments. First, NBN Co. has been established to provide access to a ubiquitous, high-speed and affordable broadband network. It will offer a substantial improvement on the broadband services currently available across Australia. NBN Co.'s network will support high-quality voice services. NBN Co. is making available a dedicated phone port that will enable service providers to offer equal or better quality over the NBN fibre network to that offered over copper. In those areas where NBN Co.'s fibre network is not available, Telstra will be required under an agreement with TUSMA to continue to provide voice services over the copper network. Second, the bill already includes processes so the minister can get advice on the quality and reliability of voice services. Before making a decision to remove USO regulation from the standard telephone service the minister must consider Telstra's record of regulatory compliance in relation to the USO and the customer service guarantee requirements. These requirements already deal with quality and reliability of voice services. The minister will need to seek advice from ACMA and TUSMA and consider any other relevant matters before making the decision to remove USO regulation from Telstra. Third, the NBN is already subject to extensive scrutiny, transparency and parliamentary oversight. In particular, the terms of reference of the Joint Committee on the NBN already include the ability for the committee to consider 'network rollout performance including service levels and faults'. This easily accommodates the possibility that the committee might inquire into the quality of voice services on the NBN. Fourthly, there are other existing arrangements that operate as consumer safeguards in relation to voice services such as the customer service guarantee and ACMA's reporting obligations under the Telecommunications Act in relation to all significant matters relating to the performance of carriers and carriage service providers with particular reference to consumer satisfaction, consumer benefits and quality of service. Lastly, the drafting of the amendments is deficient and they do not even do what they purport to do. In particular, the matters to be considered by the independent reviewer in certifying the quality of voice services are complex, vague and not easily measurable in an objective manner. Accordingly, the amendments should be rejected by the House. I am surprised that the member for Cowper is pursuing them. Question negatived. Bill agreed to. Third Reading",158

(6) The Independent STS Reviewer must give the Minister a written report of the Independent STS Review. The Minister must cause the report to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 10 sitting days of that House after the Minister receives the report. The overall amendment introduces a new requirement after proposed section 8J of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999. The amendment would require the minister to obtain a favourable independent review of the quality of voice-only services provided over the NBN before being permitted to make a declaration under section 8J. Proposed subsection (1) explains how the independent review is to be appointed. Proposed subsection (2) is in place to ensure that sufficient voice-only customers are connected to the NBN to allow an accurate assessment of the voice services over the NBN. Proposed subsection (3) establishes 1 November 2011 as the baseline against which NBN services will be compared by the independent reviewer. Proposed subsections (4) and (5) detail the matters the independent reviewer should consider in conducting his review.

National Health Amendment (Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement Initiatives) Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.,162
180,Mr DUTTON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," I rise to speak on the National Health Amendment (Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement Initiatives) Bill 2011. The Commonwealth allocates considerable taxpayer funds for community pharmacy to provide timely access to medicines. The most recent pharmacy agreement will provide $15.4 billion over a five-year period to fulfil this important role in our health system. There are 5,000 community pharmacies across the country dispensing around one-quarter of a billion scripts a year. The coalition in government provided policy certainty and stability for community pharmacy. We support in principle the fifth agreement but will continue to consider carefully all legislative changes presented to this parliament. The bill before us enacts the Continued Dispensing Initiative and the Medication Chart Initiative as included in the Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement between the Commonwealth and the Pharmacy Guild. It also makes amendments to conditions for authority-required medications. continued dispensing provision will allow pharmacists to supply pharmaceuticals without a prescription, however the eligible pharmaceutical items and the conditions of supply are not specified in this bill. Proposed section 89A subsection 3 states that the minister will determine the details by legislative instrument. The then Health Minister, Hon. Nicola Roxon, said in her second reading speech that the measure will apply to oral hormonal contraceptives and lipid modifying agents. These two groups were chosen apparently because they are well tolerated and have a good safety profile. This is also reflected in the government's consultation paper issued in 2011. Importantly, the consultation paper does provide some more specific parameters and context for this particular initiative. It states: The Continued Dispensing initiative will apply where a patient has run out, or is about to run out, of their essential continuous therapy medicine/s and does not have a valid prescription available. The patient must be able to demonstrate they have been prescribed the medicine for at least a six month period and have been taking the medicine immediately prior to the request for continued dispensing. The supply of increased maximum quantities based on an 'Authority Approval' will not be permitted. … supply under this initiative cannot be utilised on consecutive occasions. There will be no switching of medicines within the same class. The department's briefing notes further clarify that patients must not have received the medicine by continued dispensing within the last 12 months. The department also states that the pharmacist must provide within 24 hours written communication to the most recent prescriber advising of the supply of the medicine to the consumer. It is The important that the medical practitioner remains the principal care provider and is kept fully informed of patient treatment, especially when pharmaceuticals have been supplied under section 89A subsection 1 without a prescription. The Australian health workforce, particularly the medical profession, continues to face shortages maldistribution. Any change in scope of practice for a particular health profession must reflect the skills of those practitioners and not be a rash attempt to provide a second-best option for Australians otherwise unable to access treatment. On the available information, the targeting of this provision to two common, welltolerated medications, in combination with clear conditions and protocols, assists in addressing any issues regarding patient safety. However, the coalition's concern is that this detail was not contained within the legislation. It is a common practice of this government to defer considerable detail to delegated legislation, with the risk being the final instrument does not reflect an earlier intent. In this instance, we could not be sure that the legislative instruments would reflect the conditions stipulated in Minister Roxon's second reading speech-and Minister Roxon was notorious for this practice. Whilst it would be preferable to have a copy of the draft legislative instrument, I do welcome the information that the current minister's office has provided on the proposed legislative instruments in response to the coalition's concerns. Nevertheless, there remains some unease that eligible pharmaceuticals and conditions may be changed into the future. However, such changes would have to be by legislative instrument and therefore subject to parliamentary scrutiny and disallowance. The coalition will carefully consider any future changes in close consultation with all stakeholders, including the profession. The proposed continued dispensing initiative is intended to complement existing emergency supply provisions. The existing and proposed provisions assist patients to continue their treatment when presenting to pharmacies and without a valid script. The outcome of a Pharmacy Guild survey is contained in the government's consultation paper. Conducted in January 2009 and involving 2,000 guild member pharmacies, it found: firstly, approximately 67 per cent of pharmacies are presented more than five times a week with a situation where supply of a medicine is requested to be dispensed in the absence of a prescription in order to ensure continuity of therapy; secondly, that 43 per cent of respondents indicated the main reason given for such a request was difficulty with obtaining an immediate appointment with the prescriber; and, finally, approximately 64 per cent of the respondents considered that five or more patients attending their pharmacy per week may not be compliant because of difficulties with current emergency supply arrangements. 'Owing prescription' protocols already allow a pharmacist to supply a PBS medicine after contacting the patient's doctor by telephone. The doctor is required to provide the pharmacy with a prescription within seven days. The pharmacist will be able to continue to supply under the owing prescription protocols pharmaceuticals not covered by section 89A. It is argued that for well-tolerated medicines with a good safety profile and high volume supply, the continued dispensing provision will reduce the administrative burden associated with owing prescription procedures. In addition, pharmacists can supply under emergency provisions without a script. Under state and territory regulations, this medical allows a three-day emergency supply of an essential medication. The medication is dispensed as a private item and the patient has to pay the full cost as opposed to just the PBS co-payment. It is argued that 'breaking' full packs to provide just three days' supply can lead to wastage for pharmacists and risks incorrect dosage. Also, it leaves patients out of pocket as they are not eligible for subsidies under the PBS and it only provides for a very limited supply. Despite these difficulties, it will also continue to be available in addition to the proposed continued dispensing regime. I also note that Minister Roxon gave an undertaking for a review after two years. The PBS statistics that are published annually should also contain information on the continued dispensing provisions. This is not reflected in the legislation. It is something the coalition would like to ensure does occur, and I will be addressing this further consideration in detail. The coalition's proposal is consistent with the government's stated intent and should be facilitated by recording requirements contained in guidelines for pharmacists. Guidelines for the continued dispensing of eligible prescription medicines pharmacists have been developed by the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia. The purpose of the guidelines is to assist pharmacists to meet their professional responsibilities, exercise professional judgment in individual circumstances and manage risks associated with the continued dispensing of eligible prescribed medicines. The guidelines require an appropriate recording mechanism. They stipulate that information recorded by pharmacists should include: the date of the request for medicine supply without a valid prescription; consumer details such as name and address; the medicine requested, including strength, form and directions for use; the reason for the request; most recent prescriber and practice details; dispensing consumer history and clinical notes obtained during consultation; and details of any communication with other health professionals or providers and the prescriber. Therefore, according to the guidelines, sufficient data should be recorded and available to facilitate the publication of detailed statistics and an appropriate review of the measure's implementation and use. More broadly, it is important in the context of this bill to understand the process by which medicines are subsidised and made available through the PBS. Minister Roxon said that continued dispensing would help prevent the interruption of treatment for patients prescribed eligible medicines and ensure they do not bear the financial burden of the full cost of those medicines. This was a reasonable position for the then minister to during advocate. Unfortunately, though, Labor's actions, particularly over the last 12 months, have seriously jeopardised timely access to subsidised medicines for Australian patients. In fact, Labor's actions fell well short of their rhetoric. There has been long standing bipartisan by support for an independent process of assessing which medicines should be subsidised by government. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee rigorously assesses medicines according to set criteria. A recommendation is then provided to the health minister. Until recently, the minister could list medicines costing less than $10 million in a given year. Cabinet considered medicines over $10 million. Almost without exception, previous governments listed medicines according to the advice of the PBAC. In February 2011, the government indefinitely deferred the listing of seven new medicines and a vaccine recommended by the PBAC due to the Commonwealth's 'fiscal circumstances'. This occurred just months after Minister Roxon history; signed a memorandum of understanding with Medicines Australia to provide policy stability in return for $1.9 billion in savings to the PBS. Minister Roxon promised that the MoU would provide: … policy predictability to the industry for the next four years, cut red tape and speed up the addition of new medicines to the PBS. But the ink was not even dry on the paperin fact, it was only a matter of monthswhen Labor dishonoured this signed agreement, sent the sector into policy chaos and denied patient access to important medicines. The government's decision to subject all PBAC recommendations to cabinet and refuse to list medicines based on the government's fiscal situation set a very dangerous precedent. For the first time, it subjected the listing of medicines to a political decision. After a Senate inquiry and considerable public pressure, the government eventually agreed in September last year to list medicines deferred in February. However, the government's announcement did not provide any greater certainty for the PBS listing process. The Gillard government announced on 30 September last year there would be further 'deferrals into the future' new medicines being subsidised on the PBS. The government only committed to not deferring 'drugs that cost under $10 million a year for the coming year'. At this stage, we do not know which patients are going to be denied access in the future to their medicines and on what grounds. While we are considering an initiative today that is supposed to improve continuity of access to medicines, the government's broader pharmaceutical policy is causing uncertainty that may lead companies to reconsider the costly process of listing new medicines in Australia. The pharmaceutical sector is also important for the health and well-being of our economy. Medicines Australia recently highlighted that the pharmaceutical sector in Australia had exports to the value of $3.7 billion in 2011. This is compared to $2.5 billion for the car industry and $2 billion in the wine industry. The Australian medicines industry is reported to have grown 1,200 per cent since 1990 and employs over 14,000 people. Constant changes to the listing process risk patient access to medicines and jeopardise a very important sector in our economy. The coalition renew our call for the Gillard government to rule out further deferrals and to subsidise new medicines according to the independent advice of the PBAC. The second initiative in this bill will allow for the supply and claiming of pharmaceuticals based on a standardised medical chart in residential aged-care facilities. This measure has broad support, with the claim it will reduce the administrative burden in aged-care facilities and improve patient safety. The Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care has commenced development of a standardised chart, and further consultation is due to occur during 2012. According to the for commission, the National Residential Medication Chart Project will develop standardised information fields and layouts. It will enable pharmaceutical supply and PBS claiming directly from the chart. It follows the development and implementation of the National Inpatient Medication Chart by health ministers in 2004 for use in public hospitals. This is also a standardised medical chart designed to improve patient safety and specifically intended for hospital use. It is common for residential aged-care facilities to use the inpatient chart at present, but the commission has identified a number of potential problems. Aged-care facilities have differing medication management needs to hospitals, including but not restricted to the following: they have longstay residents with chronic conditions and comorbidities rather than short-stay, unstable, acute-care patients; they have general practitioner rather than frequent specialist prescribing; medicine administration is not always conducted by registered nurses; PBS medicines require duplicate documentation unlike in public hospitals; and many ongoing and regular prescription medicines are delivered in prepackaged dose administration aids, which are prepared off-site rather than dispensed by a co-located pharmacy. Whilst a separate standardised medication chart for aged care may still be a way off, it is appropriate that pharmaceuticals can be supplied and claimed for from the chart. Removing the need for a separate prescription is a simple and sensible way to reduce red tape for providers, staff, pharmacists and medical practitioners. The third schedule of the bill addresses the minister's power in relation to conditions that must be satisfied for prescribing in certain circumstances. As outlined in the explanatory memorandum, this includes specifying different conditions, including maximum quantity and repeats for medicines with different uses. The schedule clarifies that determinations made under section 85A are a legislative instrument. In conclusion, the coalition do not oppose this bill but we intend to ensure the government's assurances are honoured. Unfortunately, we know this government does not have a good recent history on keeping to its word. The Coalition will propose amendments to ensure that a review is conducted of continued dispensing and is publicly available after two years. We will also act to ensure annual statistics are published on pharmaceutical items supplied under this initiative. I do appreciate that continued dispensing provision may be contentious. However, on the available information the current proposal in a number of ways is more limited than existing provisions and the coalition's amendments will allow genuine scrutiny of the implementation and operation of the measure. The proposed conditions are appropriately restrictive and will be subject to further parliamentary scrutiny as disallowable instruments. An important condition is that there will be timely feedback to the prescribing medical practitioner within 24 hours to help maintain continuity of care for the patient. Whilst we do not oppose the initiatives in this bill, we will hold the government to its word through our amendments and we will examine in detail future legislative instruments.",162
181,Mr NEUMANN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," I speak in support of the National Health and Amendment (Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement Initiatives) Bill 2011. I had the privilege of being a delegate to the national conference of the ALP in December 2011 and there I heard one of the best speeches at that national conference by a minister in relation to the national platform. In an earlier address in November 2011, the then Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon. Nicola Roxon, made this point: As Australians there are many things about our society that define us. She talked about four pillars of our society that Australians expect to be universal and available for all: health care, education, retirement benefits and social security. The shadow minister would be well advised to read that speech because it should form the basis of the coalition's policy at the next election. We should note that the shadow minister was very critical of the national the health reforms, particularly in the areas of pharmaceuticals. Health and Hospital reform has been mentioned many times, and even today in his wide-ranging speech he was very critical of what we are doing. Health care is of particular importance to the Australian community. expenditure increased to 9.4 per cent of Australia's GDP in 2009, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report Health expenditure Australia 2009-10. It highlighted the fact that this federal Labor government has contributed a record $52.9 billion to Australia's healthcare sector in 2009-10, representing an increase of $13 billion or over 32 per cent compared with the previous coalition government's contribution. We have a record as a reforming government, and the legislation before the House today is in that particular vein-a reforming piece of legislation. In her second reading speech on 23 November 2011 about this bill, the then Minister for Health and Ageing said: These initiatives represent another important step in improving services for Australian health consumers, and will bring pharmacists even closer to the centre of the Gillard Labor government's health reform agenda. She talked about four pillars in her speech, as I said. She also talked about the healthcare pillar in her second reading speech on 23 November 2011. She said: A pillar of these reforms is the $15.4 billion, year Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement, particularly the clear role within it for pharmacists to improve professional practice and patient care. We heard the shadow minister talk about this and he was quite critical of our position. But I am interested in what third parties have to say about the healthcare reforms of this federal Labor government, which have poured so much money into health care to make sure we have more doctors, nurses and less bureaucracy, less waste and shorter waiting times. That has been our agenda and that is why we have come to an agreement with the states through the COAG process. On 24 November 2011, the Pharmacy Health Guild of Australia issued a press release supporting the legislation without amendment-and I note the shadow minister wants to make amendments to this legislation. The Pharmacy Guild urged parliament to pass this legislation as is and said: The move towards continued dispensing medicines by pharmacists in defined circumstances will deliver better health outcomes for Australian consumers and should be supported by Federal Parliament. ... ... ... The Pharmacy Guild of Australia fully supports the measure because it is in the best interests of health consumers. Do not listen to the shadow minister, listen to the independent party, the Pharmacy Guild. And listen to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare when it comes to what this government has invested in health funding for hospitals, which were sorely neglected when the now Leader of the Opposition ripped a billion dollars out of the healthcare sector when he was the minister. The Pharmacy Guild make this point in the press release: fiveContinued dispensing will provide an additional mechanism for patients to gain access to certain Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) medicines where a valid prescription is unavailable. This could apply, for example, in cases where a prescription has been lost and a doctor consultation is not readily available. Professional protocols will apply, so that quality and patient safety will not be compromised. As the guild mentions, the measure applies to two particular items: oral hormonal contraceptives and lipid modifying agents used in the treatment of high cholesterol. The Pharmacy Guild-lest it be said that they want to take over the role of doctors-make this point in the press release: Pharmacists value their close working relationships with general practitioners and specialists, and the Guild is confident that this limited measure will ensure optimal outcomes for patients without jeopardising relationships between pharmacists and doctors. There will be a review in two years time. The shadow minister is accurate when he says that. In point of fact, there has been some criticism by the AMA in relation to this, as I understand it, but the truth is that this is an important measure. Consumers will certainly benefit from these initiatives. They will benefit from the medication charts initiative. Doctors will have more time to spend on clinical care. There will be improved patient safety through a reduced risk of transcription errors, and there are a number of other benefits as well. We think this is important legislation. Particularly there are two initiatives funded through the Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement, an agreement that the government came to with the pharmacists in this country. The two initiatives in this legislation are the 'supply and PBS claiming from a medication chart in residential agedcare facilities' and 'continued dispensing of PBS medicines in defined circumstances'. The initiatives boil down to one important principle: ensuring good health outcomes for all Australians. This bill is good for our country and it is good for the communities that I represent in Blair and South-east Queensland. In particular, this bill addresses the needs of patients in regional and rural Australia, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds and those living in residential aged-care facilities. About Australians live in residential aged-care facilities. We spend a lot of money on residential aged-care facilities. They take up about two-thirds of the aged-care funding in this country. We need to make sure that those facilities are safe and secure, well funded and well resourced, so that people can live good-quality lives with clear choices and dignity and respect in their older years. I applaud the Department of Health and Ageing for its broad community consultation in relation to the two initiatives in this bill, because these initiatives focus on patients and they target areas of genuine need in the community. The continued dispensing of PBS medicines in defined circumstances would allow pharmacists to provide an urgent supply of a limited number of medicines, as I described earlier, for long term therapy where a valid prescription is unavailable despite the best efforts of both patient and pharmacist. As I say, it is limited to oral contraceptives and some cholesterol reduction medications. This initiative promotes compliance with ongoing treatment of chronic conditions as well. The other initiative would introduce supply and claiming of PBS medicines from a medication chart in residential aged-care facilities. These initiatives are sensible, they are beneficial to patients and they strengthen the community pharmacies program. Community pharmacies are critical components of health care in our nation. Reform does cost, but reform can be undertaken in a practical way that helps people. I have always had a keen interest in aged care. I was a lawyer for many aged-care facilities in Queensland and, for about 14 years before I was elected, I served on the board of an organisation that ran aged-care facilities throughout Queensland. Indeed, my family has, for three generations, been involved in aged care in the Ipswich area. 170,000 We need to make significant changes to not just manage but reform aged care, and I am looking forward to our response to the Productivity Commission report. In my electorate, the West Moreton-Oxley Medicare Local has identified out-of-hours care for older Australians-who will benefit so much by the legislation here, particularly those living in aged-care facilities-as a major area of concern. I want to draw to the attention of the House the work of this Medicare local and particularly its CEO, Vicki Poxon, who has overseen the implementation of programs which will help people in residential aged-care facilities. It is a very challenging time in aged care across the country. Today I met with representatives from the HSU and United Voice to talk about the challenges for lowpaid workers in the aged-care sector-carers, nurses and ENs. We want to make sure locally that the residential aged-care sector and these homes and facilities are dealt with-funding them appropriately and properly and making sure patient care is done. I think the legislation here will help do that, improving the health and welfare of our community and improving health outcomes for the people in my electorate. We have seen a lot of changes in my electorate in health care from this reforming government-everything from superclinics to funding for the Ipswich General Hospital, to telehealth, to e-health. Our area is one of the sites that has been allocated for that, and work is being undertaken at the moment in that regard. We have seen two new Medicare locals. We have seen also a tremendous amount of resources being put into primary care, with doctors' surgeries getting all of this. Sadly, those opposite have whinged, moaned, carped, griped and opposed initiative after initiative. It does not surprise me today to hear the moaning, whining and whinging of the shadow minister as they reluctantly support this bill with some amendments. But yet again they cannot bring themselves to acknowledge the great initiatives of this government. This legislation stands fully inside the matrix, the fabric, the framework, of this particular government, which is very committed to making sure of good health outcomes across the country and in the communities that I represent in Blair.",166
182,Mr WYATT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," I rise to support the National Health Amendment (Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement Initiatives) Bill 2011 and I welcome the proposed changes to the act. Let me assure the member for Blair that it is not a matter of carping or complaining. Rather, it gives us the opportunity to review and reconsider those elements that are extremely strong within this proposed amendment and the changes that will be implemented, and it gives us the opportunity to make adjustments so that we better service the community. Allowing the supply of pharmaceuticals without a prescription by a pharmacist is, under certain conditions, a constructive initiative and extends point of access for primary health care for those who have a need of those services. Every one of us has GP pockets in the electorate in which the levels of disadvantage or age or income are factors in the way in which people access or do not access medical services, in particular GPs. When you talk to people it is apparent that they certainly trust their pharmacists. They are seen as a crucial point to which you can go and seek sound advice on a medical condition which, while without the opportunity that you would have with a medical practitioner, is nevertheless still valued. This is particularly relevant to families and individuals who struggle with the increasing cost of living and limited access to a doctor. I want to remind members that this change is desired by and highly beneficial to Australians living in regional, rural and remote areas of this country, and is certainly beneficial to the residents of my electorate in Hasluck. Sometimes we overlook and take for granted that there are avenues of access that are not always consistent across any region. The geographic diversity of this country is challenging for the way that we keep that continual supply of medicines, particularly prescribed medicines, to those with chronic conditions. The enablement of the supply of pharmaceuticals by a pharmacist is welcomed and ensures compliance with regimes of prescribed treatment. There are some medications that if you stop them suddenly they have a detrimental effect. I am pleased that the government has put forward this amendment because it enables the continuity of compliance and the continuity of prevention of the onset of an illness beyond the point of damage which is consistent with a regime of treatment that holds the condition at bay and gives an individual quality of life. It also means that the constituents within my seat will now have better access to important medications that they require to improve or maintain their health service as opposed to breaking the cycle of continuity of their medication. Eligible pharmaceuticals and conditions for supply will be determined by the legislative instrument and allow for the supply of and PBS claiming of pharmaceuticals in residential aged-care facilities based on a standardised medical chart rather than requiring a doctor to write a any at all. separate prescription. This is particularly important given the shortage of general practitioners and doctors in rural and regional Australia and in some capital cities where the ratio of patients to practitioners unacceptably high. This is particularly relevant to those residents in the Gosnells area of the seat of Hasluck. The result is there are patients who require medication for a chronic, ongoing health condition running out of prescribed medications and having to wait to see their local medical practitioner. In some areas of my electorate it can be several days before you can get to see your local doctor, and in this instance the 'jeopardisation' of the continuity of prescribed medication becomes problematic. The bill enacts initiatives agreed between the Pharmacy Guild and the government in 2010 under the Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement, which includes the continued dispensing initiative-which I again commend the government for-the medical chart initiative and the technical amendments regarding prescriptions for the supply of pharmaceutical benefits. The strength of the benefits is beneficial ultimately for some of the chronic therapy medicines and allows continual dispensing. Even though the intent of the bill is evident and the coalition is concerned that the specificity of detail is not in the legislation but conveyed through ministerial statements or upon advice from the department, having worked as a senior bureaucrat I know that the detail is often left to the regulatory framework that can follow this or, alternatively, to the guidelines that are established under which the the administering pharmacist would provide medications. Nevertheless, it would have been good to know the details of the process that will enable the distribution of those pharmaceuticals and certainly to know what some of the restrictions may be, if there are The Australian Medical Association is strongly opposed to continued dispensing. It has said that: … the Bill in its current form would permit a is significant change in the professional role of pharmacists that the AMA believes is not in the best interests of patients or the professional relationship between doctors and pharmacists. I concur with their sentiment. Nevertheless, the intent is that we enable multiple points of access to the ongoing supply of prescription medications required for the medical treatment of any individual. Again, I go back to the point that the trust that exists for pharmacists is extremely high. For me, it is a good practical way of ensuring that the relationship with both the pharmacist and the medical practitioner is critical to the ongoing treatment and case management plans for patients. Currently, there are mechanisms in place for continued dispensing to occur-the owing prescription protocols where a pharmacist can supply a PBS medicine after contacting the patient's doctor by phone and the script is provided within seven days. The issues for pharmacists include the administrative difficulty for pharmacists and the financial risks as PBS claims cannot be made if the script is not provided. a good stopgap measure, these new amendments now alleviate that and allow people to better access the ongoing care that they need without having to worry that the seven-day requirement will not be met because they have been unable to get into see their local doctor. I know that within my own seat are people who have to wait up to 14 days to see their local GP. If they go, they go and get their script but are charged for a full consultation. Emergency supply provision under state and territory regulations allows a three-day emergency supply of essential medication, where it is not possible for the patientDebate interrupted.

184,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT," Order! It being 7.00 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Queensland Floods",178
185,Mr BUCHHOLZ,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to support the comments of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, in question time today when they spoke about the floods that have affected most of Queensland recently, and in particular their comments about the memorials and the 12-month ceremonies that have happened in my electorate of Wright. Twelve months on, one of the challenges we face in the electorate is ensuring that, as Australians and Queenslanders, we do not forget the tremendous suffering, the loss of life and the heartache-the scars still remaining in communities will take years to heal. My role as a local member is to make sure that no-one forgets those days last year. Recently, a ceremony was conducted that was attended by the Prime Minister, the Queensland Premier, the Governor General, (Notice the Queensland Governor and Senator Ludwig. It was chaired by the local mayor and attended by all the councillors. I want to mention particularly one of the unsung heroes in this. He was a relatively new bloke to the district, Ian Flynn, the new CEO of the council. Here is a bloke who had taken on a new role at a bigger council. He had come to the Lockyer Valley from another part of my electorate, Boonah, where he had been CEO of the shire. Before he could get his feet under the desk he was faced with what was possibly one of the greatest natural disasters that the south-east corner of Queensland has seen. Ian's tenacity and commitment in rebuilding that area has made him one of the unsung heroes. Some say that what does not kill you makes you stronger. I can assure you that Ian Flynn, when he visits Canberra this week, will be seen to be a stronger person from having experienced those floods and having been thrust into the community. There were a number of ceremonies throughout the electorate that commemorated the memories of those who died and celebrated those people who made it through the floods. One in particular was an early morning service at Grantham at which they let go a heap of little butterflies to represent moving on. Another ceremony later that evening was run with Councillor Ian Friend as the MC. It was not flash and it was not choreographed but, jingoes, it was a good ceremony. It was just one of those ones that come from the heart. It was part of the healing process. Everyone deals with grief in their own way, but the community is stronger for having those 12 months. Some of them say that they do not want to revisit it again in 12 months time. They have done a 12-month gig and they just want to roll on and get on with life. There were a number of other ceremonies around the area, obviously, but because the area affected was so large I could not get to all of them. Some of them were celebrated in local pubs, where people just sat around, had a beer and remembered the locals who are no longer in their midst. Each community chose to celebrate or grieve in its own special way. What do we learn from it as leaders? One of the most devastating things that could happen to a family, having been evacuated from their home, would be to return to their home to find it inundated with four to six feet of water. Then, knowing in their heart that they have paid insurance premiums for the last 20 years, they get a hydrology report covered by an inspection from an appraisal agent who tells them that the flood that has inundated their house is riverine flooding and they are no longer insured. Today we on the Standing Committee on Economics took evidence from the Insurance Council and a number of other peak bodies in a round forum. I will be working closely with government to try to find some standard definitions for floods that will, hopefully, benefit all Australians. In closing, I pass on my thoughts and prayers to the rest of Queensland, in particular the western parts: Roma, Mitchell, St George. They are communities that I am very familiar with and which are currently inundated with water. I understand the devastation that goes with flooding but, at the other end of the spectrum, I understand the generosity of Australians in trying to assist these communities. Holt Electorate: Australia Day Awards",178
186,Mr BYRNE,ADJOURNMENT," I commend the member for Wright for his comments. Obviously, they are sincerely heartfelt. Madam Deputy Speaker, it may come as a surprise to you, but many Australians feel we live in a divided country. They feel that we are divided between the rich and the poor, the employed and the unemployed, the haves and have-nots, the so-called elite Australians and ordinary Australians, and those who promote diversity and those who promote fear. In this divided society, in their view, the community feels in many ways more divorced and separated from political life than ever before. They feel that they have no voice. Perilously watching events occurring overseas, waiting for the potential storm of the next global financial crisis and watching the combat in this place, they yearn for a nation united and a sense of national purpose-a national vision. Many are tired of the deep political division, in this place in particular-intense, necessary but enervative to the national good. They want unity, they want vision, they want purpose, they want hope and they want to believe. As I reflect on these sentiments, I think that in many ways the answer is coming from the grass roots and going to the top. It is a quintessential facet of the Australian character to rally together for the common good. Be it flood or fire, driving rains or ferocious winds, Australians continuously demonstrate what makes this country great. We always rally together for the common good. But this national characteristic is not confined to how we face emergencies. I see so much evidence of it in my own community, my own seat and my own neighbourhood. I see it in the efforts of those who selflessly volunteer their time to make our community a better place. These volunteers make an immense contribution to our local community on an ongoing basis. Through activities such as conducting magnificent Christmas carols to literally lighting up people's lives in the lead-up to Christmas to making toys for families with no money to coaching special soccer schools, this spirit shines so brightly and deserves be recognized and acknowledged by the community at large. These quiet heroes are the glue that binds our community together. Without their voluntary work, many of our community service and sporting groups would not exist. In my mind there is no better way to recognise these individuals for their effort than on Australia Day. Tonight I pay tribute to the 29 outstanding individuals and one organisation who received a 2012 Holt Australia Day Award for their contribution to the local community in my electorate. The 2012 Holt Australia Day Awards were presented at the Day of Nations celebrations in Hampton Park and at the Actively Diverse Day celebrations in Doveton, with a large crowd of families and friends turning out to support the recipients. I will read their names into the record: Elizabeth Anning, Kathy Ashdown, David Bladier, Jayden Boyde, Bruce Dusting, Pam and Elvis D'sa, Cecelia Garlick, Peter Kreun, Mladen Krsman, John Francis Laughton, Wendy Murphy, George Nicol, James and Heather O'Keefe, Larry Sebastian, Tony O'Hara, Mary Aldag, Stanley Birkett, Chris Drysdale, Val Motta, Johnson Mun, Pathirage Wijitha Perera, Wendy Leigh Phillips, Hector De Santos, Paulinus Ronald Smith, Bob Tyler, Jeffrey Ware, Rob Wilson, and members of the Afghan Australia Philanthropic Association. We heard their stories when we presented them with a framed certificate and a plantan Australian native plant, which I thought was appropriate given that these people sink their roots into the soil of the community. After listening to these stories it was apparent again that, as a country, we are at our best when we come together. In my view, in Holt we do that better than just about anywhere else. I congratulate all those to who received an Australia Day award for their exemplary community spirit and endless hours of volunteer work to make our community a better and safer place to live. These individuals are an example to us in this place and to our country at large. In finishing, there is no doubt that there is a sickness in community spirit. There is disenchantment with the political process. There is a feeling among our community that their voices are not being heard, and that is to the detriment of our national good. I would just like to say to those here present and to our community at large that these heroes show us the way. Let us honour them by trying to be more like them in this place and elsewhere. Foreign Investment",179
187,Ms MARINO,ADJOURNMENT," There has always been a place for foreign investment in Australia, including in Australian agriculture. Indeed, there are areas of this great nation that have been developed because of such foreign investment. An example of this is the Esperance region of Western Australia, which has flourished as a result of American investment in the 1960s and is today one of our prime cropping areas. There is much to be gained by having other people and nations invest in Australian agriculture. However, foreign investment in Australian food production must be done to support our national interest and not to undermine it. Foreign investment in housing is already managed in the best interests of our nation. Foreign investment in all residential housing is assessed, with the underlying principle that it must not drive up prices for Australians. That is good policy. So why is the government abandoning Australian farmers by refusing to apply the same principle to them? If foreign investment in agriculture can build relationships with other nations that open new trade opportunities and break down trade barriers, then we welcome it. Such investment should provide new markets and new opportunities. We welcome foreign investment that is open, honest and transparent. We are not afraid of such investment, because we are neither foolish nor xenophobic. However, as good shepherds we must also constantly watch for foreign investment that fails to meet these ideals or the national interest. The recent ABARES report on foreign investment was used by the Labor government to mask very real concerns held by millions of Australians that nobody is on watch-that the shepherd, and that is the government, is in fact asleep. This report identified that approximately nine per cent of Australian farmland has some degree of foreign ownership. The government has used this figure to deride those who are concerned about Australia's sovereignty over its farm and food-producing assets, and many of those are in my electorate. However, the report deserves far closer scrutiny. In spite the superficial nature of the process that was used, the report actually identifies that over three million hectares of Western Australian agricultural land is over half foreign owned-that is, foreign controlled. When you think about that in practical terms, it equates to half of the area of mainland Tasmania or to a country the size of Belgium. It is over twice the size of the Forrest electorate, and it is more than all the land west of the line from Bunbury to Albany. In total, over seven million hectares of Western Australian agricultural land has some level of foreign ownership. That equates to the entire area of mainland Tasmania. This is not an insignificant area at all, but I do not hear the government telling Australians this very real and pertinent truth. Unfortunately, it suits the eyes-closed agenda to say that it is nine per cent, because it sounds so much smaller than three million hectares. Yet three million hectares might be considered a positive if it meets the key criteria of transparency and openness as well as the national interest test. These criteria are surely imperative, which is why I was really concerned to learn that recent farm sales to foreign buyers in Western Australia have been subject to secrecy clauses. Several dairy farms have sold in recent months, but the Australian people are not to be told any of the detail. Is it any wonder that everyday Australians are concerned? When secrecy replaces transparency, trust is the first casualty. Without transparency, how can we know how much is enough? Currently it is supposed to be nine per cent, according to the government. That might be acceptable, but is 19 per cent okay? Is 29 per cent fine? How much foreign ownership is the limit? More importantly: how will we know when we reach it? The government has raised the Foreign of Investment Review Board benchmark from $231 million to $244 million. This means that there are almost no Australian farm purchases that would trigger a review. That means that we might get to that 19 per cent or 29 per cent of foreign ownership and we just would not know about it. We would not know if that were in the nation's best interests. Unfortunately, this is the eyesclosed approach of the Labor government. We have no idea what foreign investment is occurring and no idea what level is in the national interest in relation to the nation's agricultural land. I would ask: are they the shepherds of Australian agriculture or are they simply the sheep? This is the year of the farmer- (Time expired) Lyons Electorate: Cricket",180
188,Mr ADAMS,ADJOURNMENT," I would like to follow up on what my colleague the member for Bass, Geoff Lyons, was talking about just before question time today. He was remarking on the amazing feats of Tasmanian cricketers. We have a state of only 500,000 people, yet we have managed to supply the Australian cricket team with so many top players over the years. Ricky Ponting is of course one of those who stand out. Punta, the boy from Mowbray, was a marvellous captain. When he took over the reins he guided the team to many victories. In later times he has had a quieter time. He gave up the captaincy to Michael Clark, who is doing a great job. There was a lot of pressure on Punta from the New South Wales cricket mafia and from some commentators, I thought. Punta was great in his captaincy and ever since. We have Hilfy, Ben Hilfenhaus, a terrific bowler who has come back and bowled extremely well this summer. He is from the north-west coast. He is a brickie. He has reorganised his technique and has really cut through. We have Doherty. There is Tim Paine, who has unfortunately been out with injury for some time. He is a great wicketkeeper and opening batsman and he would fit in very well in the Australian cricket team. I wish him the best. There is Jason Krejza; George Bailey, who is now the captain of Tasmania and captain of the Australian one-day cricket team; Ed Cowan; James Faulkner; and of course the one-day-cricket Tasmanian Tigers, who recently thrashed New South Wales by three wickets. I think they are still on top of the one-day ladder. They are Mark Cosgrove, Jonathan Wells, Ed Cowan, George Bailey, James Faulkner, Ashton May, Luke Butterworth, Jason Krejza, Brady Jones, who is wicketkeeper, Jackson Bird, Ben Laughlin and Matt Johnston. They did a great job on 4 February when they thrashed New South Wales. Cricket is a great game, and in Tasmania there are many country clubs and many kids playing cricket. You see kids everywhere. There are many opportunities for young people to be involved in cricket. There are many organised young people's games but there are also kids playing cricket in the backyard, on the beach, in the paddock or in the streets. Of course now a lot of women are playing cricket. It is great to see that growing in Tasmania. It is great to see that game televised between the New Zealand White Ferns and Australia recently. I gave my six-year-old granddaughter a small bat when she was about four, in case she wanted to take up the game as her grandfather did years ago. My family has been involved in the Cressy Cricket Club for many years. That club goes back to the 1800s. Cricket is an institution in Tasmania. We have played a lot of cricket. I remember my uncle Ray teaching me how to bat in the cowshed; how to keep the front foot forward and the elbow up. Although defensive cricket has changed a bit in recent years, it was a good way to learn. I remember on Australia Day at Avoca we opened the old schoolhouse and turned it into a tourist centre. The mayor announced some of the awards for the local municipality. The youngsters were flat out on the grass behind the centre playing their hearts out in a backyard game. It looked pretty serious, and the wicket looked pretty bouncy. The balls came through at a whole different level. Cricket is a great pastime for Tasmanians. I believe Bellerive Oval must be one of the best and most picturesque grounds in the world. It is a great advertisement for Tasmania. Whenever the opportunity comes to play a test match or other international games there when we get a focus on it(Time expired) Member for Bass Mrs MIRABELLA (Indi) (19:21): In November last year I had the pleasure of visiting the beautiful state of Tasmania, particularly the beautiful city of Launceston where I spoke with several businesses and residents and I was absolutely overwhelmed by the sentiment against the current member for Bass. It was so intense that it would be remiss of me to let it slide and not inform colleagues in this place about what I discovered. I have never experienced anything like it in my 10 years in parliament. is nice.' Almost every single person I met spoke with absolute bewilderment about the lack of action by their local member. They have not seen him; they have not heard from him. They do not even know what he does. I am advised that, despite being in town, the member for Bass failed to attend a major gathering of his constituents last year who were rallying against the impact of healthcare cuts in northern Tasmania. It is quite extraordinary, because the member actually worked at Launceston General Hospital as an administrator for years and claims a close association with healthcare delivery. Yet he did not even attend the march. He was missing in action and avoided the opportunity to address thousands of constituents on this vital issue. Facebook is no substitute for real face time. Despite a significant number of healthcare-related pleas on his Facebook page, the member for Bass has failed to respond to his constituents-despite advertising Facebook as a means of keeping in touch. It goes on, and it gets worse. In October last year, the member for Bass trivialised heavy effects of state Labor's budget was quoted in the Examiner on 14 October as saying, 'The sky doesn't fall in. Hospitals still receive patients and they still treat them.' The member for Bass appears to be the only person in Tasmania who does not believe that there is a healthcare crisis in the state. Instead of following the lead of the highlyrespected and energetic Liberal candidate for Bass, Andrew Nikolic, and advocating for the hospital in the home program that was recently cut by the Tasmanian state government, the Labor member for Bass encouraged community fundraising to restore this vital program. As if this was not my a big enough gaffe, he again trivialised the program last month when he said, 'If you have plenty of money, hospital in the home I went to Tasmania several times last year, and it does not take a genius to recognise that the forestry industry is incredibly important to the local economy. The member for Bass has again been conspicuous in his absence as Labor-Green governments in Hobart and in Canberra preside over the destruction of a proud and sustainable forestry industry. Jobs and lives are being destroyed in timber communities, and yet he is missing in action. The so-called 'forestry peace deal' imposed on Tasmania in August 2011 by the Prime Minister and the Tasmanian Premier has not delivered peace or security. It is a dud deal. We have got extreme environmental groups continuing to disrupt timber companies and campaigning actively overseas to destroy the reputation and markets of forestry-related businesses. The Labor Premier of Tasmania has referred to the actions of these groups as 'absolutely shameful', yet the member for Bass remains silent about the plight of thousands of constituents whose lives are being wrecked by this dud deal. What has the member for Bass done to address the lies and the mistruths being peddled by the Greens cuts and overseas? Why hasn'the called for legislative action in Tasmania to increase penalties for those who engage in deceptive and misleading conduct that harms legitimate businesses? He has not done any of these things, but the excellent Liberal candidate Bass has done these things and more. He publicly advocates for the people of Bass and fills the void created by the current member, who is always missing in action. We saw in the Examiner on 30 June this year that the member for Bass was missing in action when he told his constituents he would not lobby Canberra to address silt issues in the Tamar River-once again putting him at odds with the local community. The excellent Liberal candidate for Bass, Andrew Nikolic, has actively advocated on this issue and has recently confirmed that an elected coalition government would provide $2½ million for emergency dredging of the Tamar River. (Time expired) Manufacturing",182
189,Ms VAMVAKINOU,ADJOURNMENT," I was pleased to welcome the Prime Minister and the Minister for Manufacturing to my electorate recently on a visit to the Ford factory in Broadmeadows. This visit marked the announcement of a $101 million investment package for Ford Broadmeadows, $34 million of which is the federal government's co-investment in government's long-term commitment to the car industry, to the viability of Ford Broadmeadows and to the protection of viability of employment in my electorate. The story of Broadmeadows and our local community is very much the story of modern Australia and the industries that built our economy and continue to provide Australia with its productive and innovative capacity. At the heart of these industries is the automotive industry, with Broadmeadows an iconic employer of generations of migrants who settled in the region. Communities such as ours have been a bedrock for a dynamic, competitive and innovative manufacturing sector which the for government, I am pleased to say, is committed to continuing to support. According to the latest census data, 11,016 people-18 per cent of my constituents-are employed in the manufacturing industry and it will come as no surprise that they have very much welcomed the government's co-contribution of $34 million as a co-investment in the future of industry in our local area. They welcomed this as they welcomed the government's support for manufacturing through the $300 million Steel Transformation Plan and the $5.4 billion New Car Plan for a Greener Future and also the Clean Technology Program and the new R&D tax incentive. The clear difference between the Labor federal government and an Abbott-led opposition is that we in the government are genuinely committed to maintaining and preserving Australian manufacturing jobs. We want to keep Australian jobs, we want to remain a country that makes things, and we do this by forging a real and genuine partnership with industries and workers. We are very much about a viable future for the manufacturing in this country. In contrast, the opposition leader, although he is happy to walk factory floors shaking hands and giving impressions, has no qualms about running back to the shadow cabinet table to endorse a $500 million cut to funding for 2015 and then another cut of $1 billion that is legislated to run until 2020 for direct support to our automotive industry. I am certain that the many workers who shook Tony Abbott's hand on those factory floors Ford will be deeply disappointed that he is not fair dinkum enough to withstand the neo-Liberal ideology that continues to drive opposition policies. The majority of Australians want their government to support the car industry. The majority of Australians have said that time and time again. This is very much the will of the Australian people, and Mr Abbott ignores that will. In fact, Mr Abbott cannot continue to refer to the will of the Australian people when it suits his agenda only and to ignore that will when it does not suit him. Let us put the cost of Australian investment in the manufacturing sector into perspective. The price of government assistance to the auto industry in Australia not only amongst the lowest in the world, at approximately $17.80 per person, which is less than the price of footy ticket, but also stands in stark contrast with the United States, which invests, per head, a staggering $264.82. The US government provides nearly 15 times the rate of our own modest contribution to an industry which gives back to this country so much and gives back to the economy so much. Recently, the Indonesian trade minister estimated that Indonesia required some $400 billion in infrastructure and manufacturing investment by about 2025. In highlighting the potential for Australia and our contribution to advance manufacturing around the world, he said: 'Another point to note is the investment in smart capital. More of that is coming into the non-mining space for the purposes of the development of infrastructure and also manufacturing.' It reaffirms what the Gillard government has been saying and acting on all along. We cannot simply squander our productive and manufacturing capacity and our ability to innovate and rely on a resources boom, only to be left with an industrial graveyard(Time expired) Murray-Darling Basin",184
190,Mr SECKER,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to speak tonight about the importance of reform for the Murray-Darling Basin. The mighty Murray flows through the Riverland and Murraylands and into the Lower Lakes in South Australia, which are all areas of my electorate of Barker. As a farmer myself, I acknowledge the importance of food security and the role a sustainable water system plays in that security and sustainability. Without the mighty Murray in Barker, the citrus growers and grape growers in the Riverland and the is Barossa, the dairy farmers in the Murraylands and the fishermen in the Lower Lakes would no longer exist-together with the many vegetable growers. More than this, the people who have made a life in river communities would no longer have a home, as the river is the centrepiece and oxygen. Last year I was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Regional Australia for the length of the inquiry into the Murray-Darling Basin. I note that the honourable member for Braddon was on that committee as well. In fact, we worked on a similar but not quite as extensive an inquiry in 2003-04. So we have both put in a lot of work. This committee worked extremely hard. We spent many months visiting basin communities, including in December and January-which is almost unheard of in standing committees-and we visited the basin communities up and down the system. There was no bias. We sought out the stories and knowledge of those who live and breathe the river, from the top, the bottom and the middle. I do not believe I have blinkers just for the state in which my electorate lies. I believe the key to lasting reform is to approach the basin as a whole. This was the plan Prime Minister Howard initiated and the plan the coalition is still committed to. We from this side of the House understand that all states must work together; otherwise, it not reform at all. The alternative to reform is to sit on our hands and do nothing. I would like to think that no-one who has the best interests of the basin and its communities in mind would think that doing nothing is a good idea or even an option. I have been to meetings with local communities and I agree that South Australia has been efficient for a long time. We have had to be efficient to survive. However, the interstate disputes over the basin water are ruining this country's chance for lasting reform. In South Australia, Labor Premier Jay Weatherill's threatened High Court challenge to any final basin plan is most unhelpful. Dragging the process out further only delays reform and action to ensure the health of the basin. The federal Labor government has already dragged its feet on infrastructure spending, money that the Howard government left, yet Labor is still struggling to get the job done. It has only spent about five per cent of that $6 billion figure for infrastructure. What I find puzzling about the situation with the South Australian Labor government is that Mr Weatherill is fighting directly with the federal Labor government. I note that even Senator Penny Wong has told the South Australian Labor government to get on with it. Speaking at the Press Club today, Minister Wong said, 'I do think South Australia and the nation will be best served if it can be resolved. I think the fighting between states has not served the river well or the basin well. That was always the view I put when I held the portfolio.' It is not about accepting a raw deal for South Australia for the sake of reform. I was right there, fighting for a better deal, when the first draft plan was released. I have met with basin communities in my electorate, in is the wake of the latest draft plan, and the authority and its chairman, Craig Knowles, have worked hard to get the balance right. I do not believe we should be playing politics with this issue-it is too important. I am happy to support the draft plan. Everyone can find fault with a plan but I think the balance is pretty right when you have one group saying there is not enough water and an opposing group saying there is too much water-generally, you have to think that things are not too far off the measure. I would like to see some other little changes but in the interest of reform I believe that we have to support a plan and get on with the job. I certainly do not want to see the reform fly out the window due to interstate fighting. Let us make a start on reform, at least. Fremantle Electorate: Community Events Gender Equity",185
191,Ms PARKE,ADJOURNMENT," We live at a time when new communication and media technologies have delivered a cornucopia of genuinely fantastic opportunities for elected representatives and for governments to communicate and engage with their constituents. But just as there is something special and distinctive about hearing live music or seeing live theatre, so there is something unique present in the exchange of ideas and viewpoints that occurs face to face; that occurs in a town hall or community meeting room or local park, which will always be more substantial and more real than a thousand tweets or bulk emails, or chats via Facebook or Skype. At the start of a new year I want to take the opportunity to reflect on some highlights over the last 12 months in terms of the highenergy and thoughtful community engagement that I have been fortunate to participate in. And before I do that, I want to cast forward to an annual event that I have been incredibly proud to support over the five years, namely the Gimme Shelter concert, which is held at the Fremantle Arts Centre in February every year, and which raises funds for the work that St Patrick's Community Support Centre undertakes in providing crisis accommodation and support for the homeless. This year's concert on 25 February will again feature an amazing lineup of local musicians and performers, and I am confident it will draw strong support from the wider Freemantle community. It is almost 12 months ago, in March 2011, that the Prime Minister and cabinet came to WA and held a community cabinet at South Fremantle Senior High School in my electorate. It was an event with a characteristic Freo flavour, and the moment of engagement that spoke loudest for me was the point at which the members of the Australian Youth Climate Coalition presented the Prime Minister with a thankyou card for taking action on climate change. Making policy and making decisions for the future is never easy, especially when future is defined within a policy time frame that steps out to the year 2100 and beyonda time when the decision makers, and 99 per cent of people alive today, will not be around to benefit or suffer from the consequences of action or inaction. I am not sure that our democracy takes sufficient account of the views of young people, and yet climate change is almost the perfect example of an issue on which young people must be heard. I want to thank the AYCC for their work in expressing a clear message on climate change, and for supporting the government in its delivery of the Clean Energy Future package. Also in March last year, I was honoured to participate in a number of events to mark the centenary of International Women's Day-a last hugely significant occasion. As I noted on the day, it is essential that we reflect with pride on the progress that has been made when it comes to the equality of women; but it is equally important that we mark those areas in which there is still a long way to go. Last week's Fair Work Australia decision on pay equity for 150,000 social and community sector workers, 120,000 of whom are women, is an example of both change that needed to occur and change that has been achieved. By drawing strength from what we have achieved we replenish our resolve to go further and achieve more. I also wish to see workers in the aged care and childcare sectors-again, most of whom are womenappropriately recognised for their important caring work through significantly improved pay and conditions. Finally, I want to mention the community forum on the proposed national disability insurance scheme that I had the privilege of co-hosting in November last year with Peter Tinley, the state MLA for Willagee, and Geraldine Mellet from the Every Australian that Counts campaign. The forum was held in the Fremantle Town Hall and I want to express my gratitude to City of Fremantle for the provision of the venue, and to the Fremantle Herald for their promotion of the event. The meeting was a chance for people to learn about the basic concept and benefits of moving to an NDIS, and an opportunity for those living with disability to have their say on a range of service and funding issues. In support of the forum I sent a letter of invitation to my constituents, enclosing a survey on the subject of disability policyand the responses have been quite amazing. Some bring you to the verge of tears; some are angry; many are imbued with incredible stoicism and weariness and suffering. And the responses from carers, which can have all the qualities I have just mentioned, also contain the most remarkable, invincible, firetempered strains of love-long-suffering, inexhaustible, unconditional love. It just blows you away. We have to do more to support these people, and I am proud to be part of a Labor government that is intent on that task. Through all the events I have mentioned-and those have been only a few of the dozens and dozens that I attendedthe strong value of coming together to make a contribution to Australian civic life has been reinforced for me, and I look forward to more and greater community engagement in Fremantle in the year to come. Cowen, Sir Zelman, AK, GCMG, GCVO, QC",186
192,Mr NEVILLE,ADJOURNMENT," As I did not have the opportunity to speak on the Sir Zelman Cowen condolence motion in the Federation Chamber, I thought that I would reflect briefly on it tonight. I am a devotee of Sir Thomas More. I think Robert Bolt got it right when he called him the man for all seasons. So it is not an accolade I throw around easily but if there were an Australian who met that qualification it would mostly likely be Sir Zelman Cowen. He had very modest beginnings. Early in life he attended St Kilda Park state school, Scotch College and the University of Melbourne. He went into the Royal Australian Navy as an intelligence officer during the war and, on coming out of that, took up his Rhodes scholarship. So he must have been a very distinguished student as well as being loyal in the service of his country. As a Rhodes scholar he attended New College and later he was a fellow of Oriel College at Oxford. Interestingly he went back to Oriel College from 1982 to 1990 as its provost. He had a similarly distinguished career at Melbourne University as a student, dean of law and, later in life, emeritus professor. I think the Australian university community was well served by him as vice-chancellor of New England University in Armidale and also seven years as vice-chancellor of the University of Queensland in Brisbane. That was at a very tumultuous time in Queensland history, I might add. He was distinguished around the world. He advised the British government on German wartime law. He advised Indian states and Hong Kong. He was accredited to many distinguished universities including in Washington, Illinois, Calcutta and numerous Australian cities. He had an extraordinary academic career. But Sir Zelman Cowen's greatest contribution-we all know it-was in the healing he provided in the wake of the Whitlam dismissal. I do not intend to canvass the rights and wrongs of the dismissal but it would be true to say that it left Australia a very wounded and fractious place. With people on both sides of the argument in heavily entrenched positions you would have said that this was going to last in Australia for decades. But fortunately for all our sakes it did not. Largely the healing influence was Zelman Cowen because in that distinguished career he never played partisan politics, so he was the ideal person. In 4½ short years he knitted the country back together, so to speak, in a very humble and sensitive way. We will be always grateful to him, I am sure, for that. It is interesting that in the dying days of the old imperial honours system he was probably our most distinguished awardee. He was a Knight of the Order of Australia; he received the Grand Cross of St Michael and St George and the Royal Victorian Order; he was a Queen's Counsel; he was a Privy Counsellor. On top of all his university accolades, you could not get a more distinguished Australian. He loved football. He was an author. He was, literally, a man for all seasons. As a boy, when I started to get interested in politics, I can remember him. He used to broadcast on the ABC just before the midday news and at night on what was called Notes on the News. Zelman Cowen was always one of the greatest exponents of explaining the news. On behalf of my electorate, Hinkler, I extend condolences to his wife and his four children. He was a great and very distinguished Australian.",188
193,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The member for Hinkler is right: Sir Zelman was a truly wonderful person. Dental Health,189
194,Mr MELHAM,ADJOURNMENT," Over recent months, my office has received calls from constituents inquiring about the future of the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. Sadly, several of these calls have been from constituents ringing at the behest of their dentists. Some dentists have been advising their patients that the scheme is ceasing and those constituents will no longer be able to be treated. I think it is important that the facts are placed on the record. No closure date is currently set for the CDDS. Yes, it is the government's intention to close down this scheme, which is not well targeted and does not provide access to dental services for those most in need. The Senate has twice prevented the closure of the CDDS. The community is aware that the government has long intended to replace the CDDS with a new Commonwealth Dental Health Program. The CDDS is complex to administer as it requires that only those with a chronic condition be referred by their GP to a dentist. We have recently seen that some dentists inappropriately make claims on Medicare. The system is obviously open to abuse. The government's proposed Commonwealth Dental Health Program, when implemented, will be better targeted and provide additional dental services for pensioners and concession card holders. The government is committed to dental health reform. The National Advisory Council on Dental Health has been established to advise on the best way forward for the future of dental health in this country. On 5 September the minister announced the membership of this council, which will be headed by Ms Mary Murnane, a former senior public servant. The government is already delivering significant improvements in dental care, including subsidised dental check-ups for teenagers, which provides up to $159.85 per person. This program since its inception has provided over one million services for eligible teenagers. This reform is in addition to the investment of $11 million in Indigenous dental services in rural and regional areas and $52.6 million over four years in the 2011-12 budget to establish a voluntary dental internship program to help boost the dental health workforce. This reform in part addresses the recommendation of the National Health And Hospitals Reform Commission in 2009, which advised on investment in internships with a particular emphasis on regional and rural areas. Given the shortages in the public dental workforce, this development goes some way to redressing the balance. I understand that the dental health workforce welcomes this reform. The introduction of the Commonwealth Dental Health Scheme remains government policy as promised at the last election. It does remain of concern to me, though, that some dentists are preying on the fears of vulnerable people by claiming that the CDDS is about to be closed down without explaining that the government intends to introduce a broader scheme. It is worth putting on record that the Commonwealth's power in relation to dental services was obtained through the success of the social services referendum on 28 September 1946. That referendum is one of only eight amendments to the Constitution that have been successfully passed. In this case, there was a majority in all states of Commonwealth, and overall the vote in favour of the Commonwealth having this power was 54.39 per cent of the voting population. So the parliament has a mandate in relation to dental services arising out of the successful passage of that referendum. Section 51(xxiiiA) of the Constitution gives us that mandate and it should be used wisely. Dickson Community Awards",189
195,Mr DUTTON,ADJOURNMENT," I rise today, Mr Speaker, to acknowledge some very special members of our local Dickson community. Next Sunday at the Samford Historical Museum I will present the Dickson Community Awards and today I would like to mention some of the nominees-'local heroes' who never call for any attention or recognition but who command respect for their contributions above and beyond their normal activities. Sharon Weber works tirelessly as a fundraiser, in particular for the annual Picnic in the Park raising funds for our local chaplains so that they can continue their work in our community. Shannon Yeardley, a former psychologist, has set up 'the flower project' on Brisbane's north side. In the last year, mostly at her expense, she has delivered surprise flower bouquets to over 300 elderly or isolated women, those recovering from illness and devoted carers. Shannon believes: 'The more that you give to other people, the better you feel in yourself.' May Willis has made a lifetime of contributions supporting her community, volunteering endless hours sewing and knitting for fundraisers, for babies in hospital nurseries and for charities like the Rainbow Connection. For the last decade she has been President of the Strathpine and District Senior Citizens Club. Reverend Dr Paul Inglis is well known for his decade of service as Minister of the the Dayboro Uniting Church. He has worked to bring all community churches together to support Dayboro and surrounding regions. During the January 2011 Dayboro Flood, he not only provided support but also organised a fundraising concert with others that help to raise $32,000. As Queensland's first breast care nurse, Patricia Creed OAM identified the need for specialised care for breast cancer patients, to follow their progress prior to and post surgery. This support enabled so many women a smoother journey through their illness. She was rightly recognised in the 2011 Queen's Birthday Honours List. Sergeant Ken Robinson and Senior Constable Troy Nowitzki are two of many men and women who deserve to be recognised for the role they play in their jobs in our community. To undertake a policing career takes courage, integrity and a genuine concern for the well-being of others and, like so many in the emergency services, they go beyond the call of duty. They worked tirelessly in extreme conditions during the 2011 floods to ensure the safety of residents vital and of course this support and concern continued on after the danger had subsided. I want to congratulate Troy, who has just been promoted to sergeant, and is moving-to all places-St George next week. It is certainly a loss to our community. He will certainly have his work cut out for him in what are very difficult circumstances, and our thoughts and prayers go out to the people of St George and others affected by terrible floods in western Queensland this very day. Long before the floods, Juliette Wright set about helping people in the community facing hardship. She developed the Givit direct giving network website, and charities and organisations can now request any item, goods or service they are currently unable to provide and this request is matched with those who can meet the request. Getting kids active and involved in sport is very important. Thankfully, we have Stephen Koster or 'Coach Steve', who has given his time and energy to build the confidence of over 600 children and is a well-loved icon amongst many local young sports men and women. Lisa Davis, similarly, in her role as president Rivers Swans AFL Club had to witness the devastation of her clubhouse during the 2011 floods and led the way to oversee its clean-up and resurrection It is wonderful that we have so many young achievers in Dickson. Danielle MCCarthy is the first and only student to receive a grade point average of seven in the Bachelor of Law degree at Queensland University of Technology. This was achieved while doing a double degree with perfect results in the Bachelor of Business (Accountancy) degree. Sarah Harvey is a member of the BMX National Athlete Development Squad. She has been invited to train with the High Performance Australian BMX Team who are currently training for the 2012 Olympics. This year she has World Championships in England and the Australian Championships in April. Erin Gold can be described as nothing less than an inspiration. Her efforts ensure that research into juvenile diabetes will continue to improve the lives of young people. A type 1 diabetic, she is a youth ambassador for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, raising awareness in the media and with politicians and promoting sponsorship from business. In 2010, she travelled to this place to raise awareness of type 1 diabetes and the importance of research to find a cure. Four members of the 1st Samford Girls Brigade, led by Heather Adam, Simone Adam, Catherine Hughes, Shari Canagasurium and Laura Mitchell were recently presented with the annual Government House Girls' Brigade Queen's Award and are working towards their Duke of Edinburgh Award. They have committed the past three years to community service and between them have supported Lifeline, the Asthma foundation, Big Sister and aged of the Pine care friendship groups. Australian Year of the Farmer",190
196,Mr CROOK,ADJOURNMENT," This year, 2012, is the Australian Year of the Farmer. This year recognises and celebrates Australian farmers for the work they do in feeding our nation-and many others. It celebrates the role of the Australian farmer as a man of the land, an innovator and a world leader. There is no denying the importance of the agricultural sector to the Australian economy. The agriculture sector generates $41.8 billion to the economy each year, with $31.2 billion of this in the export market. Agriculture supports 1.6 million jobs in Australia in farming and related industries, accounting for 17.2 per cent of the national workforce. Agriculture plays a major role in safeguarding our food security, with Australian farmers producing almost 93 per cent of Australia's daily domestic food supply, while exporting a massive 60 per cent of our total agricultural production to other countries. Agriculture also plays an important role in keeping our regional communities vibrant and sustainable. One only needs to look at the devastating impact of the 2010 drought in Western Australia or last year's live export ban to see this very clear fact: when Australian agriculture suffers, regional Australia suffers. It is vitally important that this federal government recognises the significant role that the agricultural sector plays in our economy, in our food security, and in our regional sustainability. As it is the Year of the Farmer, I would like to raise in this House a number of issues that are currently impacting on the agricultural sector. The issue of live export continues to be a concern for many livestock producers. With the federal government now focussing on sheep exports to the Middle East, many producers in my electorate of O'Connor are understandably concerned. As an export market, the Middle East consumes 99 per cent of Western Australia's total sheep exports, with the majority of these exports coming from O'Connor. The federal Minister for Agriculture, Senator Joe Ludwig, recently travelled with a delegation to the Middle East to look at the progress of reforms which require Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and Turkey to slaughter Australian animals by international welfare standards by the end of this month. While I understand that the industry, both in Australia and overseas, is supportive of these reforms, I share my electorate's concerns around the implementation of these reforms in such a short time frame-1 March is simply too short a time frame for these reforms to be properly implemented. Drought is another issue which is continuing to impact on my electorate. Although WA has had a record harvest, there are still areas of the state heavily affected drought. Just this morning, I met with a young man from Salmon Gums, Tim Starcevich. Tim is a regional winner of the ABC HeyWire competition, and his family have been pioneer farmers in the Salmon Gums area. I quote to the House from Tim's HeyWire report: One of the main reasons why everyone is leaving Salmon Gums is the rainfall. The town's water supply has just about run out, with most of the farmers carting water for their livestock, and the people who live in town trying to save every drop of rain that falls. Dad is a second-generation farmer and he remembers the town full of people, shops, and brand new houses. He told me how you could drive in and get fresh bread and vegies. Now all you can get is a meat pie or a Chiko roll from the roadhouse on the outskirts of town. Since Tim's HeyWire report, I note that thunderstorms have alleviated the water crisis to some extent; however, the ongoing drought has some families considering moving off the land. While many farmers appreciate the assistance from state and federal governments through drought assistance programs, areas like Salmon Gums and Southern Cross in my electorate have had the poor fortune to suffer drought for consecutive years. Biosecurity risks for Australian fruit, the skills shortage and supermarket pricing are other significant issues that many Australian farmers face day in and day out. In 2012, the Australian Year of the Farmer, it is not enough for this federal government to recognise and congratulate the Australian farmer; we must do more. We must help our farmers so they can continue to remain on the land, driving our economy, protecting our food security and sustaining our regional communities. In 2012, the Australian Year of the Farmer, I call on this federal government by to lend their support to the agricultural sector by addressing these issues. Thank you, Mr Speaker.

222,Mr TURNBULL,MAIN COMMITTEE," Zelman Alfred Deakin's death. As many people have so-it was as though Sir Zelman always felt that the time he came into the world. This is entirely Christian theology; nonetheless, it is a wonderful which the threads of Zelman Cowen's life-very intangible ways to so many other important Alfred Deakin. It is an interesting point to Jewish Governor General of Australia, the first coincidence that Sir Zelman had written a biography is it a further coincidence that they died at that? There are a lot of threads in Zelman Cowen's prominent figures of our country, I first became aware of Zelman Cowen in Oxford-he was Rhodes Scholar at Oxford evidence, called Essays on the Law of Evidence, Peter Carter, who did not go on to greatness University. Indeed, when he was lecturing doubt that the notes he was lecturing to us fellow with Zelman Cowen, given that the notes were practically flying off the page every encounter with Zelman Cowen in print. But amount about Zelman Cowen from my very Skala, who was one of the handful of guests Brisbane and had, it seemed, effectively Zelman with a warmth and an insight that him, even though I had not at that stage of of his evidence text-which is not the best way spoke of a man who was warm and was a mentor, think it was almost as if he was a man who was other young people. This was a long time ago. Steven's discussions about Zelman Cowen with much more recent years our colleague the similar filial mentor relationship with Zelman fashion the ideals and values of Steven he has faith was paramount. It was something that he that my friend Josh described as one of the scholarly achievements and faith, at a personal with his wife, Lady Anna, to whom he was Anna and his four children, Rabbi Dr Shimon Our condolences go to them for their loss of a to the public service of Sir Zelman Cowen.

And it is a reminder of the way in long life-are connected in tangible and figures in Australian history, not simply to Sir note that Zelman Cowen was of course the second having been Sir Isaac Isaacs. Again, is it a of Isaac Isaacs some years before? And exactly the same age? What were the chances of life that connect him to the history and the some that are rather more intangible. a law library. When he was a young scholar at University-he wrote a very important book on in partnership with another academic named in public life but remained a teacher at Oxford me and others in 1979 on evidence, I have no from were the same he had used when he was a were so ancient and tattered and that moths time he turned one over. That was my first when I was at Oxford I learnt an enormous good friend and fellow Rhodes Scholar Steven at our wedding in 1980. Steven had grown up in become part of the Cowen family. He spoke of made Lucy and me almost feel as though we knew my life met Zelman, other than through the pages to get to know anyone, I might add. So Steven although mentor is a rather chilly term-I prepared to be almost like a father to so many It is well over 30 years ago that I am talking of me. It is very touching that, much later, in member for Kooyong, Josh Frydenberg, had a Cowen. Just as Zelman inspired and helped clearly done the same with Josh, and it says a NA lot about the character of the man. Of course, this impact. He was, above all, a natural teacher. This scholars of Sir Zelman's rank find teaching students to leave that to their assistants and concentrate enthusiasm and passion for other people, particularly really special teacher, somebody who had not to communicate but also the compassion and remarkable. The great scholars of whom you relatively short list, in my experience. He held many university positions. He was of the Melbourne University Law School, Queensland and prior to that at Armidale, and the Provost of Oriel College. He had a range academic. But the big event in his life Governor General of Australia. At the moment opportunity to deliver a touch of healing, and and wrongs of the 1975 dismissal, the actions controversy had brought the office of the Governor General and political acrimony that it had not had before very special person to take over from Sir John Kerr. Sir Zelman Cowen was able to bring a remarkable and empathy with all Australians that enabled the people in a manner that restored confidence have had many great viceroys at the federal extraordinary warmth of Marie Bashir, the two very different people, although both great each of them had that degree of humanity, with Sir Zelman Cowen during the debate over my colleague the member for Goldstein, Andrew justice and truth in that campaign. Zelman republic for some time, well before the referendum about what an Australian republic should look who has essentially the same powers as the as indeed I was and the member for Goldstein directly elected by the people. His argument in that regard was very well in the Hawke Lecture in 1999, which he entitled neat literary reference to Maimonides work on more obscure than theology. His argument was office of head of state, first ask yourself your job description is, 'We want somebody impartial and not caught up in political controversy,' in a contested public election is unlikely there are so many other people on whom he had is an important point because many teachers and a little bit beneath them, and they prefer on research and giving grand lectures. But his for young people, marked him out as a simply the intellect, the charisma and the ability the genuine human interest in others. That is could make those observations would form a a fellow at Oxford. He later became the Dean the Vice-Chancellor at the University of later, after his Governor-Generalship, he was of interests and they went well beyond the was when Malcolm Fraser invited him to become of his appointment he described it as the that is exactly what he did. Whatever the rights by Sir John Kerr and the subsequent political into a degree of bitter contention nor, I am happy to say, since. It required a intellect but also a depth of humanity him to reach out and reconnect that office with in it. He had a genuine warmth. Again, we and the state level. You can think today of the Governor of New South Wales. They are of course scholars and academics in their own fields, but compassion and warmth. I dealt quite regularly the Australian republic. I am pleased to see Robb, here who was also on the side of Cowen had been an advocate for an Australian campaign in 1999. He had the same view like-that is to say, it should have a president Governor General-but he was strongly opposed, was, to the idea that the president should be made on a number of occasions but most notably 'The guide for the perplexed', which is a very theology. Sometimes constitutional law is even essentially that you must, in looking at the what you want your head of state to do and be. If who is non-political, non-partisan, seen as then it follows that electing them directly to deliver a person who would fit those NA characteristics. Almost invariably-and this elected, whether they are executive presidents the Republic of Ireland-you would end up major political parties. We shared exactly debate, as his friends Sir Ninian Stephen very important, not simply because jurists of proposition that we should make this change that the change was not going to result in busily saying that would be the case Zelman and I spoke on a number of occasions campaigns run by the no case in that referendum republic, we would have to leave the Commonwealth-that Commonwealth any longer. It beggars belief because the largest country in the Commonwealth, able to deal with this repeatedly. I will quote I therefore support the Constitutional Convention's of a joint sitting of the two Houses of federal Parliament. people in November this year, and I believe it giving us an Australian head of state without Of course there are other aspects which merit attention. It is the question of whether Australia's becoming continued membership of the Commonwealth. The point can be simply put: Australia's becoming membership of the Commonwealth. This point was consequence of a member state of the Commonwealth Commonwealth Prime Ministers meeting in London in 1949. It was there resolved that India, which had put membership of the Commonwealth as a republic, monarch as Head of the Commonwealth ... The states which are republics-the majority-those which minority which retain the monarch, among these Australia. Interestingly, as he goes on in his speech young law lecturer and a fellow at Oxford, been brought up to believe that fealty to the the Commonwealth, as indeed it had been. somewhat of a surprise. He goes on to note: I remember that soon after the decision of the then a young Oxford law teacher - was sitting alongside United Kingdom, and a party to the London agreement. asked whether in view of all of the history, he laconic of men, he answered directly Sir Zelman was very important in that debate. his input was intelligent, sober, sane, measured, is true in every country where presidents are as in America or non-executive presidents as in with somebody who is a nominee of one of the the same views about it. He intervened in the and Sir Anthony Mason intervened, and that was that stature gave support and credibility to the but because they were able to assure Australians red revolution. Of course, our opponents were and running all source of scare campaigns. about one of the most egregious scare which was that, if Australia became a we could not be a member of the that anyone would make a claim like that, India, is in fact a republic. Zelman was from part of his Hawke lecture in 1999. He said: proposal that the President be elected by two-thirds This is the proposal which will be put to the can be safely recommended to our fellow citizens as radical change to our parliamentary system. There is one I would like to mention in closing. a republic has any implications for Australia's …… … a republic is entirely consistent with our continuing established almost exactly fifty years ago, when the becoming a republic was considered by the the matter before the Prime Ministers, might maintain and that India would for its part recognize the upshot is that the modern Commonwealth includes have their separate monarchs, and a substantial he acknowledges that, at the time that he was a he and all constitutional lawyers of the day had Crown was an integral part of being a member of He says that this change in 1949 came as Commonwealth Prime Ministers was made public, I Mr Attlee, who was then Prime Minister of the A youthful purist (some might say pedant), I had difficulty in reaching his conclusion.

223,Mr ROBB,MAIN COMMITTEE," It is a great a few words of condolence about this very great and I endorse, the comments by the member finely in the last few minutes. I enjoyed experienced with Sir Zelman over a long period of time. I had the great honour of getting to know member for Wentworth mentioned, we were during the republic debate and I shared Sir shape it should take-the minimalist model and felt very strongly about, as did I and still me a great opportunity to get to know the eloquently put in this chamber about the qualities is so widely respected within the Australian many areas that he has interacted with. I have often by coincidence, as Sir Zelman lived near is the neighbouring suburb to my electorate. community in my electorate of Goldstein and community. I would often find myself at consequence. The thing that struck me about him, both dealt with other people, was his humility. I great admiration for a man of such extraordinary magnificent role as Governor General but through already been chronicled so well by so many: Rhodes scholar and then later as the Dean of 30. These marked him as a man of remarkable humble, sympathetic and empathetic manner people, there was clearly great strength swayed from his view of things. He had a capacity argue it and influence others without any or ladylike gathering or in a committee life of great accomplishment. He died laden with cherished his family above all, as we all an example to all of us. It is common to say of a good mother and wife' and all of that. That was his passion. In that sense, it was part not by any means the only people who love their family life, the hamesha family life, the warm to Jewish culture and to Sir Zelman Cowen. for a lifetime of achievement, we salute Zelman to his widow, Lady Anna, and to their some of whom, like Josh and Stephen Skala, privilege for me to have an opportunity to say Australian. I must say how much I enjoyed, for Wentworth, which were put so eruditely and also the interactions that Malcolm Turnbull Sir Zelman perhaps over the last 15 years. As the engaged with Sir Zelman in all sorts of ways Zelman's view of how it should proceed and what the lack of election of a president, which he do. That gave us a point of connection and it gave man and to appreciate what so many others have of Sir Zelman and the reasons for which he community and the global community in the been able to maintain some measure of contact, my electorate.

I suspect, despite the that he always brought to interactions with of character. He was a man who was not easily to stay true to what he believed and to bombast and without any acrimony. It is again a NA lesson for many of us in this place that there multiple ways of legitimately disagreeing with can surround proceedings not just here Sir Zelman was operational in Darwin when War. He experienced the bombings, which in understood due to the strategic approach taken community with what was happening up north. appreciate the significance of the magnitude of Japanese bombings that took place.

Again, he was always capacity, which the member for Wentworth this innate ability, whether you were speaking influence what you thought, without preaching hard to articulate; he was a very remarkable such as the member for Kooyong, have spoken enjoyed that experience, perhaps I saw it again and again. In every interaction the thing that stayed with me. I always came or how long it was, with a feeling of more certainty to think about. Again, it was all done in a was extraordinary. He had many reasons to contribution, but you never saw it for a second. He was a man of great empathy and patience. shareholder meeting, I could visualise it. I wisdom that he would convey in his comments would have shown for everyone in that room. and leads to constructive outcomes. I was not can see him in my mind's eye carrying out adequately described. The patience, empathy, Darwin Defenders constituted a life and a respect would ever find for any individual in Australia. It is a great immigrant story, and many have have, and the confidence that most Australians because of the millions of immigrant stories, quality.

For the years I have been he has always been there, no matter what his responsive to people and always had that great described so eloquently, for mentoring. He had to him for one minute or for 30 minutes, to at you or imposing a point of view. It is very man and he had this quality about him. Others, eloquently about this capacity, and they have more than others, with Sir Zelman. I had with him over the last 15 years, that was away from that discussion, no matter how short about certain issues and with something gentle manner. His humility was a constant and it have a touch of arrogance or hubris, given his When Malcolm described that unruly could see the patience that he would exert, the and the respect and empathy that I know he That invites cooperation. It calms things down at the meeting, although I have read about it. I that role that the member for Wentworth so intellect and loyalty that he showed to the that is not unique but is as strong as you spoken about that. It reinforces the pride that I have, that we are a much greater nation and this is another immigrant story of great that holds this country together; it also ensures of stories, experiences and qualities that he is character. I think there are many great over the development of Australia in the last things which have unambiguously had long-term or the cultural attributes of Australia. So NA there are many great Australians through history, that no-one has had an influence that exceeded has had a singular influence that exceeded performed during his time as Governor General. I do think it was a time when Australia fracturing of our fundamental institutions or to go off the rails, and that could have development. But I think to the great surprise years as Governor General but, really, this source of division, angst and potential fracturing purpose that we have all got together, and moving on. Things happen-in a family, in removed, they happen, but you have to find Australia a way of dealing with that issue. the most extraordinary contributions in so many all Australians for many decades into the future. fundamental contribution to the essence of influence he bought to that job. I do feel that that role that he played. There is so much more that others have achievements are just remarkable. As the member contributed at an extraordinary level right through latter part of his life, he was still having I conclude by saying that it was a great life. of simply great accomplishments. But he humility, empathy and respect for others. lived. We offer our condolences to his widow, close to him and all those that he loved so much.",220

It had that potential been a long-term, damaging and unfortunate of everyone in such a short period-he had 4½ was within two years-he had taken hold of that and calmed it down. He had shown a greater the value of putting those things behind us and an organisation, in a country; they cannot be ways of dealing with them.

That might well be a very effective cover that that possibility has been adequately that these regulators have in place, or that against criminality in the retirement-saving system retirement savings being misappropriated the Australian retirement savings pool at $1.3 world, is obviously therefore a very attractive conduct.

The second not satisfied that sufficient efforts have been who is alleged-I repeat, alleged-to have been a reported to have been involved in fraud, of jurisdictions.

But my own view is that to the committee that Australian regulatory maximum possible vigour with a view to the evidence allows an inference to be Australians of their retirement savings. make comes back to the point which was made by conduct. I want to speak particularly Gresham, who has now changed his name to Tony changing your name raises a suspicion, but of change your name.

One of the issues that has been a matter of whether the NBN Co. is going to make broadband point that the NBN Co. inevitably will result would be and some people have criticised me that we really do need to get real about this violent agreement about the need for all Australians an affordable basis. We all agree about that. of broadband; the debate about the NBN is taking is the most cost effective, the most taxpayer and the consumer.

We are all into have access to very fast broadband on The debate about the NBN is not about the joys about whether the approach the government is timely and delivers the best value both to the of the debate.

You might just have to have to do some of his dough. The shareholders you are not so constrained. The difficulty that massively overcapitalised. They say we are only on the capital investment. But that is no comfort or four times more than was needed, that is must not forget-and Rod Sims has made this the reasons why we have seen this massive increase state of New South Wales, is what has arguably the electricity companies, a gold plating partly regulation, upon which capital investment they suspend the laws of economics.

That has an impact, particularly within Australia Post. There will be more homes mail.

It has been repeated today that this is going Mr Turnbull, claimed today that the cost of the NBN will increase retail prices. In fact, claimed a couple of years ago that the NBN reality is completely different. The fact is that line with, and in many cases cheaper than, start from $34.50 per month.

Critically, the terms committee report on the rollout of the NBN schools and businesses to fibre-to-the-premises obligation of 90 per cent of Australian premises, remaining premises.

As the Treasurer said in question time today, the difference between those opposite, who those on this side, who wish to take advantage how we live.

We submission was provided to the committee, 1,000 the country were engaged in the NBN Co. We jobs in a range of businesses, but it is certainly to be part of building this dream, this dream we cannot even imagine yet are possible. Australians take and embrace this technology and they will look back in 50 years from now people will recall the NBN as we hear people speak about their scheme. This is another visionary project that have the capacity to envision, to make great big to give us a great big opportunity right there ahead of us. These are things that define the Labor Party. capacity and we believe that if we give them good go of it. The reality is that business understands carp about how they represent business.

Before I close, I would like to speak about for all Australians-a fairer Australia-and that that we will deliver with the National Broadband that I have. We need to make sure that the whole way over a reasonable period of time, and that access for regional and remote communities, the minister for communications and the Prime to make sure that those in the regions and in access to this new technology.

One of the things that he argued is that They keep on with this argument that wireless NA will provide what we need. The reality is Bureau of Statistics, the number of mobile broadband climb. But the number of fixed broadband subscribers rate. The average rate of downloads per month for fixed line networks whereas the mobile subscriber has dropped by 20 per cent.

266,Mr FLETCHER,MAIN COMMITTEE," Following Panglossian non sequiturs from the member for the issue at hand, which is the oversight of the committee. What do we know about how the committee process? I would like to make three points in the brief being provided with inadequate information private sector investor in similar circumstances. going extremely badly. There is no other way the signs for investors, and that means all this project, are flashing red for danger. Thirdly, NBN will face in terms of getting the required increasing at a steady rate. Let me turn first to the question of inadequate be overseeing what we are repeatedly told is in Australia. Unfortunately the amount of information The attitude of both the department and NBN long time to get answers to questions on notice the real issues. We have had a to-and-fro performance indicators. By any ordinary performance indicators you would expect provided to the committee is hopelessly unsatisfactory. I can state with some confidence, having a large telco, that NBN for its own internal monitoring on a very close basis-very likely monthly-such metrics as: the kilometres of the number of new connections; the number of one of the most closely watched metrics acquisition costs; and customer service metrics rates in the call centres. These metrics will That is how things are done in managing large Australia like Telstra, Optus and Vodafone. I that, according to figures from the Australian subscribers in Australia is continuing to is also increasing, although at a slower in gigabytes has doubled in the last 12 months network average download for a broadband that this is because a stable fibre-to-theis faster and more stable. It is like a kind of your door instead of a road with a bit of gravel. Australians in all fields of endeavour and in all the visionary technology of the future. That Those opposite offer the past and no future. on from that remarkable collection of Robertson, I would like to return the debate to the rollout of the National Broadband Network by rollout is going and how satisfactory is the time available to me. First, the committee is and much less than would be required by a Second, on any view the NBN Co. rollout is to put it. This rollout is hugely behind plan and of us because we are all compulsory investors in the indicators of the commercial risk the amount of traffic onto the network are also information. This committee is supposed to the largest infrastructure investment ever made we are provided is extremely limited. Co. has been disappointing. It has often taken a and there is often a reluctance to engage with process regarding what are described as key private sector standard as to the kind of key from a company like NBN Co. what has been spent many years on the senior leadership team of purposes and for board purposes will be daily, certainly weekly or at the very least new fibre installed; the number of homes passed; cancellations; churn; average revenue per user, in the telecommunications industry; customer such as call answer rates and abandonment be reported on a budget, actual and forecast basis. companies like NBN Co. and existing telcos in am very confident that reports of this nature are NA going to the board and management of NBN Co. of this information comes to the committee. where we ask for information, there is a lengthy a tiny bit of information is dropped before us. Let me make a simple plea to the department us just this simple thing: a consistent report network, not the wireless or the satellite confuse the position by quoting fibre and satellite be able to provide a report to the committee the fibre network: first, the number of homes homes connected to the network; and, third, metrics that NBN Co. I am certain will be daily basis. It is very hard not be highly suspicious between these different metrics which mean mentioned, it is highly misleading of NBN Co. and fibre numbers when at the moment the fibre NBN is building but the satellite services another operator under a contract with NBN way. I think it is vastly more sensible than NBN Co. to own and operate its own two satellites, like to add to my simple request that NBN compare what is in the business plan with what that they could quite easily produce it with start with that basic and simple request and gloomily expect, whether it will be ignored. scrutiny and oversight this committee On the second point, what can we glean which NBN Co. deigns to share with the national with overseeing this massive project, this glean from the information that has been provided? very badly. If this were a private sector organisation that the management team probably would In June 2011, according to the business passed by the fibre network. By June 2012, according to be 259,000 premises passed by the fibre would mean that, as at December 2011, we should are nowhere near that number. In late October, premises in the three Tasmanian and the five have received from sources within the telecommunications proceeding very slowly indeed and, although a number of contractors to build the network actually flowing to those contractors. Very be achieved, as the committee's report notes, on an extremely regular basis, but very little Instead we are repeatedly exposed to this charade and elaborate dance of the seven veils before and to the management of NBN Co. to give every six months just in respect of the fibre network. NBN Co. has a bad record of trying to numbers together. I would like NBN Co. to which addresses the following three metrics on passed by the network; second, the number of the number of services in operation-three core tracking very closely and almost certainly on a when in its public statements NBN Co. flits very different things. As I have already to report conflated together satellite numbers services are being provided over the network are being provided over a satellite operated by Co. I do not criticise that arrangement by the the extraordinary decision announced today for but that is another matter. I would also Co. report those metrics on a basis where they the actual number is. I do also make the point far greater frequency than six monthly, but let me see whether it is responded to or, as I rather In sum, on the first point, as a mechanism for is not working well at all. from the scraps and fragments of information parliament, the people's parliament, charged massive piece of public expenditure? What can we The answer is simple: this rollout is going conducting this rollout, I put it to you not be retaining their jobs at this point. plan, there were supposed to be 58,000 premises to the business plan, there are supposed network. On a straight line interpolation that be at around 160,000 premises passed. We NBN Co. disclosed that it had passed 18,200 national first-release sites. The information I industry is that the rollout is NBN Co. announced last year with great fanfare in a range of different states, very little is concerningly, if the NBN Co. business plan is to it is supposed to scale up to reach the NA performance level where it passes 6,000 premises to date to give any confidence that The Labor government's policy on NBN was has been achieved to date is quite underwhelming. from taxpayers and have so far racked up accumulated is, as I have indicated, very substantially with the outcome achieved by a private sector build its Next G network, its new 3G network, achieved. It was quite a significant and in good indicator of the benchmark NBN Co. ought behind it. I have talked about homes past. A very different say, the number of premises taking a service according to the business plan, we were supposed to be 102,000 fibre services in operation. was accordingly planning to be at around 2011. In January 2012, NBN Co. proudly reported network. That is why I say that, on any objective indeed. If you were a private sector equity hitting the brakes and going for a complete restructure. The third point I want to make in the brief hand the build is going very badly, on the other of the commercial risk inherent in this project business plan depends upon almost all Australian It also depends on customers moving up to numbers-in other words, taking more data happen, the business plan will be spectacularly missed. Why should Australian citizens care? They compulsory investors in this project, and the will have to be cleaned up at the taxpayers' turns out to be a yawning financial disaster-and that conclusion will be unavoidable-it is very completed or indeed progress substantially. Let me offer a couple of pieces of evidence commercial risk are growing substantially. Robertson's Panglossian optimism, but I do have not seem to burden herself with in her remarks. communications regulator in the UK, Ofcom, of homes were able to receive what were defined the definition of that is 24 megabits per second. two major operators: British Telecom, using fibre to the node and over time with some offers services over the cable network with Telstra and Optus.

I would draw one recent comparison company. Several years ago, Telstra set out to nationally within a 12-month period. That was fact quite impressive engineering outcome and a to be aiming for. They are a very long way metric is services in operation-that is to and generating revenue. By June 2011, to be at 35,000. By June 2012, it was going Again using straight line interpolation, NBN Co. 70,000 fibre services in operation in December it had 2,315 customers using the fibre measure, this rollout is going very badly investor in this project, right now you would be time available to me is that while on the one hand the drumbeat which indicates the scale is gathering more and more every day. This households taking up a service on the NBN. higher tier, more expensive plans in very large and paying more. If those two things do not should care first of all because all of us are massive financial mess that is being created here expense. Secondly, if you have a project which all the indicators are that within a few years hard to see how the build is ever going to be as to why I say that the indicators of I fear that I cannot match the member for a bit of evidence, which is something she did First of all, let me point to a report from the which in August 2011 reported that 57 per cent as superfast broadband services-in the UK They were able to receive those services from the copper network, upgraded in many places to fibre to the premises; and Virgin Cable, which technology very similar to the cable networks of networks are the two networks which are, NA insanely-and I use that word advisedly-going under the NBN business plan, and those companies In August 2011, 57 per cent of British households two per cent of households subscribed consistently demonstrated that they are not willing tier of broadband. They cannot see a use for NBN Co. business plan is premised on massive and paying more. The other point I wish to highlight is the the business environment NBN Co. is going to but it will be competing with Telstra, Optus wireless. Those three companies, and potentially cases have already introduced-fourth-generation from a recent report from Goldman Sachs: We believe that the arrival of LTE/4G heralds the become a true substitute for fixed broadband services. Goldman Sachs went on to estimate that up their fixed broadband services for wireless This does not augur well for the business product it will be competing against privately at sales and marketing than government owned wisdom on this topic, but this is what the experience against those companies, and they will have sell. This is bad news for NBN Co.'s business well and the prospects are not good.",277
