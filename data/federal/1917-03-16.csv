QUEENSLAND MEAT AT SEYMOUR-GER MAN CONCENTRATION CAM P, LIVERPOOL - INSTRUCTORS-FOO DAND CLOTHING ABROAD.",4
1,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"On Wednesday last the honourable member for Echuca brought under my notice certain allegations that have been made concerning meat purchased from the Queensland Government. I have had inquiries made regarding the meat supplied to camps of training in Victoria, and I can say definitely that the honourable member was grossly misinformed by whoever told him that the meat in question was purchased from the Queensland Government over eighteen months ago. Frozen beef from Queenslaud has been supplied to camps in Victoria, but it has been of first export quality, killed and passed by Commonwealth Government inspectors in Queensland, and again inspected on arrival at Melbourne. The Minister for Defence has promised, in reply to a question asked by the honourable member for Brisbane on Thursday last, that inquiries will be made into the condition of the German Concentration Camp at Liverpool, and as to whether the Australian-born internees could with advantage be separated from the others. Yesterday the honourable member for Brisbane asked these questions1. Whether, following on the Minister's reply to questions on 28th February, a-copy of the circular dated December, 191C, inviting instructors to enlist for service overseas, was sent to every instructor in Brisbane? 2. Is it a fact that while those who answered "" Yes"" were accepted, those who refused are still being kept on the staff? 3. Have any of these men been notified that ' thoir appointment as instructors will be terminated ? 4. Were any of these men engaged for a definite period of five years. If so, how many of them, and what period of service remains unfulfilled? .>. What steps are being taken to fill any r vacancies, and from what ranks will appointments to the Instructional Staff be made? The following replies have been f u r nished :1. No. Instructions were - issued to Commandants of military districts* that all acting staff sergeants-major under forty-five years of age were to be given the opportunity of volunteering for active service abroad with the rank of Sergeant. This would be notified in District Orders for the information of all concerned. 2. Yes, but only as long as temporary employment is available for them. 3. No intimation has yet been received at head-quarters from the Commandant, 1st Military District, of the termination of the appointment of any acting staff sergeants-major. 4. They were engaged for the period of the waT and for four months thereafter, or until legally discharged, dismissed, or removed, or for such period as their services may be required as acting instructors. 5. It is not intended to permanently fill any vacancies until the conclusion of the war, when all acting staff sergeants-major, including those whrjC liave enlisted for active service, will be giihen an opportunity of competing for vacancics*yOa the Permanent Instructional Staff. W it h regard to certain remarks Tuesday by the honourable member for Brisbane concerning complaints about inadequate supply of food and certain - i-. : < treatment in regard to clothes, I have been supplied by the Minister for Defence with the following statement: 1. Regarding the supply of food to soldiers in England, this question was recently referred to the Commandant, Australian Imperial Force Head-quarters, London, who reports that there is not the slightest foundation for complaints regarding the insufficiency of food. 2. It is necessary that further particulars of the complaint as to "" treatment in regard to clothes "" be given before any definite reply can be furnished. 3. As regards the complaint that when a soldier dies the blanket in which he is buried is charged against him, there is no information available in the Department to prove the correctness or otherwise of this statement, but it is considered' extremely improbable that such a charge would be made. It is suggested that, before such statements are made public, the allegations should be given to the Minister, to enable cabled inquiry to be made, so that the answer could be made public at the same time as the allegation. The publication of such allegations, without any reply being possible under the circumstances at the same time, must seriously prejudice recruiting. ARSENAL AT CANBERRA.",4
2,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"I ask the Minister representing the Minister for ' Defence if he has any information regarding a recent explosion of munitions of war in England. Is he aware that by that explosion several hundred persons were killed, and half an acre of houses some miles away demolished ? In the light of that - experience, is it the intention of the Government to proceed with the proposed arsenal near the Federal Capital, and, if so, will the Government pay the difference between the premiums chargeable for ordinary policies of insurance on house property and human life, and the extraordinary premiums which will be charged in respect of the house property at the Federal Capital, and on the lives of future members of Parliament? The proposed arsenal will be about 6£ miles from the Federal Capital. I had the distance measured.",5
3,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I only know what I read in the newspapers about the explosion referred to, and am not aware that the Defence Department has received last further information concerning it . The honourable member is right in asking that the the facts should be considered in connection with the arsenal proposals. PRICE OF WHEAT .",5
4,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"The charges for handling wheat in the various States are estimated to be 4£d. per bushel in New South Wales, 4d. per bushel in Victoria, 5^d. per bushel in South Australia, and 4^d. per bushel in Western Australia. To handling charges are added other charges for freight, varying from 3£d. to 4£d. per bushel. A few days ago the Treasurer promised the farmers that, at the end of A p r i l , they should receive a f u r ther advance of Is. per bushel on the wheat, but from that advance are to be deducted the charges which I have mentioned, aggregating from 7d. to 8d. per bushel, which leaves the net'gain to the farmers from 4d. to 5d. per bushel. As it has been estimated that the price obtained for the wheat will be 4s. 9d. per bushel, and as that can be accurately determined, I ask the treasurer it it would not be possible to make the farmers now a net advance of Is. per bushel, and to deduct the charges for handling and freight from the remaining 9d. ?",6
5,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"I should like to inform honourable membersthat the Treasury Department does not administer - the wheat business, which is in the hands of a Board consisting of representatives of the Commonwealth and States, the Prime Minister being Chairman. ' The Wheat Pool is financed by the Board under a guarantee to the Banks by the Commonwealth and the States, and all that the Treasury has to do is to make the best financial arrangements it can for carrying out the Board's recommendation. Anything that I - have said in regard to .the wheat matter is only as Treasurer giving effect to the Board's recommendations. I am only the guarantor on behalf of the Commonwealth, and act on the recommendations of the Board. statement made the other day was a statement of a recommendation by the Board which has been approved by the Treasury. I am not in a position to do anything except on the recommendations of the Board. If the Board makes any further recommendation, it will be my duty as Treasurer to do my best to help so as to give effect to it . PRI CE OF CORNSACKS.",6
6,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"It is stated in one of the newspapers this morning that the Assistant Minister in another place has said that it is the intention of the Wheat Board to import cornsacks, and that the Government will remit the duty on these to the Wheat Board. Are those statements correct?",6
7,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"We do not propose to interfere with the importation of cornsacks through the usual channels, but, as by reason of the vagaries of the weather, a harvest sometimes exceeds the estimated yield by 15,000,000 or 20,000,000 bushels, and is sometimes beneath the estimate to a corresponding extent, no private dealer will take the risk of importing in advance a sufficient number of sacks to provide for a large surplus, and thus, when there is a full harvest, there is always a shortage of cornsacks, which brings about an increase in the price, not only of the sacks needed for the surplus, but also in the price of all sacks imported. The Government proposes to do three things. In the first place, it will not collect duty on the imported sacks. Secondly, it will see that the sacks are sold at cost price, plus the expenses of handling and a reasonable commission. Thirdly, either directly or through agents, or through the Wheat Board, it will import a sufficient number, of sacks to provide for a full harvest, and will carry the whole of the liability that is so incurred. Thus the farmer may know that there will be sacks sufficient for the most bountiful harvest, and that these will be obtainable practically at cost price, and will not be dutiable. PROHIBITION OF LUXURIES .",6
8,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Is the statement in this morning's newspapers that the Government intends to place an embargo upon the importation .of luxuries true? If so, can the Prime Minister give the House a list of the luxuries that will be The prohibited ?",6
9,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I can only answer the question in a general way. A few days ago the honourable member for Grampians introduced a deputation which laid before me certain facts' in connection with this matter, .and asked that the Government should prohibit the importation of certain luxuries, and consider the question of t the excessive importation of certain ot|ier articles which, during a time of wai,.jinay well f all under that classification, and consider the effect of this both on Australian industries through the alleged extraordinary increase in the amount of such imports and upon the finances of the country - I replied that I regarded the matter as one of very great importance, and I would bring the request of the deputation, together with the facts put before me, under the notice of Cabinet. Expressing my own opinion, I said that I thought the deputation had made out a very strong case for regulation - of the importation of luxuries during war time. In accordance with my promise, I brought the matter before the Cabinet, who regarded it as most important. In the course of discussion Ministers saw how - intricate the ramifications of the proposal .are. It affects, for example, very intimately the finances of the country, as regards both the receipts of the Treasury and the ability of the nation to bear the heavy burdens now imposed by war taxation and war loans. It is obvious on the face of_ it that to send money out of this country and out of the Empire at a time when - every atom of wealth is essential, is a suicidal policy. It was considered that a prima facie case was' established for the. restriction or regulation of imports from countries outside the Empire. . Such a policy seems to he dictated both by common prudence and the circumstances in which we now find ourselves. The facts to which the deputation directed my attention - clearly involved the ability of the people to contribute to those further war loans' that are inevitable if the war continues. The financial position is now very serious in regard to every one of the States. That market which formerly was open to us for war loans is now closed, practically, .and any policy which has a tendency to restrict unnecessary expenditure will necessarily make available wealth that - otherwise would possibly find its way out of the country as payment for luxuries imported from places outside the Empire. The Government have considered the matter from the point of - view put forward by the honourable member for Grampians and his deputation, and ""have decided that, as a general policy, it is favourable to the regulation of inKports. We are now considering to v&ha; extent and in what way we can give eweit to that policy, so that we may keep the^wcalth of the country within the - country and the Empire, make available for loan and other purposes money which - otherwise would be dissipated in unnecessary expenditure, and, at the same time, encourage, as far as is humanly possible, the industries of Australia, and increase the opportunities of employment for our own citizens. With these objects in view, the Government are now considering the policy of regulating imports. It will be generally admitted that we cannot run amok, or proceed without due care in a matter so complex and difficult. Every item to be dealt with must be closely scrutinized. However, I have indicated the policy of the Government, effect to which will be given straight way.",6
10,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Will the Government consider the regulation of imports of not only what are termed luxuries, but also those articles which are being and can be manufactured in Australia from our own raw material? I will hand to the Prime Minister, privately, a list of the articles which I think may be dealt with as I suggest, but I will not name them, because I think it is better that the Government should evolve their own list, and not be able to say that certain articles appear on it at the request of somebody outside the Government.",7
11,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The Government will do that. The circumstances in which we are now placed give a very wide meaning to the term luxuries. The responsibility is thrown upon the Government of promoting the welfare of this country, without which it is impossible that Australia can do its utmost in the war, and clearly the encouragement of industry is one of the means by which that can be most effectively assured. I am glad that the honourable member for Yarra has not mentioned any particular item. To have done so would have been improper, and the Government would have been at once confronted with a host of objections. I can only assure the House that the general policy of the Government does not stop short at what are termed luxuries, but contemplates a regulation which, while not being general and sweeping, will have the effect of achieving the ends I have mentioned. Mr KING O'MALLEY - When the Prime - Minister is considering the adjustments to be made in connection With the prohibition of the importation of luxuries, will he have regard to the fact that many men have entered various businesses under the laws of Australia, and have invested their money in them; that these men have subscribed to our war loans and depend upon those businesses to make good the amounts which they have subscribed?",7
12,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I do not know who these people are, or what the honourable member has in his m in d ; but one cannot have au omelette without breaking eggs. There is, or there is not, a policy in this country in regard to Australian industries ; there is, or is not, a war; and there is, or is not, an imperative demand for money. The honourable member admits, I assume, all these things. All these facts being admitted, the Government has, obviously, to take some action; but we shall have regard to the position of every person. We are not going to benefit A to in j u r e B , C, and D . That would be the act of a fool. If by prohibiting the importation of luxuries we gave employment to ten people and threw 250 out of work, of what avail would that be? We must have regard for the general welfare of the community. Since the honourable member has put this question to me, let me invite the House to consider for a moment the use of silks, so-called. Nowadays, I suppose there is hardly a woman in any class who does not wear silken garments of some sort. It is well known that thousands of people in Australia are employed in making up such garments'. If we prohibit the importation of that material, and throw those people out of work, we must do something for them. And that is why I say that the question is difficult and complex. When the honourable member for Maribyrnong asked me a question in regard to a certain list, I had to point out that before completing such a list it was necessary to look into the whole, question and to see that we did not do incalculably more harm than good. NA UTTERANCES.",8
13,Mr BOYD,ALLEGED TREASONABLE,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been called to a newspaper paragraph purporting to be the report of a speech delivered in the Senate on Wednesday night by Senator Stewart to the following effect:- "" He advised the people of Europe to dethrone every monarch after the war, the Czar of Russia, the Emperor of Germany, and all the rest."" Can the Prime Minister take any steps under the War Precautions Act to prevent men, who have taken' the oath of loyalty to the K in g , giving utterance to such a treasonable and disloyal statement ?",8
14,Mr HUGHES,ALLEGED TREASONABLE,"I am quite sure that there is no law in the country that prevents the statement by any member of Parliament of anything he chooses to say, except the Standing Orders and that good sense and restraint which honourable members choose to impose upon themselves. The publication of such statements is in a different category, and if any honourable gentlemen choose to so abuse the position they occupy as tribunes of the people as to class in the same category the K i ng of England and the Emperor of Germany at a time when England and Germany are locked in a life and death struggle, not for the preservation of monarchy, but for the preservation of liberty, I take it that this House and this country do not expect that the law shall distinguish between persons, whoever they may be. I do not know what can be done with regard to what has been said by an honourable gentleman in another place. I can only say that the statement seems to me obviously cheap, insincere, inexcusable abuse, meaning nothing, and utterly incompatible with the oath the honourable gentleman has taken in order to draw the money upon which he lives. A man who comes to Parliament and takes the oath of allegiance to the K in g , and after eating his Majesty's salt makes statements of that kind, is not even f it to be guillotined. PERSONAL EXPLANATION .",8
15,Mr MATHEWS,ALLEGED TREASONABLE,"The honourable member for Macquarie yesterday charged me with having made treasonable utterances, and he alluded to an address I had delivered at a certain place. At no time in my life have I ever given expression to any words that could be truth full y called treason.",8
16,Mr CABR,ALLEGED TREASONABLE,"I read your statement in Hansard, and it was as near as you could go to treason.",8
17,Mr MATHEWS,ALLEGED TREASONABLE,"On e is led to think that the honourable member for MacquaVie is not able to judge treasonable utteranceV, or anything that takes place in the Hpusse, because he spends so much time in mating money and so little time in Parliament.",8

I can hold out very little hope of those shipments being continued, but it is not anticipated that the quantity of left in Australia will be more than can be consumed here, now that we have prohibited the importation of American apples.

I confess I do not know the meaning of the occurrence to which the honourable request. member refers. None of us is familiar enough witii the Russian situation to know precisely what is 'the meaning of this most dramatic and most amazing episode. In the history not only of this war, but of the civilized world, there never has been a revolution so complete, so far-reaching. At one stroke figure has disappeared, and what is more to the point, the whole bureaucracy-th governing class of Russia-ha s diswhich I am about to refer. appeared.

If I may be permitted to express my own opinion-and I put this forward merely as my own view-it means the very opposite. I may be wrong. We shall learn, perhaps, in a few hours what is the truth . CASE OF MR . J . S. GARDEN .",10
34,Mr GREGORY,ALLEGED TREASONABLE,"I wish to ask the Minister representing the Minister for Defence whether the statement on an electioneering card issued in New South Wales by Mr J. ». Garden that he volunteered for active service, and was refused permission to enlist, the Department stating that his services were - required at home, is true ?",10

36,Dr MALONEY,EXCISE TARIF FVALIDATIO N,"As a matter of privilege I desire to bring a question of importance before the House, and it is a a great pleasure to me to ' be able to strongly commend the action of the present Prime e Minister in connection 'with the matter to It would yesappear that in this case "" even the ranks of this of Tuscany could scarce forbear to The Prime Minister's action, omen however, should be carried a little furWhere public documents are published without authority before they have I confess been received by the Governor General, or dealt with by the Government, some deEvery is going honourable member will agree with me that the receiver is worse than the thief; that the briber is worse than the bribed, and that the person benefited by a wrong act should be punished when the individual guilty of that wrong act is also Throughout my life my sympathy has generally gone out to the under-dog, and while I compliment the Government for the action they have taken in regard to the premature publication of the report of the Federal Capital Commission, I have something further to propose. In last night's issue of the Herald it was stated that Mr W. M. Hughes, the Prime Minister, announced today in the House of Representatives that he had agreed to a recommendation by the secretary of his Department that Mr. D. J. Quinn, secretary to the Royal Commission which inquired into the Canberra Administration, be dismissed for having supplied to the press the report of Mr Wilfred Blacket. KC, the Commissioner.",10
37,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EXCISE TARIF FVALIDATIO N,"Order ! The honourable member on rising in t imated that he rose to a question of privilege, and before doing so he handed to the Clerk a copy of a motion with which he proposed to conclude his speech. Before I give a ruling, it would, perhaps, be as well to read the motion with which The infor- the honourable member proposes to conclude his remarks. It is as follows:That justice demands that as well as the dismissal of a Commonwealth officer guilty of breach of duty, that the real wrongdoer, the editor-in-chief of the Sun, should be punished equally for violating the public duty followed by all respectable newspapers of not making use of information so obtained from a disloyal officer,"" and publishing an official report was secret before it reached the Governor General. That the Sun Newspaper Company should not enjoy the privileges of cable, telegraph, and other press services afforded it by the Commonwealth Government, and these services should be suspended so long as the said editor-in-chief is employed by the directors of the said newspaper, and the directors have not apologized in such form as the Commonwealth Government require. I should like to point out to the honourable member and the House what "" privilege "" means. In this case there is no charge against the Prime Minister or any member of the .House for having done anything derogatory to his position as a public representative. The persons affected are not members of the House, and the facts referred to relate entirely to people outside. In May, on which we are bound to rely, we find it clearly laid down, in the 11th edition, page 272, that if a question of privilege is raised it must be in connection with something affecting the House or members of the House. As I say, the matter' referred to By the honourable member for Melbourne does not affect this House, or the members of the House. It affects departmental administration; and, in regard to it , the Government may or may not take action. I am bound to rule, and I do so at this early stage, that the motion, which the honourable member has handed to me, does not come within the definition of "" privilege.""",10
38,Dr MALONEY,EXCISE TARIF FVALIDATIO N,"Before the matter is finally settled, I should like to raise a point of order. So far as I remember, in no case where a member of Parliament has risen to privilege has a Speaker ever read out the motion before it has been read by the member. I remember that in England, when the secret treaty between Russia and England was stolen  honourable member for Melbourne wishes to proceed further, he ought to move to dissent from your ruling, sir.",11
39,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EXCISE TARIF FVALIDATIO N,"The honourable member for Melbourne, and every other member, must realise that the Speaker has a duty to perform, and it is in pursuance of that duty that I have given a ruling. It is perfectly clear that no one can rise to a question of privilege unless he concludes his remarks with a motion. The honourable member for Melbourne was courteous enough to supply me with a copy of his proposed motion, Which and, therefore, I knew exactly what it was he intended to propose. It became my duty to satisfy myself whether or not the motion came within the definition of "" privilege,"" and on that point I have given my ruling. Of course, if the honourable member desires, he can take the sense of the House as to whether my ruling is correct.",11
40,Dr MALONEY,EXCISE TARIF FVALIDATIO N,"No , no; on the last day of the session I should not think of doing that. I should, however, like to ask the Prime Minister whether he will consider the necessity of bringing in a Bill to deal with newspapers, reputedly respectable, which make use of Government officers, or secretaries of Royal Commissions and other bodies, in their efforts to obtain and divulge information that should first of all be given to the Governor General ?",11
41,Mr HUGHES,EXCISE TARIF FVALIDATIO N,"I have no doubt whatever that it is most improper for any newspaper to publish any such information ; but I am bound to say that the newspapers have to regard the position as it exists. The public clamour for news, and when news comes to a newspaper from any source, it is published. I do not pretend to defend the newspapers, but merely state the facts. I will say this for Mr Quinn, quite frankly",11
42,Dr MALONEY,EXCISE TARIF FVALIDATIO N,I did not wish to refer to the particular case.,11
43,Mr HUGHES,EXCISE TARIF FVALIDATIO N,"In the case of Mr . Quinn, I had no option but to dismiss him.",11
44,Dr MALONEY,EXCISE TARIF FVALIDATIO N,I quite approve of that.,11
45,Mr HUGHES,EXCISE TARIF FVALIDATIO N,"But I do not say for one moment that Mr Quinn had any i m proper intention-no t the slightest. I have not spoken to Mr Quinn for years, but that is my opinion in regard to him . Under the circumstances, however, I could do no other than dismiss him. Since the honourable member has brought the matter up, I think it only right to say these few words in justice to Mr Quinn, lest it should be thought that he had done this thing for some consideration. I do not believe for one moment that he did so. SOLDIER S' PAY : REFUNDS .",11
46,Mr GROOM,EXCISE TARIF FVALIDATIO N,"Some time ago the honourable member for Wentworth asked me the following question:A number of oases have arisen in which refunds are demanded by the Pay Office from soldiers returned from overseas, because of overpayments, either alleged or actual, made to them. Will the Minister representing the Minister for Defence have inquiries made as to whether this hardship to returned soldiers cannot be in some way obviated, and whether the Pay Office cannot be made more directly responsible for any mistakes of the kind made in the future? I can now give the following reply:In many cases the overpayments are due to the fact that advice from abroad regarding casualties affecting soldiers' pay is not received until after the ""overpayments"" have been made. In many other cases the overpayments are the result of inaccurate declarations made by the soldiers and their dependants. In regard to overpayments due to mistakes of the Pay Office Staff, the Crown Solicitor has advised "" it is part of the employee's duty to take proper care of such property of the Department as is intrusted to his charge, and also to exercise reasonable care and skill in the discharge of his duties, and for negligence in these respects he may be made liable to the Department in damages. Generally, therefore, where loss to the Department occurs through the negligence of an employee, the Department may recover such loss from the employee by action for damages. The Department is not', however, entitled to withhold pay or allowances due to such employee, or to withhold payment of any moneys belonging to such employee which the Department has in its possession until a judgment has been obtained against the employee for a definite sum of money, for the reason that a claim for damages cannot be set off against a debt, and if a loss was caused by act or omission not amounting to negligence, the loss could not be recovered from the employee."" With regard to over-payments made in which employees are held responsible, the departmental practice is(o) Temporary Employees.

Permanent members of the Department would be dealt with under the regulations governing the conditions of their employment.",12
47,Mr KELLY,EXCISE TARIF FVALIDATIO N,"The r e is one class of over-payment to which the reply makes no reference, but which I find fairly numerous. When non-commissioned officers go with' reinforcements they lose their rank on joining their unit. Under sent conditions, when a man lose3 his rank, the fact is not always notified to the Pay Office, or, if it is, it is not acted u,pon, with the result that the men and their dependants are paid more than, under the regulation, they ought to be paid. In such cases I desire the Department to stir up its officers, so that hardship will not result to these men and their dependants on suddenly finding themselves, through no fault of their own, called upon to repay large amounts. I ask the Minister to take the matter into his consideration, because it was these cases that caused me to ask the original question, in the hope of securing some alleviation of the present conditions.",12

We are very desirous of encouraging industries, and developing the resources of pre- Australia, and the Government will give the most earnest consideration to the matter referred to in the question. is perfectly clear that the mere discovery of oil, unless in payable quantities, would be of very little value, while, of - course, the discovery of oil in payable and great quantities would practically revolutionize our industrial outlook.",12
53,Mr ARCHIBALD,EXCISE TARIF FVALIDATIO N,"Will the Prime Minister consider whether something cannot be done in the way of discovering the value and extent of the crude, oil deposits in Papua ?

Since the control of External Affairs has been handed over to me the matter has been dealt with by the Minister for Home and Territories, so that I am not closely acquainted with the details. If the prospects are as I have been led to believe they are, there should be a very hopeful outlook for the oil industry in Papua, and the Government will do all they can to develop it .

It is understood that nothing is known of it by the Auditor-General or the Postmaster-General's Department. The Postmaster-General's Department received a somewhat similar complaint, signed ""James Lowe, Moonee Ponds."" Inquiries made by the Postmaster-General's Department and the Police Department failed to discover any such person. NA COMPANY.

No. Colonel Oldershaw states that ""he does not know why Mr Higgs did not sign the agreement, though, asked by* Colonel Oldershaw many times to sign it , as delay in signing the agreement was causing the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to be uncertain as to their position, and u n t i l the agreement was signed the purchase made by Colonel Oldershaw in Sydney of 18,000 tons of ""Fiji sugar could riot be confirmed."" 8.

Happil y for us, since the institution of this Parliament we have been admirably served. To those who sit at the table and take down, - for the purposes of the official record of The our debates, the words of wisdom which all from our lips we owe so much that no effort of mine could do adequate justice to their services.

Of course, I know that the matter is full of difficulty, for it is said that Russia has made a request to Australia for steel rails, and there is a shortage everywhere. other matter to which I desire to refer is connected with the premature publication of the report of the Royal Commissioner on the Federal Capital works. I should like to make it clear that I do not know Mr Quinn myself, and that I have not been approached by that gentleman or any of his friends; but in the trouble Mr . Quinn has fallen by the way.
