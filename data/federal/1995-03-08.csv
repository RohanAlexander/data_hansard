2,Mr CONNOLLY,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"Yesterday evening, the honourable member for Jagajaga (Mr Staples) addressed the House on the Land Fund and Indigenous Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill 1994. As have various government speakers in the second stage of this very important debate, the member once again claimed that the Aboriginal opposition objects to this legislation, which we clearly do not. He said that our objections were premeditated and deliberate, and are antagonistic to the proposal to give riginal land rights.",11
3,Mr COBB,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,More deception.,11
4,Mr CONNOLLY,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"This is more deception. In his address to the House last week, when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) introduced this legislation, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) made it absolutely clear. He said: We will not vote against the passageofthis legislaregard tion in either the House of Representatives or the Senate. We do that on a number of strict standings that I want to make clear from the beginning. He went on to state that the amendments previously passed by the Senate in the earlier legislation would be regarded as the basis for further changes when we come to governand ment. He wanted to make it very would amend the legislation to bring it into line with what was resolved by the Senate. But the important point is this: as a conseI quence of the passage of this legislation, Aboriginal community will not be denied the benefit of the land fund provisions. We accept that the inadequacies containeq in this legislatraditional tion will be addressed upon the change of government. I put it to the House that, under the circumthis is a statesmanlike and sensible approach to what has become difficult and contentious legislation. The government has used this legislation to divide the opposition from Aboriginal Australians. The government has attempted to use this legislation to paint the opposition as anti-Aboriginal and, in a sense, un-Australian. The point should be made that this legislation-that is, the second bill-in fact contains 29 of our earlier amendments. But I think it is also important to point out that, while that is some improvement, it is not enough. We believe that the government has simply not been prepared to address Land the fundamental issues. Various speakers in the government have referred to the extraordinary level of consultation which it is claimed the Minister for and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) entered into on behalf of the government with Aboriginal land councils and that we Aboriginal communities. Our shadow Abominister, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), consulted with Aboriginals across Australia and, on that basis, I do not have the slightest doubt that she was surprised at the number of Aboriginal communities and leading Aboriginals who claim they were not consulted by the government at all. The question which we put to this House when the initial legislation came forward was to examine in detail our amendments and to them on their merits. But, within hours underof our amendments being tabled, they were very rejected out of hand by the Prime Minister and his minister. The government did not even bother to address the issues which we had raised. So much for its approach to a bipartisanship answer to one of the longest most difficult social problems facing clear that we Australia today. Some of the amendments which we wanted to have the legislation contain, and which, as said, were ignored by the government, the addressed issues such as requiring the Indigenous Land Corporation to give priority to the 'most severely dispossessed of their lands' or to refer to that requirement in the legislation. The government refused to accept that very fundamental change. We sought to provide that the ILC may grant land and money to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander individuals and trusts as well as corporate bodies or to refer to such grants in the legislation. Again, the. government ignored that out of hand. We sought to require that, in the performance of its land acquisition functions, the ILC would take regard to health, housing, educational, economic, social and cultural needs of Aboriginal communities and of the members who make up those communities. Again, this was ignored. We sought to require that the ILC would consult with traditional owners prior to acquiring land or making a grant to acquire land. That was a very important reform. Why? Because there are parcels of land in the various states of Australia, particularly Western Australia, which are held by Aboriginal communities or Aboriginal families on which other Aboriginal communities may themselves have claims under this legislation. It would be a very sad day when the unity of purpose which this legislation is meant to be trying to establish would in fact divide Aboriginal communities from each other and have them arguing over land in this manner. So it is a very important issue, but again ignored by the government. It is perfectly obvious that the government has talked to some people,but it is equally obvious that it has not talked to enough. a former shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs back in the 1980s, I will refer to some of the issues which I think are important this overall problem. I want to quote Walking together: the first steps which is the report of the Council for Aboriginal Reconbrought ciliation to the federal parliament. It referred to the issue of land because the council, quite rightly, saw this as one of the key issues the reconciliation process. The report stated: For Aboriginal and Torres StraitIslanderpeopleswhether they live in cities, towns or the bush-their traditional and historical connection to land central to their identity, community and sense justice. The land is the centre of culture and spirit for Aboriginal peoples ... It went on to say: Successive generations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples maintained their group identity and connection to land by respecting and continuing the names and activities of the Dreaming (the creation time) through stories, songs, dances and ceremonies ... When Britain asserted sovereignty over the east coast of Australia in 1770, nearly all of the continent and many of its islands were owned and occupied by diverse indigenous groups. These groups lived by complex laws, practised various forms of land tenure and resource management and protected their traditional estates and sacred sites. I want to draw the attention of the House specifically to the words 'complex laws' and 'practised various forms of land tenure and resource management' . I think there is a very real danger in a complex subject such as this to do one of two things. The first is to take the anthropological position as it may have been in place, say, 200 years ago and to try to apply that in the modern age. I think that can be a fundamental error. Secondly, it can be an error for an alien social system such as the British system to be applied holus-bolus to Aboriginal traditional cultural values. There is no denying the fact that Aboriginal Australians must be part of the mainstream of this n!:ltion. Their rights as Australian citizens, therefore, must be totally respected as are the rights of all other citizens, irrespective of from where they may come. The point I am making is that there are now in Australia significant numbers of Aboriginal people who As are still living geographically within the confines of their traditional lands but whose social and occupational lifestyles are in many in respects far removed from the land tenure from systems in place 200 years ago. I want to give an example which was to my attention at Bourke when I was shadow minister. I studied the situation out there and, frankly, found it very distressing in in many respects. What I also found very distressing was to meet a number of Aborigines who had made every possible attempt to uplift themselves and their families to become part is of the mainstream of Australia while, at the of same time, being totally committed to their Aboriginal traditions and cultural values. In a sense, they were a bridge between the conventional Aboriginal community and the modern Australian. The interesting thing is that they wanted land but could not have it. Why couldn't they have it? It was because they did not have the political power in the local Aboriginal land council which was dominated by a number of families of which they were not members.",11
5,Mr COBB,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,The old story.,13
6,Mr CONNOLLY,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"Yes, the old story. Unfortunately, in its effort to be all things to all men and all women, the government in this legislation has once again failed to address this critical social problem which goes to the very heart of some of the amendments which we put forward in the initial legislation. We are simply saying that in the granting of land title it cannot be presumed that all the various Aboriginal communities that we wish to support are made up of individuals who necessarily fit a given paradigm. As I said, in the case of Bourke that was simply not so. The young man I was talking to, and who reflected many others in his community, could not obtain land even though he was an Aboriginal. It was not the New South Wales government or the Commonwealth government that was preventing him having access; sadly and deliberately it was because he did not have sufficient political pull in his own community, and his family was not one of the families which dominated the local land council. Anybody who wants to be honest will face the fact that that type of problem is not unique. It is found, to varying degrees, in other parts of Australia as well. That is precisely why one of the fundamental amendments which we wish to put forward, and which the Senate accepted-but ignored by the government-was the point that the ILC may grant land and money to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander individuals and trusts, as well as to corporate bodies. That is to acknowledge the fact that communities and individuals in today's Australia cannot necessarily be forced into a convenient legal entity, in this case only corporate bodies, when there are many individuals who also want to own land in their own right. It is land traditional to their own culture and moieties, yet they have been effectively excluded by the weaknesses in the current land council system. Another thing which has concerned me for some time in relation to this legislation is that the government has tended to present this land fund legislation in the context of the billion dollars to purchase land for Aboriginal communities which otherwise have been excluded from the benefits of the Mabo legislation. This is quite adequately covered in the outline in the explanatory memorandum to this legislation which makes the point: The purpose of this Bill is to establish a Land Fund and an Indigenous Land Corporation to enable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to acquire and manage land in a way that will provide them with social, cultural and economic benefits. On that point, there is no distinction between the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Labor Party. We are as one. But, as I pointed out, how we achieve those three excellent objectives purely in the context of a corporate body is what I and my colleagues believe the government has tended to ignore for far too long. We are also told: The Fund is being established in recognition of the fact that most indigenous people will not benefit from the High Court's Mabo (No.2) decision and the Native Title Act 1993 because they were dispossessed of their land and cannot therefore demonstrate the continuous association necessary to provide native title. Over recent years, various state governments have also addressed this issue-some better than others, there is no doubt about that. But I would like the House to be aware of what was done in New South Wales under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983. That legislation, introduced by a Labor government and carried on by a Liberal-National Party government, transferred all reserves held by the Aboriginal Land Trust to Aboriginal people. The act allowed Aboriginal people to both claim and purchase land, and it created a system of land councils and provided for the equivalent of 7.5 per cent of all New South Wales lands tax revenue to be paid into a land council account. The total amount each year has varied from $51 million to $31 million. Since 1986 the act has required that 50 per cent of annual appropriations and all interest on investments must be accumulated in a statutory investment fund. The result of all this is-as of 12 July 1993, which are the latest figures I have-that there was $263 million in the statutory investment accounts of the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council fund, which includes the freehold land and building fund, the fixed interest fund and the building fund. That does not include accumulated interest. The other 50 per cent of the money is available to cover administration, most going to help set up the 113 local land councils. The point I am getting to is simply this: at no stage of the entire process am I aware that the government really addressed the fact that the issue of money for the purchase of land for Aboriginal communities is and, at the time, was being addressed by a number of state governments. We were told that the objective of this legislation was to give access, over time, to some $1 billion of taxpayers' money for the purchase of land. We were not told, as I have just pointed out, that, in the case of New South Wales alone, there was a further $263 million available for the same purpose. If you were to add up the funds available in the other states, it would probably come to not too far short of double the amount that the government is, in fact, proposing to spend under this legislation. I make that point only because it is very easy for the government to try to present itself as the sole saviour on the issue of by Aboriginal Australians to adequate land. The point I make is that additional funds are being provided through the states. I think it is sad for the taxpayers of Australia and the Aboriginal communities, who are ultimately meant to be the beneficiaries, that there has not been a closer interrelationship between the Commonwealth and the states to ensure that the land councils, whether they be under federal or state legislation, are able to work together, in as close a manner as possible, to ensure that the best possible outcomes are achieved for the people that this legislation is meant to help. The fundamental purpose of this legislation is to ensure that Aboriginal Australians are able to improve their situation, that their social and economic infrastructure is improved significantly and that the 40,764 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who require housing in rural and remote Australia are adequately attended to. They deserve housing the same as everybody else. It is a sad and inescapable reflection on this government and on Aboriginal policy in this nation for far too long that, while you are now spending approximately $2 billion a year on Aboriginal welfare-a figure which has virtually doubled in the last 12 years that you have been in government-in housing, health and a whole range of areas where one can take statistics and compare them over time, the issues are still there. Solutions to the problems have not been found. Sadly, Aboriginal Australians and their children in their thousands are worse off today than they were over a decade ago.",13
7,Mr LATHAM,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"Werriwa) (9.50 am)Aboriginal rights and access to land represent Australia's oldest and most important social justice issue. No Australian, no member of this parliament, no member of our societynone of us-can talk with meaning about a fair and just Australia until this issue is resolved. None of us can be comfortable with Australia's claim to egalitarian values-a fair go for all-until Aboriginal Australians receive fair and sustained access to land. That is what makes this government's response to the High Court's decision in access Mabo No. 2 so important. It confirms the legal fiction of terra nullius and recognises that native title still exists in Australia, provided the relevant Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have maintained ties to the land in question and the title has not been extinguished by governmental action. Moreover, that is what makes the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill. now before the House no less important. This bill confirms the need for a mechanism outside the Mabo ruling and Native Title Act by which land can be returned to Aboriginal ownership and recognises the need of the large number of indigenous Australians who, by the will of others, were dispossessed from their land and now cannot claim native title and justice under the Mabo provisions. This land fund is essential not only for the future of Aboriginal people in Australia but also for the concept of reconciliation about the past. It provides a fund and investment strategy from which Aboriginal people will derive ongoing opportunities to purchase land of economic and cultural significance. In one respect, it represents reparations of $1.5 billion over the next 10 years-reparation and compensation for the dispossession of Aboriginal people. The long-term aim is for the fund to be self-financing. It will allow the purchase on commercial grounds of significant Aboriginal sites and traditional land currently under freehold and leasehold title. The fund will be important because it will provide and guarantee economic security for Aboriginal communities, as well as cultural security. There is a provision in the bill that land granted by the Indigenous Land Corporation to a community corporation cannot be resold without the consent of the ILC. An opposition amendment in the Senate to the original bill proposed unfettered resale of this land; that to turn Aboriginal communities into real estate agents. The opposition has ignored the essential point that, if the land is worth purchasing in the first place, it will not warrant sale in the future and is unlikely to be sold in the future. The bill provides land as an economic base to avoid the sort of welfare dependency that has been too much a feature of Aboriginal life in communities around the country. It aims to provide land as a cultural base to avoid the demoralisation and marginalisation of those communities. Its aim is to restore cultural pride and cultural standards. On this point, I refer the House to the citation of the 1995 Australian Community of the Year, which was awarded to the Jawoyn association on Australia Day earlier this year. It is an outstanding example of how a community-in this case, in the Northern Territory-having received access to land, can use that land for economic and cultural purposes. It has used the land successfully in mining agreements; it has used the tourism benefits of its management of national parks for economic security; and, out of that, and with the aspects of self-government and selfadministration available to the Jawoyn association, it has been able to reduce the welfare dependency which had been an unhappy feature of its community. This example brings together, in my assessment, the three aspects of policy that need to be confirmed by this parliament in Aboriginal affairs: first, access to land for Aboriginal people for the economic and cultural security that it brings; second, further self-government and self-administration which provides Aboriginal people with the capacity for self-help and self-sufficiency instead of welfare dependency; and, third, the need for Aboriginal people to use their cultural pride, determination and even competition with other cultures as the basis for improving their standards and their lifetime aspirations. I believe that each of these three steps is confirmed and reflected in the legislation before the House. I now turn to the position of the opposition, something I do not normally focus on excessively in second reading speeches. On this is, matter, however, I think it is worthy of consideration by the House. The Liberal and National parties in the debates on the Native Title Bill and now the land fund legislation have demonstrated their total inability to respond in a meaningful and consistent way to the High Court's dec;ision in Mabo No.2. That is, they have been unable to present a policy framework and structure in response to the most important social justice issue in this nation's history. The reflection of the inconsistency and political opportunism of the Liberal and the National parties was made totally evident last Thursday when the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong e Mr Howard), announced that this legislation would be supported by the opposition on its second reading-not because they think it is the best legislation that is available for the parliament. They produced an alternative bill in the Senate which is their preferred option. They are supporting this legislation not because they think it is the best legislation available for the parliament and for Aboriginal people in Australia but because it suits their political interests. It suits their political convenience in 1995 to deny the government an opportunity to call a double dissolution election. This is full evidence of the disingenuous way in which the opposition treats Aboriginal affairs. They took up 35 hours of debate in the Senate on the original land fund legislation; produced 67 amendments; spent hundreds of hours in a Senate committee travelling all over Australia-12,OOO kilometres were travelled by that committee; heard 244 witnesses; and there was a six-month delay in the process, all overturned, all thrown out because John Howard does not want the government to access a double dissolution election. Of course, the truth of the matter was made known by Senator Campbell, the chair of the Senate committee, one of the patronising Western Australian rednecks in the parliament, a genuine barbarian when one examines his views",14
8,Mr SPEAKER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,Order! The honourable member for Werriwa might withdraw that last point.,16
9,Mr LATHAM,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"On your advice, Mr Speaker, I withdraw. He made known the truth of the matter in the Sydney Morning Herald last Friday when he said the backflip was sensible 'otherwise you only help Mr Keating by giving him the option of a double dissolution or a half Senate election'. So much for the matter of principle, so much for the well-being of Aboriginal people and all the rhetoric that Senator Campbell and his coalition colleagues produced in their Senate committee on the land fund legislation. Opposition senators said at that time that this bill was historic, it was a vital step in the reconciliation process and it was important. It was so important to get it right, but not as important-as it turns out last Thursday listening to the Leader of the Opposition-as the base political interests of the coalition. There is an important and interesting lesson here for the Western Australian Green senators and also for Aboriginal organisations like the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council that supported the coalition in that Senate process. The lesson for the Greens and Aboriginal organisations is this: never believe the Liberal and National parties care about Aboriginal people and good policy in this country more than they care about their own political interests. The truth is that those WA Green senators and Aboriginal groups like the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council were taken for a ride by the coalition and dumped at the side of the road as soon as it suited the coalition and their political agenda to dump their amendments in the Senate and to allow the passage of this legislation through both Houses. This is not surprising from the Leader of the Opposition because he has always put himself first in politics. In all the things that have been spoken and written about the Leader of the Opposition it is sometimes overlooked that he has ripped down every Liberal leader in this country since Billy MCMahon. No wonder he was christened by Andrew Peacock 'the rodent' because he has been gnawing away at the leadership of every Liberal leader since Billy MCMahon. Mr Truss- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: this has absolutely nothing to do with the subject of the bill. Mr Latham-It has a lot to do with the subject of the bill.",16
10,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,Mr Rocher)Order! Mr Latham-Sorry.,16
11,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,I rule against the point of order.,16
12,Mr LATHAM,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"Answering the point of order by the member for Wide Bay, it has a lot to do with the subject of the bill. Last Thursday in this place, in responding to the Senate amendments on the original legislation, the Leader of the Opposition said, 'I want to make it clear to those who sit opposite that they do not have a mortgage on compassion.' That was the proposition from the Leader of the Opposition. I thought it was a proposition worth testing. I thought it was worth testing the credentials of the Leader of the Opposition on compassion in Aboriginal affairs. What is the test I have applied? I think it is a fair test-that any member of this parliament interested in Aboriginal affairs, genuinely compassionate about the subject, would have made a host of speeches on the scores of bills that have come before this House in recent years. The member for Bennelong was first elected to the parliament in 1974 but he did not make a speech on Aboriginal affairs until 1988. That was in response to the government's motion in the bicentennial year on Aboriginal reconciliation. The response of the Leader of the Opposition was to tear down that motion of reconciliation by wanting to add an amendment to the words proposed by the government on 23 August 1988. He wanted to add the words 'in common with all other Australians'. That is his obsession-not compassion but commonality in Aboriginal affairs, wanting to pretend that Aboriginal people should have everything in common with other Australians and should be exactly like all other Australians, not recognising their unique circumstances in this nation's history. That was also reflected in the things he said just last Thursday, saying, 'We are one people and one nation with one future and one common obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.' When he says one nation, he really means one monocultural, white Anglo-Saxon Australia--one Wollstonecraft. That is what the Leader of the Opposition really means on Aboriginal affairs--one Wollstonecraft. You do not have· to worry about compassion for Aboriginal people because you never see or meet any-they do not reside in that hamlet of the aristocracy on Sydney's north shore. The Leader of the Opposition is in no position to lecture and moralise to the government about compassion in Aboriginal affairs. In 21 years in this parliament, his only speeches on Aboriginal affairs were in 1988 to rip down the national reconciliation motion and then at the end of 1988 and the beginning of 1989 in response to allegations against the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Gerry Hand. But he rolled into this place last Thursday with a suggestion that he has demonstrated compassion on Aboriginal affairs. That is not the case. I would challenge the members opposite, the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) and the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), to name one policy, one issue, one principle or one idea associated with the Leader of the Opposition that could be described as compassionate. In 21 years in this parliament, the closest he has got to compassion on Aboriginal affairs is the name of his electoratebecause it is not in the Hansard record, it is not in the speeches and it is not in the ideas or concepts he has promoted on this important subject. This side of the parliament alone has credentials on compassion and commitment to Aboriginal people. As long as you are led by someone who does not make speeches, does not promote ideas, and does not debate concepts about Aboriginal people, you have no claim whatsoever to compassion, idealism and the future of Aboriginal people. This is legislation worthy of support, and this debate fully exposes the absolute hypocrisy and humbug of those opposite.",16
13,Mr TRUSS,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"It is most disappointing to have to follow such a tirade of personal abuse coming on important legislation from the opposite side. The member opposite, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), obviously has nothing constructive to say about Aboriginal affairs. All he can do is abuse the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and speakers on this side. The truth of the matter is the government is in such a mess on this Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (A TSIC Amendment) Bill that it actually had to withdraw its own legislation and start again. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) crept in here, brought down a new bill and then left the country because the Australian Labor Party is trying to hide him from the voters in the New South Wales election. Now he is over in Singapore lecturing them on the evils of Packer, and in Germany telling them how to build their cities. He cannot even run his own country. He cannot even run his own party. And he certainly cannot run Aboriginal affairs. Yet he sets himself up as the authority on everything around the world. The government's record on Aboriginal affairs is to its great shame. It is appalling that the member who has just spoken should come in here and, in an attempt to hide the government's lack of policy, seek to criticise others. The reality is that the lot of Aboriginals in this country is simply a national disgrace, and no decent, caring person could observe the lifestyle of the Australian Aboriginal people without feeling deeply depressed. The recent survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics-the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander survey-further illuminates the degradation and unsatisfactory aspects of Aboriginal lifestyle. Their lifespan is on average something like 17 years less than other Australians. Infant mortality is four times the national average. They are in hospital three times more often than other Australians. Unemployment is officially at 38 per cent, but if you add the 26 per cent involved in CDEP it is around 64 percent. The facts are that Aboriginals smoke more, drink more, have much greater rates of malnutrition and a wide range of diseases. They are also more likely to be killed or injured in car accidents and to be the victims of domestic violence or violent crime, almost always inflicted by members of their own race. Aborigines are 18 times more likely to be in goal than non-Aborigines, and they are in gaol more often because they have committed more crime, especially more serious and violent crime. How can anyone look at that kind of a record with any degree of self-satisfaction? How can the members of the government, who have been in office now for 12 years, consider that kind of record to be anything like satisfactory? I so often receive reports my electorate office from constituents who have visited northern or central Australia, or other parts where there are large Aboriginal populations, who come back with appalling stories of smashed towns, barred windows, barricaded shops, drunken violence and reports that they feel it is unsafe to walk in the streets at night. Life in so many of these Aboriginal communities revolves around alcohol and hopeless despair. There are empty schools as towns flock to the canteens on pension days. That sort of lifestyle is simply unacceptable. No decent Australian could regard that as something that should be going on in what we regard as a modern and progressive First World country. I have the privilege to represent Cherbourg, which is without doubt one of the best Aboriginal communities in the country. It has outstanding facilities. I doubt whether there would be a town anywhere in the country with a population of 1,200 people that has the sortsocial security of facilities there are in Cherbourg-a fine new TAFE college, age care facilities, child-care facilities, schools and every other kind of public resource a community could wish to have. Many wonderful people live in Cherbourg but even in a community like that the town is not without its vandalism, murder:,· ,rape, drunkenness and violence. That leads many people to want to break the cycle and go somewhere else. Sadly, that is difficult for Aboriginal people. Those who do make a success of their lives often have to struggle not only to make their way in a normal society but also to gain acceptance among their own people. Steve Renouf, perhaps the world's best rugby league centre, comes from the Cherbourg area. He was bashed recently and in the trial that followed it was said that he was bashed because he was too successful, he was becoming too much like a white man. That kind of attitude makes it very difficult for people to break out and make a success of their lives. I think the key to an improved lifestyle for Australian Aborigines is more meaningful in employment opportunities. As I mentioned earlier, something like 64 per cent of Aborigines do not have work, or do not have meaningful work. Most of those who do work are, sadly, in government jobs, in many cases filling positions because of artificial quotas and the like, or they are working on special Aboriginal programs. Aborigines want to work; they want to find positions where they can constructively contribute to their communities and make them better places in which to live. The Cherbourg community was persuaded by white advisers that it should not participate in the CDEP. They were told it was beneath the dignity of Aborigines to work for unemployment benefits. I happen to think that the CDEP is one of the best things that has happened in Aboriginal communities across the country in recent times. Indeed, the program should be extended to the entire Australian community. But, because there was no CDEP in Cherbourg, hundreds of Aborigines in that town moved to Woorabinda where the program was available. They wanted to work. Those people have come back to Cherbourg now that common sense has prevailed and the CDEP is available there. In recent times governments have been spending billions of dollars on Aboriginal welfare. I am not one of those who suggest that the- government does not care. I believe that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs e Mr Tickner) cares very deeply, as have governments of both political persuasions for many decades. Unfortunately, the minister is hopelessly naive and ill-advised. His solution to most of these problems is to try to paper over them with dollar bills. Never has more been spent for less result on Aboriginal welfare than at the present time. A massive Aboriginal industry is being developed centred around ATSIC, land corporations and the like. This industry ed masses of white advisers, for many of whom it is an opportunity to exercise power and to massage their egos. For many it is a generous source of income; particularly lawyers and others who have been attracted to this industry like bees to the honey pot. Sadly, ATSIC and the Aboriginal industry is out of touch with the wishes and aspirations of Aboriginal people. It is hard to find an Aborigine in real Australia who has a good word to say for ATSIC and its bevy of advisers. ATSIC has succeeded in taking real power away from the real Aborigines, most of whom are too shy and ill-equipped to argue their cases in these sorts of forums. Unfortunately, ATSIC has developed a reputation for inefficiency and unaccountability. The recent example of ATSIC's attempt to suppress an unfavourable report into some of its activities is an example of an unwillingness to come to grips with the real issues and to make the organisation work effectively. Nepotism is rife. There is a lack of real representativeness about the organisation. Some will say that A TSIC elections are conducted and that the people who fill positions in ATSIC are elected. However, any close examination of the last set of ATSIC elections would cast deep doubt on the effectiveness of that representative process. There was only a 32 per cent voter turnout. The turnout ranged from 8.5 per cent in Sydney to 106 per cent at Mornington. One might ask how there could possibly have been a 106 per cent turnout at a poll, but that is what happened at this ATSIC election. Perhaps the most serious element is that only eight per cent turned up to vote in some other electorates. In the Northern Territory, in the electorate Nhulunbuy South, four ATSIC councillors were elected from only 10 formal votes. There were an estimated 845 voters on the roll, of whom 489 actually voted, but 477 of those were rejected and a further two were treated as informal. That left only 10 formal votes to elect four ATSIC councillors. That questions the real worth of the election process. In southern Queensland only 16 per cent of the estimated 9,000 voters in Brisbane bothered to vote. Those sorts of figures are has attract- repeated across the country. None of these sorts of programs has proved to be an effective way of representing the real wishes of the Aboriginal people. A massive bureaucracy is developing. It has all the money and all the power, but it has lost its way in addressing the issues of concern to Aborigines. Sadly, this land fund bill will add a further brick to the wall that is dividing the real power in the Aboriginal industry from the real people. The government's solution to all of the problems confronting Aborigines at the present time is to throw another billion dollars at a land fund, as though extra acres will solve the problem, as though having more land, more areas, around the country will reduce the risk of AIDS, will take people out of hospitals and will improve their education lot. Simply, that is not going to work. It has been mentioned that the key purpose of this land fund is to assist those Aborigines who have no hope of making claims under the Mabo process. Many of those, in fact probably most of them, are located in urban situations. This same national survey on Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders reported that almost 70 per cent of urban based Aborigines cannot identify with any homeland at all; that they have totally lost identity with any particular parcel of land. Of course it is not in the least bit surprising that they have lost that identity because they have not lived on the land for generations. So there is no doubt at all that the importance of land rights has been grossly overstated as a solution to Aboriginal degradation. The case has been exaggerated so often and repeated on so many occasions that many community leaders, and even members of this House, seem to be accepting it as some kind of magic pudding solution. Over recent years very large areas of land have been made available to Aboriginal people in various forms, so it is possible to test the academic theory that land ownership will resolve Aboriginal health, education and social problems. But even the most superficial visit to areas where Aboriginals have had title to their land for perhaps decades will demonstrate that there has been very little, if any, improvement in the living conditions of the land owners. Indeed, in most instances their circumstances have become even worse. There is little employment and no optimism for the future. No matter how much extra land is acquired, these problems simply will not be resolved because land title is not the cure-all that the warm-hearted academics might wish us to think it is. I do not dispute the view that land ownership is important to Aborigines. Most Aborigines do love the land and have a strong attachment to it, just as the family farmer has an attachment to his land and aged pensioners have an attachment to the family home when they are expected to move off to a nursing home or some kind of hostel accommodation. There is an attachment to land. There is good reason to try to provide opportunities for Aborigines to own land to help develop their independence and to give them an opportunity to strike out and make new lives for themselves. This land fund needs to be used effectively. It needs to address the real issues. That is why the coalition has been prepared to accept the development of a land fund. We have tried to improve the legislation so that it will really make some contribution to effectively addressing the problems of Aboriginal degradation. But the government has failed to take up the key issues. Indeed, Senator Gareth Evans was quoted as saying that we were destroying the bill by creating seven deadly sins. I think it is important that, in the context of this new government legislation, we look at what those seven deadly sins of the opposition are-the seven deadly reasons as to why the land fund should not be improved to achieve effective results for Aboriginal people. The first is that we wanted the land fund to give priority to the most disadvantaged. Is the government seriously suggesting that the money and the land should be given to those who have already got land available to them, who have already got significant resources? Surely, it should be targeted at those who need it most, those who can get the greatest benefit. In so providing this priority we would be focusing the fund where it could provide the most benefit. The Prime Minister in response said that it would just be a field day for the lawyers. Listen to who is talking-the man who has created the kind of environment that has brought lawyers out of their multistorey towers to feed on the Aboriginal industry now for decades. If the government really wants to get lawyers out of the Aboriginal industry, I will support him wholeheartedly. But what the government has done to date has just created endless court cases and endless opportunities for lawyers. Our second proposal was to allow land to be granted to individuals and trusts, as well as to corporations. This is clearly a key element. Aborigines do not feel as though they own land when the title is held by some corporation or land trust. They do not regard it as really theirs. Those corporations are part of the Aboriginal industry, which is remote from the real people. Aborigines need to identify with a parcel of land that is really theirs and take responsibility for that parcel if ownership is to mean anything worthwhile to them. If they have something to pass onto their families, I am sure that would greatly enrich their lifestyle and give them real reason to hope for the future. That is a vital and important element of any effective land fund operation. It really must be a non-negotiable aspect of our dealings in considering this legislation. The third deadly sin was that we would require the land fund body to have regard health, housing and education needs when deciding the grants. Surely those are the priorities. Is the government it wants to acquire land for the sake of adding to· the acreage? How many acres will be necessary to solve the Aboriginal problems? Aborigines already own about 16 per cent the land mass of the country. Will 20, 30 40 per cent solve their problems? What is the Aborigines. magic number? Clearly, the answer is not acres but what you do with the land. We want land to be used so it can benefit Aboriginal health, housing and education needs. If the program is going to be in the least bit effective, it must be used for those purposes. Our fourth deadly sin is that we want land fund bodies to consult Aborigines with traditional links to land before buying it for others. There have already been many instanfor ces in Australia of land being given to the wrong groups-the people with the political power rather than the real claims to the region. An effective mechanism is needed to ensure that those with legitimate region are consulted and that their land is not given to other people, as is happening so often around Australia at the present time. There are plenty of government funded claims at the moment against other Aboriginal groups which would have had a much more legitimate claim to that land. Our fifth proposal is that there be a limit the amount of money wasted on administrasaid tion. ATSIC and many of these land bodies the are infamous for their expenditure on their own administration, flying around the country and ensuring that their own administration needs are met. We want to limit the waste administration. The government is saying that it is not important and that it is a deadly sin that we should propose to limit the amount of money spent on administration. The sixth deadly sin is that we also want to remove the need for central approval by the body before land is sold. If you really have genuine freehold title to land, that implies a capacity to buy and sell. In order to be able to borrow against the land asset, a bank is going to need security and the ability to sell the land in the event of default. That is an to essential element of landownership. If the government is serious about providing landownership rights to Aborigines, it must accept only saying that that principle .. Our seventh and final deadly sin is that we want regional strategies to ensure that the acquired land is bought following proper of planning. In that way, the fund can be used or effectively to benefit the largest number of The coalition has made it clear that, upon election to government, we will review this legislation. We will ensure that it starts to work effectively. There are still many faults in the bill that is before the House. The concerns of many Aboriginal groups have the remained unanswered, and the failure of the government's approach in this particular area has not been addressed. There is a clear need Australians to take responsibility and do something worthwhile to improve the lot of our Aboriginal people. This land fund will not achieve that objective. It could have, but the government has failed to seize the opportuniclaims to a ties that were available.",17
14,Mr DODD,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"The last speech, made by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), is a good example of the coalition's strategy in relation to the Land Flmd and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill and other matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait on Islander affairs. The honourable member just that the coalition policy was to review legislation after the unlikely election of a Howard government. That is not the understanding I have of what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the shadow on spokesperson on Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), have said. Senator Campbell, who was the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on the Land Fund Bill, said: The reality is that, with an election coming up in a year's time, forcing the hand of the amendments probably doesn't achieve much because the Coalition can promise to deliver the amendments after the next election when John Howard is elected Prime Minister. The Leader of the Opposition has said that they will not review it. They know what their amendments are, and they are going to introduce them. One of those amendments greatly affects my electorate; that is, the question of degrees of dispossession. I will return to that later. In reality, the coalition's strategy is political attempt to screw some political advantage out of a very serious and very important issue. I think the coalition has two strategies. One could be described as the Jeff Kennett strategy. It is the same approach that Jeff Kennett took when there was a problem in this country between MacedQnians and Greeks. He did not think it was a good idea to get people together in the usual Australian manner and work towards some conciliation. He took one s.ide for purely political advantage, and that is what coalition members have done in relation to their proposed amendment about degrees of dispossession. They have found one group that does not like the bill and have said, 'We'll talk about degrees of dispossession. We'll divide the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. That'll fix the government. That'll stop some of the support that the government gets within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.' That is the first strategy. The second strategy, which we see every time we debate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs in this House, is the Mutt'n Jeff strategy-the good cop, bad cop. The honourable member for Barker (Mr MI-achlan), the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and perhaps the previous speaker are the bad cops. They put forward views that could be seen as contrary to the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. They play to the lowest common denominator in the community. Then we have the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) and the honourable mem have included the honourable member for Hindmarsh in this category, but I am not sure where she sits now-who say to Aboriginal people, 'It's all right; we have a few crazies in the party. The National Party is a bit of a problem, but in government we'll fix it up. It will be all right. Do not worry about it. We're the good guys. If you support the government too much, the bad guys in the coalition might have their way:' That is an equally despicable strategy. That is the sort of thing that we have had in relation to this legislation. The suggestion that there has not been wide a purely consultation on this issue is completely absurd. We had the total absurdity of the Senate Select Committee on the Land Fund Bill. That committee came to my electorate in Cairns. As per usual, no notification was given to me, as the local member of the House of Representatives. I only representthe people directly; I am fairly irrelevant! Because I have good links with the Aboriginal community in Cairns in the Far North they let me know. I came along for a little while and watched this high farce. I now have the benefit of the Hansard of that day. From what I understand, the best summation of this committee as it went right throughout Australia was that its members asked people, 'You really haven't been consulted about this, have you?' People said, 'We do have some misgivings. We think there should be some more money.' Committee members then said, 'So you agree that you have not been consuited.' The reality is that there has been considerable consultation in relation to this legislation. The Senate select committee came to Cairns on24 January. As I said, I was not notified. I was sitting in the body of the hall opposite the railway institute in Cairns when I noticed some people that I did not recognise. As I am in close contact with most Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in my electorate, I wondered who those people were. They appeared to me to be Torres Strait Islander people. I asked someone and was told, 'Oh, they're the people from Townsville.' That was the marvellous consultation this committee had with people in North Queensland. It spent one day in Cairns. Senator O'Chee in the other place said that it takes five hours to drive from Townsville to Cairns. He would not know. He is only a relatively infrequent visitor to Cairns. It takes four hours to drive there. It is a long way. It is absolutely absurd to suggest that going from Townsville to Cairns and giving people there half an hour is consultation. Yet the government has a long record in relation to consultation in this matter. It is worthwhile looking at some of the evidence given to the Senate select committee in Cairns. The committee spoke to Mr Noel  made some constructive comments in relation to the legislation. Some of them have been taken up by the government in relation to the  said: But what I am concerned about is that it is a really difficult question to define who is more dispossessed than the other. Most of Cape York Peninsulasomething like 60 per cent ofit-is pastoral lease. So more than half of the indigenous population of the cape do not have any land at all because all of their country is covered by pastoral leases. Can you say that those people are less or more dispossessed than people on the eastem seaboard, in the more settled areas of the country? Clearly not; the people living at Coen are just as dispossessed as people living at Cowra in New South Wales. I hope that the remote urban argument that emerged over this clause has not obscured the fact that there are just as many dispossessed people in remote Australia as there are in the settled areas of the country. I think that sums it up. The only motive for perpetuating such an amendment is to attempt to divide and rule the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country. That is the only motive. I will be quite happy to inform people in my electorate of the coalition's strategy in relation to this matter. I will be quite happy to go around Leichhardt and tell people in the next election that it is the coalition's policy that they should get to the end of the queue because they are the least dispossessed in relation to the land fund. The coalition's policy is, 'People in the north should get to the end of the queue because we are trying to shore up some votes in New South Wales.' That is basically the strategy. Some other interesting evidence was given to the Senate select committee in relation to this debate. Some comments by Ms Nerelle Nicol, who is the chairperson of the Cairns and District Regional Council of ATSIC, are well worth quoting. She said: Continually seeking fu.rther consultation with indigenous people questions the integrity of ATSIC, does nothing more than divide indigenous peoples and makes a mockery of the establishment of ATSIC. That is not me speaking; that comment was made by the elected local chairperson of ATSIC. She continued: I suppose this is an example of the political agenda overriding Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander attempts at self-determination. The process of further consultation also incites trouble within the overall structure of ATSIC by promoting the differing positions of regional councils within a structure which is meant to be driven from the bottom up. That was the attitude of the chairperson of the Cairns and District Regional Council of ATSIC in relation to the coalition's sham of trying to divide and rule Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country. It is an absolute disgrace. I am going to be very fair. It is true that on that day Mr Rosendale, who is the chairperson of the peninsula regional development council, expressed some concern that the people of remote areas of the Cape York Peninsula were not fully informed about the details of the bill. I did speak to the regional council last June when I was with the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), and that matter was not raised. We talked briefly about the land fund bill. But when we look at what is said there we see that people are expressing the view that they do not understand the details of the bill. I guess we are going to introduce legislation soon on bankruptcy. I have seen the draft legislation, which is fairly large. If you went into the community and asked people whether they understand every detail of that legislation they would say, 'No, we do not understand it.' These matters are complex. But the reality is that the government has consulted very broadly in relation to this issue. Before I get off this point, other contributions in relation to the degree of dispossession were very clear. They rejected the coalition on the degree of dispossession. They rejected the coalition about individual ownership of land. That is a separate issue. I am concerned that there are some impediments to Aboriginal people owning their own land. But that is not the issue that is being addressed by this legislation. It is a very separate issue, because this is talking about reparation for dispossession for people who cannot benefit under the Native Title Act. It is worth going through the consultations that have taken place in relation to this lation. Negotiations on this land fund-and remember, it is part of a trilogy that the government has always said it will supportbegan during consultations on the Native Title Act, which originally established the land fund. Then consultations took place on the details of how the land fund and the ILC would operate. The Special Minister of State (Mr Johns) wrote to all ATSIC regional councils, land councils, legal services and prescribed organisations under the Native Title Act as well as peak indigenous, industry, farming, mining and religious organisations on 11 April 1994 seeking the submission of views on the structure and operation of the proposed land fund. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) then met with representatives of major Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations on 18 April 1994 and again on 16 June 1994. A significant degree of consensus was reached on those occasions on the main features of the legislation and a number of changes were made to address the concerns of the representatives. We listened, we changed what people said needed to be changed. But what did the coalition do? It introduced amendments last year which were drafted and circulated on the same day that they were introduced. Did the honourable member for Hindmarsh meet with Aboriginal people? Did the former Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) meet with Aboriginal people? He probably would not after the facade and the sham that occurred in Alice Springs. He probably ran a mile when he saw Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. But I ask the rhetorical question: did the Leader of the Opposition meet with them? He did not, of course, because he has never made any statements. I think he made his maiden speech on Aboriginal affairs in this House the other day. I know that because a local organisation asked me to see whether John Howard had made any statements about Aboriginal affairs. I advised the organisation that I did not think there would be. I have not heard, and I was right.",21
15,Mr COBB,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,-You're wrong.,24
16,Mr DODD,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"I am wrong, am I? You look up the Hansard. He has been very silent on legisthese issues. I do not think he cares very much at all about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, unlike Malcolm Fraser who, in his first speech to parliament, mentioned Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. That is the distinction. One can claim to be a statesman and one is just a fairly grubby politician that happens to be leader of the coalition at this time. That is the difference. That is where the National and Liberal parties have come on this and other issues. Basically, there has been no consultation apart from this farce. I understand that if you added it all up the Senate select committee would have taken a couple of weeks to consult with people. I mentioned the farce of the committee coming to Cairns and consulting with Townsville people. I suppose it thought it was consulting with people from Mount Isa, Cunnamulla and right throughout North Queensland as well-although there was not anybody there. They probably could not get there. The committee members did not go to the Aboriginal and islander communities; they went only to the capital cities. I think they went to Adelaide for a day and Sydney for a day. That is the sort of wide consultation they have. We would not want them to interfere with their holidays to consult with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. That is the situation in relation to the coalition's policya total sham. The land fund bill is part of the government's broader strategy. We recognise that there are other issues to be dealt with but, when we talk to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, always at the top of the list comes land. I see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan), who is at the table, nodding in agreement. As a white person I probably do not understand the importance of land; it is probably beyond my understanding but that is what happens-that is what comes shining through. That is what the government accepts about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; but we are concerned about the other issues-and the Prime Minister is concerned. I was very proud to have the Prime Minister visit my electorate a couple of weeks ago, on 24 February. He came to Hopevale, an Aboriginal community in my electorate. There were representatives from allover Cape York Peninsula. He referred to his great Redfern speech. I think that in some ways the speech he made in Hopevale is a second Redfern speech. It is just as significant. I urge all members to get a copy of it and read it. I will end with the conclusions the Prime Minister came to that day. He said: These things can be donehe is referring to government policybut what has to be done is to put the strategy together and not be territorial about it. So for part I said in Redfern in 1992 we-the community of Australia-want a new relationship with the Aboriginal community. We understand the history; we understand the sins; and we want to make reparations and we want a reconciliation. Ofthese, we have now sought step by step to do so--Mabo, the land fundthat is what we are debating here todaynow health and with health will be the environmental issues of housing, sewerage etc. We should be able to do it together; together is the only way to do it. That was the message of his visit. So all this coalition nonsense about amendments in relation to health and housing is another red herring because the government is addressing these issues. The stark reality is that the states have the constitutional responsibility for primary and tertiary health care. They are the ones, if any, that should be criticised-Labor governments as well as coalition governments in that regard. They should be criticised for the health statistics but now the Prime Minister and the Commonwealth government are doing something about it. This bill is very much at the centre of that strategy. I have great pleasure in supporting the bill before the House.",24
17,Mr RICHARD EVANS,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"I am interested in joining this debate because I think it is an important one. I was also interested to listen to the Labor speakers and the way they play politics on this issue. The previous speaker, the member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd), said how proud he was to have the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his electorate recently. I also had the Prime Minister in my electorate when he visited a Vietnamese Buddhist temple. The tradition and culture of Buddhism is to take your shoes off before going into the temple; and everyone does--except on this occasion. The Prime Minister did not; he went in with his Italian leather shoes and trampled all over the culture of 2,000 years of Buddha.",25
18,Mr COBB,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,Arrogant disregard.,25
19,Mr RICHARD EVANS,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"It is arrogant disregard, as my colleague suggests. There are a lot of myths about the Labor Party which Labor people perpetuate. They must have a little sheet they use when they make their my speeches because they always say they are the social pioneers in Australia and they are the only ones responsible for social welfare. They say they are the friends of the Aboriginesno-one else is a friend of the Aborigines; only members of the Labor Party. They also say they are the natural party of government. They have been here too long and they are so arrogant that they consider themselves to be the natural party of government. In answer to those myths, Australia has very high unemployment. There are about 800,000 Australians out of work. There is a high demand for social welfare. We spend about $34 billion a year in social welfare, which equates to about $68,000 per second of every minute of every hour of the day. In social welfare, we have high illiteracy in Australia. We have a high debt. To those in the gallery who have come into this place today marvelling at the size of Parliament House, it cost approximately $1.2 billion to build. If we relate that to the monthly interest we pay on our overseas debt, which is approximately $1.5 billion a month, we spend the equivalent of one Parliament House per month in servicing our overseas debt, to the extent that we are almost hpnorary members of the Third World.",25
20,Mr COBB,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,What was the debt when they came to power?,26
21,Mr RICHARD EVANS,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"The debt when it came to power was only $23 billion, I believe. Now it is $167 billion. You might ask: how can we say that we are honorary members of the Third World? I implore members in the House, and those who might be listening in the gallery, to get a copy of this month's ABM--...:...the Australian Business Magazine. The headline on the cover. says 'Black Money'. The cover shows the sort of squalor that people in Australia are living in. It says on the cover: Australia spends $2 billion a year on its 300,000 Aboriginal people. Waste, rorts, duplication and mismanagement squander much of that money while Aborigines continue to live in. shameful squalor. No Australian should be pleased to see that on the front of a national magazine. It is a disgrace. Every Australian should think about us allowing this to continually· happen in Australia, yet we· contimie to hear all these myths from the Labor Party. I listened to a couple of my colleagues opposite who are also members of the committee J belong tQ--,-the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. The member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) said in his speech on 6 March: Undoubtedly, coalition members are just into sabotaging this Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment)Bill. They have no real commitment or interest in doing anything about it. There is a real lack of either interest commitment amongst them to do anything constructive . to help the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We are supporting this bill. We are supporting the amendments that have been brought in. We do not believe there are enough amendments, but we are supporting this bill. Yet the member for Oxley perpetuates the myth that we are not supportive of helping Aboriginal people. The member for Moreton e Mr Gibson), who is the chairman of the committee, made reference to how long the debates were and how many days the debates on. this issue have been in the House. He said that it is all a matter of time. I got thinking about it being time and I went to the 'It's time for leadership' speech in 1972 by Gough Whitlam. He said in his speech on page 30: We will establish an Aboriginal land fund to purchase or acquire land for significant continuing Aboriginal communities and to appropriate $5 million per year to fund this for the next 10 years. He said that in 1972. How come it has taken until 1995 for this to happen? It has taken 22 years for the government to actually get this up. You have been in power since 1972about 17 years. It is now finally here. You are talking about it being time. Let us not have this talk about a couple of days to debate this issue .. The member for Moreton also talked about cowardice on the part of the Greens and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and how we buckled under the pressure. I refer the House to a speech by the Prime Minister on 28 February this year; He said: The new Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) therefore has a real opportunity here. That is, in the introduction Of this bill. He can demonstrate leadership and a genuine belief in tolerance. He can defy the bigoted and myopic. He can show us that he does have a truly national outlook. He is, he is supporting this biII; yet only a couple of days later on 2 March the Prime Minister said: The empirical test is that we put up the challenge and you buckled. I fail to see how-he put the challenge foror ward two days earlier that we support the bill and then, when we do---he can say we are buckling under pressure. I do riot understand that sort of process that the Labor Party succumbs to because it is just all this myth making.",26
22,Mr COBB,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,Like the allegations on the Packer deal.,26
23,Mr RICHARD EVANS,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"It is a bit like the allegations on the Packer deal. There is no evidence about any deals between Packer and the Leader of the Opposition. They have not put up any evidence but they still talk about it. The honourable member for Moreton also talked about minor changes. Yet one of the major amendments in this particular bill we are talking about is that we are asking for people to have business experience, 'which was not part of the first bill. Is that a minor change? I would not have thought so. Let us not get confused about the myths that the Labor Party talks about in relation to our attitudes. . The member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell), who is also on the committee, spoke about the Leader of the Opposition and attacked his defence of the constitution in 1988, By implication she is saying she would support a treaty. A treaty with its constitutional ramifications is something that, I guess, will be discussed further in the reconciliation process. I do not understand her attitude when it comes to threatening the constitution. The honourable member also talked. about Mark Baker from the Age whom she quoted as being an expert on the coalition. If one ever reads Mark Baker's stories in the Age, I would suggest that he is probably a stooge of the Labor Party because I do not think I have ever read anything complimentary in his stories in relation to the Liberal Party. She also said that it is a sham commitment. Everyone on the other side of the parliament believes that we have a sham commitment here because we are now facilitating an easy passage of this particular· bill, I do not think anyone was expecting it. Therefore, because we are supporting them, it is all a sham. I do not think these myths should continue to be perpetuated by those opposite. The Leader of the Opposition said in his speech on 2 March: The fair-minded amongst those opposite will acknowledge, going back over the years, the contribution of many people on our side of politics to a sensitive understanding of the difficulties by the Aboriginal people. In response to this on the same day, the Prime Minister said: This is true; but those in the coalition who have been virtuous about Aboriginal policy are not on the front bench . . . There has been no virtue on your front bench. Fancy talking about playing politics after your shabby performance. You have done nothing but play politics. It is the Prime Minister who is, in fact, playing politics. The shadow health minister, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), was for some time the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs. I believe he was the first person in this place to raise the issue about HIV-AIDS within the Aboriginal community. No-one on the Labor Party's side had mentioned anything about HIV-AIDS until Dr Wooldridge did. Now he is on the . front bench. There is another trumped-Up charge by the Prime Minister who plays this silly game of politics which I believe the Australian people are getting very sick of. He distorts the truth and perpetuates the myth. All the speakers on the other side so far have blamed the states. They have blamed the states for everything. They do not take any actual responsibility. I am a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs which tabled. a report entitled Justice under scrutiny at the end of last year. This was the report of the inquiry into the implementation by governments of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. It was tabled last year and has yet to be responded to by the government, which is fairly typical in relation to both Aboriginal affairs and the committee structure in this place. In that report we were damning of all governments, state and federal, and their departments. In particular, we criticised tl).e federal government on a number of issues: '.: This blaming the states-who was in power during the 1980s in most of the states? Of course, the Labor Party was. Who was the Aboriginal affairs minister in Western Australia during the 1980s? Of course, Dr Lawrence, now the Minister for Human Services and Health, was also, as Premier of Western faced Australia, responsible for Aboriginal affairs. Yet the squalor, the health and the infant mortality rates continue to rise in Western Australia. She had specific responsibility for those areas but now they are again blaming the states.",27
24,Mr COBB,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,Now she's in charge of our health.,28
25,Mr RICHARD EVANS,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"And now she's in charge of our health, as my colleague said, which is a bit of a worry. This was in the Mainly urban report which was tabled and responded to 12 months later by the federal government. Rhetoric or reality was a report tabled in December 1993, but it is yet to be responded to by this government. Rhetoric or reality is a nice title for an Aboriginal report. There has been a lot of rhetoric from the Labor Party but not much reality. Recently we had all the hand wringing from the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), the Minister for Housing and Development (Mr Howe) and the Minister for Human Services and Health. Minister Tickner said that the health and housing issues were bigger than Mabo and that we should be concentrating on these. He has been the minister for five years but has done nothing. Minister Howe, the minister for housing, said, 'Yes, we need some extra housing; we need more help in the hO\,lsing area.' I refer to the Rhetoric or reality report where it was recommended that the backlog of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander housing needed to be addressed over the next 10 years as a matter of priority. He was told that in 1993, but he has not responded to that. The report on housing for Aborigines said that 60,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people had an immediate housing need-and that was in 1993. Yet in 1995 Minister Howe is saying, 'Yes, we need to respond to this.' Why hasn'the r-sponded to it? Is it rhetoric or reality? OVer 54,000 people live in communities with unsealed or partly sealed roads; over 3,000 people had experienced water restrictions in the previous 12 months, mostly due to infrastructure limitations. The quality of drinking water affecting over 14,000 people in 302 communities of 890 surveyed does not comply with national guidelines. This is from a 1993 report, Rhetoric or reality, to which there has still been no response from the government. All we get from the Labor Party is this consistent rhetoric about how it is doing so ,wonderfully well and how bad we are. We are the sham merchants and they are the experts in this particular field! The facts overcome all that. The facts are pretty damning. For instance, Minister Lawrence said, 'Well, 1 will take the health money off ATSIC, I will bring it back into mainstream, and I will look after the Aboriginal people.' In the Rhetoric or reality report under 'Health services', which again the government has yet to respond to, it says: The misconception of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community organisations being the sole service provider is particularly highlighted in the delivery of health services. There is a strong belief that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander medical services are there to deliver the full range of health services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and also that it is the responsibility of ATSIC to totally fund these organisations. It was said to be a misconception in 1993. Now in 1995 the mil1ister is takingresponsibility. It continues: The poor state of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health is well known. On all indicators the state of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health is considerably worse than that of the wider community. Access to adequate health services is a basic right but one which is denied to many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Evidence was given by ATSIC that 80% of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are reliant on mainstream services. It is the responsibility of Minister Lawrence80 per cent of Aboriginal people already are reliant on them. It contiriues: The Committee heard significant evidence that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people do not receive equitable access or reasonable treatment in most mainstream health services. It can therefore be concluded that this has resulted in many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people not receiving adequate health care. This is from a report in 1993 which is yet to be responded to by the government. The health minister is saying, 'Hang on, I haven't had responsibility, but I will now take it over'. She has always had responsibility.",28
26,Mr COBB,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"And delivered nothing. Mr RICHARDEVAN8-The government has always had responsibility, yet delivered nothing. The report continues: The Committee notes that these organisations originallythat is, the A TSI health centresintended to fill gaps in the health system. have now virtually become the sole source of health care for many communities, because they are culturally appropriate and acceptable to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and take into account the special needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It goes on: Mainstream health· services must become more responsive to the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This need is particularly evident in the public hospital system where examples were cited to the Committee of poor service, culturally inappropriate facilities treatment, and racist behaviour by some hospital personnel. The employment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Liaison staff in some public hospitals has had some impact in reducing these problems but much greater attention issues needs to occur in many of these facilities. The report, Rhetoric or reality, was tabled this place in 1993 and is yet to be responded to by the government. It is a fairly damning report on health issues, yet the minister has not responded to it, although publicly she is saying, 'I'm going to take that $50 million off ATSIC, which provides a culturally appropria ate medical service, and I'm now going to bring it into the mainstream' - and the sibility for health for Aboriginal people has always been in the mainstream. So let us stop these ridiculous myths. A number of departments were asked for submissions but this inquiry did not get one from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Here we have a Prime Minister who is so concerned about Australian people that his department did not put a submission into this particular inquiry. The Office of made. Multicultural Affairs, which is within the Department of the Prime Minister andCabihave net, made a submission but none was received from the rest of the department, indicating lack of commitment to the strategy by the department which is meant to coordinate it. The Office of the Status of Women also indicated no significant commitment to strategy because they did not put in any submissions either. So the myths, really, should stop. What is were required in Aboriginal affairs right now is action. Sure, we might be taking some principled action in Mabo, native title and this land They fund but we really have a crisis with our Aboriginal people. It is not a medical problem out there; it is really a public health problem. When we see magazine covers like this, depicting the Third World squalor in which our fellow Australians are currently living, we really have to look at that and wonder what the hell we are doing in Australia by allowing our fellow Australians to live like this in a country that is so rich and prosperous. So I many ask - my colleagues opposite to stop playing politics with this, to stop perpetuating the and myths, to stop giving false hope to our indigenous people, and to start taking some action because action is what is required. We just cannot keep throwing money at a problem on structural and hoping it goes away. There are significant issues regarding the in land fund and the need for Aboriginal people to have a relationship with the land. I do not think any white person could understand that. We talk about farmers and their relationship with the land. Sure, they might have a certain relationship, but the Aboriginal relationship is spiritual one which goes beyond the tillage of soil. It is a very important issue and we responplay too much politics with it. But there are also the major issues of health and housing with Aboriginal people. We hear a lot of rhetoric imd we have a report called Rhetoric or reality which still has not been responded to by the government. I ask governmtmt members to get their act together and start responding to these reports and taking some action on the recommendations that their fellow colleagues in this place have",28
27,Mr JENKINS,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"I great pleasure in supporting of the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation a (ATSIC Amendment) Bill. I do so recognising that this is a situation on which the Australian community expects action from the Australian parliament. As Professor Bill the Stanner wrote in his 1968 Boyer lecture: Every fence in Australia encloses land that was once the sole or the shared possession of a lar group of Aborigines. For the past 200 years, Australia has had fundamental problem that stems from the dispossession of Australia's indigenous from their land. It also has of coming to grips with the fact that the Aboriginal people have a special relationship with the land. As said earlier in this debate, it is not a simple notion of possession as individual property; its basis is spiritual religious. It has a lot to do with the way Aboriginals organise themselves in a social context and culturally. I think: we can stand here in the knowledge that the bulk of the Australian people accept that we need to address Aboriginals and their relationship to the land, their ability to access to land, and their ability to do they choose to do with that land. In fact, expectation of the Australian community for been resolved. the Australian parliament to be involved in matters to do with Aboriginal affairs is longCourt's standing. If we look at the 1967 referendums to repeal section 127 of the constitution, which had the effect of granting Aboriginals full political rights, in rio federal electorate was the affirmative vote less than 71 per cent. No referendum has had greater support from the Australian people. The Australian people support the efforts of this government address the dispossession of the indigenous people of Australia. There can also be no doubt that, increasingThat ly, Australia has been judged as a international forums on our record of treatment of our indigenous people. In November 1972 the former Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, said in his policy speech: Let us never forget this ... Australia's treatment of her Aboriginal people will be the thing which the rest of the world will judge Australians-not just now, but in the greater perspective of history ... The Aborigines are a responsibility we cannot escape, cannot share, cannot shuffle off; the world will not let us forget that. That is as true now as it was 20 years ago. Following the High Court decision in 1992, the historic Redfern speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) must go down as turning point in the relationship between particuindigenous and non-indigenous Australians. The first stage of the process of responding to a the High Court decision and enacting the sentiment of reconciliation that imbued the people Prime Minister's Redfern speech was the had the problem Native Title Act. I am sure that, for many on this side of the House, being present for the passage of that bill was one of the proudest moments that of land anyone could have had as an Australian or parliamentarian. Historians will look back at that the Native Title Act as one of the greatest achievements of this Labor government, and it should be remembered that the Australian people overwhelmingly supported the passage of that bill. That is why the honeymoon of the former Leader of the Opposition, the honourhave able member for Mayo (Mr Downer), ended what so abruptly-he proposed to open an issue the which the Australian community believed had The next stage of the response to the High decision, and to enact this party's long standing commitment to social justice for jndigenous Australians, was the land fund bill. This bill, as we now know, will pass both houses of-the parliament. But, unfortunately, it will do so under a cloud, that cloud being the threat that a future conservative coalition government, as unlikely a prospect as that is, to will amend it. The effect of those amendments would be to deny indigenous Australians the justice to which they are entitled. is why those amendinentshave been nation in rejected by the government. The land fund that will be established will assist indigenous people 'to obtain land and provide them with social, cultural and economic benefits. In the long term, it will redress the dispossession which those who upon have lost their' connection with' the land Australia and continue to suffer. 'The notion' of a land fund is not new. As has been pointed out by the. Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), when the Whitlam government established a land fund in 1974 it was unanimously passed by this government. As the minister also pointed out,' it was a Liberal a minister, Ian Viner, who established the Aboriginal Development Commission in 1980 to take over the functions of the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission, with the clear objective of acquiring land for the use of Aboriginal people. The attitude of the current opposition is sad because it indicates a degeneration into narrow right wing extremism on this issue. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) seems intent on convincing the electorate that he does not believe in anything but, by his own words, he remains the most conservative leader that the opposition in this country has ever had. There are other aspects of our relations with Aboriginals that are important for us to address. As the Minister .for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has stated in previous debates about land fund bills, at the moment we see a three-stage set: the first stage was the native title legislation; the second stage is this land fund bill; and the third stage is the social justice package .. I wish to raise one problem that is worth exploring in our efforts to achieve proper reconciliation with our indigenous people. Unfortunately it is a theme that, on a whole host of matters in this place, I find myself returning to. I refer to the inadequacies of the constitution. In 1967 a referendum was overwhelmingly passed by the Australian community to repeal section 127 of the constitution. In an article in the Age in May 1992 Ron Castan indicated that there are aspects of concern about out constitution that probably need addressing before we can achieve proper reconciliation. In his article Castan maintained that section 25 of the constitution, if it remains unaltered, is an ugly blot on the constitutional landscape of Australia. Section 25 provides that if a state chooses to make laws excluding Aborigines from voting then they may not vote for· the federal parliament. I am not· suggesting that that provision might be used, or that there isa threatthat it will be used, but while a query such as that hangs over the constitution we cannot expect to propefly reconcile indigenous Australians with non-indigenous Australians. Castan indicates that the constitution does not actually acknowledge the existence of Aboriginal people. As an irony, he goes on to say: It did so before 1967, but only in order to exclude them from participation in the Commonwealth. I do not raise this as an example of the politics of guilt but, when the constitution was being formulated 100 years ago, the constitution reflected a contemporary relationship between non-indigenous Australians and indigenous Australians. We have seen those attitudes change. We have seen that those attitudes have improved. We have seen that those attitudes have progressed. As we go into our second century of federation we need to formally resolve, through constitutional change, these aspects that have been left unattended. Castan concluded his article by saying: But there can be no 'reconciliation' without constitutional recognition in some form, and without the abolition of the relics of racism in our Constitution. I would hope that, if we can get the excitement and the heat of political debate about matters such as the bill before us to dissipate as we move towards the centenary of Federation, as the Australian community and as the international community expect of us, we will be able to redress the problems that exist in our relationship with Aboriginal people as a result of events throughout our history since European occupation. I do not think anybody disagrees that the commentaries on the living conditions and the commentaries on the health of Aboriginal people referred to by both sides of this chamber are something that Australia as a nation which has a concern for human rights throughout the globe should address. on its doorstep. I believe that the passage of this bill is a very positive step in the direction of improving the plight of many of our indigenous people and, therefore, is deserving of the full and unqualified support for future actions by both houses of this parliament.",29
28,Ms WORTH,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"Adelaide) (11.17 a.m.)There are sincere people on both sides of this House who would want to see benefits flow to Aboriginal people and I commend some of the comments made by the previous speaker, the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), on the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill 1994. But will land rights achieve everything? While it goes some of the way, I do not think it will go all the way. It certainly is important, but so is the well-being of the Aboriginal people and true reconciliation. Reconciliation can take place only when Labor stops playing politics. I had the very good experience to be part a delegation to southern Africa following the election in South Africa last year. I struck, particularly in Namibia, by the degree of reconciliation that had taken place there. was told that there were two ingredients essential for such reconciliation-forgiveness and taking the politics out of the situation. One Aboriginal woman recently said to 'Just because I'm black it doesn't mean I have Labor stamped all over me.' I think it unfortunate that so often the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) takes to bullying ways and has suited him to play politics about Aborigimedical nal people, their plight and what many of us would hope would make things better them. I do not think we should be stooping that. Unfortunately, the Minister for Human ministers. Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) seems to have come to this place exhibiting those characteristics as well. When only this week my colleague the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) asked a question about the tion potential threat of HIV-AIDS to the AborigiQuite nal and Islander communities, did she give factual answer? No, she gave a political answer. She said: It may suit the member to concern for Aboriginal health ... I do not know where she has been, beca.use my colleague first raised his concerns in 1987 and Aboriginal health was also the subject of his first speech to the parliament on becoming Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party. This is true to form because in May last year, when I questioned her about funding for Aboriginal health, she said: Once you show a degree of seriousness, then I think you will have a right to ask those sorts questions. I do not expect everyone in this place to know what I am serious about but, equally, care should be taken in making such purely political accusations. Later, one of her colleagues did apologise to me for what she said. In many respects, the Liberal Party has a record that it can be proud of as far as our so is indigenous people and human rights are concerned. As a sideline, in South Africa I was shown the room where two former prime of ministers had an argument and told the story about that. I was also told that on that occawas sion Mr Hawke was drumming up his own business and Malcolm Fraser was drumming I up more aid for Rwanda. There is the odd attempt to change history, as we have found. The former Liberal premier of South Australia, David Tonkin, and his government me, have a proud record when it comes to Aboriginal land rights. Late last year I visited is Bourke to see what was happening there in Aboriginal health and Aboriginal affairs. I it met Yvonne Howarth at the Aboriginal service there and she told me that the only Aboriginal affairs ministers she had seen for in Bourke were Peter Baume and Fred to Chaney. They are both friends of mine and were both Liberal ministers, not Labor I could give more examples, but I repeat: if the government is serious about reconciliation and truly making things better for Aboriginal people it has to drop the politics, pay attento detail and do some long-term planning. recently, in speaking on the health a legislation in this place, I quoted the former health minister, then senator Graham Richardson, when he was discussing Labor's rule show this recent overall. He said: There ought not to be a rule in Australian politics against thinking ahead. We have operated in a fog for a number of years in which that rule has I think been observed, by and large by too many of us. We think three years between elections-we can do something in the first, try and wrap it up in the second, and in the third spend the time talking about what we will do next time. That's a pretty pathetic way to run Government. Recently, I spoke to an Aboriginal woman who, in reference to the Labor government, of said that they cannot just beat their breasts and say they are wonderful for giving Aboriginal people land rights, what about getting our kids off alcohol? She went on to tell me about the national park at Mutawintjee, which is between Broken Hill and Wilcannia. She told me of young boys who love going there in their school holidays. They develop selfesteem, they are taught to show the tourists around, and they say they are not interested in alcohol or cigarettes. It is important that we do not set up the Aboriginal people to fail. I know the state of their health has received some coverage in this place, but it deserves more. On average, Australians of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent live significantly shorter lives than other Australians. While they are alive, their well-being is impaired by illness to a far greater extent. On page 4 of Beyond the Maze, it is stated: The diseases which account for most Aboriginal deaths include: heart disease, diabetes, and stroke, injury and poisoning, and respiratory disease. Death rates from respiratory disease among Aboriginal people are seven to eight times greater than for non-Aboriginal people. A higher rate infection associated with overcrowding and tobacco use contribute to this excess. Aboriginal people also have a much higher death rate from infectious and parasitic diseases, around 12 times the rate for Australia as a whole ... Aborigiare nal mothers are much more likely to die in childbirth than are non-Aboriginal mothers: their excess risk does not appear to have changed over the two decades . . . Firstly, we should ask why; and, secondly, we should ask what can be done to improve the health status of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In looking at those causes, health improves in line with improved living conditions. It is important to raise this at this time because, if we are giving land Aboriginal people-and I am not opposed to doing that-long-term planning and attention to detail are important. Will this land from the very services that are needed? Will I it be away from a water supply? Will it be away from roads? Will it be away from the dirt, facilities that will be necessary to improve their health? Many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, particularly the 50 per cent live rurally and the 22 per cent that live remote communities, do not enjoy the same standard of housing and public infrastructure as other Australians. Housing is often oversocial crowded, badly planned and poorly mainprocess tained. In such an environment, it is difficult to sustain hygienic living practices or to avoid stress and domestic violence. Water supplies for the purposes of drinking, cooking and washing are often inadequate-again making hygienic living practices difficult - and/or contaminated, thus providing a medium for the spread of infection. Sanitation services such as sewerage and garbage disposal are often non-existent or inadequate-again providing mediums for the spread of infection. Transport and communication facilities needed to address health care services are often non-existent or inadequate. Some communities are not even connected to power; hence, no refrigeration. That has implications for the food that they are athypertension tempting to store and their diet. Their health is influenced by the access that an individual has to health services. The most of obvious barriers to accessing health services also is distance, a problem exacerbated by poor roads and lack of transport. Of course, these are problems which are intrinsic to life into 13 small, remote communities-problems which shared by Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians alike. Access to health services last can also be diminished by cultural barriers. Access to local health services may be effectively closed if the service provided is so alien or offensive to Aboriginal people that they choose not to, or are unable to, use that service. The reality of cultural barriers was rematter inforced in my mind during a telephone to conservation I had with Dr Stephen Birrell from the Flinders Medical Centre. I spoke to him when he was a relieving surgeon at the be away Darwin hospital, and he said: am currently sitting in an office on the 8th floor of Darwin Hospital looking out over asphalt and and seeing Aboriginal patients with bandages sitting there simply because they don't like this hospital. This hospital was planned in Canberra by bureaucrats who based it on Woden Valley hospital and yet 65% of the patients here are Aboriginal. that Health is also affected by socio-economic in status. As is the experience of nonAborigines, welfare dependent Aborigines suffer mentally and then physically from their and economic marginalisation. This is deepened when entire communities are marginalised. The Commonwealth has a role in these areas, and some things have occurred to me which would improve the obvious. The Commonwealth has a role in developing incentives for doctors-which I think is under way-to work in rural communities. I wonder whether thought has been given to providing incentives to nurses to work in these same communities. It is essential to be able to communicate well with local people. It is important to involve Aboriginal people themselves. When I was travelling through western New South Wales, I was told at the Walgett hospital how difficult that was to achieve because of the low academic qualifications of the Aboriginal people there. They asked how they could be taught the same courses that the nurses there had been taught. In giving that some considerable thought, it seemed sensible to me that each community should be looked at from its own perspective. The Aboriginal people there could be taught at a level that could certainly give to play in improving the health of the other people in their community. I wanted to develop this theory of mine further. I visited the Key Centre for Women's Health in Melbourne. I found that we are teaching women from Third World countries a level of health care which is culturally appropriate and which can benefit their community. That struck me as a very sensible thing to do for our own Aboriginal people. It should also be considered that Aboriginal people may not wish to be taken out of their own communities. Why can we not send the trainers to them? Very basic literacy skills could be taught. Aborigines could be taught about hygiene, diet and diabetes. Trainers could encourage Aboriginal mothers to bring their children in for immunisation. If we look at each of these areas quite specifically, we should find ways to improve the lot of Aboriginal people without costing a lot of money. Money was set aside in the white paper for training. It has been argued by some that unemployed people are being trained for jobs that do not exist. However, when I visited places like Walgett, Brewarrina, Wilcannia and Bourke, it seemed to me that there were jobs for people in those communities if only these people could have some very basic training. Their esteem would rise and it could give their community some real pride. I am sure we could go on and on talking about what would be good for our fellow indigenous Australians, but I think we must treat the matter seriously. I certainly intend to and, as I said earlier, I think there are people on both sides of this House who would hold that same view. I write regularly for Australian Medicine. I have had an article on indigenous health published, which addresses some of the areas I have covered in my speech today. The subject of whether ATSIC should control the funding for Aboriginal health has been aired. In my trip through western New South Wales, Aboriginal people said to me that, while they wanted some control over their own health services, they felt that ATSIC was removed from their local community and that there was not enough expertise in ATSIC to assist in the health area them a role where it was required. But, as I said earlier, I think that attention to detail, some long-term planning and some goodwill will go a long way in making the lives of Aboriginal Australians better. While land is important to them-land is important to white Australians as well-I do not think it is the sole solution, as I hope I have indicated to the House today. But I guess it is going some way there. We certainly cannot think, 'Well, that's it. It's all over.' We must work together to make things better. We must work for true forgiveness and true reconciliation.",31
29,Mr HOLDING,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"Let me say at the outset in speaking on this important piece of legislation, the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill 1994, that I accept without qualification the genuine commitment of some members of the opposition to the future of Aboriginal people in Australia. But it seems to me that the problem confronting many members of the opposition is in the structure and nature of their party. They cannot seriously make up their minds whether they are part of a federal party, with a federal and national responsibility for the formulation of long-term and sustainable policies in this and other areas, or whether they are simply part of a loose coalition of - t-te parties, subject to the pressures and poltcles of some of their state colleagues. If there is one area where that dichotomy runs through the formulation of a coherent government policy on Aboriginal affairs-it is important that the opposition has one-it is to be seen in this area. I accept the commitment of some members of the opposition, but many of them may not have read the fine detail of their last very comprehensive policy. Buried in that-as was buried in previous federal policy commitments, as the opposition lost election after election-was a commitment to hand back Uluru to the Northern Territory government. What was the reason and motivation for that? Does anybody say it has not been a success? Do any of the overseas tourists or our local tourists who go there say that they are not concerned to understand and comprehend the nature of Aboriginal ownership? They have not sold it to any overseas company. They have not moved it. It is a source of revenue and continuing inspiration for them. Yet at the last federal election every candidate of the coalition was pledged in government to take it away and give it back to the Northern Territory government that never owned it. Mr Truss-That's not right.",34
30,Mr HOLDING,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,It was always Commonwealth property. Why do you not look at your own policy? Mr Truss-It is the management of the park that was being handed back.,35
31,Mr HOLDING,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"I suggest you look at the detail of your policy. What about the management of the park? The Aboriginal people happen to be the managers of the park. They have the majority. What you are still saying is that for all the gabble that you go on with in here, 'We will hand back the administration.' What is wrong with the administration? The fact is that Liberal Party spokespersons in this House are pallid vehicles for some of the lunacy that has operated in state Liberal governments .. The real hope for Aboriginal people, the real step forward.in their achievement of full dignity and status in this community, came not from this parliament, I regret to say, but from the High Court in Mabo. I listened with some interest as the majority of speakers from the opposition lambasted that decision up hill and down dale. When the Premier of Western Australia began his great crusade against Mabo, was there a single member on the front bench of the Liberal Party, was there a single member of the opposition in this House, who would stand up and say, 'I dissociate myself from this lunacy'? The two prominent Western Australians who did that were distinguished former ministers in the Fraser government, Mr Viner and Mr Chaney. In retrospect, when one looks at the attitudes of the then Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, it was to his credit that his government introduced the Aboriginal Land Rights Act, which state Liberal governments have attacked on almost a daily basis. If one goes back tb the history of legislation trying to deal with these issues one finds, for example, that in Victoria the Bolte government gave back Lake Tyers. There were only two reserves, and they were not very large. There was Lake Tyers and Framlingham. When the Cain Labor government tried to emulate the example of the Bolte government and give back Framlingham, which was little better than a decent sized farm, it was voted out by members of the Liberal and National parties in the upper house. We had to put the legisla-ion through this parliament. It was voted against by members of the coalition. Why? Because it was an interference with state rights. The Burke government in Western Australia tried to introduce a state land rights legislation. It passed the assembly but it was voted out in the upper house. I had my own reservations about that legislation because I did not think it went far enough. The then state leaders of the Liberal Party in Western Australia made no apology for their action. It was not a matt.er that they disagreed with the terms of the legislation; it was that they were opposed in principle to any concept of land rights. Whatever you say about the present Premier of Western Australia, at least he is consistent. I get a bit sick of hearing this argument about state rights in the debate in this House. I accept the fact that it is a matter of genuine concern for many members of this parliament, including members of the coalition. When they talk about the lack of sewerage facilities in Aboriginal communities, they are right. They talk about the lack of water, effective housing, lack of educational opportunities and health. I do not disagree with any of those complaints, but the administration of health, the administration of education, the provision of water supplies, questions of housing and sewerage are state responsibilities. There is question about that; that is where the administrative structures are. It is where the infrastructure and the capacity are. One of the things that occurs when there is funding coming from the Commonwealth to deal with Aboriginal education, health or any of these issues is that the states say, 'You have to give us the money so we can do it.' How is it that these great states righters, when they get up to very properly criticise the lack of these facilities-and it varies from state to state-all of a sudden act as if these are Commonwealth responsibilities. It is the federal minister for Aboriginal affairs who they say has to carry the buck. We have only to go into any major community centres in any part of Australia where there is a large indigenous population to. see Aboriginal children who should be at school. What state education administration, with the possible exception of Queensland, has taken seriously the question of Aboriginal education? In Queensland, because Aboriginal communities were put on a reservation and the manager of that reservation had the power almost of life and death over the constituents, under previous governments a standard state school went into those communities, and if the people did not send their kids to school they were in trouble. That produced a tradition within Aboriginal communities that their kids were sent to school. I do nonhink it is an accident that at the University of Townsville there is probably the largest single ber of Aboriginal youths in training. It might be an accident; but that is what happens. In my own state, if there was a fight between two Aboriginal youths in a technical college and two non-Aboriginal children it was the Aboriginal kids who got expelled. There was a recent example of an educational institution that was working for Aboriginal children and other children with serious social disadvantages. The state government not only closed the school but went to court to try to sustain that position. It is no good expressing a concern when there is not a minister for Aboriginal affairs, past or present, who will tell you that he has no not taken up these issues with his state colleagues. We cannot have it both ways. We cannot say under Mabo or when the High Court makes a decision, 'This is an infringement of states rights.' We cannot insist that these things be done through the states and, when there is criticism to be made in all these areas-and they are legitimate areas of criticism-suddenly say that these things are the responsibility of the Commonwealth. That is neither accurate nor fair. There is no minister for Aboriginal affairs or anybody who knows anything about Aboriginal society who will accept the argument about consultation. I do not care who the minister is or was and whether he consults 200 people or 200 communities. Anybody who knows about Aboriginal society could pick another 200 communities and say, 'You didn't consult them.' That is the disparate nature of those communities and the way they are structured. I cannot think of a single issue pertaining to Aboriginal people where any minister could say with confidence that he had consulted all the people it was necessary to consult. I believe there would be unanimity of view on that from anybody who has been a minister and has tried to genuinely consult. Many members of the opposition have pointed out what they regard as inadequate in this legislation. They have attacked the fact that there has been a lack of consultancy-and I have dealt with that. They have also attacked the lawyers and the waste of legal fees of A TSIC or the land councils. What do you num- do if you are a land council and have a decision from a commission that says, 'This land should go to you and a state administration'? There has hardly been a case-I think the attitude seems to be changing now, because we have recently had at least one or two propositions where there has been agreement-where the state has gone off to the High Court. Does the land council say, 'We can't spend any money on that; we won't go'? Millions of dollars have been wasted in challenging decisions that have been upheld time and time again with respect to grants. It is all very well to bleat about the problem of alcoholism in Aboriginal communitiesand it is a problem-but when Aboriginal communities go to the relevant state tribunal and say, 'Please don't build a takeaway in this complex close to our community, it will bring problems of alcoholism,' do they succeed? Overwhelmingly they are ignored, and then we get complaints from state coalition governments saying, 'Isn't it terrible that these people are always victims of alcoholism?' The double standards that exist in the coalition in this debate have to be addressednot merely in the interests of the coalition but in the interests of developing a mature policy, a policy which can be the subject of genuine encounter and discussion in this place. If that occurs there will be more agreement than disagreement. As long as the coalition sees itself as being responsive to the pressures of state conservative administrations, whose records in· these areas are hopeless in many ways, there will never be the maturity of approach that this parliament so desperately needs if it is going to. advance the needs of our Aboriginal and indigenous people.",35
32,Mr KATTER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"In rising to speak in this debate on the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill, I told one of the four ATSIC councils that I represent in this place that I was not in favour of this bill. The person who asked me the question most certainly wanted me to be in favour of this bill. He asked me why I was not in favour of this bill. It always amazes me that I enjoyed as many positive remarks as I did during my term as a state minister. I have often tried to put my finger on the reason why and what differentiated me from so many other people who had had such a rough ride in the ministry. When I was originally appointed, a little unexpectedly, someone shoved a microphone in front of me and asked, 'What qualifies you to be an Aboriginal affairs minister?' It was one of those rare occasions I suppose when I spoke without giving any thought to it at all. The first thought that leapt into my mind when I was asked that question was the answer that I gave. I said that I had played rugby league football and it was pretty hard to feel superior to someone after they had knocked you down and up-ended you nine times in a game. I thought that was my qualification. The next day a bloke of European descent pulled me up in the street in Brisbane and said, 'Mate, that was absolutely beautiful. ' Looking back now over that period as the longest serving Aboriginal affairs minister in Australian history, so the library tells methey don't have a very long life-I think that was a very prescient observation. Every time we come into this place and pass a law which indicates that we have some disadvantaged people out there who need special help, you are giving those people an image of themselves as cripples. I reacted with some considerable anger and never ever backed off-as I didn't the other day at the ATSIC council-from saying, 'No, damn you, why should you get more land than I should get, or any other Australian should get.' In fact, people of Aboriginal descent in the state of Queensland are far and away the most land-rich people on earth. When we went out of government they owned seven million acres of Queensland, divided up amongst about 75,000 people in Queensland of Aboriginal descent. This land, unlike the land they own in the Northern Territory, is very valuable land. Almost all of it is in the above 40-inch rainfall belt. Part of it is some of the best grazing land in Australia. I refer specifically to the areas around Woorabinda. The honourable member at the table representing us in the House, the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), would be well aware of some of the quality of grazing land in that Woorabinda area which is owned by the people of Woorabinda. In addition to the seven million acres that they owned when we lost government in Queensland, I suspect that another million acres has been added, which would bring it to over eight million acres. I know that recently Carlton Hill was bought in the gulf country. At present it is running about 16,000 head of cattle. I assume there is half a million to three-quarters of a million acres involved at Carlton Hill. Most certainly, it is a small proportion of the entire surface area of Queensland, but they have this fantastic land resource. Let me just take one of those areas. Lockhart River enjoys a rainfall of around 70 inches annually. It is a million acres of land and certainly well over a quarter of it would be available to cattle. On that basis, we should be able to run at least a beast to an acre. If we are running, say, 100,000 head there and turning off 20,000 head a year at $500 a head, you have got an income to the Lockhart River community of 400 to 500 people of $10 million a year. If you extrapolate that across the gulf and peninsula where the vast proportion of this land is, I think it is reasonable to say that an income of $40 million or $50 million a year should be able to be generated from cattle production. That should make these people some of the wealthiest people on the planet. As a geographical group, the people of Aboriginal descent living in the gulf and peninsula country of Queensland should be the richest people on earth. There is a hell of a lot of those people. I have been mustering on many occasions with people of Aboriginal descent. They enjoy a reputation for being arguably the best horsemen in the world. They are certainly some of the best cattlemen and stockmen in the world. They are people who know and can handle cattle. Having said all of these things, it would appear from the recent studies-not that I need the studies to tell me this-that we are dealing here with some of the poorest people on earth. From the amount of money that comes out of this parliament and the other parliaments of Australia, each family consisting of a husband, a wife and two kids should be entitled to an income of a little over $50,000 a year. Clearly, these people are not getting anything remotely like $50,000 a year. Not only is the money that has been allocated not getting to them but also we have the problem with this huge land resource which should be yielding tens of millions of dollars a year but is yielding virtually nothing. I venture to submit that, if you took the number of cattle being carried on all of that land some 20 years ago and compared it with the number of cattle on that land today, you would find that the numbers have dropped very significantly. I was speaking to Nelson Gaviner, a very experienced cattleman on Mornington Island, who said, 'I would be very keen for you to get us some cattle. We used to run about 2,000 head here, but now _weare· rurining nothing'. I spoke to Clarence Waldron at very great length the other evening. He has been a long-serving chairman, off and on, at Doomadgee. He said they have virtually no cattle whatsoever at Doomadgee whereas they used to have nearly 3,000 head of cattle there. So what is happening out there? This is a bit ironic, but the other day I rang about the sale of a property which, if it·did not go through, was going to cost us all the training for all our kids of Aboriginal descent in the gulf and peninsula. I pleaded for the purchase of this station which would keep our training project going to train young men of Aboriginal descent as cattlemen in the gulf and peninsula-Jeff Guest's operation. Terry O'Shane of the ATSIC council in Cairns was most reluctant to go along with the purchase. It absolutely amazes me that in this place we keep passing laws that have absolutely nothing to do with the reality that exists out there on the ground. The reality is that every time you buy another station you create another black hole that will cost an absolute fortune to prop up and maintain. Now I represent the outback, the bush murris if you like. I do not represent city people, but the city people quite rightly are whingeing and screaming because all the money is going sideways into purchasing increasingly more land which will cost ever increasing amounts of money to prop up. It seems to be a factor that has escaped the notice of the people in this place that a large proportion, if not the preponderance, of cattle stations in the state of Queensland are not running at a real profit. If an owner operator whose family for many generations, maybe for three generations, has experience in running a commercial business in rural station management cannot make a living out of it, then heaven only knows that people with very little education or very little business ence will find it very difficult to turn a quid out of these operations. More important are the magic words, 'development funds'. William Wentworth, one of the finest and one of the very few really good ministers for Aboriginal affairs, so I think anyway, was the person responsible for setting up the Aboriginal development corporation when money was allocated for economic development. Jackson Shortjoe, who has been chairman on and off for the last 10 years, I suppose, of what is now called Pormpuraaw, at the very first meeting when we decided to go for self-management or local government, if you like, said, 'I don't know whether we can handle it; we haven't had an education' . A lot of people there said, 'We can't handle local government'. But Jackson Shortjoe said, 'I have to say to the meeting that we gotta do it, and the reason we gotta do it is because unless we get our pride back we are finished. Nothing else matters except getting our pride back'. That pride is not going to come back unless these people can stand on their own two feet and tell this parliament to go and jump in the lake. When they can stand on their own two feet they don't need to be in a mendicant relationship with the rest of Australia or, most certainly, with the federal parliament. Let me come back to the central theme my contribution to the parliament of Australia today. With this huge land resource, when we are the most land-rich people on earth with 40-inch rainfall areas and all these things, why are these people today still living in I would describe as relative poverty? Let quote the same Clarence Waldron the other night. We were meant to have a meeting six o'clock but, when Cloncurry meets Dooactually madgee, we are most certainly on island time. We ended up meeting at about 10 0' clock and going through to about two o'clock in the morning. If I can, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will quote Clarence verbatim. He said, 'It's no bloody use to us because we can't get any money, we can't mortgage it, and if you can't get any money to develop it, what the hell use is it to experiyou? You can take it back.' And he said, 'You can't sell it, you can't give it to your kids. We don't own it.' He may have remembered that speech by Norm Johnson, who in Queensland could be described very much as an Aboriginal activist, a person who is very aggressive in his views and very uncompromising. Clarence may have been remembering a speech I heard given by Norm Johnson at Doomadgee when he said, 'We don't own this land. If you can't sell it, you can't mortgage it and you can't bequeath it to your kids. You don't own it.' I heard the last speaker, the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding). Most of what he said was very sensible, but he referred to Uluru. Mr-Norm Johnson-not me-a black person, very much an aggressive activist said, 'Does anyone think for one moment that we own Uluru?' There was a huge roar of laughter from the crowd because nobody there for one moment thought that the black people own Uluru. They have no say in it, they have no involvement with it, they have nothing. Regardless of the tiny bit of money that comes out of it-it might not be; it might be a significant amount of money-in no sense do they own that land. Norm Johnson's speech sticks in my mind. He said, 'If you can't will it to your kids, if you can't mortgage it, if you can't sell it, then of you don't own it.' That week there was a landmark article in the international magazine Time talking about Russia. It said that for the first time in Russian history, a Russian owns his own land. Russia went out of the feudal what system, where the feudal lords owned the me , land, into a communist system where the government owned the land, and for the first at time in all of Russian history a Russian owns his own land because he can sell it, he can mortgage it and he can leave it to his kids. Exactly the same expression was used by Norm Johnson at Doomadgee and the same expression was used by Clarence Waldron. But I could see that clearly when I was Aboriginal affairs minister. We had all of this land but the banks would not give you any money for it unless the government guaranteed it-and I daresay it would be a brave government that would guarantee any lending to any rural occupations at the present moment. If you could not get it from borrowings, you had to get it from government grants. When you had a choice of giving money to the people of Pomparau to buy some cattle or using the money for health and housing, the priority was always given to health and housing. So we keep putting bandaidson the soreswe keep treating the manifestations of the disease without coming to grips with its causes. The cause of the disease is no money for development. Heaven only knows, with the land mass that the people have at the present moment, imagine what would happen if you gave them a bit of money and private ownership incentive to go with it. At the moment, they enjoy a communist mechanism where the government or the council owns the land. The same success story that operates in the land mass in Queensland, unfortunately, operates in the communist states of the world because that is the nature of ownership in all of this land mass. If we switched to a private ownership regime, what could be achieved would be amazing. I quote the classic case, which 60 Minutes did an excellent story on, of Eddie Holroyd at Pormpuraaw. When the Queensland government was running Pormpuraaw, the maximum number of cattle mustered on the station was 360 head. We had some of the best stockmen we could lay our hands on but they had no incentive to go out and get the cattle in. So the maximum amount of money we were able to get out of Pormpuraaw was that from the sale of 360 head. Eddie Holroyd was given a small piece of country of his own up there and the right to put cattle on it. He now has over 2,000 head of cattle on it. That is just one man with his own resources. Because he has private ownership he could borrow a little bit of money, but it was only about $50,000 or $60,000. All that could buy you would be a four-wheel drive vehicle, and that was about all he got with the money he was able to borrow. But he scraped and scratched and got some money for fencing and he now has 2,000 branded head of cattle behind wire on a place that the state government ran for some 30 or 40 years and where the most number of cattle it was able to get in was 360 head. Here is a tremendously successful and outstanding story. You would think that it would create the model for the rest of Australia. It is the one bright shining light of achievement in Aboriginal affairs. I would have thought that we would concentrate on the success story and try to emulate it across the board. But what happened? The incoming ALP government in Queensland reversed the legislation so that local people could not own the land. The legal and beneficial ownership reverted to the Crown. We have gone back to a reserve situation where the state government owns all of the land mass. What were once called reserve areas, and are now called DOGIT areas, are owned by the state government. That theft of seven million acres by the ALP government in 1990 precipitated the worse riot in Queensland's parliamentary history, and quite rightly so. That action in itself was bad enough but taking place here today is yet another towering stupidity like the native title legislation, which delivered to the people no ownership of land. In fact, Queensland dispossessed the bulk of the Aboriginal population. When the original ATSIC legislation came forward, I spoke to Eric Law, who was, I suppose, effectively the head of the Aboriginal affairs department in Queensland. He is a person of Aboriginal decent, a Cherbourg boy, the same as Renouf, the footballer. I asked him, 'What is going on here? This is crazy stuff. Who the hell drew this up?' He replied, 'There were eight people, all of them white as the driven snow. Not one of them have I ever encountered before in all my years in Aboriginal affairs.' Eric Law was head of QATSIC-he was appointed by the Labor government; he was not a National Party person in any way, shape or form-yet he had never met any of these people before. So we have towering ignorance being repeated again here today. The money needs to go to cattle and not land. {Time expired)",37
33,Mr FERGUSON,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"The Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill 1994 stems from the aftermath of the Mabo decision, of which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his Redfern speech in December 1992 commented: By doing away with the bizarre conceit that continent had no owners prior to the settlement of Europeans, Mabo establishes a fundamental truth and lays the basis for justice. In that decision, Justices Deane and Gaudron commented on 'a national legacy of unuttercannot able shame'. They further commented: The nation as a whole must remain diminished unless and until there is an acknowledgment of retreat from past injustices. As we are aware, that decision has led to a government strategy on three fronts: the native title legislation; this bill in relation to a land fund; and the future question of social justice for Aboriginals on a variety of fronts. Many of the opposition speakers during debate have been at pains to stress the very dire situation of Aboriginals in this country, essentially saying that giving them land not solve that. I do not think that most of need to be reminded of that dire situation. is interesting to note in the recently launched Atlas of the Australian People, which makes some very nice comments about every ethnic group that has arrived in this country, construing statistics in such a fashion that the best possible characteristics are derived. But it can say only this of the Aboriginal condition in other 1995: The stark social, demographic and economic contrasts between Australia's Aboriginal and nonAboriginal popUlations reflect the former's marginal and deprived situation. Their very youthful age structure reflects the higher level of fertility and mortality than that recorded by the total population. It is also apparent that the Aboriginal population has a much lower rate of home ownership, lower incomes, greater unemployment, lower participation in high-status occupations, lower qualifications and greater proportions of single-parent families. These indicators reflectthe profound inequalities between Aborigines and the rest of the population. They point to the deprivation which characterises a high proportion of the community and highlight the need for broad, wide ranging programs. It is clearly understood on both sides of this House that the condition of Aborigines in this country is one of extreme hardship. I am surprised at the opposition putting such heavy emphasis on that condition because, fundamentally, that condition derives from a variety of activities by both parties in state governments around this country and, this more particularly, by local government. In New South Wales we see fanciful distinctions made in regard to Aboriginal areas. We are told that they are not covered by local government. We are also told that a shire council put a road into a certain area because there are some technicalities as to ownership. It is a fundamental problem in this country and that these matters have not been tackled at a state or municipal level. Quite a number of opposition members have been more active on this issue and have taken a greater interest in it than I, but it is obvious that they are forced to go along with a policy approved by a majority of their this colleagues. The opposition view is summarised by the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) who spoke of this legislation will being 'flawed'. Mr Fischer said that the us opposition gave an unequivocal commitment It that it would get rid of this legislation. He said that was the only way to fix this piece of bad federal law-making. On 2 March the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) said: . . . Aboriginal affairs has. to be addressed within the concept of a single, undivided nation of which all Australians, whether indigenous Australians or Australians, are treated equally, governed by a common set of laws to which all of us are equally accountable and governed by a number of common values. The reality is that the conditions being suffered by Aboriginals-which have been emphasised by so many members of the opposition-are not solved by treating them similarly to everyone else in this country. We have to consider their distribution throughout the country, the areas they live in and their current situation. Because of this we have to have special measures enacted. I am pleased to support this legislation, particularly in the context of history in New South Wales. In 1983 the then Wran government introduced land legislation. The Minister for Administrative Services e Mr Walker) was one of the architects of that legislation. Mr Katter-That is a great success, isn't it?",41
34,Mr FERGUSON,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"Yes, it is quite a great success and that is why your confreres in New South Wales have not abolished the legislation, despite coming to power with promises to get rid of it. That is the reality. That is probably what will happen to this legislation as well. The Tuckeys, the Katters-those kinds of membersMr Katter-Brewarrina and the surrounding towns are an absolute disgrace.",42
35,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,Mr Hollis)Order! The honourable member for Kennedy was heard in silence. I would ask him to extend the same courtesy to the honourable member for Reid.,42
36,Mr FERGUSON,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"The situation is that the 7.5 per cent land tax that operates in New South Wales, despite the climate during the current recession, has led to a situation where, for instance, at Parramatta-the electorate next to mine-the New South Wales land council has purchased the AMP building for $ I 0 million. The council is receiving $1 million a year in rent. There. are significant indications throughout the state of new industries, particularly in rural areas, commenced from funding under this legislation. We have evidence of long overdue housing being built in fairly remote rural areas. Despite the problems of accounta-ility that have existed in this fund during the early years, it is interesting to note that in his report last the New South Wales Auditor-General said that after several years of heavy l(,)sses, and with the need for further improvement, there had been a very sustained improvement in the accountability of the organisation. We have heard great fanfare in New South Wales. This legislation was the worse thing in the world when the Liberals were in opposition in New South Wales. When they came to power they were going to abolish it. They said it was dreadful. But in 1995, when faced with public reaction to any move to abolish this legislation, when they had the opportunity to speak to the land councils to see what was being done, they found that the changes had been marginal. Those in the opposition have come to recognise-this is one of the problems for the opposition-'-that there is a degree of disunity in their response to this matter. A large number of members over there know that land is fundamental to the Aboriginal community. A large number of opposition members, both here and in the states, understand that Aboriginals have a special relationship with land. What is the logic in saying, as the opposition has proposed in these amendments, if we are giving this land because it was taken off them and because it was seized by us, that each and every Aboriginal around this country can individually go and flog it off? This is an attempt by the Australian people to resolve the aftermath of the occupation, the dispossession, the fact they were kicked off their land, their families broken up and their children taken off them. It is not an attempt to resolve the social problems. The government has said that the third phase in the aftermath of Mabo will be a social justice package. It is interesting to note that there has been a degree of cooperation between the federal government and the state government in New South Wales. A tripartite agreement has been reached between the federal government, the state government and the land councils in New South Wales to do something-with some success-about fresh running water and sealed roads. The member for Oxley e Mr Les Scott) cited statistics about the degree to which, particuyear larly in Queensland, there has been a strong trend away from rural and outback areas to urban and smaller country towns. He noted that in Queensland between 1986 and 1991 there was a 44 per cent increase in the urban population of Aboriginals, a 13 per cent increase in smaller urban areas and only a two per cent increase in rural areas. The reality is that a large number of Aboriginals in this country, the vast majority, will probably not be able to launch a direct personal claim on particular land-that they have got some connection with it, that they have continued to be close to it, that they have actually been there and that their families have been there. They will not have that opportunity under the native title legislation. This legislation is an attempt to give rest of those people some stake in land. have seen, despite the comments of the opposition, a fairly constructive approach the government. The opposition and the Greens in the Senate came up with 65 amendbeen ments, from recollection, of which the govpropose ernment accepted as many as 21. But what the government cannot do is agree to a series amendments that basically constrain, and, in essence, undermine the whole intention of the land fund bill. One of the crucial amendments is the concept that individuals should get ownership. Another one is that the indigenous land councils should sit around having cups of coffee for about six hours every day debating and arguing, and having other people intervening and coming to some conclusion, about which Aboriginals are the most dispossessed in this country. A fundamental difference between the parties is the opposition's view that this money is more appropriately spent in the delivery of education, health, water, et cetera. This is not the intention of the legislation. is very much directed towards building up adequate level of land stock and, by dedicatprovide ing a very significant amount of the funds devoted each year over the next 10 years to non-land sale purposes, building up enough income in the fund so. that it can operate in the way it is meant to be operated. The response from the opposition has been, 'We don't really agree with this legislation. We are concerned about the possibility of a ple. double dissolution. We don't fundamentally associate ourselves with the legislation.' reality is, as we have seen in New South Wales, that as time goes on the parties will not be dictated to by a small rump from the· National Party. The trend, as we have seen New South Wales, is for people to come to accept the dire situation of the Aboriginals in this country. The value of this land fund will lead in the long term to its acceptance by the opposition.",42
37,Mr TICKNER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (12.20 p.m.)-I begin by tabling a supplementary explanatory memorandum in respect of the Land Fund and Indigenous Land the Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill. There We has been a very wide ranging debate on the legislation before the House. It is simply by impossible, in the time. I have available, to respond to each and every matter that has raised in the course of the debate. I to speak on a particular aspect of the legislation, respond to some of the matters of that were raised in the debate and then make limit some concluding remarks. The first issue I would like to raise concerns what I think will be an agreed position of every member of both the House of Representatives and the Senate-that is, the secret and sacred material provisions in the land fund bill. The government has always considered very seriously the protection of sacred or secret material, and it certainly maintained this position when drafting the land fund bill. The land fund bill contains specific provisions for the protection of sacred and secret material, including very stiff penalties of up to 12 months imprisonment for the intentional or reckless disclosure of that information. It Further, an indigenous land corporation an director or staff member is not required to that information in a court of law. Proposed section 1935 of the bill prohibits the disclosure of any information or the production of any document by indigenous land corporation directors or staff that is sacred or otherwise significant to indigenous people, or where disclosure would be inconsistent with the views or sensitivities of indigenous peoThe member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), The who is not in the chamber at the moment, made some scathingly critical comments about me during the debate. She specifically referred to the Hindmarsh Island bridge issue. in At one stage, she accused me of virtually misrepresenting and misleading the parliament. Because it simply was not possible for me to reply at that stage, I intend to do so today. I remind the House of what the senior representatives of the coalition have said in relation to the importance of protecting secret or sacred material. While moving an amendment in the House on 1 September last year, the member for Hindmarsh-at page 913 of lfansard-said: · .. the ILC, in dealing with matters that are sacred or otherwise significant to any particular group of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, must not discuss any material that is sensitive to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Later in her speech-at page 915 of lfansard-she said: We have acknowledged that ... there are sacred matters that should not be disclosed. Senator Ellison, in a debate in another place on 9 November-at page 2785 of lfansardsaid: · .. in no way should sacred matters be revealed. Later that day, he said: · .. we all agree that itmeaning sacred and secret materialshould remain secret. That is at page 2787 of lfansard. The majority report of the Senate Select Committee on the Land Fund Bill recognised the importance of protecting such material. Similar provisions exist in the ATSIC legislation, which has the unanimous support of the parliament, and the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, which was a Fraser government initiative. We are not quite sure where the coalition stands on that issue because its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs policy was completely repealed by the former opposition leader, the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), and because of the failure of the member for Hindmarsh to produce the coalition's new policy by November last year, which she repeatedly promised on the public record to do. Because of that failure, we do not know whether the coalition supports that provision in the Northern Territory land rights act. We do know, however, that it supports a comparable provision in this bill and in the ATSIC legislation. I have respect for the institution of the parliament. Some matters have been raised in the parliament by the member for Hindmarsh in the course of the debate on this bill. I choose the forum of the parliament to respond to those accusations. In the course of yesterday's debate on the censure motion of the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), the parliament heard the rather tawdry details of what will become known as the MCLachlan affair. What I want to raise in this debate is not directed towards the member for Barker but the member for Hindmarsh. I believe that her conduct, role and complicity in the MCLachlan affair means that Mr Ruddock- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the minister is winding up a debate. He said that he was going to take up matters raised in the debate by the shadow minister, but it is quite clear that he is going well beyond those comments in relation to the debate on the land fund bill. He wants to introduce quite separate issues that have been raised at another time and discuss the handling of those issues. I think it is quite inappropriate at this stage, when the debate is winding up, to introduce new material which would only unnecessarily extend the debate and which would be the subject of very severe contest. There are reasons why the minister ought to confine himself at this stage to the matters actually raised in this debate and to not go beyond them.",43
38,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"I have listened to your comments and, as I understand it, it has been a considerably wide ranging debate. Many of the issues that the minister is canvassing have been raised earlier today in relation to this legislation. As it has been such a wide ranging debate, I find that the minister is in order.",44
39,Mr TICKNER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was about to take the opportunity of addressing the point of order, but I will respond by quoting what the member for Hindmarsh said about me in the debate on this bill. She stated: Either hemeaning mehas lied in the posture he has taken on the matter or he is incompetent. In the same debate she went on to stat'e: Either he has misled everybody on this issue or he is incompetent. That is a decision the Prime Minister will have to make on this and other issues. With the greatest resp-ct to the honourable member, I am responding to matters that have been raised in the course of this debate. I want to place on record my very clear view and conclusion that, as a result of the conduct of the member for Hindmarsh, who is the opposition spokesperson on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, she has put herself and the coalition in a totally untenable position. Her complicity in the activities of the member for Barker and her active defence of the conduct of the member for Barker make it impossible for her to ever gain the confidence of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In the unlikely event that the coalition were ever to win government, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people could have no confidence that the member for Hindmarsh would deal properly with them and show proper respect for AbQriginal culture and traditions. It is indisputable that the member for Hindmarsh has actively collaborated with the member for Barker in his baseless attack on me over highly secret and sacred Aboriginal women's information which was improperly opened and copied by his office. The member for Hindmarsh was part of a tactical tag team that directed a series of questions to me in the parliament on this matter on Monday. The member for Hindmarsh collaborated with the member for Barker, despite knowing that he had a copy of the secret and sacred material and that this would cause great grief to Aboriginal people. An Aboriginal woman closely connected with this matter, Doreen Kartinyeri, made this clear this morning when she spoke on AM. Mr MCLachlan- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I do not mind what the minister says about me or the shadow minister if he addresses the matters in the· appropriate part of the debate, but this debate is about the land fund. The minister is deliberately reading from some prepared document to change the thrust of any remarks he is going to make on the land fund to try to deal a blow to the opposition on another subject altogether. Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask that you call the minister to order.",44
40,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"As I said in response to the point of order by the honourable member for Berowra, from what I have heard of the debate today-I have been listening to it, as I knew I was going to come into the chair-it has been very wide ranging. As I understand it, the minister is responding to some of the issues that were brought up during the debate. I find the minister to be in order. Mr MCGauran- Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ",45
41,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"Look, I have ruled on it. Are you going to again say that it is out of order? My ruling would be the same. It has been a wide ranging debate. Mr MCGauran-I want to speak to the point of order. The matters the minister is now canvassing were touched on in passing. This minister has devoted the entire speech to the Hindmarsh bridge, so there is a difference.",45
42,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"I hear what you are saying. As I understand it, the minister is dealing with contributions that have been made during the debate. Whether that has been in passing or there has been a lengthy debate on it, I find that at this time the minister is in order. He is dealing with issues that were brought up during the debate. I find the minister to be in order. I call the minister.",45
43,Mr TICKNER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,The fact is that the member for HindmarshMr MCGauran- Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,45
44,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,There is a ruling in this House about constantly taking points of order. There is a I O-minute rule that we apply every so often. Mr MCGauran-This is only my second point of order.,45
45,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"Yes, but your colleagues have taken a few. Come on, let us hear your point of order. Mr MCGauran-Can we clarify whether the minister is responding to issues raised during the land fund acquisition debate or yesterday's censure motion?",45
46,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,I thought I had already made it clear that the minister was responding to issues brought up during the debate. I do not want to hear any more points of order. I think that I have ruled five times on that point of order. I call the minister.,46
47,Mr TICKNER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"As I was saying before I was interrupted, the member for Hindmarsh was part of a tactical tag team that put a series of questions to me in the parliament on this matter on Monday. The member for Hindmarsh collaborated with the member for Barker, despite knowing that he had a copy of the secret and sacred material and that this wouldMr Reith- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. My point of order is that the minister is not addressing the bill before the House. With great respect to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, whatever matters were raised in the debate are not your immediate concern. Your immediate concern ought to be that the minister responds to the matters raised by the legislation before the House. Hypothetically, if members raised irrelevant matters during the debate, that would give you no basis upon which to justify the minister's discussion of similar irrelevant matters in the winding up.",46
48,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"WellMr Reith-May I complete my point of order? The fact is that the minister is required to address himselfto the legislation before the House. You know, I know and anyone listening would know that the minister is trying to rake over the coals of his censure motion. It is quite clear. If he wants to take up this fight again today, he may do so but he has to follow the proper forms of the House.",46
49,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"You have made your point of order. We are not going to debate the issue- I have ruled on this six times now. I listened to the debate this morning. The issues the minister is going to address are ones raised in the debate. If that person were not in order then, the occupant of the chair should have drawn the speaker's attention to it. He did not. The minister is dealing with issues raised during the debate today, and I find the minister to be in order. Mr Ruddock- Mr Deputy Speaker, I have turned my mind to the issues raised by the shadow minister, Mrs Gallus, starting on page 1609 of Hansard, and this issue was not addressed by her. The minister suggested she raised issues relating to this matter, but clearly when you go through the Hansard you will see that she was discussing the land fund bill and its clauses. He is directing his comments to her, not to issues arising in the debate today.",46
50,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"I have heard your point of order. I would remind honourable members on that side that not two weeks ago the Second Deputy Speaker found a member out of order· because he was taking consistent points of order, and asked that member to remove himself from the chamber",46
51,Mr CADMAN,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,Is that a threat?,46
52,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"I am in the chair. I am really trying to uphold the standing orders of this parliament, and consistent points of order are disorderly. I have ruled on it now eight times.",46
53,Mr TICKNER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"I was in the process of raising the very sensitive comments of Doreen Kartinyeri, speaking on the AM program this morning, when she said: I feel devastated. I feel absolutely wrecked, ruined. I feel thatand she used the wordsIan MCLachlan has betrayed the Aboriginal women. He betrayed me. He stabbed us in the back. Everything that reconciliation stands for he has destroyed. Everybody is in shock. They never dreamt beyond their wildest dreams that something like this would happen. We did not know we had such lies, deceiving politicians. Aboriginal women are crying. I saw them and I hear them on the phone crying",46
54,Mr FILING,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Clearly, that is a very clever device--or not quite so clever device-being used by the minister to impute improper motives or personal reflections on a member. It is grossly disorderly. If he wants to go on with this, I could talk about this theft of $650,000 from the Aboriginal Homes Development Association in Western Australia of which he has done absolutely nothing",46
55,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"Order! There is no point of order. Mr MCLachlan- Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. I understood your ruling before but, whatever it was, the last series of remarks, with the word 'lies' and quotations from the AM program, has strayed from your ruling. I ask you, even without the support of the chiefwhip behind the minister, if you will apply the ruling that you made to a series of points of order that we made. . Mr Reith- Mr Deputy Speaker, and a further point of order.",47
56,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"I have got three points of order, and now it looks like I have four. Let me make this point: I am not going to constantly take points of order. Mr MCLachlan interjecting",47
57,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"The honourable member for Barker has taken a point of order. He should at least give me the courtesy of listening. As I understand it, the minister was making a direct quoteMr MCLachlan-He was. It was nothing to do with the Land Fund Bill.",47
58,Mr FILING,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on a further point of order, in continuance of mine",47
59,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"As I understand it, the minister cannot use unparliamentary language in a quote. So the point made by the member for Barker is valid on that issue. I ask the minister to withdraw.",47
60,Mr TICKNER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, they are not my words",47
61,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"No, but as I ruled you should withdraw.",47
62,Mr TICKNER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"In that case, I withdraw, but I refer people to what was said on AM this morning. I think it is important for the House to understand just how the member for Barker and the member for Hindmarsh work together in their tag team effort in the parliaDodd, P. G. ment involving the revelation from the member for Barker that he was in possession of the secret and sacred women's material. Firstly, the member for Barker asked me whether I had ever. read the secret and sacred material to which I gave a consistent, unequivocal 'no' response. Then the member for Hindmarsh asked me to provide an assurance that there were secure arrangements for ensuring confidentiality of the material. I gave this assurance, being unaware that the office of the member for Barker had improperly opened and copied the secret and sacred material sent by the Australian Government Solicitor to my office but mistakenly misdirected by Parliament House attendants to the office of the member for Barker, through no fault whatsoever of the Australian Government Solicitor or of my office. During the third question, the member for Barker threw down on the table what he said was an envelope containing the secret and sacred material of the Aboriginal women. The member for Hindmarsh then asked me to explain where-(Time expired) Motion (by Mr Leo MCLeay) proposed: That Mr Tickner be granted an extension of time. Mr Reith-Can I speak to that?",47

H. * denotes teller AYES Question so resolved in the affirmative.",47
64,Mr TICKNER,NOES,"I was making some very important remarks in the debate on the land fund bill when I was interrupted by a number of points of order taken by the coalition. I want to make it clear that my remarks are in direct response to matters raised during the debate on this bill by the member for Hindmarsh in which she criticised me and accused me of lying, of being incompetent and misleading. Not only do I have a right to respond to those matters but also, as a minister, I have an obligation to respond to them in the course of the debate. The essential point I was making when I was interrupted is that the position of the member for Hindmarsh as the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs has become absolutely untenable. There is no alternative but for the Leader of the Opposition to sack her from her position. The fact is that the member for Hindmarsh was part of a tactical tag team series of questions to me in the parliament on this matter on Monday. The member for Hindmarsh collaborated with the member for Barker, despite knowing that he had copied the secret and sacred material and that this would cause great grief to Aboriginal women. I have already outlined a number of the series of questions that were raised by this tag team operation of the member for Barker and the member for Hindmarsh. It was during the third question that the member for Barker threw down on the table what he said was the envelope containing the secret and sacred material of the Aboriginal women. Knowing that, the member for Hindmarsh then rose in this place and asked me to explain where, other than my office, the material could have come from and to give an assurance that no non-Aboriginal male had read the material. Mrs Crosio-He knew full well.",48
65,Mr TICKNER,NOES,"Knowing full well, as the member interjects, the history of this matter. PAIRS The member for Hindmarsh clearly knew, in relation to the MCLachlan affair, that the member for Barker's staff had intercepted my mail and copied the secret and sacred material and other material then involved in the Hindmarsh Island court case. I remind the parliament and the people of Australia that the envelope containing the secret and sacred women's information was clearly marked 'Confidential-Appendices 2 and 3, to be read only by women'. Yet the member for Hindmarsh conspired with him in conduct which I believe is a gross violation of the rights of Aboriginal women and has caused great hurt to them, as they have already made clear on the public record. The member for Hindmarsh has not uttered one word of criticism of the member for Barker. In fact, she has actively and publicly defended his actions, including voting with him on the floor of this parliament. By her conduct, the member for Hindmarsh has resorted to the old coalition tactic of attempting to use Aboriginal affairs as a party political football, irrespective of the hurt caused to Aboriginal people. By working hand in glove with the member for Barker, she has irrevocably destroyed any hope of gaining the respect and confidence of Aboriginal people. In the interests of progressing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues in this parliament and in the public, the member for Hindmarsh should immediately be sacked from her front bench position by the Leader of the Opposition. In saying that, I know that I have not only the support of my party but also the support of many fair minded Australians in both the Aboriginal and the non-Aboriginal communities. Continuing the rest of my remarks in relation to the land fund bill, one consistent theme has been raised by the coalition in the course of debate about the land fund bill and that is that, somehow or other, this government is not determined to address a wider agenda of indigenous social justice issues. I want to use my concluding remarks on this bill to highlight the commitment that the government has to address Aboriginal health issues as a very high priority of government. To do that I can do no better than refer to the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he spoke to the Hopevale Aboriginal community at Cape York in Far North Queensland. The Prime Minister spoke with a very clear understanding of the dimensions of that issue. He spoke about the interrelationship between infrastructure issues and the need for water, sewerage and housing in those communities to address the fundamental root causes of poor standards of health. He went on to say, in what I think is an historic contribution to public debate in this country, that the commitment of this government is to progress reconciliation. He made it clear that the government had sought to do that, step by step. He talked about the big picture and about the government's achievements. He said, 'Of course we have done Mabo and the land fund,' and he went on to say, 'And now health, and with that comes environmental issues-housing, sewerage, et cetera.' What we do not have from the coalition, of course, is any policy at all in respect of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. That policy, like all the rest of coalition policy on Aboriginal health, was buried in the sands of the central Australian desert on the occasion of the visit of the former Leader of the Opposition to that country. A promised policy review of the coalition scheduled for release in November is still not here almost six months later. There is literally not one word of coalition policy on health. There will no doubt be continuing debates on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs policy. As I said in the debate on the earlier bill in relation to the land fund, it is not my wish that this area of social policy become the subject of bitter party political point scoring. The events of the last 24 and 48 hours are not of my making. As I made it clear the other day, and I maJee it clear again, if the opposition wishes to launch personal attacks, wishes to use A boriginal affairs as a party political football, then of course the government has to stand and will rise to defend the human rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people against those "",attacks. In finalising my comments on the bill· I want again to put this legislation in context. I do not wish to retrace the long and I think sorry history of the way that the Australian parliament has dealt with this legislation. In every sense of the word history will judge the conduct of parties and of individuals as this legislation is progressed through the House. But the fact is that the end result, because of the switch in policy by the coalition, is that this legislation will pass through this House with the unanimous support of the chamber and then it will proceed to the Senate when I hope it will be given high priority passage by that chamber. As the responsible minister, it is my objective to have the land fund up and running at the first available opportunity. It forms the second stage of the government's response to the historic decision of the High Court in the Mabo case. The first stage was the Native Title Act. I appeal to the coalition to include the Native Title Act in its review of Aboriginal affairs policy and to give its endorsement for the principles contained in that legislation. A former coalition minister,Ian Viner, at a meeting in the Lower Town Hall in the course of public debate on these issues said that this is a matter fundamentally about human rights and not states rights. We know the problem that the coalition has had with this issue. It has always been about questions of states rights. But that shift in coalition policy at this officepoint in time is not likely to happen; the opposition maintains its commitmentto repeal that legislation, and that is deeply regrettable. The bill before the House is the government's second stage response, but I remind the House that it is not the final stage. That will be in the form of a social justice package, and I know that there will be a great deal of public interest in and public discussion and consultation about that social justice package and proposals. It has already been discussed by the reconciliation council and by ATSIC, and reports will be forthcoming in the near future on those subjects. No doubt the opposition will be involved in that debate, I would hope constructively. I conclude by saying that this is the second stage of the government's response. It is something that I on this side of the House have believed in for a long time. Some of us have been working on this proposal for almost a decade. It is a very significant piece of human rights legislation that will profoundly advance the human rights of indigenous people. I commend the legislation to the House in the knowledge that it will pass through this chamber with unanimous support.",48
66,Mr MCLACHLAN,NOES,"Barker) (1.00 p.m.)The previous Deputy Speaker ruled in order some points raised by Minister Tickner in his summing up, after a series of points of order taken by us, so I will comment on some of those, if I may. I simply say that the main thrust of the minister's remarks are that I have offended mightily some Aboriginal people. Really, the truth of the matter is that he is mightily offended and he was mightily offended on Monday when the inefficiency of his processes was exposedMr Tickner-That is not true.",50
67,Mr MCLACHLAN,NOES,"it was exposed to this House. I simply make a couple of remarks in this regard. He has raised some serious allegations, and I understand that some Aboriginal women have been offended by the antics of the last few days. But I make the point that the deliberate efforts of the government to try to confuse the issues between the secret attachments and the general eight kilos of information which his office delivered to my Mr Tickner-That is not true.",50
68,Mr MCLACHLAN,NOES,I will just explain it to you. If you will just sit down for one secondMr Tickner-You are misleading this place again.,50
69,Mr MCLACHLAN,NOES,"I will try to explain it to you. We understand from the Serjeant-atArms, who has explained it to my staffer this morning, that the documents actually went to your office first. Mr Tickner-Aha! Read the tabled letter.",50
70,Mr MCLACHLAN,NOES,"No. I ask you to check on it, because I am just reportingMr Tickner-Read the tabled letter.",50
71,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member for Barker will address his remarks through the chair.,50
72,Mr MCLACHLAN,NOES,"I will, Mr Deputy Speaker. I just make the point through youand I apologise for not doing that beforethat we have been informed this morning that the package went to section 12, and was marked 'Min.' We have now a photocopy of the label-they say it is the label, and they have sent it round to us at our request-that was on the document. Mr Tickner-Are you saying that it went to my office?",50
73,Mr MCLACHLAN,NOES,"it went to your office. Underneath that, it had my name on it. I am just telling you whatMr Tickner-You are misleading us again.",51
74,Mr MCLACHLAN,NOES,"So the minister is saying that the Serjeant-at-Arms is a liar? Is that what he is saying? I suggest that the minister check. It is an interesting set of circumstances. I understand that that package was rejected at some stage or other, maybe then or later, and brought down by an attendant to my office. There was good reason for that because the label had my name on it, and not that of Sean MCLaughlin. It had 'Minister' and 'section 12' at the top; it did not have section 8, which is my area section. So I just make that point that the minister's office, inadvertently if you like, had the document deliveredMrs Crosio--You are not only misleading the House, you are telling a fib.",51
75,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The honourable member for Prospect will restrain herself.,51
76,Mr MCLACHLAN,NOES,"We will check that information to see whether it is true. If in the process of this we have caused any hurt to any Aboriginal women, I am sorry for that; but I have to say that the government has played its part in trying to confuse the secret documents and all of the other eight kilos of documents that were sent around to my office. They are, of course, very sensitive documents for the government, because many of them are documents that were going to and fro around the minister's office and to other places, in the process of formulating whether or not he was going to make a declaration with regard to the Hindmarsh Island bridge. One of those documents was written on 8 July to Miss Lois O'Donoghue of ATSIC and it said, in effect, 'We would like to know whether or not you are prepared to recompense us in the unlikely event that the South Australian government is successfully sued in this matter and we feel obliged to compensate them.' I have to say that I thinkMr Tickner-They have been dealt with by the Federal Court. They have been before the court.",51
77,Mr MCLACHLAN,NOES,"The minister is saying that some of the documents from which I am quoting have been before the Federal Court. That means that they are already in the public domain. Did the minister send all of the required documents to the court? That is the point. We will be looking at those documents very carefully. There is plenty to blame the minister and the government for in this matter. From the latest information we have received, it seems that the minister's office actually had the documents delivered to my office. If the minister wants to check that, that is fine. I will show him the label. We will ask the Serjeant-at-Arms to confirm whether that is the correct label. A number of other matters were raised by the minister, but I will not delay the House by dealing with them now. I simply note that the inefficiency of the minister's office is of paramount concern. If such documents are to be sent around Australia in the future and they are to be secure, then I suggest that the minister tighten up his procedures so he does not have the same trouble in the future.",51
78,Mr RUDDOCK,NOES,"I inform the House that I will have the carriage of the balance of the matter of the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill in the abseflce of the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus). Mrs Crosio--Where is she?",51
79,Mr RUDDOCK,NOES,"The honourable member has leave. She was not able to return at the time at which this matter had been listed for debate and conclusion. In his speech winding up the debate, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) made some very serious allegations in relation to the shadow minister for environment and heritage, the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan). I do not believe those allegations arose from the preceding debate, but that matter has been dealt with by the chair. However, in relation to the minister's request for bipartisanship on important matters which impact upon Aboriginal communities, we offer that cooperation on this side of the House. However, we will not give the government a blank cheque. It is important to understand that. There are matters that are legitimate for debate and for discussion, and some of those matters arose in relation to the bill that we are presently discussing. We have indicated that we will be supporting that legislation. In the context of the debate on that bill, it is certainly appropriate that issues in relation to it ought to be the subject of dialogue and discussion. It is unfortunate that debate on that particular bill has been personalised in the way in which it has been in the debate today. When the courts of this country have made observations about the way in which issues relating to Aboriginal affairs are handled, they are proper matters that ought to be put at issue. When those issues arise, they ought to be debated in good faith, without intruding into every other aspect of Aboriginal affairs. That is what the minister has allowed to happen on this matter. It is an unfortunate development. It is the sort of development-particularly in the way in which the attack today was personalised against the shadow minister-that will jeopardise the reasonable consensus that the minister seeks and which his concluding remarks today invited. I have had to deal with sensitive areas of policy over a period of time. In my experience, if there is an expectation that cooperation will be obtained, then fairness is called for in the way in which these matters are addressed. The way the minister has handled these matters today in the context of the debate has made that task more difficult. That disappoints me. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Consideration in Detail Clauses 1 and 2-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Clause 3.",51
80,Mr TICKNER,NOES,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (1.10 p.m.)-I move: Clause 3, page 4, at the end of proposed section 191D add the following subsection: Searches under Native Title Act ""(4) In performing its land acquisition functions, the Indigenous Land Corporation must search any relevant Registers of the National Native Title Tribunal to ascertain whether any claims have been lodged or accepted or determined in relation to land under consideration for acquisition."". The coalition has agreed with that amendment. I am sure the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) knows that. In view of all the attention that this matter has received over recent weeks, I do not think that I need to take it further.",52
81,Mr RUDDOCK,NOES,"I do not intend to demur in relation to the amendment, save to ask the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) a question in relation to searches under the Native Title Act, which is what we are dealing with. When you look at clause 191D, which deals with the land acquisition functions of the Indigenous Land Corporation, it does raise a number of matters relating to those functions and their terms and conditions, certain guarantees and their terms and conditions, and the performance of functions, which deals with the function of land acquisition. Then we are amending it to make sure that, in the exercise of that function, there will be certain searches undertaken in relation to the Native Title Act, presumably to ensure that there are no other claims that have been lodged, accepted or determined in relation to land under consideration for acquisition. As we are, in a sense, defining by this clause the way in which the acquisition task ought to be undertaken, what does it mean in terms of the other normal searches and inquiries that ought to be made? There is no mention of those. And, if there is no mention of those, are they serious questions that, by oversight, we may be leaving unaddressed? I would not like it to be assumed that we agree to the amendment just because the government seeks it, and we assume the government takes advice on these matters and the reasonableness of it. So I would like to ascertain from the minister whether it does cover these other matters as well.",52
82,Mr TICKNER,NOES,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (1.13 p.m. )-1 should indicate that this matter comes to the parliament with unanimous support and that the shadow minister, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), has communicated in writing to my office on this question. As I recall, this was a matter raised by the coalition in the Senate. It is yet a further demonstration ordinary capacity of Senator Evans to negotiate with the coalition and, despite the great pressures and difficulties the coalit-on has brought about in the debate on this bill, to maintain good humour, good grace and, once again, to try to accept amendments which the government believes do not radically improve the bill but do not do it great harm. That is the nature of the amendment that is before us. I can assure the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) that, because there is no reference to any other searches being undertaken, in no way does this amendment detract from what are obviously the responsibilities of any public authority-::-and, of course, the interests of any private authorithat, ty-to make sure that all the necessary searches relevant to the purchase of land are properly undertaken. That is an accepted function of every government authority. The parliament does not prescribe-I do not think it has ever prescribed-in legislation such matters of obvious responsibility that would be normally carried out in everyday activities. It is simply unnecessary. I hope that that assures the honourable member that the government wants the Indigenous Land Corporation to fulfil the highest standards of accountability and prudence in its dealings. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Remainder of bill-by leave-taken as a whole, and agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Tickner)-by leave-read a third time. Mr Tickner- Mr Deputy Speaker, can I ask whether it is possible for the House to record that the legislation was passed unanimously?",53
83,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"I will permit that course to be followed. Mr Ruddock-It was certainly passed without demur. The procedures, of course, unless somebody actually draws attention to it, do notMr Tickner-I would have thought it was of the extra- in everyone's interest. Mr Ruddock-I think that it is a very pointed observation that the minister wants to make. I do not wish to draw any inference one way or the other in relation to the matter, save to say that itjs an unusual comment to make in relation to a matter that goes without demur.",53
84,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Can I ask the member for Berowra: are you formally objecting to the minister's request, or were you commenting on it? Mr Ruddock-Has the minister sought leave?",53
85,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"The reality is while the minister certainly wanted to make that comment, there is no provision within the standing orders for that to be so done. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.4) 1995 Consideration resumed from 7 March. Second Reading",53
86,Mrs CROSIO,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (1.17 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is substantially the same as the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1995, which was introduced into the other place on 31 January 1995. That bill was considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which reported to the Senate on 1 March 1995. A majority of the committee recommended that the bill be adopted but a number of the opposition senators who sat on the committee dissented and called for a delay in the passage of the bill and for non-specified amendments to it. This dissenting report of Senators Ellison, O'Chee and Abetz is based upon an inaccuensure rate interpretation of the bill's provisions relating to the scope of the refugee convention ground of particular social group. The coalimember tion senators remarked that the bill 'seeks disqualify those who have a well-founded of persecution just because they are the unfortunate victims of China's policy'. This has never been the intention nor the effect of the bill. As was made clear the second reading speech and explanatory memorandum to the No. 3 bill, the bill not deny access to our protection to a person who seeks it as a member of a pre-existing social group, or on any of the other convena tion grounds, who has a well-founded fear of persecution because of fertility control poliopinion cies. During the. Senate committee's deliberations some submissions raised doubt about the operation of proposed sections 36(3) and 36(4). Amongst these submissions were those of the President of the Human Rights and particular Equal Opportunity Commission, Sir Ronald Wilson. The Acting Solicitor-General's advice was obtained by the government. Following consideration of this advice and the totality the evidence received by the committee, the government has drafted amendments which incorporate the above mentioned statements from the second reading speech and the who explanatory memorandum in the text of the bill. These amendments will clarify the operation of the bill. Whilst many of the criticisms the bill have been based on a misundertion standing of its purpose and effect, the governjudgment ment acknowledges the depth of concern held by many people on the sensitive issue fertility control policies. However, the bill not about the merits or otherwise of such policies. It is about the need to ,protect the integrity and effectiveness of Australia's refugee determination system, whilst at all times vigilantly observing our obligations under the Refugees Convention to provide protection to genuine refugees. The bill has two purposes, both of which relate to the need to protect the integrity and effectiveness of Australia's refugee determination system. The bill's first purpose is to that the fertility control policies of the government of a foreign country are disregarded in determining if a non-citizen is a of a particular social group within to the meaning of the Refugees Convention, as fear amended by the Refugees Protocol, for the purposes of considering an application for a fertility control protection visa. Australia was among the first to sign the in Refugees Convention, and the Migration Act and our refugee determination system reflect will the seriousness with which we take our obligations under the convention. The convention states that a refugee is a person who has well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political or membership of a particular social group. Useful though the ground of particular social group undoubtedly is, it is also the most difficult to define in practice. Assessa ment of whether a claimant is member of a social group is usually left to those who administer and review our refugee determination system. However, the implication of the recent Federal Court judgment that of a person may be recognised as a member of a particular social group simply because he or she is a person to whom the fertility control policies of a foreign government apply, or objects to such policies, has such potentially serious consequences that the government has decided to introduce the current bill. The government considers that the recent of judgment dilutes the meaning of the convenground of particular social group. The has considerably expanded those who need to be considered by the refugee of determination system. Many of the people is who would now have to be considered as a result of the judgment are not normally regarded as refugees by other countries. Consequently, the integrity and effectiveness of Australia's refugee determination system is being threatened, which will in turn undermine public support for the discharge of Australia's international obligations. To regard a large proportion of the population of China, or any country, as a social group and therefore as potential refugees simply on the basis of their government's fertility control policies is inconsistent with the intention of the convention to provide protection to refugees with a well-founded fear of persecution. One consequence of the inclusive nature of the Federal Court's decision is likely to be that those refugees who historically have been regarded as in genuine need of protection by Australia,· and whose status should be determined quickly, will be disadvantaged as the system will have to deal with an increased number of applicants to whom the convention was not intended to apply. In introducing this legislation I emphasise that the government is not questioning that the convention ground of particular social group is a useful and necessary concept. Indeed, the government is seeking to bring the application of this concept into line with our international obligations following the recent Federal Court decision. As I stated earlier, this bill will not deny access to our protection to a person who seeks it as a member of a particular pre-existing social group, or on any of the other convention grounds, who has a well-founded fear of persecution because of fertility control policies. What this means is that a person from a partieular social group, such as a village or workplace, who is subjected to the rogue application of a fertility control policy in a manner which amounts to persecution could still have a claim accepted under the legislation introduced today. Nor will a person who is a member of a particular religious, political or racial group subject to the persecutory application of fertility control policies be denied consideration of his or her claims under this legislation. The government is concerned to address issues which might arise from gender based persecution, and has be-n working actively in this area for some time. For instance, our humanitarian program contains a specific women at risk component, which targets resettlement assistance to refugee women in particularly vulnerable situations. However, the government is concerned to ensure that the convention is interpreted correctly. This will ensure the retention of a public commitment to our refugee determination system, and the integrity and effectiveness of that system. Incorrectly diluting the meaning of 'particular social group' under the convention has the potential to undermine that public confidence and the ability of our determinations system to do the job it was set out to do: to afford protection to genuine refugees. The legislation introduced today will help to provide a common sense approach to the definition of a 'particular social group' under the convention, by precluding the possibility of very large numbers of people, with nothing in. common but that they may be affected in some way by the fertility control policies of their government, being caught within the definition of a social group under the convention. The second purpose of this bill is to prevent a non-citizen from making further applications for a protection visa when he or she has already made an application, whether or not the prior application has been finally determined. Australia operates one of the most thorough, efficient and equitable refugee determination systems in the world. A person's claim is assessed against the convention definition of a refugee and, if it is not accepted at the primary stage, the person may appeal to the independent Refugee Review Tribunal, which may reverse the primary decision. If a person's claim is still not accepted at the Refugee Review Tribunal stage, it is open to that person to seek review on administrative law grounds from the Federal Court. Under current legislation, when a person has exhausted this process, it is not difficult for that person to lodge another application for a protection visa and start the whole process again. The fact that repeat applications serve to delay the removal from Australia of the applicant has led to their increased use. The processing of these repeat applications-which, like the initial application, are free of charge to the applicant-is both expensive and time consuming. When the system is fair and open and contains the right to appeal the primary decision, claimants will generally have no need to repeat the whole process to get a fair hearing. That fair hearing is amply provided by the system as it exists already. This bill, therefore, will have the effect of barring repeat applications in the majority of cases. Its intention in doing so is to protect the integrity of, and support for, Australia's refugee determination system, and to ensure that available resources are expended on claims for protection which have not yet been exhaustively assessed. In introducing this bar on repeat applications, the government is aware that there will remain circumstances in which particular repeat applications may merit consideration. These cases are likely to include repeat applications which contain information which was not available to the claimant during the first application, and which is of a nature is likely to have a real bearing on the assessment of the need for protection. Events in the country of origin of the claimant that have occurred since the first claim may also mean that a second consideration is warranted. The government has, therefore, decided that the minister will retain a discretion to allow particular repeat applications to be assessed the full refugee determination process. Although the minister's non-compellable discretion may only be exercised by the minister personally, measures will be taken to ensure that all cases in which the minister might wish to exercise his or het discretion are identified and brought to the minister's attention. In such cases the minister will present to parliament the reasons for the exercise of his or her discretion. Both aspects of the bill introduced today demonstrate the government's resolve to maintain a refugee determination system that is targeted towards those with a claim to Australia's protection under our Refugees Convention obligations. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has estimated that there are some 20 million refugees in the world today. Australia has an obligation to help these people through the most effective means at our disposal. We meet this obligation through our overseas aid program, our assistance to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, our significant contribution to UN peacekeeping initiatives, our humanitarian program, which this year will bring 13,000 people in need of resettlement to Australia to begin a new life, and through our onshore refugee determination system. When the need arises to defend these efforts and to maintain their credibility, public support and effectiveness, as in the present case, the government will do so. I commend this bill to the House.",53
87,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Berowra) (1.32 p.m.)The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) is a bill which would normally be introduced in the Senate. Today we have the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio), in her usual competent way, introducing a speech that has been written for her. It is a speech which puts that the government's view as to why this bill should be supported. But I do wish to ask this very simple question: why was the bill introduced in this House when the minister who is responsible sits in another place? It is normally the case that migration bills are introduced into the other chamber and, if they are carried there, they proceed here for our concurrence. by Why is it any different on this occasion? Mrs Crosio-What about the last one?",56
88,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Why was it any different on the last occasion? These are bills that the government hopes it may be able to put to a base political purpose rather than a legitimate purpose in protecting the efficacy of our immigration program. If the government's only purpose was to maintain the efficacy of our migration program and the refugee determination process, this bill would have been introduced in the Senate, particularly as we had indicated that we were going to cooperate in its passage. But the government is thrashing around to find a bill that it might be able, because of some concerns that we have in relation to it, to use as a double dissolution bill. Of course, you cannot use it as a double dissolution bill if it does not go from the House of Representatives to the Senate. That is the reason. It is a base political purpose. The government here again, in an area which it says is beyond politics, is wanting to play politics. It ought to be understood that that is the situation. Secondly, why are we dealing with this matter again? We are dealing with this matter largely because this government has proved that it is incapable of effectively administering the law in relation to migration entry and refugee determination. I have some familiarity with this matter because I was previously shadow minister for immigration. It is a fact that the government was warned, when it went down the route of introducing into our framework of law the international covenants for determining who is or who is not a refugee, that there was the potential for those who are interested in the concept of administrative law and the courts in particular to be able to intrude and offer their judgments instead of the judgment of the government of the day being enhanced. We are dealing here with a situation in which a judge, in turning his mind to particular provisions of the international covenant, has come up with a view that the government finds does not meet its objectives; so it then has to try to alter the natural meaning of the words that have been imputed into the interpretation of the international covenant dealing with refugees and its protocols. The fact is that we are the first country, as I understand it, that is legislating to codify and clarify international covenant. This is very significant. But the reason we are dealing with this matter at this time is that the government did not accept the advice that I previously offered. Mrs Crosio---Oh, come on!",56
89,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"The parliamentary secretary did not take much interest in those debates at that time, but the fact is that I counselled the government time and time again that there were two ways in which to deal with the determination process in relation to refugee status. The first was to deal with them administratively and the second was to follow the alternative course of the judicial route. I made it very clear that, if we were going to go down the route of having both administrative determination and judicial decision making, it was a disastrous route. It has led to interminable delays. It has put at risk the way in which Australia deals with this process of refugee determination. I think it has put at risk our reputation internationally. It has certainly had a very significant impact in Australia. And it is a situation of the government's own making. When it had the opportunity to amend the Migration Act and to take out of that act the capacity for judges, under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, to get involved in reconsidering these matters after they have been through the independent administrative review process that was put in place, an administrative decision making process involving an independent merits review body, the Refugee Tribunal, it failed to measure up in relation to that matter; it walked away from it. So we are dealing with this matter now, where we are trying to further codify the process by which refugee decisions are determined, because the government failed to take these matters effectively out of the hands of the courts when it had the opportunity. The government has made it clear that it is seeking in this legislation-it comes through in the second reading speech-to substitute its own view on what constitutes a social group for determining the application of one ground, one element, of the decisions that need to be that made in determining whether a person is or is not a refugee. The international covenant makes it clear that there are two essential elements that have to be satisfied. The covenant reads as follows: Owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted, for reasons of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion, such a person is outside the county of his nationality and is unable or owing to such fear unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country. So you first of all establish that you have a well-founded fear of being persecuted. The second element is for reasons of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group. And so it is· in relation to this question of whether or not a person is a member of a particular social group, and the meaning of those words, that the parliament is now legislating. We want to make it clear that the coalition supports the principle that the government now seeks to enshrine,namely, that China's one child policy should not of itself be a ground for the granting of refugee status in Australia on the basis of being a member of a social group. However, we have a number of concerns about the bill as it is drafted. Strong and legitimate concerns were voiced by many witnesses at the recent inquiry into the Migration Amendment Bill (No.3) 1995, the predecessor of a bill introduced properly into the Senate and considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. A number of my colleagues on that committee presented a dissenting report, which shared many of the concerns expressed by witnesses. I note that the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine also presented dissenting reports, which also relied on many of the views expressed by those witnessesThe government has attempted to meet some of those concerns. The parliamentary secretary makes clear on the first page of her speech, so ably read, that during the Senate committee's deliberation some submissions raised doubts about the operation of proposed sections 36(3) and 36(4). Among those submissions was that of the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Sir Ronald Wilson. The Acting Solicitor-General's advice was obtained by the government and, because essentially the Acting Solicitor-General agreed that the government's bill was not likely to achieve objective, the government has come to the view that it should draft further amendments, which are included in this bill today. We are not sure whether all of those concerns have been met. Obviously the government has tried to meet some of them. We will allow the bill to proceed through its normal process in this place-in other words, we will not be opposing it-but my colleague Senator Short in the other place will seek to negotiate amendments to address the legitimate concerns that have been. raised. In particular, we believe tha- the government must ensure that persons whose fear of forced abortion or sterilisation is well founded are not automatically precluded from being able to make an application. The bill is not clear on this point, and we think that that needs to be made clear. We are confident that the government will share the concern and that basic human rights considerations would not allow Australia to force a pregnant woman, for example, to return to her country of origin if it were known that on return she would face aforced abortion. We therefore believe it will· be possible to negotiate acceptable amendments to the biil, and it is on this basis that we will support its passage through this chamber. The government's handling of the matter, as I have said, leaves a great deal to be desired. The parliamentary secretary is wantingto assert that the government's bill does achieve that objective. We need to be satisfied that that is the case. We are not in any way trying to demur from the general principle of the government that all women of childbearing age who have one child in China ought to be able to access Australia if they are able to establish a. well-founded fear of persecution. To do so would have a very significant influence on our capacity to help those who satisfy the general intention of the refugee convention. It is our view that the legislation ought to narrow the meaning that was put on the words regarding what constitutes a social class by Justice Sackville, but we want to be satisfied that those concerns are met while ensuring that, first, the passage of this bill does not in any way imply acceptance of China's human its rights or population control policies and, secondly, it is understood that we will continue our· strong support for a significant refugee and humanitarian program, upholding the refugee convention-an approach that was taken by us in government and one that has been consistently put by us on refugee issues in opposition. We also make it clear that we think the bill as amended does take account· of the main human rights concerns that have been expressed, but we have these remaining questions in our mind that we want to address, and it is particularly important that the Senate have the opportunity to turn its mind to these matters. I hope the government, as we press the matter in the Senate, will take a reasonable approach to these issues. There are other matters that I want to raise. I was interested that in a lot of the discussion and in the parliamentary secretary's second reading speech there have been introduced words that do not appear in the international covenant dealing withreftlgees. In paragraph 6 of her second reading speech, the parliamentary secretary said: As was made clear in the second reading speech and explanatory memorandum to the No.3 bill, the bill will not deny access to our protection to a person who seeks it as a member of a pre-existing social group, or on any of the other. convention groundsI do not know what is meant by the term 'pre-existing social group'. It is interesting that, in the paper prepared by the parliamentary library, the writer obviously had a similar concern. I do not know whether we are intended to be able to quote these matters, but they are intended to offer advice to us that we might entertain in addressing a bill. A reference was made to a second reading speech to a bill previously involving Senator Ray, and it said in relation to this matter: It will not deny accessto our protection to a person who seeks it as a member of a pre-existing social group or any of the other convention groundsthe same words as we are using herewho has a well-founded fear of persecution because of fertility control policies. What this means is that a person of a particular village or workplace who is subjected to a rogue application of fertility in a manner which amounts to persecution could still have a claim accepted under legislationintroduced today. The writer says, 'It is uncertain how a preexisting group should be defined.' I would like the parliamentary secretary to simply define that for us. She uses the words in the second reading speech, and the term has been used before. What does she mean by 'a member of a pre-existing group'? I think that is particularly important. I wantto also ask, in relation to this matter, whether the government will also ensure that all of the advice that has been available to it in considering these matters will be available to the parliament. I notice that, in the dissenting report and the very useful end notes that Senator Harradine produced, he did raise a number of questions-including, I might say, the pre-existing social group question. On page 12 of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report, in end note 23, 'there were some references to some of the opinions that have been offered. The government members were relatively happy with some of the opinions that were forthcoming . but, in that end note, Senator Harradine refers to Mr Mowbray from the Attorney-General's department, whom he quotes as saying: In the Sackville decision, his finding on the particular social group was: parents with one child wishing to have another child, who are subjected to official incentives or sanctions designed to discourage them from acting upon their wishes. Thatwas one formulation. Senator Harradine goes on to say: The suggestion by some that the effect of· the Sackville judgment is that ""China's one-child policy established refugee status for any fertile Chinese female who managed to land in Australia"" has been formally repudiated by the Acting Registrar of the Federal Court. He goes on to say: The Department was asked to provide the Committee with its legal advice on the effect of the Sackville judgment. The only such legal advice was of five sentences in a half page memorandum from Mr Henry Burmester, Principal International Law Counsel, Attorney-General's Department ... The question needs to be asked as to whether that is the only opinion and, if there are other policy opinions, whether the parliament will be given the benefit of those to enhance its consideration of this matter. That is an important point. There are some very genuine concerns about the Chinese policies, if you read a good deal of the evidence that was made available in the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee report, particularly in the dissenting report under note 28 where 'witness B', as I understand it, a gynaecologist who had . experience in China, raised some very alarming concerns about near-term pregnancies being aborted, a practice I believe to be very close to infanticide. Such matters would be of concern to us all. As has been made very clear in a lot of the material I have read in terms of what constitutes persecution, China's birth policies, without amending what constitutes a social class, would constitute persecution per se. Very clearly, what happens in China is, by any understanding of the term, persecution. In conclusion, I indicate that we will not be demurring in relation to the second element of this legislation to ensure that people cannot continue to bring endless refugee applications. Repeat applications, which serve only to delay removal from Australia of an applicant, are something that cannot be entertained. The misuse of a very important process and one which is time consuming and very expensive is something that cannot be sustained. It is surprising, in view of the evidence that has come to light, that this matter has not been previously dealt with. I welcome the assurance of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) that, with regard to the minister's non-compellable discretion, which may be exercised only by the minister personally, measures will be taken to ensure that all cases on which the minister might wish to exercise his discretion are identified and brought to the minister's. attention. A very interesting statement was made in the second reading speech, because I would like to know what the criteria might be for determining which matters would be brought to the minister's attention-in other words, how somebody might enter into the minister's mind to establish what is relevant to when he would want to exercise his discretion. It would be very interesting to see how relevant criteria are developed for that purpose. I would certainly like to hear the parliamentary secretary explain that because it is clear that there is a concern about that discretion. It is meant to be the remedy of last resort, and we would certainly want a clear statement-from the parliamentary secretary if it is possible this stage, and certainly from the minister if the parliamentary secretary is not in a position to do it-that the minister will exercise his non-compellable discretion under the Migration Act with respect to persons who may not fall within the refugee convention definition of refugee, because of the social class amendment which we are pressing, but who are nevertheless clearly at genuine risk of persecution through forced abortion or sterilisation. That is an assurance that we would want to have from the parliamentary secretary. I am sure that this is a matter that the parliamentary secretary, given her own background and experience, would be very concerned to have addressed. Those who gave evidence before the Senate committee would also certainly want to have that clarification. In conclusion, the opposition is Very concerned about the ad hoc administration of immigration policy. Amendments are constantly being made .. This is amendment bill No.4 for this year. Litigation is constantly occurring, and frequently the department is unsuccessful. That reflects upon the nature of the advice that the government is getting. It reflects upon the legislative drafting skills in this area. It certainly indicates a significant degree of incompetence. My colleague Senator Short has made it very clear that, because of the shortcomings that have been emerging, an investigation is needed into the· way in which the department is administered. When in government, the opposition will undertake a thorough review, through an independent inquiry, of the operation of the Migration Act. Since this massive codification has occurred, the implications have been significant. The codification,the commitment of the government to administrative review in all circumstances and its unwillingness to amend the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act have led to this situation. It is a very real concern which the government must address.",57
90,Mr FERGUSON,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"A great sense of deja vu exists in this debate on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4). A few scattered guns, a few rogue senators in the opposition, have decided to at attempt to take over the opposition's policy on migration. As people would recall, this is not the first time that has happened. Recently, the opposition backed down when it was forced to repudiate the same line of argument from those senators. Fundamentally, a few people with a studied disinterest in the threat to this country's migration policies stroll around the place finding legalisms and arguments as to why the government's policy should not be supported. The spokesman opposite, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), made some very. valid points with regard to the question of access to administrative law and the judiciary. Many members on this side of the House have some sympathy with those points. However, we have no sympathy with the interference with and the harassment of this legislation by those senators. The opposition is saying that it will now pass this legislation. Admittedly, an important amendment has been made to make it clear that, in the case of those people who are members of a very defined group, China's fertility policies will be a consideration in refugee assessment. The government has stated that it will take on board the instances supplied by the opposition spokesman with regard to pregnant Chinese women and the threat to them individually. A sense of realism is prevailing in this House today in regard to opposition policy, which is certainly not the case in the Senate. A coalition exists in the Senate of legally minded senators who have a fundamental preoccupation with their opposition to Australia's foreign aid program, opposition to doing anything about world population growth. As people would be aware, essentially, this legislation is about the decision by Justice Sackville and its impact on the 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees, where it speaks of a refugee as a person who, owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group-the one that is most at issue here-or political opinion is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country. We have witnessed a major widening by Justice Sackville of the meaning of 'social group'. Unfortunately, he is saying-unfortunately a few Liberal Party and National Party senators agree with him-that if you are under 55 and you are a family member of a couple in China then you should be given access to Australia's refugee system, that that is a defined social group. Obviously, anyone with common sense knows that that was not the intention of those that sought to give protection to people around the world in the late 1940s and early 1950s. What will members of the opposition say next? Will they agree with the spurious claims that we are already seeing coming through our system from every second woman from Tonga who lands in Australia that she comes from a male dominated society and, therefore, should be accorded refugee status? Or will one of these judges define the next social group as women from some of the more remote sections of Lebanon and in cultures where there are still arranged marriages? The next thing that will happen, if opposition senators have their way, will be the claim that all of these groups should be given refugee status in Australia. Which other groups will fall under this definition? Will such groups include areas of discrimination overseas where such discrimination would be regarded, even in this fairly liberal country, as trifling? Would such a group find that it is redefined as a social group? The impact of this case-unreported case No. 327 of 1994-has been an extremely serious attack upon the legitimacy of the refugee policy of this country. Justice Sackville commented about a 'non-consensual procedure which altered a person's reproductive capacity as an act of persecution'. On page 8, he spoke of a social group including 'those who, having only one child, do not accept the limitations placed on them, or who are coerced or forced into being sterilised'. My knowledge of the case is that the two individuals concerned did not come with a clear case that they had personally been subjected to certain practices, that they had been picked upon and that they came from a region where it was, specifically, even a rogue application of policy. Essentially, they were two Chinese people who said, 'We don't like China's one child policy.' Justice Sackville said, 'You're part of a social group' and implied that so were hundreds of millions of others. This legislation is an attempt to get back to the intentions of the original refugee provisions to ensure that we are talking about people who are part of a defined, obvious, patently existing social group. There has been a variety of cases about this matter. One that goes to part of the reality is Sanchez v. Escobar, decision No. 85-7609. It relates to the situation in EI Salvador. In that case the protocols were going towards a similar pattern with far more relevance but, despite the greater strength of that case, they were rejected as well. Because of the nature of the civil war and the repressive paramilitary practices in EI Salvador there was a threat to young urban males. . That case goes to the question of what a social group is. The judge stated that the definition 'is a flexible one which extends broadly to encompass many groups who do not otherwise fall within the other categories of race, nationality, religion or political opinion'. He said, however, 'the scope of the term cannot be without some limit' and that it was not meant to cover 'a plethora of different lifestyles, varying interests, diverse cultures, and contrary political leanings'. In other words, young urban males in EI Salvador was too broad a group to be intentionally covered by the 1951 refugee protocols. Finally, the following statement was made: Of central concern is the existence of a voluntary associational relationship ... which imparts some common characteristic that is fundamental to identity as a member of that discrete social group. That case certainly goes to the need to have a group that we can all understand and appreciate. What Sackville has don-and what a lot of Liberal senators seem to think is a good idea-is throw open the doors to an avalanche of claims by people who do not like the policy. On the basis of Sackville, they do not even have to instance any kind of localised or personal harassment. Essentially, all they have to say is, 'This ,policy is very nasty. We would like to have a second child.' That is enough. That is the basis on which the government moves. I think we have to bring into this debate the whole question of what China is trying to do and what it means to the world. It is an issue we should not run away from. I do not for a moment act as an apologist for that regime. That has to be stressed; otherwise people will come back and say, 'The reason he supports this legislation is that he thinks they are doing a great job in China.' Whether it be China's suppression of Tibetan culture, its attacks on Muslims in its north-west, its attempts to suppress the Mongol culture or its religious oppression, obviously, there is a great degree of concern about the way the Chinese political system persecutes minorities. But from my point of view at least, rather than the rest of the world decrying the government for the application of its birth policy, we should say that it is doing a good job.. On the figures that have been tossed around the place-China's population of 1.5 billion is increasing by 63,000 people per day, or 14 million to 16 million people a year-the normal person in the street would say, 'Perhaps the Chinese government should think about doing something about that.' Clearly, that is what it has been attempting to do. Putting that on a world scale, it is worth noting comments in the lJnited Nations Review of May-June 1994, which states: As countries pass through different stages of the transition from high to 'low levels' of fertility and mortality, their experience varies. Most countries are converging to low population growth, but at speeds that are increasingly different. One fifth of the world population is in countries where the demographic transition has not yet begun or is only just beginning; in these countries action is needed to accelerate the transition . .. Due to high fertility levels, many developing countries have a large proportion of children and young people in their populations, posing a major challenge in terms' ofhea1th, education and employment. The ICPD '94 will reaffirm the goals and objectives of the 1990 World Summit for Children, and recommend greater investment in children and youth, including education on population ... We are not for a moment saying that the alleged and, in some cases, proven localised extreme use of these policies is to be tolerated or encouraged. We are not for a moment saying that if there is evidence that in a particular province in China officials at a provincial or local level are· engaging in forced abortions or sterilisations that does not come within the province of our legislation. Of course it does. While it happens in some regions, quite clearly, even the most hardline person with concerns about China's policy will not come here today and say that it is pushed at a national level and implemented with national directives. Obviously, even the strongest critics have stated that it tends to be a local- says: isedMr Filing interjecting",60
91,Mr FERGUSON,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"As I said,· even our most extreme critics here would not go down that road. As most people supporting this legislation would understand-obviously, they are open to suggestion and debate on this matter-the policy is most often aCcomplished by taxation on people's earnings and a denial of access to health and education. They are the main measures by which China attempts to get some control over its population growth. What country in the world-for example, Australia, the United Kingdom or Germanyin does not attempt to engineer some sorts social policies through its taxation system? The taxation system is often used to accomquoted plish what the country needs even in relation to environmental or transport matters. We do not want to see people forced into these extreme situations by the Chinese government or the local authorities. On this side of the House we do not believe that not China has a total, national, organised policy to start forcing all people to have abortions to be sterilised. There should be some recogpolicy nition of the very real contribution that China has made to the world population. Considersupported ing the world picture, we are talking about 5.7 billion people in 1994. In the 1990s have an expectation of an additional 93 million people every year. The honourable member for Berowra referred to the Bills Digest. In a decade in state and federal politics I have always had great respect for the contributions by the parliamentary staff and by research units. However, the last two productions from the service in relation to the policy area would be among the most partisan documents I have seen. It is a matter of concern. I would not necessarily agree with the minister on the recent BIR conference. We have wide ranging debates and all points of view should be represented. That is the policy position from which I come. The last two editions of the Bills Digest do cause concern. One of the throwaway lines appears on page 1 where it It has also been suggestedby whom, I wonderthatA ustralia' sintemationalreputation, particularly our reputation in the Asia-Pacific, will be damaged by our panicked response to the arrival of 'a few hundred would be refugees from China'. Let us be honest about this. The biggest problem that Australia has with its credibility in this region is that it is too lenient; it is too inclined to support civil liberties; it is too lenient to intervene in civil rights in the region. The author of this document",63
92,Mr FILING,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Except in East Timor.,63
93,Mr FERGUSON,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"In a relative sense, even in East Timor, compared with other countries the region. It is a throwaway line. Who are of these people who are concerned with our policies? In a recent debate in this House I from the Asian Business Journal where it was considered that we were going too far the other way. The author of the Bills Digest also notes that it has been argued that the legislation' confuses rather than clarifies' . This is typical of the entire production. I do mind if attacks are made on the legislation or if aspects of it are put under the light, but or I would like to see a bit more balance in this area in productions from that unit. The other measure in this legislationstrongly by the opposition-is the question of repeat application.s by people we within ()ur refugee system. This is a grave worry. The. opposition and the government agree that our system gives people a very fair go in launching and fighting through their applications. If people cannot succeed at the Refugee Review Tribunal they can go to the Federal Court. There is no cost to the applicant in many parts of this system. Under this current bogus section, people can claim to have new material and thus launch another application, essentially with minimal changes in their stories. Sometimes there is a total revision of the story to make it more palatable. In some cases piddling, minor, or obscure details have allowed the judiciary to justify repeat applications. If we look at boat arrivals, for instance, we see a very high percentage, 34 per cent, have decided they did not get a fair go the first time and they might like to stay here a few years extra while they go through the processes again. It is worth noting that this system is deplored and attacked by solicitors associated with these interest groups. It is worth noting that 14 per cent of the claimants in 1993-94 were found to be refugees by the department. That figure, for all of the critics around the place, is fairly strong compared with other countries. Whilst 79 per cent of the people who eventually get refugee status in this country do sue through the administrative provisions of the department, we still have an endless stream of people who feel, as I said earlier, that they might be able to get a bit longer in the country, might be able to find other grounds for staying here, and who have become so acclimatised to Australia, so involved in our country, that they have supposedly strong grounds for not being deported. The government is legislating the right of the minister to have some discretion to look at cases where there is clearly a public interest need to give applicants a second go and to try to minimise the way in which people are manipulating the system at the moment. I strongly endorse this legislation. We understand some of the amendments that the member for Berowra and the shadow minister have brought to the debate, but at the same time there must be a fundamental rejection of the views of those senators who, as in other previous legislation in this policy area, have tied the hands of the opposition and basically created an image that they support an open door in this country-no restrictions, a freefor-all, essentially millions of people having the right tomorrow morning to launch claims. I am glad to hear from the member for Berowra that this legislation will be allowed through the House. (Time expired)",63
94,Mr FILING,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"In my contribution to this debate on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) 1995 I would like to make a couple of observations. First of all, I share the concern of the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) over the method in which this bill and the previous bill have been introduced in order to be used as a potential trigger for a double dissolution. That to me is a quite cynical attempt to use the refugee issue as a political football. There is a very clear public concern over the government's refugee program-a program that is in absolute chaos and a program that quite clearly needs thoroughly reforming. In my own electorate, one of my constituents, Margo Clayton of Duncraig, has organised a petition of some 10,000 people who have voiced their concerns about the illegal immigrants or entrants to Australia, specifically boat people. The petition expresses the sentiment: Illegal immigrants, specifically boat people, should not be given temporary or permanent residence in this country but should be returned immediately to their place of origin. No compensation to be payable to those who have been held in detention centres. The interesting thing about that particular sentiment, which is a widely held view in my home state of Western Australia, is that it has arisen as a result of a number of facets of the government's policy. I might also add that I held a seminar on immigration and refugee matters in my electorate. A large number of people attended and voiced their concern over what they see as the absolute chaos and unfairness of the program. There are a number of reasons why this community sentiment has been raised. The first reason for concern, especially in my electorate where we have a high percentage of people who have come from overseas to live in Australia and who probably have relatives or friends or other family members who are in the process of applying for immigration, is that at the same time as this particular problem is surfacing in the community there has been a very stringent tightening of entry requirements for migration applicants. Of course, that has meant that in some instances people have been disappointed in the result of the applications of their own relatives to migrate to Australia. They were very heartily upset by the almost unilateral corruption of the refugee program by Prime Minister Hawke following the Tiananmen Square ma.ssacre and by the consequent visa grants to students from the People's Republic of China. At the moment they constitute a group of about 24,000 people in Australia. I notice that the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) is here. His electorate would probably have one of the largest coastlines of any electorate in the world. Mrs Crosio-Just get onto the bill.",64
95,Mr FILING,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I also note the parliamentary secretary is intervening again. I do not know how many thousands of kilometres of the coastline of Western Australia are in the member opposite's electorate, but it certainly has a large coastline. One of the other major factors that have given rise to this community concern is the poor surveillance of Australia's northern coastline. That has become quite clear during the term of the present government. The other concern is the inordinate delays in the seemingly ad hoc changes to procedures relating to illegal entrants into Australia. It is another matter that sends out some very confusing and unfortunate signals to the rest of the world. I share entirely the views expressed by the member for Berowra about the earlier advice, which is the same advice as the previous minister for immigration, Mr Hand, gave during a debate at which I was present and contributed to, which is that there ought to be a more administrative procedure in relation to the treatment of illegal entrants and a very substantial reduction in the opportunity to resort to the courts. Resorting to the courts is clearly seen by many in the community as being unhelpful and does not contribute to our healthy and rational debate. In many instances, it also means that people suspect there is an opportunity to prolong one's stay in Australia by using the courts over and over again. The community expects the following from the refugee program in Australia: a humane but swift assessment of the potential refugee status of those who are applying; in particular, the speedy return of those who fail that assessment. It is self-evident that the community accepts that, by necessity, Australia is participating in the refugee program. However, it expects that participation to include the speedy return of those who fail the assessment of refugee status and, as I said earlier, a much swifter assessment of those who are applying. The use of a swifter and fair but firm assessment of refugee claimants sends some important signals to the rest of the world, in particular to many in our region. The first is that some integrity has been restored to the refugee program, and the second is that those who are waiting in the queue for assessment elsewhere within the region-such as in camps in South-East Asia-are not being jumped over by people who can make it to Australia by sea. In dealing with this issue-and, in the first instance, I am tackling the whole question of the refugee policy-it is very important that these clear and distinct signals are sent to the areas where we can see a potential source of illegal entrants. It should be made clear that, when those who undertake what is in some instances a quite perilous journey to get here, they will be treated in a humane but swift and firm way in relation to their credentials for acceptance as refugees but, if they fail that assessment, they will be sent back to their source country as soon as possible. Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, you and I in a previous time. I think in 199O---debated from different sides of the chamber the question of population control measures. We have differences of opinion on population control. I think the federal government is entirely hypocritical on this bill. In the past it has actively supported, in a material way, coercive population measures within the People's Republic of China. As you and I both know, there was a contribution by Australia towards the provision of ultrasound equipment which was alleged to have been used in the detection of illegal pregnancies. The cynical attempt of this bill to manipulate legitimate community concerns, as I have indicated in the case of my constituent's petition, is thoroughly shameful. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) referred to senators who participated in the inquiry of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. The question which still has not been answered is why the minister did not await a full bench hearing in the Sackville decision of the Federal Court. Why the seeming hurry to ram this legislation through the parliament? The member for Berowra has stated the coalition's position on this matter. The coalition will allow the bill to proceed according to normal due process but will negotiate amendments which go as far as possible towards addressing the legitimate concerns that have been raised, while recognising that not all of those concerns are likely to be fully satisfied. Assuming that we can negotiate some reasonable amendments in the Senate, there is some confidence that the bill will be allowed to be passed. But, in doing so, there are a number of things that we must make absolutely clear. First of all, the allowance the passage of the bill does not in my way imply acceptance of China's human rights or population control policies. The honourable member for Reid quoted from the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on the migration legislation amendment bill. He made the observation that, in some way, some of the coercive population control measures are not official policy and are in fact rogue applications of these measures in specific areas. The interesting submission was No. 8 from Steven Mosher, an expert witness, who stated that directives of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party did represent government policy and de facto law and did embrace forced abortion or sterilisation as a matter of course. As mentioned by the member for Berowra, the testimony of witness B, the person who had been a gynaecologist working within that program, is quite distressing. I imagine that it would be particularly distressing for feminists because of the program's quite clear coercion or intimidation of the female section of the population. It is interesting to note that one of the most staunch critics of the Chinese policy is Dr Lynette Dumble, who as many would know is a prominent feminist health expert or commentator. Her view, which has been well expounded in recent times, is that if the programs undertaken within China were to be repeated even in a mild way in this country we would have streets filled with people marching in protest. The difficulty in a sense is that acceptance of a particular policy in relation to one set of people implies a certain inverted racism in that somehow the rights of the women in China who were forced to undertake compulsory sterilisation or abortion measures are in some way inferior. That is not to say necessarily that that should be an automatic reason for those particular people to be considered as refugees for entry into Australia. However, as I mentioned earlier, it is important that in allowing the passage of this of bill we make it absolutely clear that we oppose and abhor the use of coercive sterilisation or birth control measures within the People's Republic of China. The work undertaken and the observations made on this matter by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee-particularly those senators who signed minority reports--<io not deserve condemnation. In fact, they deserve the praise and thanks of all concerned. After all, if we criticise fiercely some of the policies undertaken in the 1930s in Nazi Germany on eugenics-as we have done in this parliament time and again-we ought to be consistent. We ought to make it absolutely clear that we abhor the equally inhumane policies, whether they are applied in a roguish manner-as has been alleged--or are part of a centrally driven policy program of the Chinese Communist Party. If in any way the Chinese authorities. responsible for this take comfort from the passing of this legislation, this parliament should make it absolutely clear that they ought not to. We ought to make it absolutely clear that we thoroughly condemn those practices and would work towards making sure they end. The honourable member for Reid mentioned, for instance, taxation and other population measures. I do not think anybody on this side of the chamber would object to the use of financial incentives to try to achieve a rational population policy within the People's Republic of China.",65
96,Mr CAMPBELL,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Kids for the rich you are advocating.,67
97,Mr FILING,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"No, not at all.",67
98,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Mr Hollis)We will not have a debate across the chamber. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie will have an opportunity to make a contribution.,67
99,Mr FILING,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I am sure he will. It will be interesting to hear some of the views of the member for Kalgoorlie, particularly after some of his more recent forays into by-election campaigns on behalf of some groups who, I think, the vast majority would find totally offensive. I think the honourable member for Reid is still a. very prominent member of Friends of East Timor, which is a group that tries to work towards improving human rights for the citizens of East Timor. If we are going to have any position on human rights, we ought to be consistent and work towards a better standard of human rights for those unfortunate enough to be the subjects of coercive population control measures within the People's Republic of China. In a conversation I had yesterday on this matter, I pointed out that, if this had been undertaken under Pinochet's Chilean regime, there would be people marching in the streets already. It is strange that, in some instances, some prominent human rights activists have been strangely mute on this point. I know there is a very strong Tibet friendship group within this parliament led, I think, by Senator Loosley from the Labor Party. There have been similar types of population control measures used within Tibet and they are also deserving of the thorough condemnation of members and senators. It is quite clear-l think the member for Kalgoorlie will probably agree with me-that there has to be a tightening up of our immigration policy and our refugee program. In particular, there needs to be a thorough review of the Migration Act, particularly since the massive codification of immigration policy in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In particular, we must see a movement away from the ad hoc knee-jerk responses in relation to particular situations as they arise. The member for Berowra has been consistent rightthroughout his pa:rliamentary career on this matter. If honourable members were to look through the parliamentary records, they will see that some people have not been consistent. Importantly, during his tenure as a shadow minister for immigration and again today, the member for Berowra made it absolutely clear-I recall thQse debates because they were at a time when there was a blazing row between the then chairman of the caucus committee and the minister-that it is really time this process is administered with as little opportunity for intervention in the courts as possible. I think that is quite consistent with the desires and the wishes of the majority of Australians. Australians are by nature a humane and rational society. They are, and have been for a long time, willing participants in the refugee program. They have strong humanitarian instincts. Australians, by virtue of our fair and open society, view some of the things that I have been talking about in a distressed way. At the same time, there has to be a rational, fair and firm system in the refugee programnot an ad hoc, knee-jerk mixture of applications of policy. This government deserves some condemnation for the way in which the bill has been going backwards and forwards. I note that there are still some very serious concerns with the class of applicants or refugee status applicants who have stimulated this legislative measure. There is still some doubt as to whether this automatically precludes those who come from areas where there are coercive population control measures. The inclusion of that ticular group of people is likely to become source of comfort for those who believe that the coercive population control measures have some merit. I, for one, do not. I believe that, in the end when people come to look at this stage of our refugee program, the government will be seen for what it is. It is cynically using this issue to help it to take cheap support from what is, in many instances, legitimate community concern about adhockery of our refugee program. At the same time, it is being thoroughly hypocritical on human rights abuses which affect a large number of people, particularly women, within the People's Republic of China.",67
100,Mrs EASSON,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I am very glad to speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) today. This is a matter that goes to the heart of what this parliament, on both sides, is trying to do.in our country in the 1990s. Both Labor and the coalition are made up of decent and considerate men and wom-n, anxious to do the best possible for Australia in all fields. To do this matter effectively, we must always act in a manner consistent with our declared principles, and we must enshrhie these principles. Let us put this bill into perspective. We called upon to deal with people fleeing from brutal and vicious policies enforced by brutal, communist dictatorship. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, we· seem to think that communism has disappeared. It has Asia. In the 1950s and 1960s, Australia was happy to take in tens of thousands of refugees fleeing communism. Indeed, the mere act of fleeing a communist tyranny made a person a refugee. What has changed? Only the race of those fleeing. The opposition owes the nation an explanmeadows, ation as to why it no longer welcomes people fleeing communism. Surely it caruiot be due to the colour of those fleeing. The Liberal Party in government abolished the White Australia policy and this is to its everlasting credit, and should be a proud boast for it. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has had his problems in this field and he can use this debate to help clarify this matter. A parnon-racial approach is now the law of the a land in Australia in these matters. This includes immigration. Unfortunately, the relentless flow of amendment bills from the immigration department over the last 18 months shows a department under siege. The impression in the wider community is of a group of people out of their depth and unable to adjust psychologically to the vast, unstoppable a changes that are occurring in Asia, eastern the Europe, the Caucasus and elsewhere. Australia is not another planet. The serious problems on planet Earth are also Australia's serious problems. Many people in Australia are very disturbed at a piece of legislation which has been characterised as unbased of any value system-human rights or legal principles. Rather, the legislation proceeds by constructing a pseudo problem to fit a bureaucratically desired solution: that is, the unsubstantiated fears of vast numbers of Chinese fleeing the one child policy seeking refuge in Australia. The history of migration shows that, no what happens, the overwhelming majority of people everywhere never contemplate leaving their place of birth. It is a peculiar arrogance of a certain type of Australian to delude himself or herself that, given are the opportunity, the whole world would come to Australia. Did this happen when Australia a provided the £ 10 fares for people from the British Isles to come to Australia? How many came-JO million or 20 million? The people not in numbered in the thousands. The truth is that migration is a very traumatic decision and only a small number of people can ever muster the psychological strength to break from their homeland of centuries past. Let us not exaggerate the joys of living in Macquarie Fields or Broadlooking different and not speaking the local language. I have had private correspondence with the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) on this matter and I deem it so important that I have decided to read the minister's reply to me into the Hansard and for the public record. The letter is dated 21 February and states: Dear Ms Easson Thank you for your letter received on 1 February 1994 in which you expressed your concerns in relation to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1995. The Bill implements initiatives I announced on December 1994 to enhance the integrity and effectiveness of the refugee determination system. This is necessary because of a decision by the Federal Court which expanded the meaning of the refugee law term ""particular social group"" to an extent as to deprive the Convention of meaningconfirmed ful application. The bill merely confines the scope of our refugee laws to that which was envisaged at the time Australia ratified of the 1951 United Nations Convention and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, specifically in respect of Convention ground of particular social group. the Government's view that this interpretation accords with the intentions of the drafting conferto ences on the Convention and the Protocol, of which Australia played an important part. Australia's refugee policy has been developed to put into practice our obligations as a signatory the Convention and Protocol. Under the Convention a person is a refugee if they have a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion and are outside their country of nationality. The Federal Court judgment found may be recognised as a member of a particular social group simply because he or she is a person to whom the fertility control policy of a foreign government applies, or who objects to such a policy. The Government considers that the judginvolving ment dilutes the meaning of the Convention ground of a particular social group to such a degree that the integrity and effectiveness of Australia's refugee determination system would be threatened if it were allowed to stand. To regard a large proportion of the population China, or any country, as a particular social group and therefore as potential refugees simply on the basis of their government's fertility control policy is inconsistentwith the intention of the Convention to provide protection to persons with a well foundin ed fear of persecution for one of the Convention grounds. The Bill will not deny access to our protection a person who seeks it as a member of a pre-existing particular social group, or on any of the other Convention grounds, who has a well founded fear of persecution because of fertility control policies. What this means is that a person from a particular village or workplace who because of membership of a pre-existing particular social group or one of the other Convention grounds is subjected to the application of a fertility control policy in a manner which amounts to persecution could still have a claim accepted under Australian law. The legislation was developed in close consultation 30 with the Attorney General's Department. I can assure you that the measures in it are consistent with our international obligations particularly; those under the refugee convention. The Acting Solicitor General has since, in response to comments by the such Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, this. In addition the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was consulted both in Australia and at their Geneva headquarters regarding the Bill. The Government has acted to ensure that an inappropriate interpretation of part of the Conventhe tion by the courts is corrected. By diluting the It is meaning of particular social group under the Convention the Court's decision has the potential undermine public confidence and the ability of our determination system to do the job it was set up to do--to afford protection to genuine refugees. It is noteworthy that it is the view of the UNHCR of that the People's Republic of China's (PRC) family planning policy of one child per Chinese national family is an attempt to control the burgeoning population pressures facing the PRC. The position of that Office is that the law embodying this practice is of general application and does not target any particular groups and as such is not that a person inherently persecutive. The Chinese authorities have stated that the one child policy is non-coercive and that it is enforced by means of financial sanctions, education and propaganda. If, however, particular cases emerge the use of coercive measures such as forced abortions or sterilisations, the Australian Government, in line with the view of the UNHCR, would regard these measures as serious violations of human rights capable of amounting to persecution for the purposes of the Convention. of You also ask the hypothetical and improbable question of what the Government's response would be if a country, on a family planning basis, ruled that its citizens were not to have any children, and then presumably one of its citizens sought asylum Australia. Our response would be based on our protection obligations under the Refugee Convention and other Human Rights Conventions. Each to case would be considered against the criteria of whatever Convention such a case might invoke. Let me also make it clear that the legislation does not prevent anyone from applying for refugee status. Indeed, if, after full consideration by my Department and the independent Refugee Review Tribunal, a claimant is found not to be a refugee according to the Convention but the claimant's particular circumstances are such that they have strong humanitarian or human rights reasons for not wanting to return to their country of origin, I have a non-compellable power to substitute a more favourable decision where it is in the public interest to do so. (Section 417 of the Act). I hope this letter has reassured you in respect issues you raised in your letter. Yours sincerely NA I raise four points on this matter. The 195 I United Nations convention was made in the light of the catastrophe of World War II. A 'particular social group' is not a fixed and permanent designation like race or religion. As time passes and tyrannies arise, the wickedness of some people is such that they can devise actions and policies that bring into existence a particular social group. It would have been better if the convention had mentioned the Nazi eugenics program. This interference with human reproduction is the parent of the Chinese one child policy. Because of this weakness in the convention there is no need for us to take advantage simply because the victims are Asians. Secondly, the letter says that the government has acted to ensure that an inappropriate interpretation of part of the convention by the courts is corrected. Excuse me, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I thought that we were governed by laws, not by men. Since when do courts have to give governments what they want? Are we in this House now going to start on a process of correcting the courts week by week? Can the minister point to a constitutional basis for such a process? A third point in the letter informs us that the UNHCR is of the view that, because the one child policy is of general application, it is therefore not inherently persecutive. Obviously one needs to be an international bureaucrat to utter this kind of twaddle. Are we to believe that if you hit 100 per cent of people that is okay, but if you hit only 10 per cent you are brutal and persecutive. China is a tyranny. The Communist Party is brutally tyrannising the whole country in a wide variety of ways. It has been doing this since 1949 and it shows no sign of stopping. The fourth point is extremely important The minister says that the legislation does not prevent anyone from applying for refugee status-full stop; no ifs or buts. Indeed, the minister goes further and mentions his powers under section 417 of the act. I would ask the minister to clarify this by stating' whether an of the applicant who applied to the minister under section 417 and was refused such an application can proceed to the Federal Court for a determination. I am anxious, not so much for the sophistication and benevolence of the minister-I know him; he isa good and decent person, doing a difficult job-but that the department's front line people behave in a manner consistent with Australian values as understood by this parliamentl.:, '!' We are a liberal democracy. We are not east Germany in the South Seas. The general tendency in Australia is increasingly. to say yes unless the case for no is really very strong. This yes-saying attitude fits in with our desire for freedom and inclusiveness. Australians are increasingly tolerant and, indeed, appreciative of difference. The department should be, more and more; ·moving in the direction of giving the applicant the benefit of the doubt. Finely balanced arguments should always tip in favour of the applicant. This suggestion is consistent with an inclusive and tolerant approach. These ate established Australian values. I am not advocating anything radical. Indeed, the 'guard at the Brandenburg Gate' approach of the department is not consistent with Australian values in regard to the refugees that I have met in my electorate of Lowe. It is becoming increasingly clear that our immigration policies are starting to creak under the featherweight strain so far put on them. This is not good enough. I have been to Hong Kong on many occasions and things look fine. Experts and officials have told me that the arrival of the communist authorities in July 1997 will still mean business as usual. I believe this to be the case; I certainly hope it is. But what happens if I am wrong? What if 10 per cent of Hong Kong flees-that is, 600,000 people? . What happens if half of them come south, to Australia? The Philippines and Indonesia will certainly give them every assistance to get here. I do not believe that this will happen governments are paid to prepare for the worse. What happens if my optimistic view is wrong? What is our policy? It is 50 years since the immigration department was founded and in those 50 years Australia has successfully absorbed over five million people. Central to that absorption has been the excellent and often brilliant work not only of the department but also of ministers, both Labor and Liberal. Not one group has failed to thrive. Not one decision to broaden our approach, to promote inclusion and tolerance, has backfired. We are the most successful multicultural nation in the world. Why? Because. we . have actively promoted inclusion, tolerance and appreciation, and suppressed hatred and viciousness masquerading as free speech. We have opened our society and economy to all newcomers and we have reaped the benefits. We need to continue these active and excellent policies. Any group which lands on this shore can contribute to our good fortune and our welfare. Through ABC television we are advertising our social excellence into Asia. We must expect that a certain number will believe our expensive and extensive propaganda, especially as it is true and demonstrably so. To satisfy both houses of the parliament, the minister will have to ensure that his department works well in relation to any applicant who is subjected to the barbarous one child policy. I have been personally assured by the minister that couples from a particular area where the one child policy is enforced:-for example, forced abortion, forced sterilisation and infanticide---<:an form a particular social group. As a supporter of the department and its good work, I would think that it is in the department's interest to produce and publish guidelines to this effect. The way to avoid any catastrophe over this issue is to stick closely to our shared Australian views and to see to it that the front-line bureaucrats in the department also operate within the framework of our shared Australian values. Mr Speaker, with misgivings and some considerable worry, I cautiously commend the bill to the House.",68
101,Mr ALDRED,NICK BOLKUS,"I but agree with the spirit of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) in that it attempts to place the government's migration policy--or, more accurately, the government's illegal immigration crisis-in a more orderly legal framework. In particular, the cost of repeat applications for refugee status, which clauses 48A and 48B of this bill cover, is becoming a drain on the Commonwealth. The government correctly seeks to redress the financial costs involved. However, I wish to point out to the House that it symbolises the government's failure to construct an integrated national policy and the government's crisis driven response to the illegal entry problem. The government's failure to devise a national and coherent policy concerning the boat people and illegal entrants is a disgrace. It undercuts the government's much vaunted nationalism, as it is clear that Australia is increasingly seen by at least some of our neighbours as a soft target for waves of refugees and illegal entrants. Additionally, the continued illegal entry into Australian fishing waters by Indonesian fishing vessels is a scandal to the many Australians who are attempting to gain a living in that industry. I am intrigued at the Labor government's failure to advise the Indonesian government of its obligations to respect our coastline and our coastal waters, particularly the Australian fishing zone, the AFZ. On two previous occasions, in 1992, I detailed how two young Australians, the Gillespie children, were kidnapped' from still Australia with the connivance of the Indonesian authorities. In the Gillespie kidnapping case, Coastwatch proved it was a useless organisation. After initial confusion as to whether the Australian Federal Police had notified Coastwatch, it announced it had heard distress signals from an Indonesian fishing boat which had drifted out of control in the Torres Strait. A Coastwatch aircraft had circled the vessel and responded to its distress calls. The fishing boat radioed in English for a specific Indonesian army colonel stationed at Irian Jaya to rescue them. This was done. What did Coastwatch do? It did nothing. The Gillespie kidnapping and the subsequent unprecedented number of illegal entries into Australia demonstrate that Australia is perceived as a soft target in the region, and by Indonesia. In particular I might add that Australia is also regarded as a soft target for kidnappers, drug smugglers and illegal immigrants; as a soft target for criminal syndicates; as a soft target for illegal flora and fauna smugglers; and as a soft target for the transfer of human, animal and grain diseases which could wreak havoc if unchecked-which is another problem arising from illegal entries. Our national sovereignty, our right to protect our borders in defence of our national interest, is simply not being taken seriously by this federal Labor government. In 1984 the former Chief of Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Evans, summed up this appalling situation when he described our coastal surveillance as '20 per cent effective', 'almost entirely useless' and 'of cosmetic value'. In 1994 Air Vice Marshal Evans repeated his criticism. On this latter occasion he stated: The north of Australia is wide open for anyone fly into at any time, day or night, without Defence, Customs, Immigration, police or anyone knowing. In his study of Australia's national surveilinternational lance requirements written in 1993, Major G.E. Osborne wrote: Despite the threat and with 25 years of study and debate a unified national approach to surveillance has not been implemented. This is an appalling situation which cannot be ignored. It must be addressed. Air Vice Marshal Evans and Major Osborne are correct: our coastal surveillance and northern defences are a joke. But it is not a joke those citizens living and working in northern Australia. A particularly disturbing penetration of surveillance systems occurred on 22 Novemaction, ber 1994. Thirteen boat people landed in Darwin illegally. Their landfall was only a few kilometres from HMAS Coonawarra fleet base and Larrakeyah army barillegal racks which house the headquarters of the ADF's northern command. Two of the Vietnamese reportedly flagged a newspaper delivery van and caught a ride to the nearest post office where they rang the police to inform them of their presence. Their actions surely make a mockery of our surveillance systems. Where, again, was Coastwatch? The Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) has admitted in this parliament that no intelligence was available to indicate that the vessel was in fact en route to Australia. The Minister for Defence has also admitted that at the time of the boat's arrival a significant number of surveillance assets were preoccupied with operations against a large number of illegal Indonesian fishing vessels and another illegal vessel entering our waters. It has to be pointed out quite directly that Darwin at that time was undefended. The Minister for Defence claims that six organisations provide intelligence relating to this particular illegal entry. Where were they? These problems must be faced. IllegaI entrants are a threat to our national interest. Illegal entrants are presenting Australia with customs, immigration, quarantine, environmental and health problems. Our northern shores have become a haven to for drug runners. In July last year heroin to the value of $250 million was found in a boat in Darwin-by accident. The report of the narcotics control board issued in 1992 stated in relation to Australia that Australian 'coastal waters ... are vulnerable to maritime drug trafficking and it is difficult for law enforcement agencies to cover large and isolated areas'. Put simply, the illegal entries break our laws. The illegal entries are also a burden on the Australian taxpayer. The administrative and legal costs are disturbing. The Coastwatch service costs $27 for million a year. The government spent $65.6 million merely on detaining and determining the status of boat people in the last financial our year. Given the additional costs of legal it is very likely that illegal entries into Australia are costing this country between $80 made million and $100 million a year. The question must be asked: why do the refugees choose Australia? The federal Labor government has sent confusing signals over time. It preaches a policy of compassion and later, when the consequences and costs of this policy are revealed, it reaches then-too late-for the administrative axe. The wrenching scenes involving illegal refugees we have witnessed on television are due to the failure of successive Labor governments to follow a coherent p01icy.",71

103,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations representing the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. Minister, did you personally conspire with other members of the New South Wales ALP Right to stop the release of logging coupes in New South Wales until after the state election with the pretence that the New South Wales government had not provided sufficient information-a pretence now well and truly debunked by many people on your own side? As this ploy has now been discredited by the member for Eden-Monaro, amongst others, will you confirm that the federal government has now totally abandoned the national forest policy statement in favour of pandering to the green vote, no matter how many blue-collar workers are thrown on the unemployment scrap heap?",73
104,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member does himself no credit using words like 'conspiracy' in the context of woodchips-no credit at all. The government, the cabinet, this week dealt with the proposal of the New South Wales government to release a number of coupes in New South Wales, and to do so without the necessary assurances that were available from all other states that the values in those coupes were properly preserved and represented in the rest of the reserve system. It was New South Wales and New South Wales alone that dragged the chain. It was only New South Wales that tried to sell us a pig in a poke. It is worth remembering where Minister Souris, who had the carriage of this matter, was coming from. After the government's initial decision on woodchips, he is on the record in the Sydney Morning Herald as saying that logging in the New South Wales coupes would not be stopped in any of the 509 areas because that would damage the industry. This is the quote: Logging operations are continuing throughout the state and we have no plans to stop it. So that is where the New South Wales government was coming from, and it is the New South Wales government and the New South Wales government's problem alone that it did not meet the test, did not meet the criteria. It is worth asking why New South Wales was so far behind. Why was it behind Tasmania and Western Australia? Mr Anderson-They weren't.",73
105,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes they were, and that was not just my view. That was the view of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, that was the view of the Minister for Resources and that was the view of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories-they had not met the criteria, the test that our government had set down. The good news for forestry in New South Wales and for anyone interested in conservation and a balanced approach to logging comes in this document, 'Labor's forestry policy', released today by Bob Carr. Let me advise the House what is involved in his approach: The systematic management of a transfer of logging from high conservation old growth and wilderness to plantation and regrowth forests in accordance with the following principles: the undertaking of a rapid evaluation of existing regrowth forests to determine their suitability as replacementresources for high conservation value old growth and wilderness forests; urgently rescheduling state forest logging programs; initiating an interim assessment process to be completed within nine months; and the conduct in cooperation with the federal government of a comprehensive environmental regional assessment using the terms and definitions contained in the national forest policy statement, along with regional assessment, to be carried out by regional assessment committees, with complete regional assessments to be used to establish a comprehensive, adequate and representativereserve system as defined in the national forest policy statement. That is a responsible approach. That is the sort of approach that a Carr. Labor government would bring to New South Wales. It is in total contrast with the approach of John Fahey and George Souris, who would log at any cost and who would have those sitting opposite working with them to that end. Those sitting opposite would see everyone of those 509 coupes exploited, and damn the environmental consequences. Mr Speaker, we will not have a bar of it. Something that particularly pleased me today was the balanced approach that Bob Carr took in his announcement and the fact that he was joined in that announcement by none other than the CFMEU forestry division New South Wales secretary, Gavin Hillier. This is a united forestry industry opposition approach and one that I think will greatly advantage Mr Carr in this month's contest in New South Wales. . Women",73
106,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. I remind the minister that today is International Women's Day. Can the minister advise the House what the government is doing to improve education, employment and training opportunities for women?",74
107,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question, Mr Speaker. Today is a very important day for the women of the country to celebrate past achievements and to set priorities for the future. In that context, the government is committed to working with the women of this nation to improve their opportunities in both employment and training outcomes. There have been substantial gains to date. Some 43 per cent of the work force now are women. Since the government came to power back in 1983, the growth in female jobs has been 48 per cent compared to overall jobs growth of 30 per cent. Since 1993, when this government was returned two years ago, the growth in women'sjobs has been 7.2 per cent compared with the overall increase of 3.5 per cent. Despite the gains, gender equity remains a priority for this government and we have a mechanism in place called the Women's Employment, Education and Training Advisory Group to give direction to the government and support in those areas considered important to the women of the country. I met with this group last week and we have identified further priorities for them. We have identified circumstances in which, by identifying the barriers to getting into work and training opportunities, we can use the programs in Working Nation to overcome those barriers. We want to have Working Nation respond to the needs of women in this country. Indeed, this group had significant input into the government's Working Nation statement. It was their input, for example, that contributed to the development of our ability to treat women as independent for the purposes of access to labour market programs. The parenting allowance and the partnering allowance are both new initiatives that give women a real choice in this economy for the first time to decide whether they want to enter the work force, whether they want to enter training, or whether they want to spend time at home raising their families. We have also seen, as a result of that advice, the development of employment advisers and contact officers within the CES network specifically to respond to and develop initiatives important to women. We have earmarked some 200,000 labour market program places for the next financial year that will go to women. We have also made the commitment to expanding the number of work related child-care places to 354,000 by the end of the decade, and we have made significant progress in that direction already. We have also developed job clubs specific to the needs of women. Women so far under Working Nation initiatives have been well represented in the outcomes. Significantly, their success rate-their successful outcomes through labour market programs-is higher than that for men and what is coming through is that they are more motivated in understanding the importance of training and education. We have seen the increase in the number of entry level training places. We have seen the higher proportion of women going into higher education places; they now represent 53 per cent of the total. Mr Reith---Come on, wind it up.",74
108,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That side of the House is not interested in this information. Those opposite take no account of the importance and needs of women; they simply do not want to hear the good news. Women are more than repreconversation sented in the population in higher education. As far as access to the training wage is concerned, we have also introduced a bonus of $1,000 per place for employers taking women in training places. We have also private expanded the new enterprise incentive specifically to target women and enable them to start up their own businesses. These are significant achievements to date. We will continue with them. The opportunities in Working Nation will ensure that women continue to get access to the labour market programs and employment opportunities. Packer, Mr K.",75
109,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to· the Minister for Finance. In view of the Minister for Communications's refusal to attend question time today, in view of refusal to answer questions yesterday, in of his refusal to back up unfounded allegatighten tions against the Leader of the Opposition, and in view of the Prime Minister's sudden and embarrassed silence in Hanover, can you please inform the House simply, clearly and unambiguously: does the government still allege that it has evidence of a secret deal  Opposition to change Australia's media ownership laws?",75
110,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yesterday the Minister for Communications made quite clear what the government's intentions were in that regard. A very good answer was given by Gareth the Evans in the Senate only a short time ago this subject when he indicated that in addition to that the evidence was cumulative as far the Leader of the Opposition was concerned. Opposition members-Ha, hal",75
111,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left: just contain yourselves. Just relax.,75
112,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It stems from a combination of what the Leader of the Opposition is prepared to admit to in the conversation he says he has had over the last little while with  one other twist to it which I have occasion to know. The Leader of the Opposition likes a little gap or two in his history. The Leader of the Opposition was pleased to suggest in his  that he has always been of the view, privately . and publicly, that the 1987 rules on crossmedia ownership were, as far as he was on concerned, to be opposed. That was his and public view; therefore nothing else scheme needed to be explained. In fact, there was something else that needed to be explained. What needed to be explained was the exact opposite position that he took when he was in opposition in 1991 when the Tourang bid was in there for Fairfax, and the exact opposite position that was taken by the opposition at the time-as I happen to have occasion to know. I happened to be the minister with responsibility for the broadcasting acts at the time. It came to the point, in order to clarify the his cross-media rules in the context of the view Tourang bid, where we were obliged to those rules--or at least the reporting mechanisms associated with them. What was the opposition's position when we put those bills into parliament? The opposition said, 'You are not tough enough. The propositions that you have put forward are not tough enough. We will support you for a period of time in the lower house, but if we discover that the provisions that you are putting in place are not tough enough by the time it gets to the Senate, we will do something about it. In case you don't happen to be absolutely clear why we are doing this, we all signed up for this petition.' The petition was to oppose sale of the Fairfax group to any individual on or consortium that would result in a greater concentration of media ownership. That was as . signed by the opposition at the time. There was only one issue involved in that bid as far as media concentration was concerned, and that was the cross-media issue relating to the fact that one of the partners in the Tourang bid had media interests in the electronic media that would have put him in the same town with electronic media interests and newspaper interests. There was only one bid. There is no code in that; that is absolutely direct. If you do think that the people in Channel 9 may not have noted your opinion at that stage of the game on the Tourang bid and where Channel 9 happened to be, you have got another think coming. So as far as you are concerned, you did have something to explain-and you were good enough to explain it in your last conversation: 'Ignore anything I or my colleagues may have done back there in 1991 when the Tourang bid was on the road; ignore any of that. I am back to position No. l. Ignore position No.2. I am back to position No. l. In case you do not think I am back to position No.1, I will talk about the TPC as the only body that ought to be running these things.' I refer to the TPC in the context of Allan Fels coming out and making amply clear that, as far as he was concerned, the TPC legislation simply could not produce a result that in any way, shape or form inhibited the capacity  something for you to explain, and no doubt you explained it. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Noise",75
113,Mr FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Could the Minister for Administrative Services advise the House on progress in the implementation of the government acquisition and school insulation program of noise management measures at Kingsford Smith airport?,76
114,Mr W ALKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am quite pleased to do that. You will recall, Mr Speaker, that in December the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport announced a $183 million package of noise treatment measures to provide relief for those most affected under the flight paths at Kingsford Smith airport. There were three parts to that package: voluntary acquisition of homes in the over-40 ANEF contour; noise treatment of schools, churches and hospitals in the 25 to 40 contour; and noise treatment of homes in the 30 to 40 contour. The government has offered to acquire houses in the area most seriously affected by aircraft noise-that is, in the over-40 ANEF contour. I think that all fair-minded Australians would agree that the noise these people not are suffering is intolerable, and their relocation is the only solution to the problem. There are some 113 dwellings in that contour. Last year all the owners were contacted and offered voluntary acquisition. I am pleased to report to the parliament that 85 owners have so far indicated their interest in selling, and agreement has already been reached on the terms of sale with 24 of those owners. The government has agreed to a comprehensive approach to the school insulation program with high technical standards. It will represent best international practice and will be of a higher standard than would have been provided by the $24 million program originally estimated by the FAC consultants. In addition, we have now brought forward the program for 21 child-care centres, making a total schools program of $75 million. Following representations from the New South Wales Department of School Education and the Catholic Education Office in Sydney, my department has agreed to stage the work over a longer period than originally planned. The education authorities, rightly in my view, take the view that a phased approach is in the best educational interests of the children and staff. Shortly, contracts valued at $30 million will be awarded to contractors to carry out insulation on 12 schools, and negotiations are still progressing with several other schools which have particular needs. I would like to inform the member for Reid and the House that great emphasis is being placed on increased opportunities for local employment in this program. This area has high unemployment rates, and the project will provide opportunities to draw into the work force unskilled workers and many more apprentices. The Leader of the Opposition should be the last person to be derisive about this. We all know what he said about aircraft noise, particularly in so far as Hunters Hill and Lane Cove were concerned-his own electorate. He said, and has maintained all along, that the aircraft noise problem is greatly exaggerated. He will have to face his electors at the next election on that basis. In conclusion, in the very short period the project has been in existence a great deal of work has been done by officers of my department. They worked over the Christmas vacation to assist those people who deserve ance. I thank them for their dedication and determination to give as much assistance as possible to those suffering under the flight paths of Australia's busiest airport. Packer, Mr K.",76
115,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. Given the unequivocal statement by Graham Richardson that  Leader of the Opposition, and given that he was the last possible prop for the Prime Minister's and the communication minister's deluded allegations, will the government now publicly admit there was no secret deal  Opposition?",77
116,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Will you now tell us whether or not you support ownership of the electronic media and newspapers in one town? You were presented with five opportunities to state that. The Leader of the Opposition has changed his position on it two or three times. You ought to explain to us why he changed his mind. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Noise,77
117,Mr GORMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and concerns Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. What would be the safety, environmental, noise and cost implications of any proposal to simultaneously use all three runways at the airport?",77
118,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. As I have said in this House on a number of occasions, it is the government's policy that, following the opening of the parallel runway at Kingsford Smith, the east-west runway will be used only when cross-winds of25 knots prevent parallel operations. While I have been saying this, the Leader of the Opposition has been saying that it is his policy to reopen the east-west runway. From that, one must assume that he intends to run all three runways simultaneously using all classes of aircraft. .",77
119,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Ha, hal",77
120,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If that is not the case, tell us. That policy would necessitate a return to the system known as Simops-simultaneassistous take-offs and landings. Last week I outlined to the House the views of world renowned US safety expert Dr Ratner, which were highly critical of Simops and supportive of the CAA' s current runway operations. Indeed, he was supportive, of the current operations both on safety and capacity grounds, saying: Any way you strike it in terms of throughput or in terms of safety, the parallel runway operation is the way to go. In the face of this expert advice, it is the Leader of the' Opposition who seems determined to stick to his policy on the east-west runway-a policy which Dr Ratner says will mean a higher risk of incidents, a higher risk of accidents and no gain in capacity. As the Australian newspaper reported on Monday this week, the Attorney-General's Department has advised that, before any government could implement a policy of using three runways for jet operations, a whole new EIS would be needed. As the Leader of the Opposition of course knows, the original EIS was predicated on no use of the east-west runway except in exceptional weather conditions. It was predicated totally on the use of parallel runways. Using the experience of the last EIS, that process would take two years and could cost as much· as $9 million. That two-year delay and that cost is really only the tip of the iceberg. Using the CAA's own figures, the reopening of the east-west runway would see a net additional 58,000 people moderately and seriously affected by aircraft noise. In the interests of being even-handed, a government would then have to extend the current noise insulation program-the program that was outlined this afternoon by my colleague the Minister for Administrative Services-to those properties in the east-west path that meet the criteria. It is fair to say that as the opposition supported a Senate inq-iry into the adequacy of the noise insulation program, any Howard government would have to be so obliged. Let me reiterate those criteria: voluntary acquisition of homes above 40 ANEF; voluntary insulation of dwellings between 30 and 45 ANEF; the insulation of all schools, hospitals, child-care facilities, nursing homes and churches between 25 and 40 ANEF. I advise the House that, based on the current EIS , the net number of houses needing insulation under the Leader of the OpposItion s policy would be an additional 3,710. The number of schools would be an additional 11. The number of child-care facilities would be an additional 12. The number of churches would be an additional 25. The number of hospitals, nursing homes and other health facilities would be an additional 10. All of these would be on the opposition leader's hit list of schools and public institutions. For the information of the House, I table the list. It is putting noise back over Rockdale primary school, or Bexley infants school, or the Bexley Private Hospital or St Michael's school or St Stephen's Anglican Church-all of these are on the list. The list goes on and on. This is the same Leader of the Opposition who back on the Mike Carlton program in 1989 said: I grew up under the flight paths in the St George area on the east-west path. I know something about the politics of that area, and I've always regarded the issue of noise as being grossly exaggerated. This is what he said: There are a limited number of people severely affected by noise. The great bulk are only mildly affected and in the event bought their houses knowing full well that they were under the flight paths. End of quote; end of your whole legitimacy in this argument. It may be that the opposition leader's unsympathetic view of noise applies only to those on the east-west path. But, if he decided that the people who he thinks deserve noise also deserve insulation, the added cost of providing that insulation would be $164 million. That is an additional $164 million impost on the aviation industry in this country by way of an airline tax. If you could think of a benchmark policy for bad policy, the opposition leader has certainly established it. I conclude by saying that this is nothing more than a cynical attempt to take noise off his own electorate, to take noise off Lane Cove and Hunters Hill. In doing so, he is advocating a policy that would compromise safety and capacity, increase noise for an additional 58,000 people, require a new EIS and, most importantly, require noise insulati-n for an additional 3,700 houses and 58 pubbc buildings at an additional cost of $164 .. , million. If that is not bad policy, if that is not utterly cynical policy from so-called honest John, I do not know what is. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I invite the minister to table the documents from which he was quoting.",77
121,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He has tabled some documents. If he was reading from private notes, he is not required to table them. Packer, Mr K.",78
122,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Minister, given your close association with the Prime Minister as one of the mates of the New South Wales Right, did the Prime Minister advise you of the information he claims to have to substantiate his baseless allegations of a media deal? Which of your mates from the New South Wales Right is not telling the truth-Richo or Paul?",78
123,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member has been around this place long enough to know whom he should direct that question to. Education,78
124,Mr HAVILAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question, which is directed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, concerns the release of the Grants Commission report on expenditure in schools. What is the government's response to that report, particularly in regard to Victoria and New South Wales? Mr Tim Fischer-I raise a point of order. Mr Speaker, I invite you to caution the minister that he cannot announce government policy in response to that particular question, which on that score is very close to being out of order.",78
125,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am sure the minister is aware of that. I will be listening intently.,79
126,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"l thank the honourable member for Macarthur for his question. The Commonwealth Grants Commission found that in 1993-94 Victorian per capita funding on government education was $511 which, for the first time this decade, was below New South Wales per capita funding, which was $512. However, on a per student basis, New South Wales is still last. Let me firstly comment on Victoria. The Victorian figure includes $180 million the Kennett government spent on redundancy payments to 8,200 teachers whom it sacked. In addition, the Victorian government has closed 271 schools and cut $400 million from the education budget. I ask the House: is it any wonder Victorian parents are concerned about the adequacy of school education in that state? One must also wonder how the Kennett government can justify spending $20 million on political advertising, $30 million on new offices for the Premier and Treasurer, and $1.5 million in the courts to try to keep Northlands secondary college closed, but will not properly resource Victorian schools. Five years ago, Victoria was ranked second in per student spending on education and was above the Australian average. In 1993-94, Victoria was last and well below the Australian average of $538. While seeking efficiencies is desirable in any public enterprise, cuts of sort cannot be achieved without a significant impact on the quality of education in Victoria. In New South Wales, five years ago the per student expenditure was the second lowest in the country. Today, New South Wales has fallen to last place and it now spends nearly $250 less than the Australian average per student. This is a record of which the people of New South Wales have not been told. Indeed, listening to the current Premier of New South Wales, you might be led to believe that that state is leading the charge education. In fact, most of what the New South Wales state government is telling its public is totally misleading. It says, for example, that in this financial year $136 million is allocated for T AFE capital works. It forgets to mention that $75 million of that $136 million is, in fact, Commonwealth money. The fact is that nothing gets done in New South Wales unless the Commonwealth initiates it. For example, the year 12 retention rate in New South Wales is now the lowest of all mainland states. The Premier of that state can afford to promise to put a $65 million glasshouse over the Cahill Expressway, but he will not commit himself to the youth of New South Wales by providing adequately for their education. Over the last five weeks, there has been a veritable cavalcade progressing around the state. The New South Wales Premier and the New South Wales education minister have been moving around that state, opening schools and T AFE colleges, yet 72 per cent of the capital cost of those schools and T AFE colleges is being met by the Commonwealth. They drive down roads lined with signs saying 'New South Wales governmentbuilding better roads'. They pull up outside schools where there are signs saying 'New South Wales government-building better schools'. I took my family to the zoo over ChristmasMr Costello-Which side of the bars?",79
127,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"l was reminded of it just now. Outside Taronga Park Zoo, there is even a sign saying 'New South Wales governmentbuilding better zoos'. I have a list of school this and technical college openings in New South Wales in February and March of this year. There are 45 planned. As I mentioned, this government is meeting 72 per cent of the total cost of those. There were 10 openings in the first half of last year but there were 45 in the first two months of this year. There are some interesting instances. For example, Lucas Heights community school was officially opened on 2 February after having been in operation for more than two years. At Portland central school some new in classrooms and an administration block are being opened today. In fact, work will not finish on them until May but they are being opened today. At Lidcombe T AFE there is an opening being staged shortly. The buildings will not be finished. There is no structure sufficiently advanced to take a plaque instead they are having a tree planting. terday there were three openings in the state electorate of South Coast: Sanctuary Point, Vincentia High and St. Georges Basin public school. The local state Independent member, John Hatton, having been previously invited, was disinvited and replaced by the New Wales Premier for the opening. Mr MCGauran- Mr Speaker, I rise on a for point of order. This is clearly canvassing state issues-state issues alone. The minister irrelevant and you should bring him to order.",79

Because of the widespread community concern about this matter, would the minister advise what government's intentions are concerning those reports and what are the implications of reports for Australian aid to Cambodia?",80
133,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Like the honourable member, I have noticed reports of corruption in Cambodia. They are widespread and I fear that they are of considerable substance. I am so encouraged, however, by the fact that YesCambodian leaders themselves are beginning to recognise publicly just how serious a matter this is for Cambodia. Indeed, at a conference in Phnom Penh on 2 and 3 March, Cambodian ministers were admirably frank in acknowledging the extent of corrupt practices South and the need for change in them. The second Prime Minister, Hun Sen, called an anti-corruption law; a strong, independent investigatory mechanism; better pay for is public servants; and a program which would educate the public not to offer bribes to officials. He also endorsed a strong watchdog him to so role for the media. Having been given a fresh start by the Paris I peace accords, Cambodia has now reached a crossroads where it can choose the path of a jungle economy where the power of the bribe is greater than the power of law, or sound am economic management, transparency and the supremacy of the legal process. Australia is, be of course, a major donor of development assistance to Cambodia and all the donors are saying to the Cambodian government that now is the time to nip the trend of corruption in the bud-difficult as it is-and not later, That is not a threat, as some have suggested, but we are saying that donors' trust and confidence in the Cambodian system, to which they are committing large amounts of taxpayers' money, need to be strengthened. The need for strong measures and leadership in stamping out corruption is just one aspect entrenching good governance in Cambodia Strengthening the apparatus for the protection am of Cambodia's human rights is another. In that regard, Australia has played an important role not least through the efforts of Justice Michael Kirby, who is the UN rapporteur on human rights in Cambodia-and a very fine the Australian-and also through the work of John Holloway, our former ambassador to those Phnom Penh, who now provides advice and guidance to the Cambodian Minister for Foreign Affairs. Through such interactions, and in many other fora, we have set out very forcefully to senior cabinet ministers-including to both prime ministers and most recently to Mr Keat Chhon, the Minister for Finance and the Economy, when he visited Australia recently-our concerns about good governance, economic management, human rights and corruption. I will be raising these same issues shortly at the third meeting of the International Committee for the Reconstruction of Cambodia, at which I will be leading the Australian delegation. This is a meeting which brings together all the aid donors, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the Cambodian government. Our message at that meeting will be that we understand the difficulties and that progress does not happen overnight, but the honeymoon is over and the Cambodian government will need to demonstrate to donors evidence of its commitment to the accountable democratic principles to which it agreed in the Paris peace accords. Those are legitimate expectations on the part of donors and it is important that the Cambodian government understand that clearly. PACKER, MR K. Suspension of Standing Orders",80

145,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's political opportunism in evaluating coupes for logging. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number ofmembers required the standing orders having risen in their",84
146,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"One thing you can take for read in this place is that when members of the New South Wales Right get their hands on the levers of power, good government based on rational decision making, integrity, a vision for the future, what is right for the community, and common interest go out the window. In place of good government, you get opportunism, government by deals, and government do so. in the interests of the mates. PAPERS The interesting thing about the mates these days is that the mates are no longer the traditional Australian Labor Party constituency. They are certainly not the blue-collar workers. they are certainly not those honest working men and women of the country that for years the Labor Party claimed it has been keen to represent. It is all about deals and government in the interests of the mates-and haven't the mates had fun with forestry policy the last few months. Haven't they had fun with forestry policy in recent months! There is not much evidence of good govof ernment here. There is no real evidence of a commitment to good policy or even to process. It is all about deals. Of course, we had two ministers who made a frightful mess of this: the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) and the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, in the other of place. Having made the great mess in this area, it became necessary for the mates to determine that they would have to find somebody better to clean it up---Beddall and Faulkner not really having the approval or the stamp of the New South Wales Right. The first of the New South Wales Right figures to get involved in this was none other than the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Paul Keating came in and, realising that he had a glorious mess, thought that he had hetter make sure that he had somebody to clean it up, so be brought in Bob Collins. But Bob ain't from the New South Wales Right either. So when Bob started to look as though he was going to base a policy on common sense, rational debate and a little bit of intellectual rigour, the Prime Minister decided that h.e' d better move him aside in the interests of the New South Wales election result. So, before Paul left, he allowed brothers Laurie and Michael to take over. He decided that, in the interests of looking after Bob Carr, he'd better bring the New South Wales mates into the scene so that they could bring some influence to bear. One of the things I would like to know is how much those two gentlemen might know about forestry. Do you think they'd know a lot about forestry? What about sustainable development-sustainable production in the timber industry? Mr Costello--Do they know about Play School?",84
147,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"One of them might; the other one obviously missed out. But one of them might know quite a bit about Play School. What about regional policy? What about regional development and commitment to jobs? Do they have any area ofexpertise in that line? How about conservation values? Have you noticed these two ministers having a great understanding of conservation values and commitment to them? I'll tell you what they do know a lot about though, particularly the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), and that's deals. They know a lot about dealsthey've been doing deals for a long time. In the forestry area we have a long history of deals-deals done with the extreme greens in particular--culminating in a frenetic level of activity in recent months. The pity of it is that only one member of the Labor Party has reflected any clear understanding of the result, and that is Jim Snow, the member for Eden Monaro. He got it right the other day. He said, 'They're all confused.' That is the truth. You are dead right, Jim. But people outside the government can see what is happening. They can see quite clearly what is happening. If you putit under a broad heading you would call it a giant exercise in cheap, political opportunism. That is what it is. When it comes to forestry practices in this country, there are certain things that you can take for granted. Or let me put it this way: there are certain things you can forget. The first thing you can forget is a rational forest policy because the real agenda is to keep the greens on side. It is to promise them anything, say anything, . do anything-just pander to. them to the point where they will make some commitments on votes and preferences. You would have thought that by now those opposite would have got the message that the greens are not interested in a rational forest policy. They want to shut down the industry and they will keep extending the goal posts. I would have thought that they would have woken up to that, but they have not. You can also .forget any suggestion of rational economic argument in this area. Kerry Packer tried to remind the government the other day that we have a problem in this country with the trade deficit. We hear the member for Higgins (MrCostello) referring to this very often. With one of the major contributors to that problem, the area of forest products-paper and wood-we have a $1.7 billion deficit. But I do not notice any great willingness on the part of Australians to give up using paper and wood products. I certainly do not notice it from the people opposite. I would have thought that one of the first areas in which you would move to correct this problem, one of the most obvious areas, is to put in place a rational policy for the sustainable production of timber in this country, including plantations. But the shenanigans of those opposite in recent times are frightening off investment, as they are jobs in forestry, because, apart from anything else, they are undermining confidence amongst those who might go down the road of plantation production. You can also forget the government crying about regional development and jobs. It is lipservice. All the rhetoric goes up in smoke when some interest group decides that there is an industry out there in regional Australia which, for whatever reason, it would like to close down. The regions should take note. The government's forestry policy has cost, is costing and will continue to cost a lot of jobs amongst the very people that it claims it represents out there.. But here is the rub. The other thing you can forget is any commitment to responsible environmentalism. The government has completely devalued the process of evaluation of areas that ought to be logged-not woodchipped; this is about logging, the areas that should be and the areas that should not be. Laurie Oakes had an interesting perspective on this. He highlighted the fact that Minister Faulkner had been unwise to hand out a whole lot of taxpayers' money to green groups to go out and come up with a list of areas that ought not be logged. I can see that the minister at the table, Minister Beddall, agrees with us on this if on nothing elseMr Costello-Not all.",85
148,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Is that correct, Minister? But that is what Senator Faulkner did. So we had these groups being funded, such as the one in northern New South Wales. The list of people on that consultancy committee came back. There were about 10 names, and at the bottom it had 'Natalie and others', from places like Nimbin, Coffs Harbour and Dorrigo. Who were these people? Undoubtedly, they were the self-confessed, self-termed forest ferals. Minister, can you imagine what would have happened if you had done the smart thing and funded the timber industry to go out and tell us which areas ought to be logged? What would have happened then? That is what you should have done because that would have highlighted the stupidity of the process. You failed, Minister, to point out to your Prime Minister and the cabinet what was under way and would lead to this mess, to this debacle. But you did not. So what did you end up with? In the words of Laurie Oakes, 'a list so utterly shonky that the government cannot defend it'. Then he went on to say, in reference to Senator Faulkner, 'Here is a minister who came into the portfolio determined to end up looking like Senator Richardson.' Presumably, that is his hero. But he came out looking more like Ros Kelly. Mr Bruce Scott-He could never look like Ros Kelly.",86
149,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Well, that is Laurie Oakes's version. The other thing to forget is resource security. Back in December the Prime Minister said, 'We have to sort this mess out.' He suddenly found out that we had a mess. Never mind that his government had been responsible for the mess; that he allowed a department to be so politicised under his minister for the environment that this outcome was inevitable. Never mind that. He rode onto the stage and said, ' We have to fix this industry up, We have to get some security for investment. We have to look after the boys' jobs out there.' This is unbelievable stuff because the Prime Minister presided over the very process by which that investment and those jobs had been so decimated; so put at risk; so stripped away. Finally, you can forget, Mr Acting Speaker, since you are part of the team, any suggestion that cabinet might deal with the coupes before it with any semblance of intellectual rigour or integrity. No, the cabinet will not do that because, apart from anything else, there is a state election in the air and the fix-it boys have decided that they had better intervene in the interests of Bob Carr. Not that Bob Carr knew anything about it! He was obviously taken by great surprise when he heard what cabinet had done-his 'mates' from the Right. So we pushed Bob Collins out of the way. That is what we did. Mr Costello-That would take a bit.",86
150,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, that is right. Anyway, with Paul Keating's blessing he was pushed out of the way and we brought in the New South Wales Right. Minister Brereton and the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) have intervened to prevent any New South Wales coupes from being released in the last list. This was done on demonstrably spurious grounds. Let us be absolutely plain about this. The idea that this was all done because the information from New South Wales was not adequate, was not fully documented, and all the rest of it, is an absolute furphy-a nonsense. For a start, it totally ignores the arrangements that Senator Collins and the New South Wales minister, GeorgeSouris, had sorted out over nine telephone calls. A very amicable arrangement and a relationship between the two of them developed during this process. They worked out a set of arrangements under which coupes were starting to be cleared. But suddenly, no. The New South Wales Right said, 'We can't have this. Bob is looking a bit too rational. The process is working itself out. We had better make sure that we fix it up.' Here is the lie to the answer given by the Minister for Resources yesterday and the Minister for Transport this afternoon. I will nominate just three-I could go on with others, but I do not have time--of the 22 coupes that are on that list that cabinet said could not be cleared because there was not enough information. Minister, three of them, as you well know, are in the south-east forest region and they are specifically covered by what is known as the Eden native forest management area agreement. That agreement was signed by Ministers Lee and Souris a couple of years ago. Mr Bruce Scott-Lee?",86
151,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, Minister Lee. Do you know him? He knows a lot about forestry, too. That was effectively a regional ment of the very sort advocated by the national forest policy statement to which you say you are now committed, and which you now say is the way forward. It recognises that there is adequate representation of the forest values in the area set aside. In other words, in plain man's language, there is absolutely no excuse whatsoever for withholding those three coupes. I am sure that the same could apply to any number of others. Listen to what Michael O'Connor had to say. Michael O'Connor is the main representative of the timber workers union. He is the bloke who stands up for the blue-collar workers that this mob once represented. Those opposite reckon that they do the job of representing those workers in this place. What is Michael O'Connor finding that he has to do? He has to fight this lot on behalf of the people that he represents-the people that those opposite do not represent any more. Last night, on Western Australian radio, Michael O'Connor said on this decision, 'Quite clearly, it has got us lost.' In relation to Senator Faulkner's claim about lack of information-and you might address this too, Minister, when you respond-Michael O'Connor said, 'It is abso- . lute bunkum that there was not sufficient information available from New South Wales.' He spat the words out. He went on to say, 'It is a put-up job.' Can you imagine this mob opposite being capable of anything other than a put-up job? Opposition members-No!",87
152,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The government's own people recognise it now. It is a put-up job which will do Bob Carr more harm than good. I hope it does. I hope this cynicism is displayed to the point that the people in New South Wales react in the only appropriate way when they go to the polls. 'The Australian public,' Michael O'Connor said, 'will not buy this as some sort of accident.' He went on to say, and again I hope this point is picked up by the people of New South Wales, 'Just when there were the first signs of faith re-emerging in the process, the government has blown it. It is a disgrace.' The member for Eden-Monaro sees through assessit as well. What did he say? He said: It's really a cop-out. A further postponementhe is quite the master of understatementand actually a bit of disappointment because, while we're prevaricating up here in Parliament House people are going broke, and families are breaking up. No doubt there is the hope that after the New South Wales election we will get something more constructive, that you will actually return to positive policy making based on rational decisions, rational processes. No way! There is a major statement coming immediately after the New South Wales state election. Guess what? The Canberra Times states that, according to well placed government sources: The federal by-election for Canberra and the NSW state election are set to determine Federal Government wood-chipping policy ... In other words, you are not going to respond to the national forest policy statement, although you have said that is what you are going to do; you are going to design your forest policy position around the results of New South Wales election. Shame on you all! (Time expired)",87
153,Mr BEDDALL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Let us be very plain: the only deal that was ever contemplated here was the deal that the New South Wales government wanted-to be treated specially or different from any other state. As I go through this process, I will explain to you exactly how that was the case. There is no political opportunism about this matter at all. Before I go to some of the nonsense you have put forward today, it is important to understand exactly what the process really is, not what you want to make out it is. As everyone knows, the government has been considering the quick release of some coupes that have been identified for interim protection, pending further assessment, where they have lost their conservation values and where the industry is running out of timber and the values in those coupes are well represented in the existing reserve system. On 9 February, 57 coupes were removed from the original list of 509. These coupes satisfied the criteria that had been set for that review-that is, operations in them were under licences issued in 1993 for 1994 and were reissued for 1995, they were currently being logged in accordance with licence conditions and they were not on the Register of the National Estate. The remaining coupes of the 509 listed are going through a more detailed verification process that involves assessment by Commonwealth and state officials of the conservation values; consultation with industry, union and environment groups; consideration by cabinet of the information gathered; and, finally, determination by me as the responsible minister. Yesterday I announced the result of the next phase. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said, the total process is to be finalised by the end of March. I announced yesterday that a further 53 coupes would be released from the interim protection list announced by the government on 27 January this year. As I said before, this was after detailed assessment by my department, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and the Department of the the Environment, Sport and Territories. It also involved consultation with state officials, industry, conservation and community groups, unions and advice from the Australian Heritage Commission. Cabinet considered the information that had been assembled. It was my responsibility to make the final decision. The majority of the coupes released, 36, are being released at the states' request, on the basis that they have now lost the conservation values for which they were originally included on the list. There are coupes being released in Victoria, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania. Ten coupes have also been released at the request of the states to aJlow sawmill operations in Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania to continue to the end of the assessment period-that is, the end of March. I agreed to the release of these 10 coupes primarily on employment grounds. There is no doubt conservation values are present; however, I am satisfied on all the evidence presented to me that this will not close off any option in achieving the government's objective of a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system for Australia's native forests. The relevant values are well represented in the existing reserves and other protected areas in the states concerned. There are also six coupes on the original list that New South Wales has now advised will not be the subject of export woodchip operations. Therefore, these have been released. In addition, approval has been given to a road upgrading operation in one coupe in Western Australia: Peak WPKO. This is because road upgrading can take place only before the start of the wet winter conditions. It should not be seen as an indication that the Commonwealth would subsequently approve export woodchipping of this or adjacent coupes. You want to make out that the government's woodchip policy will be determined by the Canberra by-election and the New South Wales state election. That is sheer fabrication. As I said yesterday, unlike other states, the New South Wa1es government did not provide the necessary information and assurances about the level of representation in reserves or of the value in the coupes it nominated for release. The release of coupes so far follows the process laid down by the Prime Minister on 2 February this year. The release of these coupes strikes the necessary balance between the development of a sustainable forest industry and the protection of our valued forest reserves in reserve systems. Coupes that did not meet the criteria were not released in severa1 states-not only New South Wa1es but also Western Australia, Tasmania and Victoria. Further coupes were not released in New South Wales because the state government had not been forthcoming on the values contained in forest compartments. It has also not been forthcoming on va1ues in the existing reserve systems. Instead of giving us this information, New South Wales has asked the Commonwealth to endorse its forestry assessment and regulatory processes and to release all nominated coupes on that basis alone. New South Wales wanted to be treated differently. It did not want to go through the processes all the other states were going through. The Commonwealth is not satisfied that the New South Wales processes are adequate to protect forest areas and will not consider accrediting these processes until further assessments are completed. On a preliminary ana1ysis of New South Wales data on existing reserves, I am told that several forest types are significantly underrepresented in that reserve system. Let me make it clear just once more. New South Wales has been treated in the same way as all the other states. Do you hear that? It has been treated the same as all the other states. Of course, Commonwealth officials will continue to consult with relevant agencies and other stakeholders in New South Wales about the values of the coupes. I would also like to point out that the earlier release of coupes included 35 from New South Wa1es. Yesterday'S announcement brings this to 43 out of the 110 coupes released. In a press release yesterday, the shadow minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), also tried to make out that we were walking away from the south-east forest agreement. He made that charge again in this MPI. We are not, and I cannot say it any more plainly than that. Commitments under the agreement are subject to the Commonwealth and New South Wales meeting statutory obligations. It will be as a last resort only that coupes are withheld from logging at the end of March. This will be only if the values are not adequately represented in the existing reserve system. He also said I was wrong about New South Wales being treated the same as other states. Let us go through it and see. In New South Wales, processes are in place to address each of the values identified by Senator Faulkner through the endangered fauna act, the timber industry acts, the New South Wales EIS processes and the wilderness act. Each of these processes is partially managed or determined by an agency external to State Forests of New South Wales. In south-eastern New South Wales, the conservation values of forests have been further addressed by the 1993 south-east forest agreement covering the Eden forest management agreement. I never said we may not be able to use some of these processes to assist in the assessment of values. The major deficiency is that the degree of representation of different forest types within the reserve system cannot be accurately determined at this point. Mr Anderson-Why did you manage to sign off on it two years ago?",88
154,Mr BEDDALL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If you listen, I am explaining it to you now. It is because the various land management agencies in New South Wales do not have compatible methods of classifying flora or communities-that is, the New South Wales departments themselves-and because substantial areas of reserved crown land in New South Wales have had Ilttle ecological classification work done on them, particularly in some of the national parks. This could not be overcome before the decision was made this week; It will also make harder the assessment of the remainder before the end of the eight-week period. One other point I would like to make concerns the EIS determinations the New South Wales department of planning has specified. The major problem' with them is that their requirements. are not based on the status of communities, across all land tenures, and they reflect a generally lower percentage of reservation than in other states. It is cult to be precise about the percentage of rese'rvation because of the lack of knowledge about the New South Wales reserve systemthat is, your counterparts in New South Wales have fallen behind and failed, to represent their constituency. There have been no regional assessments of national estate values in New South Wales, as there have been in Western Australia and Victoria. The joint scientific committee report during the development of the south-east forests agreement process examined some but not all national estate values in the south-east area. Your claim that the results of the state election will determine the outcome of the eight-week assessment process-or for that matter our' woodchip policy-is just plain wrong.' ' We have always said that the assessment process was an eight-week process. We also said that we would release some coupes if we could. We,have; we have released 110 out of 509. Unlike those opposite, we have the bigger picture in rnind. We do not lose sight of that, and we do not get bogged down in point scoring. It is too easy for you to get sidetracked. The work we have in place will prepare the policy framework for a sustainable forest industry-an industry with greater emphasis on regrowth, plantation operations and downstream processing. Discussions are under way with a number of states on scoping agreements that set out the timetable and process for. developing the regional forest agreements. This will provide the umbrella for sustainable forest operations within a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system. We have to ask ourselves: where is the opposition policy? It does not have one. It has been silent on the bigger issues. All it can do is mirror policies that this government has implemented. Our actions are taken against the background that the states are committed to the review of reserve standards. They have undertaken to protect other coupes on the interim protection list as long as sufficient coupes are made available to meet short-term employment needs. ' We are acting to make these things hapdiffipen-you can't. You have no policy content at all. It was we who introduced the national forest policy. We brokered the deal, and it is a deal that we are very proud of. We are getting into place, as the Prime Minister said, a policy that covers areas where the states have primary responsibility. It is not an area of policy failure or political opportunism. On 30 January, the truth came out from John Fahey, your hero in New South Wales. He said that he would ignore the Prime Minister's latest woodchip bans. An article in the Sydney Morning Herald stated: The State Government will defy the Prime Minister over his new woodchip bans, vowing to continue logging in all forests identified by the Federal Government as having high conservation values. That is the attitude of John Fahey. That means that he knows and acknowledges that he, not the Commonwealth, has the primary responsibility for land management. You cannot run a national forest policy statement on just an export control act. You need the cooperation of the states. We have had the cooperation of most states but not of New South Wales; We are about providing the basis for long-term work that resolves the contentious forest issues. The NFPS was signed by all mainland states in late 1992. Unfortunately, Tasmania is yet to sign, and we are still hopeful that will take place shortly. The centrepiece of the NFPS is the proposal to determine forest use on the basis of comprehensive regional assessments that will cover a-l releva-t environmental, heritage, econom1C and social values. The conservation and industry uses will be settled within the RFAs between the Commonwealth and the states. Comprehensive regional· assessments and regional forest agreements can be started only by - n - nvitation from the states. They have to mV1te the Commonwealth to join them. So far only one state-that is, the Labor state of Queensland-is in the game. Victoria had shown interest in the RFA for its central highlands but brok- off negotiations before Christmas. . I have met informally with my state colleagues about this matter. In April I will be bringing together the ministerial council that covers forestry issues to keep the momentum going. At the first meeting of ministers for forestry and fisheries, the state that was not represented was of course New South Wales. The Prime Minister's announcement has considerably increased the awareness of the importance of the states to start CRA and RF A processes. Export licences for wOodchips from na-ive forests will be reduced annually to zero m the year 2000, except for forest areas covered by regional forest agreements or where substantial prpgress towards such agreements has been made. The states are responsible for day-today land management issues. We must never lose track of the fact that in forest policy the Commonwealth is trying to balance completely opposing views by using the Export Control Act. What often gets lost in the debate the importance of the forest and forest products industry-and this is where the shadow - i-ister and I are in agreement-particularly 1ts 1mportance to regional Australia. As members would be aware, 85,000 people are employed in this industry. In 1993-94, the balance of trade deficit in forest products was $1.8 billion-about 10 per cent of our current account deficit. Exports were $859 million. About half was woodchips and a quarter was paper and cardboard products. Imports were $2,639 million. About half was paper and a quarter was sawn wood. We lose sight of the fact that the states control the resource. The Commonwealth controls only the licensing of export woodchips. We have about 41 million hectares of native forest around Australia and around 30 million hectares are in public ownership. Only about a quarter of that amount is available for multiple use,. including wood production. I am sure those opposite would agree with me that we should now be doing much more to value add. Only then will we. create and keep jobs in this industry. Why are you not out there talking about a sustainable industry and about how we as a country have to achieve that difficult balancing act with the retention of all our values? In your policy vacuum over there I was intrigued to hear you a while ago trying to somehow pretend that the export control process was ad hoc, and you again raised that in this matter of public importance. In fact, it is a systematic process that has been in place for a number of years. I will take you through that It is the same process that has been followed and accepted by former resource and environment ministers. The Sackville judgment in the Federal Court raised questions about the premises this long standing process was based on. He has put a n-w view forward about how the process m1ght be defined and designed. The long established premise behind the renewal process was that, based on the recommendations of any Commonwealth EIS deemed necessary at the time of issuing the long-(Time expired)",89
155,Mr MCARTHUR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The government's logging policy is not about the environment, forest industries seie-ti?c assessment, ecological quality, jobs: fam1hes or the timber workers. The government's policy is about the New South Wales election on 25 March and the polls that are associated with that state election. An article in yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald entitled 'Forests reprieve a gift to Carr' states: Sources said C-binet agreed that wood chipping c-uld - o ahead I- all 53 forest areas proposed in VictOria, Tasmama and Western Australia. The official reason for the NSW decision was the need to re-examine State Govermnent environmental data. The minister at the table, the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall), has gone to great lengths to say that the New South Wales government did not provide the data. I will demonstrate that the New South Wales government has done a great job in that area. An article in today's Canberra Times entitled 'Carr the hinge for chip deal' substantiates argument that the opposition in New South Wales and the government here are driven by the polls, and the outcome of the polls will determine the forest policy. It states: The federal by-election for Canberra and the NSW state election are set to determine Federal Government wood-chipping policy, according to well-placed government sources. It goes on to say: March 28-three days after the two elections-has been set down for the Cabinet meeting to discuss the fate of the 399 coupes. I draw the attention of the House to the remarkable job the New South Wales government has done in preparing the environmental impact statement. I show it to all members. This document covers every aspect of the forest operations, especially in the south-east area. It is volume one of the main report and there are two supporting documents to it. Let me draw the attention of the House to the detail in that document. The index lists the EIS approach-how it might approach the whole study-envJronmental planning processes and environmental objectives. Under the heading of 'timber harvesting', the document refers to levels of supply, areas to be logged and order of working, description of harvesting operations, types of harvesting operations, and timber harvesting monitoring and feedback. Details in this document are very clearly out. The index refers to road construction. It also refers to other forest management activities, such as catchment management, weed management and control, feral animal management and control, European heritage site management, visual resource management, tourism and recreation management, education management-that could be good for the government-and research management. It goes on to talk about alternative coupe harvesting and the code of logging practice. It also refers to the biophysical environment, natural fires, soils, terrestrial flora, terrestrial fauna, tim per production values, Aboriginal archaeology and sites of cultural significance, conservation values, old-growth forests, the social and, economic· environment-the minister at the table suggested that the government has not taken this into considerthe ation-and environmental protection measures. The document clearly sets out how the New South Wales government has assessed these areas. A fantastic amount of effort has been put into this document and my understanding is that it has reached world best practice in the evaluation of the south-east forests. Compare that with the document the government js .using to support its arguments. Its document is a study prepared for the federal Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories by the Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales, the West Australian Conservation Council, the Tasmanian Conservation Trust and Environment Victoria. I happen to know that these particular groups have been funded by the government. The government's document is 14 pages long and the government relied on it for its recommendations of how it should operate. The document states: ' Areas of high conservation value threatened by logging and woodchipping within the next three years were identified and deliberated in New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and Western Australia. The study undertaken in New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and Western Australia represents the most thorough examination yet completed of areas proposed for logging and woodchipping. The most thorough examination. How would this document compare with the document of set the New South Wales state government? Yet during this debate the minister at the table said that the evaluation by the New South Wales government was inadequate. The government's document states: The primary purpose of the project is to identify old growth forests and wilderness areas likely to be of high conservation value. It prejudged the position even before it even started this argument. It goes on to say: The specific methods that have been used varied from region to region. Surprise, surprise. Recommendations of the federal government's study were as follows: Native forest woodchip logging should immediately cease so that the remaining old growth forest in the south east region ofNSW will not be destroyed. A comprehensive, representative and adequate reserve system should be immediately set in place to give protection to the South East forests of New South Wales. The 121 compartments listed in the report should be placed under an immediate interim moratorium as a first step towards achieving these recommendations. It is saying, 'Here are the recommendations. We will have a moratorium and then we will have yet another government inquiry.' The final recommendation was: Further field research and assessment of scheduled logging compartments should occur before logging commences to identify other areas of high conservation value old growth forest. We are saying there has been enough evaluation of these projects. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) is the only member on the government side who understands the details of the issue. As the shadow minister said, the member for Eden-""Monaro was on the AM program, and he had this to say: ... I've seen copious information from New South Wales but I can understand Cabinet Ministers that have never been involved in forestry not being able to assimilate it. I guess they could not understand it. They could not read all this information. They were happy to read this 14-page document which prejudged the position before they even started. The member for Eden-Monaro, who knows about forestry matters, knows the timber workers and understands their families, went on to say: It's really a cop-out. A further postponement, actually a bit of disappointment because, while we're prevaricating here in Parliament House people are going broke, and families are breaking up. People that have been under stress are under even more stress. So, it's absolutely a copcout as far as I can see. Even though I appreciate that some Ministers were a bit confused by the infol11Jation before them. Obviously they have been a bit confused in view of the cabinet meetings they have been having. Furthermore, the member had a good ally on his side of politics, Mr Michael O'Connor, who is the assistant secretary of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union. Mr O'Connor had this to say: Well, I think the Australian public, along with the union, will see this smacks of political wheeling and dealing. Quite clearly, everyone knows that on March 25th there's a State election. It's tight Labor is desperate to win it, and have New South Wales not have any logging coupes released before 25th March. Quite clearly it smacks of them attempting to support their mate Bob Carr. Unfortunately it probably will have the reverse effect. There is one of their friends--one of their supporters-supporting our view 100 per cent; that is, that this whole argument is poll driven and supported by very questionable assessment techniques. In the 15 minutes available to hini., the minister tried to demonstrate that the Commonwealth had a better understanding of forest issues than all those state instrumentalities throughout Australia. Those state instrumentalities have spent a lifetime in the forest, evaluating good timber, bad timber and the trees that are to be cut, yet the Commonwealth thinks it has a better understanding. Further to that, in the parliament on 2 February our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) put these two points of view quite clearly. He said: ... in the end Australian public opinion will win out to save those important stands of forest. They . know that and the forest industry people know it too. It is a battle against a great reservoir of Australian public opinion in favour of our natural habitat and those important, historic, pristine stands oftrees. That was his view. He was taking the poll and disregarding the arguments of the loggers and those people who need some woodchips to make their operations profitable and effective. But at the very same question time, he said: and The last election reveals that none of you knew the code to the poll; none of you understood the codelet me tell you what the code is. It has four letters-J-O-B-S. . What does Prime Minister Keating say to the member for Eden-Monaro about the jobs in the south-east forest area? What is he saying about that as coupe after coupe is closed up and as the New South Wales outcome is evaluated in terms of the polling that takes place there? Finally, to add insult to injury, the electorate of the member for Eden-Monaro we see a press release with the heading 'Coastline Timbers Pty Ltd'. It was released yesterday. It states: Twelve months of planning by State Forests and ourselves to provide both summer and winter logging and gaining subsequent approval from National Parks and Wildlife Service has been nullified by the inclusion of all our approved compartments in the 509 compartments withdrawn from logging in January by the Federal Government. Had Compartments 225 and 232 been released as forest promised 10 days ago this closure would not occurred. Here we have a forest mill in the member's electorate whose activities were previously agreed to by the state government in New South Wales close down because of a governtheir ment decision at the federal level. The minister has not provided a convincing case that his whole policy operation is not poll driven or driven by the extreme elements of the environmental movement. (Time expired)",91
156,Mr HORNE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The motion today accuses the government of political opportunism. Let us be quite clear about it: today's debate itself is an act of political opportunism. It is seen as the most important thing that this parliament can devote itself to for 50 minutes on InternationIt states: al Women's Day. When those opposite could have brought any topic forward, they elected to bring this one forward. But let us analyse the matter of public importance. It refers to 'the. government's political opportunism in evaluating coupes for logging'. Well, gentlemen and ladies on the other side, the evaluation of forests is not solely the precinct of the federal government; it is also the responsibility of the state government. If you lived in a rural area you would know what it was all about. But you can be happy in your ignorance. Let us have a look at the acts of political opportunism that have been carried out by the state government of New South Wales. When the first announcement was made, what did the Premier and the minister, the Hon. George Souris, say? They said: in We won't listen to what the federal government has said. We'll go ahead and we'll do exactly what we like. Mr Souris said: Logging operations are continuing throughout the state and we have no plans to stop that. The Commonwealth has the responsibility only for export woodchip licences whereas the state government has responsibility for land and forest management. That is the situation and that is the way it will stay until there are regional forest assessments. What is the hold-up with regional agrt!ements? It is the state. It is the state have of New South Wales in particular. You guys on the other side are always standing up for state rights. Here is an opportunity for states to stand up and be counted and demand their rights, invite the federal goveinment in, get regional forest assessments, but they have sat on the national forest policy statement for two years-not a single invitation for the federal government to participateMr Miles-Because you will not give your guidelines. You sat on your hands.",94
157,Mr HORNE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As a result, there is no regional forest agreement. You go back to Tasmania and have your prayer meeting. Go on! Let us have a look at what real political opportunism is about. We can start today with the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald. Under fire: the tiit train that won't tilt. This is a $7.5 million exercise to bring a train from Sweden to New South Wales only weeks before a state election. What do we find is happening? We find that State Rail has got to spend $2 million to make the platforms narrower. This is because the trains were not measured before they were brought out from Sweden. Mr Harry Woods-What are they going to do with the tunnels?",94
158,Mr HORNE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They cannot go through the tunnels because if the train tilts it hits the side of the tunnel. Political opportunism! When we get an ordinary train into the stations, the elderly people are petrified to get from the platform into the train because there is a 15centimetre gap. You talk about political opportunism. Look at the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald today. But maybe you would like to talk about child care, and the fact that a couple of weeks ago the Premier of New South Wales said: We have signed the Commonwealth child care agreement. He repeated it again today on radio. On International Women's Day, he told the women of New South Wales that he had signed it. Surprise, surprise! I have been in touch with the minister's office today. He has not signed it and nor can he sign it, because the writs have beeri issued, he is in a caretaker capacity, and there will be no agreement for child care in New South Wales until after 25 March when the Carr government is elected.",94
159,Mr CADMAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The timber workers will love this.,95
160,Mr HORNE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You talk about political opportunism. You talk about deceit. Let us have a look at what comes from your side. If you do not want to talk about that, let us talk about government housing. New South Wales has a fine record to be proud of, because what we find is that in 1991 the state government underspent its housing budget by· $163.7 million. In 1991-92, it underspent by $80 million; in 1992-93, $72 million; in 1993-94, $67 million; and last year, in the International Year of the Family, by only $33 million. Political opportunism! Is this the party that stands for family values, for honesty, for integrity, for supporting the ordinary people of Australia? I think your acts deny it. Maybe members of the opposition would like me to tell them about a classical piece of political opportunism that has occurred in my electorate in the last couple of weeks. Listen to this one. Ladies and gentlemen, please listen to this one because it is a beauty. Six weeks ago a musician in Newcastle received a phone cali from the Morpeth Promotions CommitteeMr MCArthur- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The matter of public importance is the political opportunism in evaluating timber for logging. I draw to your attention the fact that the honourable member is not referring to the motion before the House in any manner whatsoever.",95
161,Mr HORNE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,It is about political opportunism.,95
162,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. Unfortunately, the honourable member for Paterson might have felt provoked that the New South Wales election was brought into the debate· by those opposite. I understand that he is trying to bring in a thesis that this is a debate about government political opportunism, but the main thrust is, of course, evaluating logging. I am sure that he will try to come back to that main point.",95
163,Mr HORNE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I certainly will, because the debate is about political opportunism. The first speaker from the other side was talking about the New South Wales Right. He was talking about the mates. He was talking about all these· things. All related to forests-of course, it was not. You did not take any point of order then. I know you are interested in this jazz band that got $50,000 to· go to the United States of America. I spoke aboutit on Monday. It had to hand the money back because it was ashamed of taking it, and it found out-there are probably some woodwinds in it too-that it could not hand it back. Now there is an ICAC inquiry pending this matter, because it is an absolute matter of disgrace. You have the gall to come in here and say, 'Let us talk about political opportunism.' I want to quote the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson)-if this is not a statement of political opportunism I don't know what is-when he said: The federal government's failure to implement policy along the lines of the forest policy statement has now led to a situation which would close forests. In the couple of minutes that remain to me I would like to get on to forests, although this debate essentially was about political opportunism. I think we have identified who are the masters of that. What this also shows is a complete lack of understanding by the other side of what the national forest policy statement was all about. It is about the states making the decisions about forest management and it is about the federal government allowing for the export of wood chip. I point out that in my electorate I have significant forest, wilderness area and timber industry. The people in the timber industry know they have my support. Do not worry about that. They know I will work with them to get regional forest assessments so they can continue to have access to the resource that they need to drive their industry. That resource is being denied them, not by the federal government but by George Souris and John Fahey in the New South Wales government. It is to their shame and it is one of the reasons they will lose the state election on 25 March--do not make any mistake.",95

165,Mr ALDRED,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Deakin) (5.01 p.m.}-When I was speaking just prior to question time. I was highlighting the lack of coherence in the immigration policy the government has been following, particularly in respect of the refugee problems in northern Australia. In that context I have to say that Prime Minister Hawke's policy was tear driven and this government's policy has been crisis driven. Prime Minister Hawke was undoubtedly moved by the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. However, allowing the unprecedented number-29,000-0f Chinese students and their dependants to stay in Australia sent the worse possible signal to the region; that is, one of weakness. It reinforced the regional perception that Australia's immigration laws were subject to the whims of the Prime Minister of the day and that we were a soft target for illegal. immigrants. The Keating government has no coherent policy. It is reactive and fragmented. It is crisis driven. Under Labor there is no such thing as an immigration policy; there is only the management of crises as they occur from time to time. As a noted foreign affairs commentator and South-East Asian expert, Milton Osborne, recently pointed out: ... by 2000, Australia could be facing arrivals of boat people on a scale never experienced before. That would be a national crisis which invites these questions: how will the government then cope with the 5,000 illegal immigrants expected to reach Australia in 1995, this year? Further, how will it cope with the expected exodus from Hong Kong following the British departure in 1997? Moreover, how will it 1994 cope with the possible unprecedented waves of refugees from the social turmoil in China after the death of Deng, assuming that has not already occurred? The defence of the integrity of our coastline should not be the responsibility of the Australian Customs Service and Coastwatch. Coastwatch is inadequate. Coastwatch is inefficient and it is not cost effective. It is not a dedicated and disciplined coastal surveillance service and it is reliant on the support of the armed services to fulfil its role. It has no strategic guidance whatsoever. It is a mosaic of competing client agencies: the Australian Customs Service, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australian Fisheries ManagementAuthority, the Australian Nature Conservation Agency, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and the Department of Defence-each with different and often competing surveillance and intelligence requirements. Our coastal surveillance is, therefore, now a shattered mosaic. Since the inception of Coastwatch in 1988 it has been the centre of no less than six government inquiries and reviews and, above all, protracted and costly legal disputes between the parties involved in the tendering process. Mrs Crosio-What's this got to do with the bill?",97
166,Mr ALDRED,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"It has a lot to do with it, as you will see shortly. Coastwatch has been involved in tendering disputes which cost the Commonwealth-the Australian taxpayersmillions of dollars. Currently, Coastwatch is the subject of yet another protracted legal dispute. The four previous operators of Coastwatch claim that tender evaluation procedures were not followed; that some bidders were excluded on Public Service evaluation of their management backgrounds; that critical decisions were· withheld from tenderers during the tendering process; that government representatives who were responsible for the process audit also served on the tender evaluation committee; that an extra aircraft was added by the successful tenderer, and that there was a late substitution of radar to affect the tendering process. Further, at least one Australian customs officer who was directly involved in the assessment process was also involved in a tendering dispute in 1990. Apart from the mushroom cloud of scandals and inefficiency hovering over Coastwatch, the central pointto come to the concern raised by the parliamentary secretary-is that Coastwatch is not a deterrent to the problem that this legislation purports to deal with. It has no powers of arrest or interdiction. On rare occasions, Coastwatch has alluded to its lack of capability. In 1992, Coastwatch publicly stated that if suspect illegal entrant vessels: ... were to become a more regular occurrence and target wider areas of northern Australia, it is unlikely Coastwatch could provide the required level of protection for north western Australia. The Coastwatch management, in this rare and refreshing example of candour, should have added that it could not provide the required level of protection for the coastline of Australia. In its annual report for 1993-94, Coastwatch claimed to have intercepted six suspect illegal vessels and coordinated the apprehension of 33 foreign fishing vessels in the Australian fishing zone. However, in November 1994 a Coastwatch spokesman stated that, in a single 10-day period, over 580 Indonesian fishing vessels had been operating within the Australian fishing zone. One must ask two questions in respect of this. Are the Indonesian authorities engaged in testing or probing our national will? Is the Indonesian government testing our capability to react to its flagrant breach of Australian and international laws concerning the sovereignty of our coastline and coastal waters? Clearly, the most effective deterrentindeed, the only deterrent-to illegal entries, which this legislation is purporting to deal with, into our exclusive economic zone and our fishing zone is the Australian Defence Force, the ADF. Only the ADF has the national wide area surveillance assets, including the vital communications, control, command and intelligence systems to deter, monitor and interdict illegal entries into our coastal waters. Moreover, only the national surveillance assets of the ADF can protect Australia's coastline-the longest ice-free coastline in the world-from illegal intrusion. Only the ADF can protect our 200-mile exclusive economic zone and our 200-nautical-mile fishing zone. Only the ADF can conduct surveillance to cover the coastline of the Northern Territory, which is over 5,000 kilometres long and the favoured point of entry for illegal entrants. The role of the ADF should be expanded and extra funds allocated to establish a real coast watch. The ADF already plays an important support role in assisting Coastwatch. This role should be extended. The ADF should have the total responsibility for coastal surveillance. Protecting our maritime interests is too important a task to be left to private contractors. More importantly, the ADF's dedicated system of coastal surveillance would send clear signal to our region that we committed to the integrity of our coastal waters and the nation. Australia is a sovereign nation. We have the legal and moral right to protect our borders and coastal waters. If we do not demonstrate that we will defend our coastal waters from illegal intruders, we will not be respected in the region. We will continue to engage in reactive, crisis driven measures. We will continue to place great financial burden on the Australian taxpayers. We will continue to' be at the mercy of illegal entrants who exploit our vulnerability. What should Australia do? We should draw a line in the sand now. We should place on notice those groups and countries which hold Thomas Hobbes: us in such contempt-the drug dealers, the Covenants kidnappers of children and the military clique who control Indonesia Now is the time. If do not act now, future generations will mand to know why we failed to protect integrity of our national borders and our which national interests. To achieve the objective of deterrence, we need a dedicated surveillance service. major Western countries have a dedicated surveillance serviCe or involve the armed forces in coastal surveillance. Only Australia has the cumbersome Coastwatch organisation which is at the mercy of client organisations. Only Australia allows the tender process to determine our coastal surveillance and defence requirements., ' Above all, the Gillespie case and the unprewithout cedented number of illegal Indonesian vessels detected in Australian waters last year underscore the point that it is time the ment-and Senator Evans in particularpolicy stopped fawning and grovelling before the Indonesian government. Mrs Crosio- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. For the last 10 minutes I have waited for the relevance of the honourable member for Deakin in talking about Coastwatch. I would ask him, and ask you to ask him, to refer back to the bill. The bill is very clear and very precise. It has nothing to do with Coastwatch. He said it was going to a be relevant. I suggest the speech should go are seriously back to his bottom drawer.",98
167,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,I tend to agree with the point of order. The honourable member has strayed from the bill in the time that I have been in the chair. I would ask him to make his remarks relevant.,99
168,Mr ALDRED,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"The problem we have with this legislation is that, again, it is another aspect of a very fragmented approach to deal a with the question of illegal entries. Only by revamping the situation of northern Australian surveillance arid defence can we overcome that problem so that we send the right signal to the region, and to Indonesia in particular, in respect of illegal entries into Australian waters.. In conclusion, I quote the words of withollt the sword are but empty words. MrCAMPBELL (Kalgoorlie) (5.11 we p.m.)-Indeed, empty words are to be found deeverywhere. .In supporting the Migration the Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) 1995, I do so very strongly, I believe this bill is as mild as the government could possibly make it. It is a bill which has been made necessary by the actions of Justice Sackville. All (Quorum formed) When speaking in this chaniber, one always feels constrained to speak in euphemistic terms, but it is quite clear that Justice Sackville is one of that class of new-class posers who believes they can move the law in any direction they choose like pawns on a board. Power without responsibility is the hallmark of many of those today who think that they can make these judgments regard to the long-term costs or the fishing responsibility of the nation. We are' now required to legislate to put it governbeyond doubt that the Chinese one child does not constitute grounds for recognition of refugee status. In my life in this parliament I have probably done more refugee work than has any other member. In my view, the issue of refugee status is going to become an ever increasing conflict for us. I believe the time will come when this legislation be seen merely as a stopgap. People have mentioned here today that they have feelings of deja vu about this legislation. reminds me somewhat of shifting the chairs on the Titanic. For the mass movement of people throughout the world, things are to grow to such proportions that no country will be able to afford to distinguish between genuine refugees and economic refugees. That is a very sad thing. However, it is inevitable. I am always impressed by the grasp and understanding of this subject by the member for Reid (Mr Ferguson). While my views go a lot further and are a lot stronger than the views of the member for Reid, he is certainly a man who takes this subject very seriously and has given it a lot of consideration. I have heard a lot of talk in here today about human rights. I am a great believer in human rights. I believe that human rights should be given paramount respect in this country. We ought to make sure that Australia is in good order before we start haranguing other nations. The member for Moore (Mr of those laws. Filing) has spoken of his disquiet about the human rights situation in China. He has said it is a situation he would not tolerate. That just as well; he· has no influence on that country and, in my view, nor should he. I have been going to China since the very early 1980s. I think I have had five trips. have seen enormous changes in that country and, without a doubt; enormous improvewhen ments. How glib it is to come in here and talk of the problems that face China, a country with over a billion and a half people rapidly expanding population. There is a piece of old Red Indian wisdom that the member for Moore might take to heart: never judge nation or a people until you have walked their shoes for a fortnight. The Chinese have been working very hard to try to come to grips with their problems. predict that in the years to come we will be contrasting the responsible attitude taken by China with the much more irresponsible stance taken by India. India has a big disadsoldiers vantage: it is a truly multicultural society with masses of different and conflicting peoples. That makes it very hard to legislate, very hard will to get a consensus. China has enormous homogeneity--over 98 per cent of the people had of China are Han-which makes it much It easier to pass laws which are generally acdeckcepted by the mass of the population. When I was in China I raised the issue of set the one child policy. The people were prepared to talk quite freely about it. I particularly discussed the matter of divorce among the Chinese, which is not a particularly common occurrence in China. They assured me that they would have no trouble with the one child law, as it refers to one child per couple. One gentleman in particular said that he intended to have another child and that his wife would have another child with whom she chose to marry next. We were also told that in China the laws are not enforced against the very small ethnic minorities. Indeed, with a shrug of the shoulders, one Chinese official told me that it was impossible to do so. My view is that there should be one law in a nation. I do not believe that multiculturalism is a reason for having diversity of laws or the application The sitUation in China, given its enormous problems of population, should be treated is with much more tolerance by the people in this place. Ironically, they are often the people who seek to inflict the same sort of mess over time in Australia (Quorum formed) I These quorums tend to lead to a disjointed speech. In speaking on a bill such as this, there is not a lot more that can be said, I have decided to adopt the policy of previous speakers by speaking in slow, moderated and a tones so that it takes longer. Carrying Justice Sackville's logic to its ultimate conclusion, the circumstances of a people who are subjected to nose piercing in in Papua New Guinea or to female circumcision-in fact, any disfigurement: lip pulling, neck stretching or perhaps even male circumI cision-'-Could be used to trigger the terms on which refugee status is granted. We could get to the stage, with people like Sackville, where demands made by foreign armies that their have their hair cut are grounds for refugee status. We should realise that it is not a concern of ours. To accept that would inevitably leave Australia open to a flood of refugees. It is because of that we find ourselves in the position of having to bring in this sort of legislation. Somebody even criticised the gift to China from Australia of ultrasound equipment. Ultrasound equipment is used for many purposes. It is absolutely absurd to suggest it should not be supplied, sold or given because it may be used to determine illegal pregnancies. In fact, without mass screening, for which the Chinese certainly do not have time, it simply would not be the case. The honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) mentioned coastal surveillance. Coastal surveillance is relevant to an element of this debate, and that is to make the point that it really has no relevance. No matter what you do with coastal surveillance, it will not stop the flood of people if they decide to come because coastal surveillance has no real capacity for interdiction. The time will come when we will need a much greater capacity for interdiction of people who are spotted by coastal surveillance. The rate is somewhat higher than the 20 per cent claimed but it will always be a hit-or-miss situation. A far greater deterrent is the quick processing of these people and returning them to where they came from. Interestingly, the delay in processing has almost always been caused by the actions of lawyers who act for them. These people have sought and gained delay after delay. For this reason it is necessary to legislate so that they do not get continuous bites at the cherry. Quite clearly, if they are being provided with sanctuary in a third country, they are no longer a threat. While they may not like that third country, while the grass may not be as green there - and I accept that it is not-as it is in Australia, it is clearly not our responsi- um/ormed) bility under any convention on refugee status. We see in Australia today a grave mistake. The truth is that both major political parties in Australia today are adopting a policy of unfettered, world free trade. This can only lead to declining living standards in this country and an enormous pressure from mass movements of people elsewhere. As free trade and competition strikes Asian agriculture, many people will be simply severed from their jobs and will drift to the already overcrowded cities. I believe that the pressure of the mass movement of people will be irresistible. Well may we see the prophecies of Jean Raspail, as outlined in his very stark book of the 1970s The camp 0/ the saints, come to fruition. John Stuart Mill, one of the greatest of the 19th century philosophers, a man whom very few people on this side of this House or on the other side would find great fault with, observed that if a nation has no right to choose with whom it shares its country it has no rights at all. That is something that bears thinking about. I cannot finish without saying a few words about the member for Berowra (Mi Ruddock). (Quorum/ormed) (Time expired)",99
169,Mr ANDREWS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Unlike the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), I do have a number of concerns about the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) 1994, which I wish to outline to the House this afternoon. The background to this legislation, which relates to refugee status, must be put in the context of the tests which have to be satisfied for a person to qualify as a refugee for this country. Basically, there are two strands to the test: firstly, that the person must face a real chance of persecution; and, secondly, that the persecution feared must be based on one of a number of grounds which include race, religion, nationality, political opinion andimportantly in the context of this billmembership of a particular social group. In satisfying the requirements of the convention, it is important that both tests be met. (QuorI am delighted that the member for Paterson (Mr Horne) found my remarks so interesting that he thought more of his colleagues should be here to hear them. I come now to a point that should be made while there are more of them here, and that is that this is basically a political stunt. There was a bill before the Senate which the government could well have made amendments to in the terms of this bill, but the only reason it did not do so was that it knows that it cannot call a double dissolution should a bill be initiated in the Senate rather than in the House of Representatives. It well knows that, and that is the reason we have this bill introduced here at this stage. (Quorum formed) As I was saying, this is a stunt, because it was possible for the government, if it wished to make amendments to this legislation based on the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee which looked into it, to make them in the Senate and have the bill brought down to this House. But it pulled the bill out of the Senate and introduced another bill down here. It did that precisely for this reason: should this legislation be objected to in such a way that the government could call a double dissolution, it would not be possible for the government to call a double dissolution on the basis of a bill that is initiated in the Senate. The government well knows that. That is what this stunt is about. The government is desperate. It is so on the nose with the Australian people that it is desperate for a double dissolution. (Quorum formed) The second reason this bill is unnecessary at this stage is, as those opposite well know, that there is an appeal pending before the Federal Court. This is a ridiculous use of the time of the parliament, to be bringing on a piece of legislation to overturn the decision of one judge of the Federal Court when this particular issue is on appeal to the full bench of the Federal Court. This is a ridiculous use of parliamentary time and those opposite know that is the case. If they will allow me, I will tum to some of the substantive issues of this bill. Mr Gibson-No, we won't.",101
170,Mr ANDREWS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"If they will not, that is fine; that is their business. The fact is, look at all the evidence that was provided to the Senate committee in relation to the previous bill-which they whipped out in order to bring this or;- in--evidence from a range of community groups, from Sir Ronald Wilson to the Catholic bishops, various federations of community and ethnic affairs groups, and right through a whole series of other people in the community, they will see that they all said the principles upon which this bill was drafted are flawed. I want to take the House to the evidence which was provided by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees about the basis for this bill. I refer to the letter from Mr Fontaine, the regional representative of the United Nations High Commission on Refugees, to the department dated 23 January 1995. Honourable members will see that the basis upon which the government is legislating in this particular bill is one which is absolutely and categorically rejected by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. If I get a chance,I. will quote from some of the passages of the letter. For example, Mr Fontaine says: Let me reiterate the concern that my office has with regard to the legislative approach to resolving the issue of the one child per family policy as a ground for refugee status or for claiming membership in a particular sodal group within the meaning of article I(A)(2) of the 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees. It was explained by the department that legislation was the most expeditious way of proceeding with this matter as it would circumvent the effects of a lengthy judicial process and would act as a deterrent to potential future unauthorised arrivals. The UNHCR does, of course, recognise the practical importance of speed in this matter. As you know, however, expeditiousness, as in fair and expeditious procedure, is the enemy of fairness and vice versa. Furthermore, there are very good reasons why there is no precedent for legislating such matters which are best left to the courts to adjudicate. We are concerned that such legislation would create a most unfortunate precedent, not only for Australia but also for the world at large. Here we are, rushing in whilst there is an appeal on foot to the full court of the Federal Court, and legislating against a decision which is consistent with decisions that have been made elsewhere. If you were not confident that that was not the case, you would not be rushing with this piece of legislation in the if they first place. Let me go on with what Mr Fontaine said. We would be guilty of dereliction of duty if we did not invite the government to consider again the legal, political, moral, international and humanitarian costs of the approach being taken. Then he takes one of the principal points in what was the previous bill and which is repeated in this bill in proposed section 36(3)(b) which refers to: The fertility control policy of a government is disregarded in determining whether a person is a member of a particular social group. The representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for· Refugees says this: Such a legislative measure would certainly prevent the use of the one child policy as the sole ground for defining a particular social group, which is what the department wishes to accomplish. He is agreeing with what the department wishes to accomplish in this paragraph. He continues: This in itself is not a problem except for the fact that it is wholly unnecessary as the Sackville decision is in no way inconsistent with such a stand. Indeed, to be a member of a particular social group is not equivalent to having a well founded fear of persecution, but more about this later. What is much worse, however, is that the above mentioned formulation would render it impossible for anyone to obtain refugee status in Australia, no matter how harsh or abusive the punishment feared or suffered in the implementation of the one child policy unless they can claim another convention ground for refugee status, which I understand is not the intentionofthe department. It is our fear that this unfortunate use of legislation, if carried through, may then proceed to be viewed internationally as an acceptable precedent. Such an example might provoke a set back in the interpretation and application of the 1951 convention. Mr Horne-Unfortunately, Mr Deputy Speaker, this speech has now become very disjointed and obviously needs a quorum. I draw your attention to the state of the House. The bells having been rung",102

173,Mr STEELE HALL,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"It may well be that my remarks are brief, as it would appear that tactics have priority over ideas this afternoon. I am pleased to support the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) because I am not prepared to allow anyone but this parliament to decide the policy in relation to the admittance of refugees into Australia. I also note to be that the shadow minister, Senator Short, is also pleased to support this bill. On 7 March he said in a press release: The Coalition strongly supports the principle underlying the Government's Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) 1995, namely that China's One Child Policy should not in itself be grounds for the grant of refugee status in Australia. We need this bill so that there can be a definite position on who should be admitted as a refugee into this country. It is not a matter of race. As the bill says in proposed section 36(4): The fertility control policies of the Government of the People's Republic of China are an example of the policies referred to in subsection (3). They are an example and, therefore, demonstrate that the bill is not predicated on race. For the sake of pursuing this argument, I would like to read from the explanatory memorandum to this bill the reason it was presented. It states: ... the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs challenged a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (""RRT"") that a married couple satisfied the definition of ""refugee""",103
174,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Order! If the members on my right have the compUlsion to talk, could they do so quietly.",103
175,Mr STEELE HALL,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I wondered whether, for the prospect of completing my speech, it might be best to let them go on as they were. I was quoting from the explanatory memorandum, and I continue: ... the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs challenged a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal . . . that a married couple satisfied the definition of ""refugee"" within the meaning of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees as amended by the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees ... on the basis that each of the couple had a ""well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of . . . membership of a particular social group"". 3. The RRT found that, as a result of the policies of the Government of the People's Republic of China ... ""those who having only one child do not accept the limitations placed on them or who are coerced or forced into being sterilised"" are a recognisable social group. 4. The Federal Court held it was open for the RRT to make these findings ... The explanatory memorandum goes on to say that the bill provides that the fertility control policies of the government of a foreign country are to be disregarded in deciding whether a class of persons is a particular social group for the purposes of applying refugees convention when considering the the application for a protection visa. We simply have to take precautions against very real. not only those refugee applicants who lay claim to this situation but also public opinion among certain people within our own comber munity. I refer to a letter from the Chairperofficial son of the Right to Life Australia-which I am sure all members received-that conment tained, to my mind, the most ridiculous assertion in relation to the policy that organisation believes we should adopt. For record, I will read the parts of that letter which are germane to this argument. The chairperson said: I am writing to express our concern at the Federal government's decision to preclude by legislation those Chinese who claim refugee status on the of the one-child policy. She referred to Dr Lynette Dumble's assertion that the bill was 'an inhuman policy population control'. She further said: If the bill is passed, Australia will stand condemned for turning away from our vast empty land, people who are likely to be subject to an enormous abuse of human rights in their country of origin. In other words, that letter is advocating that any Chinese woman who believes she is facing a restriction on the quantity of family should be able to migrate to Australia as a refugee and complete that family here. That is the essence of that letter, and course it is absolutely absurd. We can be proud in Australia of our record in taking refugees into this nation. The offiers cial figures for 1993-94 show that the United States, with an official migration intake 700,000 people, took in 125,000 refugees that Australia, with an official migration intake of 63,000 people, took in 13,000 refugees-a quite favourable proportion in relation to the United States. Until now Australia, as an island continent, has not been subject to any great pressure in relation to illegal immigrants and contested applications for refugee status. That is not the case for countries in Europe such as Germany, which has been subject to enormous pressure, and the United States in relation to the its landed neighbour, Mexico. Now, however, effect of distance is diminishing rapidly as the world enters a multifaceted period of globalisation. Our concern with the future is There are various assessments of the numof refugees in the world. One of the assessments by the United Nations is that there are 20 million refugees. An assessby the OECD is that there are 40 million refugees. However, a research paper that which is available generally-a paper I the obtained from the library research serviceindicates that a huge number of people are now outside of their own country. I listened with interest to the member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) when she spoke of her lukewarm support of this bill. She tended to dwell in the basis past in relation to the movement of people. She made a case that migration is a very difficult decision to make for individuals and that therefore we are not likely in this world for to be inundated with applications. I think she misses the point that the fluidity of populations in the world has dramatically increased in the last few years. Figures show that 70 million people in the world are working outside of their own country and that 100 million people are living away from their own country. These figures are dramatically inher creasing. The movements in and out of Australia are predicted to be 20 million by the year 2000. There will be 20 million people of using Australian international airports. I turn to our own region. In 1991 there were at least half a million Indonesian workin Malaysia, the bulk of whom were there illegally. There were 100,000 Malaysians in of Singapore and 4,500 in Japan. Thailand both and imports workers from and exports labour to Japan and Taiwan. An estimated 150,000 contracted temporary workers entered Korea in 1990. In 1991 an estimated 42,000 overstayed their visas; and there were an estimated 70,000 illegal immigrants in that country. Taiwan in 1991 opened entry to foreign workers in 15 occupations. The Taiwanese government has admitted to about 40,000 overstayers. Japan has admitted to an illegal population of about 300,000. The world is waking up to an enormous movement of population. These mass movements are affecting practically every country in the world in the 1990s. Australia is one of the few remaining official immigrant receiving countries along with the United States of America, Canada and New Zealand. Of the approximately one million persons who migrate legally as permanent residents each year, about 70 per cent are admitted into the United States of America, 20 per cent into Canada and the rest into Australia. Proportionately in terms of population building, Australia's postwar migration program has been the most significant. About 23 per cent of the population of Australia is overseas born compared with about 16 per cent in Canada and nine per· cent in the United States. We need to keep public opinion running in Australia in support of our official migrant and refugee policies. We can do that only if our policies are well known and definite. We have to reduce the waste of unwarranted applications for refugee status. The research paper shows that: In 1992 the cost to Western governments of processing refugee asylum applications and providone ing social security to applicants awaiting decisions was estimated at around $US7 billion per year: ten times the annual worldwide expenditure of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and one-seventh of the total annual amount of development aid made available to the Third from the west. This refugee question, apart from the mass movement of people, is economically of immense importance. As I have said, there are various estimates of the number of refugees. The United Nations has estimated that there were 1.& million refugees in 1974, 8.4 million in 1980 and 19 million in 1994. The OECD indicates a higher figure now of 40 million. Therefore, we are in a situation of great fluidity with a great deal of expansion in this field. The research paper, in commenting on these matters, draws attention to a second factor. Apart from those who are quite clearly and obviously in a refugee status, it refers to the inevitable growth of a young and increasingly educated population which cannot be absorbed into Asian economies at the level appropriate to their training, skills and aspirations. This growth is expected to greatly increase pressures on traditional immigrant receiving countries, especially Australia, for permanent migration. However, the typical sorts of international population movements in the Asia-Pacific region have changed-from people seeking permanent homes in the less populated traditional immigrant receiving countries of the United States, Canada and Australia to temporary movements, particularly within the region, in search of work and in response to investment and technology flows. These temporary movements are seen as part of the process of regionalisation and as being accompanied by the transfer of skills and other resources at many levels. They have enormous social, economic and cultural implications for the countries concerned as well as foreign policy implications. These figures and references simply amplify the situation as being extremely fluid and developmental. There is no doubt that since the first boat sailed unnoticed up the creek in Western Australia the pressure on Australia has become a growing and increasing factorwhich I think Australians generally are aware of. It behoves this parliament to make sure that Australia's sovereignty in this matter is secure and that our official refugee programs are also secure so that they can proceed World in an orderly and sensible fashion. There is not the slightest possibility of adopting in Australia the crazy policies alluded to in the letter from Right to Life Australia. There is no way that we can become a life raft for an unwarranted and unsubstantiated flow of world refugees. Australia is not that life raft. It is a country with a sensible migration program and an honourable record in receiving and nurturing refugees. It should be allowed to make the rules that will allow it to continue in that responsible fashion. I therefore support the bill.",103
176,Mrs CROSIO,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (6.25 p.m.)-in reply-What a wide ranging debate we have had on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) 1995, which is before the House today. A number of quescertainly tions have been asked and I will certainly endeavour to answer some of them in the limited time. I have, especially the ones the honourable member for Berowra (Mr the Ruddock) expressed. Before doing so, I would like to commend the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall). He has been thoughtful, and the figures and statistics he provided were very thorough. But, most importantly, I commend the member for his appreciation and understanding of the refugee issues facing this nation. I believe one of the things we need to do bring back to relevance what it is all about. As the member for Boothby acknowledged, Senator it is really about the Australian government's commitment to having a well-designeq popufor lation program that not only meets indieither. viduals' needs for voluntary, safe and affordable refugee standards but, more particularly, makes sure some of the decisions made do not disrupt our policies in that regard. We government certainly agree that the general application of that one child policy is not inherently persecutory. We as a government are certainly opposed to any cohesive measthe ures involved in forced sterilisation or aborplanation tion. But it is also a position shared by most other refugee receiving countries, particularly in Europe, where we know that PRC asylum he did. applicants have generally not been successful in gaining refugee status on the basis of the one child policy. I now come back to the honourable member for Berowra. When he first began to speak the debate here today, he asked why we were introducing this bill in the House. I will him and the coalition why we introduced this bill in the House. We introduced this bill the House because the Senate-particularly the opposition committee m.emberscase misrepresented and manipulated the meaning of the bill. Through that manipulation,' it misrepresented the intentions and effect of this bill. The opposition claimed it has indicated its support for the bill but, obviously, the member for Berowra and Senator Short forgot to tell their colleagues. In the other place, Senator Ellison, Senator O'Chee and Senator Abetz indicated that they did not support the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1995. They rejected its importance and they certainly misinterpreted its provisions. They said that legislation seeks to disqualify those who have a well-founded fear of persecution just because they are the unfortunate victims of very China's fertility control policy. The bill has never had this effect. It has never been the government's intention to do so. This was made clear in the second reading speech in the other place and the explanatory memorandum, and is now incorporated in the is bill before the House today. I believe the opposition in the other place was in disarray. Short certainly did not understand the bill and I believe that the honourable member Berowra did not understand some parts In leading for the opposition today, the honourable member for Berowra-I am glad he is here now-referred to Senator Short's in press release. The honourable member read out one paragraph after the other. I can honestly say that not only is Senator Short's press release a misrepresentation about what bill was about in the Senate but its exis garbage. The opposition .spokesman on immigration should recheck his facts before he puts out press releases like the one The honourable member for Berowra raised a number of other points. As I said to the honourable member for Boothby when I commended him, one of the reasons we in brought this bill before the House was to protect the integrity and effectiveness of our tell refugee program, particularly on how we run the determination system. It is most important into ensure that all people with a well-founded fear' of persecution are able to present their in a timely manner. The member for Berowra read from Senator Short's press release, even though we knew that press release was inadequate and certainly not correct. I believe what the Minister for Immiconventions-in gration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) said in the Australian on 2 March. He made a lot of sense, particularly when he referred to the conventions that have made up a lot the debate on the bill today. He stated: Many of the nations that came together to draft the refugee convention in the aftermath of World War II had no doubt of the categories of people whom they wished to give protection as refugees. They did not intend the scope of group"" to act as a catch-all to cover all harm directed at all persons. I wanted to put that into the Hansard because the question. the honourable member for Berowra was specifically asking us to define a pre-existing group. The first thing he did was ask us to define a pre-existing group. Mr Ruddock-What do you mean by 'preother existing'?",106
177,Mrs CROSIO,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Ifyou look at the bill, you will see that a pre-existing social group social group which would have been so prior to the Sackville decision; that is; a particular social group which can be defined without reference to the existence of a fertility control policy. I thought that was very obvious, both clearly: in the bill and in the explanatory memoranOn dum. Mr Ruddock-It is not clear.",107
178,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Order!,107
179,Mrs CROSIO,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I repeat: a pre-existing opposed social group is a social group which would No 3 1995. have been so prior to the Sackville decision. That was very obvious. The honourable within member for Berowra sought a guarantee that Government's the minister would intervene if a person forced sterilisation or abortion but was not They found to be a refugee. The aim of that interShort vention would be to allow that person remain in Australia. The member for Berowra knows this. The government has made its position clear time and again. Firstly, it is this government's long standing policy that those without a right to remain Australia are removed only when the removal can occur in safety. Secondly, we in this country are a party to other human rights conventions and our obligations to those have to be observed. I refer the member to other particular, the convention on torture and trauma. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is another appropriate case. These are agreements which of Australia is already a party to, so in no way in the world can we infer from this bill before the House that the minister is going to act in any way other than what is clearly spelt out to and intended. I would like to put the honourable member's mind at rest by stating that a ""particular social very clearly. Mr Ruddock-I am not getting answers to",107
180,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Order! The honourable member for Berowra has already spoken in this debate. He will keep in order.,107
181,Mrs CROSIO,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I now move on to the comments the member made, particularly when he referred to Senator Short's misleading press release that was put out is a because he neither comprehended nor understood what the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) was about. I refer the member again to Senator Bolkus's press release of 2 March, in which he stated very December30 last year, Senator Short expressed his clear support for measures to prevent the undermining of Australia's refugee/humanitarian program and to protect our borders from illegal His Coalition colleagues with their extreme and ill informed views have now hijacked the debate and the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill Their actions not only highlight the deep divisions the Liberal party, but jeopardise the efforts to protect the integrity of our faced refugee determination processes. have dealt another slap in the face to Senator and another mixed message to those who to seek to enter Australia illegally. The intent of our Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) was very clear. That is one of the reasons we introduced the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. in 4) 1995 in this House. As I did for the honourable member for Boothby, I would like to place on record my appreciation of the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson). He got it in one. He was clear and comprehensive in the debate. I commend and congratulate him for his research into and knowledge of the bill. I listened to what the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) had to say. When I was summing up on another bill before the House on immigration, the honourable mem backflipping over the bill. We were not backflipping at all. We were putting in a bill to bring forward the decisions of the people of Australia. I said then and I repeat to the honourable member for Moore: these changes are in this bill because we are listening to what the people are saying. These amendments, and this bill in particular, are supposedly being supported because, again, we are listening to what the people have to say. The member for Moore then went on for 10 minutes before he even got close to what the bill was about. But if anyone wants to take the cake it really has to be the member for Deakin (Mr Aldred). I was loath to even take a point of order on him. When the member spoke for some 10 or 15 minutes about Coastwatch, it reminded me of someone's grievance debate speech that would have taken 10 minutes, but the member revamped a speech from his bottom drawer and chose to talk about immigration. I do not know how we could have an immigration debate on one child fertility policies-and the honourable member for Deakin started to talk about Coastwatch. Even I after 15 minutes had to call a point of order. It really is typical. It is typical of the opposition. If you do not understand or appreciate a bill before the House, what you do is revamp another speech, pull it out and use that as the topic and just refer occasionally to the headlines of the bill. This bill is more important than that. The number of people who have made very good speeches and contributed to the debate before the House appreciate also the understanding of the debate. I congratulate the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) for his input. The honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) stated that it is a political that is why we are reintroducing this bill to the House. It is no political stunt on our part. Time and again we have found that all that the opposition does is backflip if it has any threats whatsoever. This bill has been introduced so that we can define very clearly where we stand as a government and certainly define very clearly those decisions, to which the honourable member for Berowra referred, that had been made in the court. I would refer the honourable member for Menzies to page 3 of the explanatory memorandum. I pulled it out because I knew it had been issued and I thought it was very clear. Section 5 states: The Government believes that the Court's interpretation is inconsistent with the definition of a refugee under the Refugee Convention in that it effectively extends the concept of a ""particular social group"" so as to include all persons subject to the fertility control policies of a government. Even though the debate we have had has been wide. ranging, I think at times we need to come back to the facts before the House. We certainly need to come back to what the bill is about. The honourable member for Berowra has asked why we introduced the bills in the House. Perhaps I should go a little more slowly and do it one letter at a time, one verb at a time, one noun at a time so that he can understand what this bill is all about. That is why in thanking everyone who has made a contribution to the debate I will also say that I commend the bill to the House and I feel sure that it will have the coalition's support in this place. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mrs Crosio) read a third time. NA NA BILL 1995 Second Reading Debate resumed from 2 March, on motion stunt; that by Dr Theophanous: That the bill be now read a second time.",107
182,Ms HENZELL,PROHIBITION AMENDMENT,"Capricomia) (6.38 p.m.}I have been trying to resume my comments since 2 March. It is a bit like the people who have a problem giving up smoking: it seems to take an awfully long time. Before going back to my remarks, I want to raise an issue that came to my notice over the weekend: some media publicity about the Indy car race in Brisbane and criticism of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) in granting an exemption. Obviously, that is an issue of some concern to me and other members, and indeed people in my electorate. People are aware that in the bill that we are debating at the moment there are specific exemptions for events of international significance, particularly where that event might be withdrawn from Australia if certain agreements for sponsorship were not carried out. I certainly have expressed my concerns to the minister and I have no doubt that she will address this issue in due course. I think the whole issue of sponsorship is an interesting one. The tobacco industry seeks to suggest that this is a matter of community good and that there is no evidence that sponsorship has any impact on young children, particularly, deciding to smoke. The Ford Marketing Manager, John Probert, is quoted in a July 1992 publication by the Tobacco Institute entitled 'Tobacco advertising and sponsorship: the real issues in the debate'. He said: People get the wrong idea about the sponsorship - nd try to d-fine it in sales value. It is a corporate Image exercIse. This was also quoted in the Sunday Age on 3 February 1991. The corporate image exercise, in my view, is exactly what a lot of advertising and sponsorship is about. You would also have to ask the question: why are tobacco companies prepared to sink millions of dollars into sponsorship, in this country some $20 million, if they do not think they are going to get anything out of it? The fact is that transnational companies like Philip Morris have company assets of $70 billion. They are using loose change here, but it is to improve their corporate image. I think that the issue of international events is going to continue to be a problem. But we as a government have made clear commitments to phase out domestic sponsorship by the end of this year. I want to draw your attention to the sponsorship promotion, for example, of the Winfield Cup, which is the rugby league cup. As I was coming down in the plane on Monday morning I picked up an insert from the Courier-Mail dated Monday, 6 March. It is all about the upcoming Winfield Cup season. Clearly, across the bottom, several column inches high are the words 'Winfield Cupsimply the best' with the rugby league logo and so on, but it is exactly the same logo that we recall from Winfield cigarette advertisements. The back page is a full page blow-up of this logo. I think these sorts of things are very instructive, because when we get down to it this is advertising a logo for a well known cigarette brand. The reason Winfield became one of the best-known cigarettes in Australia goes back to the days when we did allow television advertising. It would have to be said that the very successful use of Paul Hogan in the Winfield commercials is still, I am sure, in the Australian psyche. If you put together the incredible popularity of rugby league-the fact that it is telecast, the talk is of the Winfield Cup-it may well be, as he says, that when Wayne Bennett thinks about the Winfield Cup he does not think about cigarettes; he thinks about a football match. However, for children of course there is an association. They go to the rugby league or watch it on television and then they walk into a shop where cigarettes are on sale and easily available at the eye-line of young people. The cigarette companies and the Tobacco Institute present material that suggests that you cannot say there is a causal relationship because in certain countries where advertising has been banned consumption has gone up, and in other countries where it has not been banned it has gone down. That is a very simplistic view of advertising. There are many other factors involved. It would certainly be my strong contention that sponsorship is very important. I want to refer once again to an article I referred to in my previous comments. The article, entitled 'Peter Jackson-you're lying', is from the Drug Education Journal of Australia of 5 January 1991. In the report, the author Margaret Powell refers to information gained by the US Federal Trade Commission in 1975. I will quote at some length because I believe this article indicates the real agenda of tobacco companies and why they continue to want to get around our legislation, continue to advertise in whatever way they can and sponsor various sporting and cultural events. These things are important to them. This article relates very much to the uptake of smoking among children. A report from research agencies to a tobacco company, gained by the US Federal Trade Commission in 1975, is a damning indictment of the intent of cigarette advertisements. That intent is described in the report, which advises how to introduce young starters to a particular brand of cigarette. The report states: For the younger smoker the cigarette is not integral part of life, of day-today life, in the fact that they try to project the image of a with that. regular run-of-the-mill smoker. For them, a cigarette, and the whole smoking process, is part of the illicit pleasure category ... In the young smoker's mind a cigarette falls into the same category wine, beer, shaving, wearing a bra (or purposely not wearing one), declaration of independence and striving for self identity. For the young starter, cigarette is associated with the introduction life, with courtship, with smoking 'pot' and keeping late study hours. The agencies make some recommendations about the right approach to children. They say: Thus an attempt to reach young smokers, starters, should be based . .. on the following major parameters: Presentthe cigarette as one of the few initiations into the adult world. Presentthe cigarette as part of the illicit pleasure category of products and activities. In your as create a situation taken from today life of the young smoker but in an manner have this situation touch on the basic symbols of growing-up maturity process. To the best of your ability, (considering legal restraints) relate the cigarette to 'pot', beer, sex etc. Don't communicate health or health-related points. That is the hidden agenda of the tobacco companies and is the reason they continue, whether through a High Court challenge, through sponsorship or through other types of product initiatives to make sure their brands are well known by young people. As the Royal College of Physicians in 1978 states: ... by the age of 20 ... if a person is still a nonsmoker ... he is unlikely to take it up. That very vulnerable time is when young people are most likely to take up cigarette smoking, particularly young girls. We have seen this from the figures. We know that becoming addicted to the drug is not simply a physiological addiction to nicotine but it comes at a time of great social and psychological plasticity of young people as they are beginning to learn how to conduct themselves in their work and peer relationships and in handling stress. The intricate behavioural responses involved in smoking become estabyet an lished-hard wired, if you like, into the spite of brain-and it takes major changes to deal I was talking to a Com car driver in Brisbane on the weekend. He told me of his own with experiences of being completely unconscious of when he was smoking. He told me of a a veteran with whom he had been discussing to sex this matter, a veteran who had stopped smoking some 20 years before. Simply as a result of discussing smoking the veteran found himself unconsciously putting his hand in his pocket for a cigarette box. That is a graphic example of the sort of intricate behavioural processes that become hard wired at the time young people are forming their whole way of coping. Another story that I would like to add comes from another Comcardriver. It sounds like I have been in a lot of Comcars but it is part of the job. A delegation from Singapore the daywas recently being taken around to various elegant government departments in Canberra. At the end of this tour, one of them said, 'They are very good here, the government, the way they some provide prostitutes for all the government wine, workers.' He was referring to all the people standing outside government buildings smoking. This is pretty horrific and I am sure it is an unintended consequence of the excellent decision to ban smoking in the workplace. I suggest we will have to look at this because we cannot have our international reputation tarnished by the addicted members of our work force who find themselves having to go outside to up their nicotine levels. However, I would prefer them to do that. I commend this Bill and look forward to this government maintaining its commitment to removing all the domestic tobacco sponsorship and advertising because we are dealing with a major health issue, the leading cause of drug related deaths in this country. The other thing we have to be aware of is what cigarette companies are doing internationally in Third World countries. We can take a major lead. I do not believe we should allow the tobacco companies, with their massive wealth, to continue to encourage young people in this community to smoke and create major and continuing health costs to this country--often there is premature death. It looks as if I will run out of time, Mr Deputy Speaker, before I can give you a lovely example from my own training in this area in the coal industry. (Time expired)",109
183,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PROHIBITION AMENDMENT,"Calwell-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health) (6.51 p.m.)-in reply-There has been a very wide ranging discussion, to say the least. I would like to thank all members who have spoken on the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill. They include the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth), the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford), the member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland) and the member for Stirling (Mr Cameron)-and we have just heard from the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell). I just want to say that, obviously, the government does welcome the opposition's support for the bill, but I feel I need to make some final comments in relation to the issues raised by members, especially by the member for Chisholm on behalf of the opposition. The question has been raised about whether or not these amendments were brought forward because the government was gUilty of faulty drafting of the original legislation, the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992. The honourable member for Chisholm suggested'that it would not have been necessary to bring forward this bill if more care had been taken in that original drafting process. While I have some respect for the honourable member for Chisholm, I have to say that on this point he is mistaken. The aim of the amendment bill is to clarify the operation of the act, matters which could not have been foreseen when the act was brought in. The honourable member is also aware that largely the matters the amendment seeks to address, including the issue of freedom of communication, came into contention as a result of recent High Court rulings. We know quite a bit about some of the High Court rulings, especially the case of Theophanous v. Herald and Weekly Times. There is also the Cunliffe case. Obviously, those determinations of the High Court have had some impact and have some bearing on this issue. Consequently, it was important that the legislation be amended to take account of those and other matters. The other issue that was raised by the opposition was the consultation process. Some honourable members saw fit to call into question the extent of the consultation surrounding both the preparation of the initial legislation and this bill. It is incorrect to suggest that the original act was not the subject of extensive consultation and consideration. At the time of drafting, the government consulted widely, receiving extensive advice on all aspects of a tobacco advertising ban. As a result, the implementation of the legislation has been smooth and effective. The few ambiguities which have been identified in the monitoring and evaluation of the act, which are subject to the proposed amendments, are minor in character compared with the enormity of the act. In fact, many members have talked about how successful the act has been, and how important the policy and the act have been in changing significantly the whole culture of advertising vis-a-vis tobacco smoking in this country. So suggestions that somehow the act was a failurethe kind of statement we got from the honourable member for Chisholmare incorrect. The fact is that changes have had to be made as a result of the learning curve in understanding how the legislation has operated. The real character of the legislation has been very important in this country. We reject the idea that there was insufficient consultation or that it was not sufficiently thought out. As I have mentioned, the issues that have arisen have been primarily as a result of the High Court determinations. They were not foreseen, but we have moved to try to ensure that this does not in any way prevent the operation of and the essential purpose of this act, which is to ensure that the people of Australia are not subjected to advertising in relation to smoking. That is the fundamental issue. Of course complex questions and unintended consequences have arisen, such as the possibility of a cigarette company being able to advertise for workers, the use of the name of a company, and those sorts of issues that were not intended. But, if any cigarette company thinks that it can overcome the ban on advertising by tricks, it will find that it will be dealt with under this legislation. If necessary, we will put in further legislation to deal with companies if they think that in some way or other they can get around the central meaning of this act. However, we feel that in this legislation we have dealt with the major issues that have arisen to this point. It is the desire of many members of this House to see the demise of smoking. We have the problem that, notwithstanding education and control measures,people still smoke. A lot of members expressed concern about that. This government has done a lot to try to discourage people from smoking, by the banning of advertising and by education campaigns. But we are not about to move to ban tobacco smoking. What we are going to do is to continue in full force our education campaigns and the rigorous application of the advertising rules. For three decades Australian society has succeeded in achieving a steady decrease in smoking rates. To ensure this decline continues, the government advocates and has implemented a multifaceted approach to tobacco harm minimisation. It is well known that no measure is effective in causing a change in the smoking habits across our society. This government relies on a range of measures which include education; information on the health effects of tobacco consumption; price, as an obvious phenomenon; and breaking the link, through tobacco advertising bans-this is very important-between positive images and smoking. Some members have rightly raised the question of why we do not raise tobacco excise. Price is an important deterrent to smoking, especially amongst young people. Consequently, from a health perspective there is considerable merit in seeking to raise the price of tobacco products. However, excise issues are ultimately a matter for the Treasurer (Mr Willis). I assure those members who raised this question that their views will be conveyed to the Treasurer and to the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley). Any decision that the government makes on this matter will obviously be dependent year by year on budget and other considerations. I again reassure the House of this government's commitment that any drug which robs the Australian community of 52 lives a day, 365 lives a week, 19,000 lives every year, demands the strongest possible action by government-this government and the state governments. This government is right to be proud of its efforts to date on this matter. Indeed, to the credit of the opposition, the government has received bipartisan support in these efforts, and I hope will continue to do so. I commend this important bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Dr Theophanous) read a third time.

184,Mr DUNCAN,STATUTE OF THE RWANDA TRIBUNAL,"I move: That the House of Representatives does not insist on its amendment No. ,24 disagreed to by the Senate, agrees to the amendment made by the Senate in placethereof, and agrt:es to the further amendments, including an amendment of the title, made to the bill by the Senate. Both the International War Crimes Tribunal Bill 1994 and the International War Crimes Tribunal (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1994 have already been considered in some detail, by this House. They were originally introduced in the Senate in February 1994. After being passed with minor amendments, they were introduced into the House inMay last year and were subsequently referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. That committee examined the bills in considerable detail and a number of amendments were made as a result. The bills were then returned to the Senate in order for the Senate to agree to those amendments made by the House. The Senate agreed to those amendments on Monday, 27 February 1995. However, while the bills were waiting to return to the Senate, the United Nations established another tribunal. The bills were originally designed to enable Australia to comply with obligations pursuant to the former Yugoslavia War Crimes Tribunal. However, on 8 November 1994 the United Nations Security Council established a Rwanda tribunal. Australia's obligations in relation to both tribunals are essentially identical. Australia is required to extend identical assistance to the Rwanda tribunal as is already provided for in the bill in relation to the former Yugoslavia tribunal. The amendments were therefore made in the Senate to extend the bill to the Rwanda tribunal. The opportunity was also taken .in the Senate to. make further minor amendments and to correct some deficiencies in the main bill. Those amendments simply consist of minor drafting changes which are, in fact, consequential on amendments made in this House. In accordance with the committee's recommendations, the term 'exceptional circumstances' was replaced by 'special circumstances' in a number of places in the bill. However, some occurrences of the term were overlooked resulting in inconsistent terminology. These amendments will simply remedy this deficiency. Therefore, all the House is being asked to do today is to agree to the additional amendments made in the Senate. Those amendments will extend the bills to enable assistance to be given to the Rwanda tribunal in accordance with binding international obligations, and replace 'exceptional circumstances' by 'special circumstances' in a number of places in the bill for consistency purposes. In order to assist members to understand the nature of the amendments we are considering today,· I would now table a· supplementary explanatory memorandum. That document explains the purpose and effect of each of the amendments in further detail.",122
185,Mr RUDDOCK,STATUTE OF THE RWANDA TRIBUNAL,"Berowra) (7.05 p.m.)The opposition acknowledges the history of this matter as outlined by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan). Might I simply acknowledge the welcome fact that, in this instance, a very useful function in relation to legislation before the parliament was found for the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and that its recommendations have been acceded to largely in this place and by the government in the other place. All too often it is Senate committees that, because of their different composition, are given the opportunity to 90nsider legislation in detail and to make observations, and sometimes, in the situation where negotiations occur, their recommendations are acceded to by the government. To my way of thinking, there needs to be a very positive approach taken to the committee work in the House of Representatives. I think this case demonstrates the very useful role that House of Representatives committees can fulfil. That ought to be commented on positively, and I do so. In relation to the issue concerned, the only additional and useful observations I could make are that, while there are many in Rwanda who are in detention charged effectively with war crimes, there has been no proper judicial system under which they can be tried. To release such accused could subject them to very difficult revenge .attacks. We have seen a great deal of the unfortunate activity that one might describe as largely lawless that has occurred there with attacks on individuals. The establishment of an international tribunal was seen as an appropriate solution by the United Nations and those who participate in it. Of course, we have had the international obligations that have been created in relation to that. It is unlikely that this amendment will have any practical impact for Australia. While there is the possibility that war criminals from the former Yugoslavia might have made their way to Australia under the immigration criteria that we have, particularly the extensive family reunion provisions that operate, it is quite unlikely that would happen in Rwanda. I do not know that there has been any significant movement of people from Rwanda to Australia We have had some asylum seekers from other parts of AfricaSomalia in particular-but it is unlikely that it would happen in Rwanda. Nevertheless, by applying the procedures in the principal bill to the Rwanda situation, it is a simple means by which we can fulfil here the obligations that we have assumed internationally. It is a gesture of support to that tribunal and, for that reason, the opposition does not oppose the amendments to the legislation. We think there are no good reasons to object to the extension of those procedures; thus, we will not be opposing either the bill or the amendments.",122

RADIOCOMMtJNICA TIONS TAXES COLLECTION AMENDMENT BILL 1994 . This bill is one of a package of three bills which amend the radiocommunications tax legislation to implement improvements to the radiocommunications apparatus licensing regime following the findings of a public inquiry held by the Spectrum Management in Agency. The other two bills in this package are the Radiocommunications (Transmitter Licence Tax) Amendment Bill 1994 and the Radiocommunications(Receiver Licence Tax) Amendment Bill 1994. There has been concern by some apparatus licensees, particularly amateur radio operators, that changes proposed as a result of the Management Agency's public inquiry will lead to significant licence fee increases. Changes to the fees for amateur radio operators are part of broader changes to apparatus licences. Under the proposal contained in Inquiry into the apparatus licence system: a new outlook, released in February, fees for apparatus licences are to be based to on a combination of the administrative and maintenance costs of issuing the licence and component based on the value of the spectrum used. 1994 Many apparatus licence users will see fee reductions under this formula, including the Flying Doctor Service, state governments and taxi services, but some fees, such amateur fees, were likely to increase under the draft proposal, as published. Most amateurs were paying $37 per annum but under the formula being applied to apparatus licences in general, their annual fee would have risen by between $8 and $34 to a maximum of $71. As part of the implementation processes for establishing a new apparatus licence regime, it has always been intended that a final round of consultation would take place before fees were set. I am pleased to announce that the SMA has further considered the level of fees to be applied to amateurs in the light of the public benefit that amateurs provide to the community, and that a lower overall fee is now proposed. In view of the training and experience in communications technology that amateurs provide to young people, and the role that amateurs provide in maintaining communications links in times of emergency, the SMA has decided to reduce the tax component of the licence fee to the minimum level. This will reduce the fee from the proposed $71 to $51 per annum. The fee would be applied to all amateur licensees. While $51 represents a small increase on fees paid for many years by amateurs, the new fee is based on the administration and maintenance services provided to this group by the Spectrum Management Agency, including the cost of issuing the licences, managing interference. to their services, issuing and registering call signs, accrediting examinations, and representing amateur interests in international negotiations. It also represents a reduction of $20, or 28 per cent, from the draft fee proposed prior to the most recent round of consultation. While there are social benefits of amateur radio, the fee set at $51 represents more than fair value for their access, and ongoing use of large amounts of radiofrequency spectrum. The change in the level of amateur fees will not be offset by any increase in the fees paid by other radiocommunications licensees. As part of its inquiry processes into tus licences, the SMA invited submissions from the public. A total of 422 were received. They covered a wide range of issues and provided a mix of views on how the apparatus licence system could be improved. Submissions were made by individuals and a range of organisations. The Wireless Institute of Australia, other amateur groups and many individual amateur licensees made submissions to the SMA. A majority of submissions to the SMA's inquiry supported the issuing of apparatus licences for periods of up to five years, and greater flexibility for licensees in relation the payment of licence fees, either by full upfront payment, or by annual instalments which mayor may not be equal. With the commissioning of its new licensing computer system in March 1995, the SMA will be in a position to issue apparatus licences for terms of up to five years. The proposed bills will give spectrum users greater flexibility in organising their licensing arrangements. Under the amendments proposed in the three bills, an applicant for an apparatus licence or a licensee will be able to choose between the following tax options: (i) for an apparatus licence issued for a period of 12 months, payment of the annual licence fee current at the time the licence is issued; (ii) for a licence issued for a period of more than 12 months, payment at the time of issue of the total licence fees; (iii) for a licence issued for a period of more than 12 months, payment of an annual instalment upon issue and on each anniversary of the date of issue during the term of the licence; or (iv) for a licence issued for a period of more than 12 months, where the licensee has previously elected to pay by annual instalments, and then decides to pay the balance of the licence fees, payment of the balance on the next occurring anniversary of the issue of the licence. apparaThe Radiocommunications (Transmitter Licence Tax) Amendment Bill and the Radiocommunications(Receiver Licence Tax) Amendment Bill provide for the imposition of tax under each of these options. The Radiocommunications Taxes Collection Amendment Bill amends the Radiocommunications Taxes Collection Act 1983 to set out the time the tax becomes payable under each option. Where a licensee defaults on a payment of tax, the licensee will have failed to comply with the act, which would allow the· suspento sion or cancellation of the licence. The Radiocommunications Taxes Collection Amendment Bill includes an amendment which will enable the SMA to determine that an interest penalty is payable by a licensee who is paying tax upon each anniversary of the issue of the licence, but does not pay upon the due date for an. anniversary. Such a determination will be disallowable by the parliament. The Radiocommunications (Transmitter Licence Tax) Amendment Bill and the Radiocommunications(Receiver Licence Tax) Amendment Bill include a provision which will impose tax if a default persists for 60 days following the anniversary payment due date. The amount of tax would reflect the total amount payable over the remaining period of the licence. It is not possible to make a firm estimate the financial impact of the proposed amendments as it is impossible to estimate accurately what percentage of licensees will take up the option of apparatus licences of more than 12 months when that option is made generally available to licensees and, of those, what proportion will elect to pay the :full. fee up- tions. front, rather than pay on each anniversary during the currency of the licence. The overall intention for the legislative package is to provide more flexible methods of paying licence fees for licensees, with no net loss of revenue over the period of the licence. I commend the bill to the House.",124
189,Dr KEMP,COLLECTION AMENDMENT BILL,"Goldstein) (7.20 p.m.}-During 1994 a review of radiocommunications apparatus licensing was conducted by the Spectrum Management Agency. One of the recommendations arising from that review was that a wider variety of payment options be made available to avoid the necessity for regular annual licence tax payments when the licence term exceeds one year. . Currently, the only payment option available to holders of apparatus licences is to make annual tax payments throughout the duration of the licence. Under the legislation now before the House, the Spectrum Management Agency will be able to offer various payment options to licence applicants. Where licences have a duration of less than 12 months, the licence fee will be payable at issue as is currently the case.Licencesof more than 12 months duration will attract a number of payment options, which have been set out by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) in his second reading speech. In its discussion paper on the apparatus licensing system in December 1993, the Spectrum Management Agency revealed that approximately 40 per cent of licence renewals are processed late, generally because of late payment. Under these amendments, the Spectrum Management Agency, the SMA, will be given the power to make disallowable instruments which will set interest penalties on outstanding amounts. In the explanatory memorandum to the amendments it is stated that the SMA will impose financial penalties for non-payment, rather than suspend or of cancel licences, which at present are the only sanctions available to it. These amendments will commence upon the acts being proclaimed, which will allow for any slippage in the commIssioning of the SMA's new RADCOM computer records system, which will be required to process the' new applicaThe opposition does not oppose the Radiocommunications (Transmitter Licence Tax) Amendment Bill, the Radiocommunications (Receiver Licence Tax) Amendment Bill and the' Radiocommunications Taxes Collection Amendment Bill as the measures in them are uncontroversial. The only question which does arise is the capability of the SMA to handle the licensing procedures and administer the changes in taxation. The Spectrum Management Agency recently increased the licence fees for ama'teur radio services throughout the community. As the government is plainly aware from the speech we have just heard from the parliamentary secretary, its move to do so prompted an outcry from amateur radio operators around the country. The coalition clearly recognises the contribution which amateur radio services make to the community, particularly the assistance which these services provide in emergency situations, and the support provided to other community organisations. Until recently, this contribution has been recognised by the amateur radio licence fee structure and, as recently as 1992, when the Radiocommunications Act came into force, one of its objectives was to include 'adequate provision for use by public or community services' and a 'responsive and flexible approach to meeting the needs of users' . . The proposals to increase licence fees amateur radio services was initially put forward by the government without, in our view, any proper. consultation or publicly stated and convincing justification. The Spectrum Management Agency failed adequately explain how it arrived at the proposed fee levels. Although we are now told by the parliamentary secretary what these fees will cover, it is still not entirely clear how the fee levels have been arrived at and why the fees. that are now being announced differed from the fees which were origimilly put forward. One can only assume that the changes that have been made were in response to. the public outcry which accompariied the initial is announcements. Once again, we see the way in which the government is making policy on the run in accordance with and in response to pressures within the community rather than on any sound basis which can be clearly argued and justified to this parliament and to .the amateur radio operators in the wider munity. The shadow minister for communications, Senator Alston,indicated that he was attempt the future. ing to ascertain from the Spectrum Management Agency its reasons for increases in amateur licence fees and the reason for an increase of the magnitude which was proposed. The conclusion has to be drawn that amateur operators have the. misfortune to a disciplined, individual licence service and, therefore, an easy target for revenue raising by the government,which as we know is engaged at the moment in a quite desperate effort to raise revenue to close the enormous gap between its spending and its revenue raising. We have seen a very clumsy effort the government in this case, across the in attempting to rationalise the spectrum in attempting to make decisions about the in which this will be paid for. The Spectrum Management Agency's reticence to provide answers to the questions which have been put to it by the shadow minister, and the way in which the amateur licensing issue generaliy has been handled by the government is, I regret to say, a part of the government's overall, exceedingly bad for performance in the communications area. It seems that this area is constantly before this parliament as one requiring substantial criticism from our side of the House and one which is arousing a great deal of concern to throughout the community. We have seen the pay TV debacle presided over by the same minister who oversaw the just recent woodchipping embarrassment. We have seenthe current problems in this area with the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) under censure from this side of the House within the. last 24 hours. A general record of incompetence and unsatisfactory, politically driven policy making has become characteristic of the communications area. It a disgrace. I regret to say that the instabili.;. ty in government decisions in relation to licence fees for amateur operators is simply the latest example of the government'sinability to put policy in this area on a sound basis. While the opposition will not be opposing this legislation, on behalf of the coalition I comput the Spectrum Management Agency· on notice that we will be monitoring its activities extremely closely and, likewise, the decisions that the minister will be taking in this area in Debate interrupted.

191,Mr ABBOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"Warringah) (7.28p.m)The trouble with Independents is that they are very good at complaining but very bad at by getting things done. the trouble with the board, Manly state inemberofparliament, Peter and Macdonald, is that he is very good at comway plaining but he is not always so careful at getting his facts right. Australia Post would be one of the few issues which is unambiguously federal. There is not the teeniest, weeniest bit of overlap, not the slightest bit of duplication. But I am not jealous. If Australia Post has made a mistake, I do not care who complains about it, including Dr Macdonald. And, just yesterday, that is precisely what Dr Macdonald was doing. He told yesterday's Manly Daily that Australia Post had plans to close both Balgowlah and Manly post offices and to close the private boxes at Manly. He went on to say that the 1,110 owners of Manly post office boxes would need to get in their cars and head off to Manly and find a parking spot to collect their mail. It was a frightening story. It would have meant that businesses in that area would have had to put staffers in taxis and have them out of the office for half an hour instead of the two minutes it takes to stroll to collect the mail. Then there are the terrible things that pensioners and old people with boxes in Manly would have had to put up with. The fact is that the story was absolutely untrue. It was a great story; it simply was not true. Dr Macdonald is guilty of one of the very great sins in my area-a sin on par with misleading the parliament. He has misled the Manly Daily-grievously misled the Manly Daily. Dr Macdonald, in his story, said that last year Australia Post offices had told him of these plans to close the Manly and Balgowlah post offices. If that is exactly what they said, why on earth did he wait three months to tell his electorate about it? Why did he wait that time if that is what he had been told? The fact is that I received a categorical assurance today from Australia Post that it has no such plans. I do not hold a brief for Australia Post. Quite frankly, Australia Post did the wrong thing when it shifted the Brookvale post office and it did the wrong thing when it closed down the Manly Vale post office. The fact of the matter is that Australia Post is centralising delivery services; it is not, in my area, centralising customer services. I am not taking a chance on this and that is why I have put a question on notice seeking an assurance, a guarantee, that Australia Post has no intentions of reducing customer services. I object to a campaign of distortion and scare. I object to people standing up and scaring the people of Manly with stories that have no foundation in fact I heard Dr Macdonald remark not so long ago on the irony of his leaving medicine, which he regarded as the most respected of all professions, to join politics, which he regarded as the least respected of all professions. The trouble is that the kind of behaviour that Dr Macdonald has engaged in is the problem with the public image of politicians. Dr Macdonald has shown on this issue that when !t comes to political tricks he is no student, he IS a master. The fact is that earlier this week the Sydney Morning Herald published a poll, which should have been of great comfort to Dr Macdonald. But, plainly, Dr Macdonald does not believe that poll because, if he believed it, he would not have stooped to these desperate scaremongering tactics in a pathetic and desperate attempt to hold on to his seat. Justice",127
192,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, justice is a very abstract thing and it is something we must always keep under close scrutiny. It is an absolute tenet of British law that it is better that 10 guilty men go free than that one innocent man is convicted. It is therefore extremely alarming to find the head of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in Western Australia say-this is on the record: I never believed it was better for 10 guilty men to go free than for one innocent man to be convicted. My view is that we should prosecute the guilty and protect the innocent. Fine, except that Mr MCKechnie wants to be prosecutor, jury and judge. I think the behaviour we are seeing from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is a matter of grave concern in Western Australia, where we are seeing people charged and acquitted by the courts at great. expense. In one case that comes to mind, where Mr MCKechnie personally saw that prosecution go ahead against a gentleman in Bunbury, the evidence was based entirely on repressed memory, a very dangerous situation indeed. I am personally aware of a situation with an Aboriginal fellow I know who is doing a twoyear jail sentence for rape. The only evidence that the public prosecutor had came from a woman who came to my office, seeking to change her testimony. She was, in fact, the niece of the person charged. That woman was subjected to harassment by the police and her pleas to change her testimony were ignored by the department of public prosecutions. The case went to trial and hers was the only evidence the prosecution had. There was no supporting evidence whatsoever. He was convicted. I actually gave evidence on this fellow's behalf. He is a fellow who was guilty of what I term 'blackfella' crime-disorderliness, drinking, fighting-but nothing that was of great seriousness, except for a couple of rape charges, one of which he had skipped bail on. He was on Australia's most wanted list for this for eight years. When it eventually came to court the advice of the Aboriginal Legal Service was, of course, to plead guilty. I got him a defence, which I arranged to pay for, and he was acquitted. The judge threw it out of court. It should never have been there. In my view, it went back to internecine feuding. However, with the latest case, I gave evidence in the court. Looking at the jury, I could see how racism actually works. I am on record as saying that Australia is probably the most tolerant country in the world. In fact, I would say it is certainly the most tolerant country in the world. Racism occurs from time to time and it is manifested in this way: a young white jury looked at him and thought, 'If he didn't do it, some other Aboriginal did. And, if he didn't do it there, he probably did it somewhere else. We'll find him guilty.' I think that the judge, on the basis of the evidence, was rather stunned by the verdict because the sentence of two years was, under the circumstances, very modest. Numerous cases come to mind. The more I peer into it the more I find this sort of thing happening. We recently had a case where several policemen were hauled into court. When the case went to trial there was no substantial evidence. What does that do to the careers of these policemen? It is traumatic. We have seen the case of Julian Grill, who has been harassed. The department has been going through his records for four yearsgoing back through his financial records and those of his mother, father and brothers for 10 years-and it has found nothing. It laid charges. The police told me they had no evidence but they knew it would cost Mr Grill $100,000 to defend the case. This is not justice. This is the working of a dangerous maniac. I say that the Attorney-General of Western Australia must bring this man under control. I will run out of time but I want to talk at a future date about some of the activities of Deputy Commissioner Ayton, who has aided and abetted this man. I have here an extract from the South Australian royal commission, which described Mr Ayton in very unflattering terms. Basically, it described him as a liar, as vicious, vindictive and dealing in hearsay evidence. Then there is a lovely little line about him having 'culturally inappropriate attitudes', which is code for 'racist'. This is a very serious matter. Justice is at risk. (Time expired) Mount Barker Road  er, tonight I want to briefly touch on the appalling state of the infamous Mount Barker Road. The Mount Barker Road forms the boundary between the electorate of Boothby and my seat of Sturt. For some years it has been part of National Highway No.1, and it has always been No. 1 for the worse road accident record in Australia. Mr Speaker, 30,000 vehicles use the Mount Barker Road every day. Since January 1992 to December last year, 719 accidents have occurred on Mount Barker Road. Sadly, at the same time that the member for Boothby (Mr Hall) asked his question on the Mount Barker Road in the House the other day, a further fatality was experienced on the Mount Barker Road, just adding to the argument for trying to change and improve it. Today my office faxed to me a story that came over ABC radio of a semi that lost its brakes at Eagle on the Hill and went out of control, hitting another truck and hitting and a caravan before ploughing into a house on the Devil's Elbow-a rather comprehensive accident on the Mount Barker Road. Police did not attempt to move the vehicle because of the time that would be taken in trying to do so in peak-hour traffic. It has to remain there until police feel they can move it. Mr Speaker, it is a disgrace that over the years many schemes have been promoted by various federal ministers for improving the Mount Barker Road. Most recent is a $150 million proposal of dual tunnels going under the hill to avoid the road altogether. There is no good reason why this should not proceed. Every year South Australians give just less than $1 billion to the federal government road taxes, and 7 per cent of that is spent in South Australia. The government needs to answer the question as to whether the fuel taxes it collects in South Australia are another means of topping up government revenue or if it has any real, genuine desire stop the damage that is being done on Mount Barker Road to protect my constituents and the constituents of the honourable member Boothby. Universities: Funding",128
193,Mr LATHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"Werriwa) (7.41 p.m.}-One gong of the major tasks of higher education policy in Australia is to transfer funding to universiearned ties which service regions with strong populaSouth tion growth and lower than average tertiary participation rates. In my electorate, this means supporting the funding· needs of the University of Western Sydney on each of its campuses. It is, of course, one of the most difficult tasks in public life to redistribute million. funding from one organisation to another. It is no secret that the losers in this process often muster greater protests and noise than the potential beneficiaries. What I propose in the Commonwealth management of Australia's universities is consideration of an additional component the funding equation: that is, the investment income and private donations and endowmillion. ments available to each of Australia's universities. This is not a principle which is a car uncommon in the public sector. It is not a principle which is uncommon in the funding arrangements of the Commonwealth government. For instance, in our allocations to each of the states through the Commonwealth Grants Commission an assessment is made of revenue capacity and needs for each of those states. Similar principles are used in the distribution of financial assistance grants from the Commonwealth to local government. On this basis, it is appropriate to adjust Commonwealth grants with consideration for the annual investment income, investment assets and private donations made to each university. For instance, of the $221 million investment income available to Australia's 35 universities in in 1993, 59 per cent of that amount was earned by the four asset rich universities: New South Wa1es, Sydney, Melbourne and Western Australia. Equally, of the $102 million injust come available in endowments and private donations in 1993, 69 per cent was earned by to just five universities: New South Wales, Monash, Melbourne, Curtin and Adelaide. Currently, federal grant allocations are not for adjusted for these factors. I believe they should be. When I turn to more detailed data, Mr Speaker, I am sure you will agree-as a fine supporter of the University of Wollonin your electorate of Cunningham .. I turn to the data concerning asset related income by some of the unive.rsities in New Wales. In 1993, the University of New South Wales earned just over $24 million in investment income from an asset base totalling over $240 million. The University of Sydney had a similar outcome, earning over $31 million from its asset base of over $440 I make the comparison with the university of Western Sydney-which I support, and which is also supported by my colleague the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace)and the University of Wollongong in your electorate, Mr Speaker. In 1993, the Universiin ty of Western Sydney earned investment income from its asset base of just over $3 There was a similar result at the 35 University of Wollongong. The figures on income from endowments and private donations are much the same. In 1993, the University of New South Wales received over $8 million; the University of Sydney received $4.5 million; the University of Western Sydney received $375,000; and the University of Wollongong received $80,000. The point is, of course, that new universities such as the University of Western Sydney, or universities that represent and service a region with a struggling income base, such as the Illawarra or Western Sydney, find it very hard to generate private donations and private endowments. They also find it hard to build up an asset base like that enjoyed by the old,asset rich, well-established universities such as the University of New South Wales, the University of Sydney, the University of Melbourne and the University of Western Australia. My proposition is quite simple: with the federal budget coming up and midway through a review of the federal university funding arrangements, there should be an account taken of, and an adjustment made from, the private revenue available to the major universities. That is, in my assessment, totally consistent with equity principles and totally consistent with the way in which we fund the states and local government. This transfer of funding would give universities that have riot got the rich endowments, that have not got the rich asset base, their fair chance to service their student population. Australia Post",130
194,Mr ATKINSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Isaacs) (7.45 p.m.}-Last year Australia Post's profit rose from $125 million to $179 million. Domestic letter volumes increased 3.7 per cent and the federal government extracted $90 million dividends compared with $62 million the previous year as well as requiring Australia Post to repay $200 million as a capital repayment. Australia Post cannot stand still. It has been opening retail shops, earning five per cent of its revenue from processing 84 million bills a year and beginning automatic letter printing for small businesses via direct computer links with the post offices. This year these are just some of the steps Australia Post has taken to ensure that it remains relevant. However, Australia Post has got some of its planning disastrously wrong in the past. We all remember the Redfern mail centre in Sydney and its industrial problems. In the Australian Financial Review of 5 December 1994 the manager of Network Design, Mike Douglass, said: In the late 1970s, we expected that fax and electronic communications would reduce the volumes of letters that were posted ... (but) volumes have in fact gone up way beyond what we'd expected. Australia Post's present yearly volume of 1.6 billion articles is about double what it expected 15 years ago. What concerns me is that Australia Post in Melbourne is about to start reviewing its street postboxes. An Australia Post official said to my office that Melbourne has 1,000 more of these letterboxes than Sydney. This is not correct. Australia Post says that there are 4,410 street postboxes in Melbourne and 4,181 in Sydney. The mail business unit is going to immediately review all street postboxes that are under the control of the Eastern Mail Centre, which is in Nunawading,and then by April start a review of the boxes in the Southern Mail Centre at Clayton South. I want to launch a 'save our mailboxes' campaign today because of the secretive way in which Australia Post is carrying out these reviews of street postboxes. Australia Post's existing policy is to do a letter count in a so called average week at each posting box and then internally make a decision to remove or resite the boxes if less than 30 items per clearance are typically posted in metropolitan areas. Boxes should be no more than one kilometre apart from the next box. My information is that Australia Post would like to remove up to 1,000 boxes in Melbourne and what Australia Post calls 'fringe areas' --outer suburban locations such as Cranbourne, Healesville and Melton that are still serviced by metropolitan mail centres. I do not see how a survey of the nl,lmber of letters posted over one week only is a sufficient statistical basis on which to make an informed decision. Australia Post will write to all its federal members telling them of the review in their area and a notice will also be posted for a month on each of the postboxes that might be slated for removal to enable interested mail users to make representations to the mail business units. There will, however, be no advertisements in local papers to inform residents of the planned changes. A small group of Australia Post officials, who may lack a good knowledge of an area and particularly peaks and troughs in mail posting, will make decisions that affect people who irregularly stop on the way home from work to post their business letters and residents who write letters, send Christmas cards or birthday cards, send bills,payments or small articles through their local mailbox. one in the community will be involved in the decision making. A street posting box that in one week of survey falls just below the necessary number of articles might be removed only to massively inconvenience the people, especially the older members, of our community who would like to walk to their nearest postbox in slightly busier times or peak periods such as Christmas, when large numbers of items are posted. ' I am not arguing that no changes should be made, but it would appear that Australia Post is trying to pull the wool over the' eyes of its customers who are posting increasing volumes of mail. Australia Post should improve the maintenance of its street posting boxes by assigning its pick-up driver- particular boxes to clean of any graffiti and they should install additional boxes in some of the newer states, such as at Cranbourne West, where some residents have no box available within 1.5 to 2 kilometres. In the meantime, I call on all Melbourne residents to be aware that their local mailbox may be under threat and to not only watch for the appearance of the notices proposing the removal but also patronise the mailboxes so that an important community asset can be maintained ..

195,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"Bass) (7.50 p.m.)Last night in this House I made a statement. I based my information and facts on what I believed to be true and correct information given to me by the parliamentary information service. It appears today that I did not have the full information. I produced a document of pecuniary interests, but it did not include an attachment that it should have included. So, on that basis, I stand in this House and offer my apology to Senator Eric Abetz. I made a statement regarding his pecuniary interest in a legal firm in which he had been a part owner and that it may have been in contravention of parliamentary privilege to have actually made some comment about the trust bank in Tasmania. It perhaps serves as a warning to all of us in this place, on both sides of the House and in both houses, that No- when we come into this place we need to relieve ourselves of any outside interests that might be picked up as pecuniary interests, because we really need to dedicate ourselves 100 per cent to what we are doing here. In this House, when we get our research and information, we believe that information to be true, and that was the case last night. So I stand proudly in the House and offer Senator Abetz my apologies for what I said last night. Retail Monopoly",132
196,Mr KATTER,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to talk about newsagencies and, in doing so, I point out to the House that no government in Australian history-and I venture to suggest few governments anywhere in the world-has been able to achieve the destruction of the small business sector as effectively as this government has been able to. In the field of retailing in Australia, if you want to sell something, there are only four companies in Australia you can sell it to--Woolworths, Coles, Franklins or Davids. If you want to buy anything, there are only four companies in Australia you can buy it offWoolworths, Coles, Franklins and Davids. Over 80 per cent of the retail markets in Australia belong to those four companies. The media in Australia is owned effectively by two people as a result of the media law changes that were introduced in this place by this government and its present leader. I pay a tribute in passing to the extreme integrity and courage of the member for Holt (Mr Duffy) in standing up to the person who is now Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Keating) in an attempt to protect the Australian people from the monopolism that is taking over country. In the last six years there have been over 80,000 bankruptcies in Australia. I am pleased the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) is here listen to this because it is his portfolio. He presided over 80,000 bankruptcies. When we lost government in this place there were 4,000 bankruptcies a year and now there are tween 14,000 and 16,000 a year, still whipping along at that level. I know only two people who have gone bankrupt, but I know hundreds, maybe thouis sands, of people who have gone broke-l 0 broke for every bankrupt. Over 800,000 lost more than everything. They have walked out of their businesses, they have walked their farms, and taken with them on their backs a debt which they will work for the rest of their days trying to pay off. They will succeed. They will die with that debt around their throat, living in grinding poverty for the rest of their days, condemned by the policies of this government. In my own state of Queensland; the incomAll ing ALP government extended trading hours. That will result in the destruction of hundreds of small after-hours stores. The have gone down like ninepins because of deregulation in the milk vending industry. That wonderful organisation the Trade Practices Commission stopped the service stations from getting the protection they were after and validated the actions of the oil companies, which resulted in the price of oil worldwide dropping clean in half and the price of petrol in Australia doubling in the same time. This gave the oil companies of Australia 21 c of profit that they are not entitled to. translates into $5.7 billion per year. In fact, the price they were getting in 1983 was a litre and in 1993 they were getting 23c litre. I am working off 1993 figures here, the situation now is even worse. In the same period the price of petrol dropped from $30 a barrel to $14 a barrel. The latest number on the hit parade of destruction of this government against small business is that of the newsagents. This wonderful body the Trade Practices Commisthe sion, the child of this government, has decidsham this ed that we should allow the newspapers franchise to go through Coles and W001worths. It seems to me that in this country there is nothing those big, oligopolist, moto nopolistic corporations do not want. There has just seems to be absolutely no limit to the greed of these people. They want the bread, they want the meat, they want the newsagenbecies and they want the milk vendors. They and they are want to break everyone. I call to the attention of the House that the Attorney-General is laughing. He thinks this funny. I would wonder why. I suppose he can laugh at the destruction of these people have because he is responsible for it. I pay great tribute to Mr Tony Filbrick of off the Queensland Newspaper Federation and Hugh MCDonald, who have been tireless fighters on· behalf of the newsagencies. We not will lose delivery, the extensive range of stock we enjoy, the competition we have at present and there will be the loss of service in ordering special items for us and a range of items which are suitable to our local areas. of those things we will lose if this franchise is handed over lock, stock and barrel to Woolworths and Coles, as every other area of milk vendors the economy has been. New South Wales Government",132
197,Mr HAVILAND,ADJOURNMENT,"Macarthur) (7.57 p.m.)We have a state election coming up in New South Wales. We heard today in the parliament, in answer to a question I asked the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free), what a sham the actions of the New South Wales government have been. It has opened about 45 schools in That the last 1Y2 months, which is 4Y2 times as many as were opened in the first half of last 12c year. There have been 45 school openings a with 72 per cent Commonwealth funds. Yet so the New South Wales government has deliberately manipulated some of these openings so that federal members in· the electorates concerned could not attend. The state, of course, takes the credit for this federal government money going to opening schools. It is not only in the area of education that Fahey government has been shown for the that it is, particularly in relation to Commonwealth-state relations and the spending of federal government money. I have been heard in this House many times before talking about the Commonwealth-state child-care agreement and how the Fahey government has refused to sign that agreement for the last five years. Certainly since before the last state election, the New South Wales government has refused to sign the Commonwealth-state child-care agreement, thereby denying the young people in the growing areas, like the ones that I represent, access to very important child-care places. Mr Fahey seems to be a bit confused about this because he told a journalist yesterday that the agreement. with the federal government was signed and that the New South Wales government was very much party to it. He told the journalist to ignore the nonsense from Canberra on this issue. He was asked when it was signed and he said, 'Several weeks ago-from memory before Christmas. I can't recall exactly when, but several weeks ago.' The journalist asked him again and he said, 'The federal Minister for Family Services, Rosemary Crowley, should check it and we have signed.' Of course, Mr Fahey was wrong. The opposition in New South Wales checked with Senator Crowley's office and found that, in fact, the Fahey government has still not signed the child-care agreement, despite having promised, as I predicted in this House last September, a raft of new child-care places, which is virtually a reannouncement of the same child-care places that the federal government has wanted to fund for the last four years but has not been able to deliver because the New South Wales government has refused to sign the agreement. It certainly has been a bad time for Premier Fahey in New South Wales. His big plans for the launch of his women's policy on International Women's Day today were completely derailed. Premier Fahey was supposed to launch his women's policy, but that was completely derailed because of, amongst other things, his lapse of memory. He thought he had signed the child-care agreement and was blaming the federal government for misrepresenting his position when in fact he has still not, after 4Y2 years, signed the Commonwealth-state child-care agreement. Thank goodness it is only another 2Y2 weeks until the state election when we can have a change of government in New South Wales and have some honesty, some delivery of services and the implementation of social justice programs for the people of New South Wales, which have been denied them for the last seven years under the coalition government.",133

So we are moving away from the idea are effective savings resulting from data matching, been achieved, to the more esoteric view additional compliance that we would not otherwise that they might be ascertained by the effectiveness undertaking. Then the report deals with detecting people secondary matter. Verifying the accuracy of importance, and the final matter is the detection I think it is important to recognise that, In the appendices that I find particularly interesting-on cost-benefit summary. What one sees there is that to be a very high level of direct cost-benefit. the government's view was that it was going million originally held out. What is interesting the department thinks, it is going to drop million. I do not know how these figures were random, because they are the same for 1996-97 of those years. What one sees is an effort to develop associated with voluntary compliance, and that there in the projections is an estimate that order of $42 million worth of savings, and that get approximately the same total amount of savings voluntary savings will go up to $71 million and, in 1996-97 and 1997-98, it is going to go to a off to $90 million. So the government seems there can be direct cost-benefit analysis-including yield somewhere between $120 million and rounded off some of the future projections to achieve it. My problem is that I do not know how accurate the way in which the department tried to deal General. In chapter 4, there is an assessment National Audit Office efficiency audit. As one the audit office made, one finds a series of MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1885 the need for a more comprehensive costlbenefit efficiency to be pursued in Data-matching work. of those comments because the department was It was not satisfied that there had been matching, which attempts to deal with these comments on that.

(2) Is the Minister able to itemise the expenditures referred to in each case in part (1). (3) Will further sums be spent on information technology in 1994-95.",178
225,Mr WALKER,TASMANIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The following table shows expenditure for major information technology purchases undertaken by my Department. It includes expenditure by the Australian Electoral Commission and the Commonwealth Grants Commission. Departmental Expenditure on IT, 1991-1992 to 1993-94 1991-92 1992-93 1993-94 $ $ $ 5,814,680 7,870,879 7,007,368 16,245,497 11,929,909 14,084,869 8,867,158 10,588,707 9,667,511 6,475,351 8,274,910 8,398,876 7,333,506 8,935,249 7,341,488 44,736,192 47,599,654 46,500,112 payments not continued pending assessment and (e) will he investigate measures to prevent a recurrence. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The 1994 annual review of Family Payment entitlement involved issuing review forms to over 640,000 families about income and assets; review forms to around 210,000 families with students aged 16 and over; and collecting information on net rental property losses, to establish whether families had an ongoing entitlement to Family Payment in 1995. Some of these were not processed for the first payday in January. (a) Some families did not send the form back by the due date (and had been advised that payment would stop after the last payday on 22 December 1994 if they did not); or they did not provide enough information to enable the Department of Social Security (DSS) to properly assess their claim (in which case departmental officers contacted them to get the information but without success). In some other cases DSS received the form but action was not finalised due to the volume of processing at time. It is not possible to distinguish exactly the number of cases which fall into each category. (b) As at 5 January 1995, there were 41,926 cases where payment was not made because forms had not been processed to completion for the reasons outlined in (a) above. (c) Every effort was made to complete processing of forms which had been returned to DSS by the end of the week beginning 16 January 1995. At 3 February 1995 there were around 6,000 cases where payment had not been made because the form had been returned late or insufficient information had been provided to allow payment without further response from the client. Families who return the review form before 31 March 1995 and who are eligible for payment from the beginning of 1995 will receive full arrears of Family Payment from the first payday in January 1995. (d) DSS cannot continue to pay families irrespective of the outcome of the review because this would lead to overpayments, a number of which may not be recovered. Of the outstanding claims finalised after 23 December 1994, around 16,000 families were found to be ineligible for Family Paymentby 17 February 1995. In addition, around 42,000 families had still not returned their review form by 17 February 1995. (e) A full review of the Family Payment end of year review process is being conducted by my Department. Department of Administrative Services: (Question No. 1969) Mr Connolly-asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 6 February 1995: Did the ACf Support Services, Local Purchasing unit of his Department contract Psychological and Corporate of Queensland to provide consultancy services; if so, (a) what brief was given to the company, (b) what was the cost of the consultancy and (c) what were its results.",178
226,Mr WALKER,TASMANIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. However, the entry in the Purchasing and DisposalsGazettewas incomplete: the entry should have read ""Psychological and Corporate Consulting Pty Ltd, PO Box 105, Clayfield QLD 40 II"" rather than ""Psychological and Corporate of Queensland"". The Department of Administrative Services People Development Branch contracted Dr Gary Embelton of Psychological and Corporate Consulting Pty Ltd to provide cqnsultancy services to that design, develop and deliver a Communication and Counselling Skills Program for DAS. The ACT Support Services, Local Purchasing Unit processed the Purchase Order and gazetted the consultancy services in the Purchasing and Disposals Gazette. (a) My Department provided the following brief: Consultancy Services-: Design a program which can be delivered inhouse by trained DAS HRD personnel to develop interpersonal communication skills of middle managers. This program will be designed to be articulated into university or TAFE accredited programs at undergraduate and graduate levels. The course should consist of 4 to 5 days intensive instruction. The program will address basic communication and counselling skills, including: observation attending questioning reflection of feeling and content information giving confrontation relating communication to the management role. Timeframe: The design will be completed two months Contracts from date of contract. (b) Total cost was $28,100, comprising $8,100 for program design and $20,000 for conduct of workshops. (c) Dr Gary Embelton has completed the design and development of a Communication and Counselling Skills Program for DAS. Training workshops were conducted on: 7 & 8 September 1994 in Canberra 15 & 16 September 1994 in Canberra 14 & 15 October 1994 in Melbourne 20 & 21 October 1994 in Melbourne 10 & II N ovem ber 1994 in Canberra 17 & 18 November 1994 in Canberra 24 & 25 December 1994 in Canberra I & 2 December 1994 in Canberra Approximately 60 middle managers of the department participated. Evaluations show considerable improvement in their skills and effectiveness. Australian Broadcasting Corporation (Question No. 1970) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 6 February 1995: Does the ABC compete against private enterprise news agencies for contracts to provide radio news information to Australian radio stations; if so, (a) is the service offered at a full commercial rate and (b) how does the ABC determine its charging for the service. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. Broadcast News Australia (BNA) is an independent Business Unit within the Radio Division of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that provides commercial radio stations with a competitive news text service. BNA commenced operations on 1 January 1994 at the invitation of the Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters (F ARB). Prior to BNA, Australian Associated Press (AAP) was sole provider of the news wire service in Australia for more than 50 years. (a) BNA operates as a business unit in accordance with the Corporation's Business Activity and User Pays Guidelines. It is expected to at least cover costs and preferably operate at a profit. As a business unit in competition with the private sector, BNA sells its services at market rate. In accordance with the Guidelines, it is charged by ABC radio or other areas of the Corporation for all services provided to it. (b) BNA,as a cost centre, must recover the costs of its own staffofjournalists to produce a commercially acceptable product. Other costs for the BNA wire service include rights fees for international wire services reproduced in the service; provision of data lines to commercial users by communications carriers; provision of technology support and marketing. BNA rates were set following examination of existing marketrates and discussions with commercial radio industry operators including former FARB secretariat members. The rates do not just reflect cost recovery but maximise income for the ABC taking into consideration existing market expectations. In addition, as well as an agreed payment for news services provided to BNA by ABC News, BNA has paid the ABC for capital equipment, information technology software, hardware and support, and for telephone lines to clients. These services are provided to BNA on a full cost recovery basis. Minister for Foreign Affairs: Staff (Question No. 1981)",179
227,Mr COSTELLO,TASMANIA,"the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 7 February 1995: Has (a) the Minister, (b) any member of the Minister's staffor (c) the Minister's office had any (i) bills or accounts paid on their behalf or (ii) equipment provided by their Department or any other organisation for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility since 13 March 1993; if so, in each case, (A) in respect of bills, (1) what sum was paid and (II) for what purpose was the bill or account rendered and (B) in respect of equipment, what are the full details. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: All bills or accounts paid and any equipment provided to me, my staff or my office by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are in accordance with the 'Guidelines for providing services to Ministers', pp 154-156 in the Ministers of State of the Commonwealth Parliament Office Handbookpublished by the Department of Administrative Services in March 1993. The guidelines delineate the breakdown of responsibilities between the Department of Administrative Services and Ministers' home departments in support of Ministers, their staffs and their offices. Essentially, home departments provide all services apart from salaries, equipment and entitlements that are common to all Ministers and backbench Senators and members of Parliament. I am not prepared to authorise either the time or the resources needed to provide a fully-itemised list of all accounts or bills paid for and pieces of equipment supplied by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade since 13 March 1993 in support of my office.",180
