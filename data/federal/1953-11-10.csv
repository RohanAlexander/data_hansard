1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," I have to report that the House this day attended His 'Excellency the Governor General in the Senate chamber, where His Excellency .was pleased .to 'make a Speech to both Houses of the Parliament, of which I have received a copy. As honourable members .have copies of if he .Speech, I presume that tiliey do .not desire that .1 should formally read it to 'the House. It will be included in Mansard .'for record purposes.

The session now .to ""begin w i ll - not 'be ML long ime, fmr we'all luvve rt in - mind'that eaTly in the : ! - new year Australia is to'be ""honoured'by a-v'is'it - from"" Her Majesty the Queen - accompanied by luer husband, ""His Royal 'Highness the '-Duke of . BILL 1953. Edinburgh. The devotion of Australians to tihe - Dhronu is both 'deep a'nd warm. It '.has been show.ii !by word 'a'lid deed in bo'th 'peace land VVRST. It As 'not the --special 'prerogative 'of iiaiy political - parte, or of any creed, or of'any section of'the Australian people. We all'know that from the-.time'Her Majesty'arrives/among us until the time she departs, she will not only encourage us by giving us a rare opportunity to express to her our feelings of allegiance and of love, but she will also, as we believe, derive encouragement herself for the great responsibilities which it is her toric mission to sustain. As the Royal Style and Titles Act passed by this Parliament earlier this year records, Her Majesty is no stranger in any of her realms and territories, because she is the Queen of each and all of them. Her Majesty has graciously consented to open in person the next session of the Commonwealth Parliament. To that end, the Parliament will be prorogued at the end of the present sittings. In Korea, the conclusion of an armistice after a. struggle lasting for more than three years, a struggle which involved Australian forces of all arms and sad casualties, is of great importance. My advisers wish to pay high tribute to those who have fought under the banner of the United Nations to resist aggression, and who have made great sacrifices in the defence of freedom. It is indeed good that the Korean conflict has been confined to Korea and that a wider and IIIOTC devastating disaster has been averted. My advisers will work with the other governments concerned for a negotiated and permanent settlement of the Korean problem, so that what is now an armistice may become a real peace. In the long run, peace can be secured in a real sense only by honest and patient endeavours to remove the causes of misunderstanding and conflict. It is with this basic truth mind that my Government, having taken the initiative in the Colombo plan in 19C0, has continued to support by money, technical assistance, materials, foodstuffs."" and Australian training for groups of persons from overseas, international efforts for the economic advancement of those nations which are at present under-developed. Human welfare and political stability upon a basis of individual freedom will, we all hope and believe, tend to restrict and ultimately to eliminate the causes of war. It is for this reason that my Government has continued the policy, which'has been pursued by all Australian governments since the war, of supporting the United Nations and its specialized agencies, with particular emphasis upon that area of South-East Asia with which we have a close and growing contact. Although I have the honour to address you today as Her Majesty's personal representative in the Commonwealth of Australia, members of the Senate and members of the House of Representatives will . I know, permit me to refer to the fact that much of my own previous service to the Crown has been rendered in Asian countries, the character and problems of whose people have engaged my own attention. These reflections render the expressions of co-operation which I have already made a matter of personal and particular interest and pleasure. The major legislative proposal which my Government will submit to Parliament will take the form of a comprehensive bill to clarify and consolidate the law relating to the provision of pharmaceutical, sickness and hospital his- benefits and of medical services. This will provide authority for the further development of registered hospital and medical benefit organizations. It will also provide for the operation of committees drawn from the medical and pharmaceutical professions to assist in the administration of these far-reaching health services. My advisers will continue to work in close association with the various professional associations and insurance organizations for the furthering of voluntary health insurance. They believe that the corporate finance resources so developed will protect the people to a substantial degree against the heavy financial burdens which so often result from medical and hospital treatment. The bill will also provide a firm legal foundation for the provision of medical and pharmaceutical services to pensioners. Discussions have taken place between representatives of my Government and the Governments of the States, and it has been agreed that it is desirable that the Commonwealth and States should take legislative action foT the proper control of the standards of therapeutic substances. To this end, my Government will present a bill to provide standards for such substances and for other purposes connected with this matter. During the twelve months ended 30th June, 1053, Australia's international reserves were increased from £302,000,000 to £548,000.000. W it h this improvement in the balance of interin national payments, there have been successive relaxations of the restrictions on imports. The larger volume of imports resulting from these relaxations will add to the productive capacity of Australian industry and will contribute to the satisfaction of consumer demand. EaTly in the new year, Commonwealth Finance Ministers will meet in Sydney to review matters of mutual interest to the Commonwealth, including balance of payments' prospects in 1054, progress of plans for moving towards a system of freer trade, and payments, covering the widest possible area, and cooperation in development of the economic resources of the Commonwealth. It is my Government's view that much is to be coined by hoidins important Commonwealth conferences of this kind not only in the United Kingdom but in other Commonwealth countries as well. It is therefore gratifying that the proposal to hold the next Finance Minister's meeting in Australia has proved acceptable to other Commonwealth countries and n warm welcome is assured for Commonwealth representatives who will attend thp meeting. My advisers are confident that the conference will contribute to the economic advancement of the Commonwealth countries. My Government, belicvinsr that Australian development can be materially assisted by the investment .of overseas capital in suitable industries in Australia, has examined the menus by which taxation obstacles to the investment of such capital can be removed. Au agreement designed to eliminate deterrents to investment was concluded by Australia and the United Kingdom in 1040. My Government earlier this year signed with the United States of America a convention of a comparable nature. In addition, conventions to avoid a double imposition by Australia and the United States of estate duty and gif t duty have been signed. My advisers will introduce legislation to give the force of law in Australia to these conventions. My Government has continued membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs anti Trade. But it has made it known that it regards this instrument as being unsatisfactory in some respects and therefore in need of revision. At the recent session of the contracting parties, it was agreed that they should commence a general review of the agreement in l!)o4. The majority of the eon tract ing parties recently decided to allow Japan to participate in the work of the agreement and formulated a declaration whereby those of its member' who wish to do so might regulate their trading arrangements with Japan, in accordance with the principles of the agreement. My Government has abstained from any association with this decision. Within the limits of its present policy <>' non-discrimination in import licensing matters, my Government has continued the practice of negotiating bilateral trade arrangements designed to promote friendly commercial relations and to expand our export trade with various countries. In according reasonable and adequate protection to efficiently conducted Australian industries, either by way of tariffs or by other methods, my Government will rely upon the Tariff Board for advice. The Tariff Board Act provides for public inquiry into niatters referred to it and this provision ensures that the interests of all sections of the community a.re considered by the Government. The need for a more expeditious procedure for determining Tariff Board inquiries is receiving consideration and my Government will, during the course of the present session, ask the Parliament to approve legislation designed to achieve that objective. My Government intends to refund to wheat growers the amount now held in the Wheal industry Stabilization Fund from the tax of. wheat exported from the 1050-51 crop in No. ,14 po'.d. Tinamount of tax is .just over £11,000,000 Australia. iiml interest from the investment of the fund will he added. The refund is to tie made lieunuse the amount is no longer, required for its original purpose, and. it has' consistently been the policy of my Government not to hold funds contributed by the growers in excess of the amount legitimately required for the .pur poses of the wheat stabilization plan. A. balance of f0,000,000 is being held in the fund ponding the results of ballots to be conducted by the States as to an extension of the wheat stabilization plan, and should the growers vote for an extended plan the amount will be retained as the nucleus of a fund for that plan. My Government has made it clear at all times that the consent of the growers is a first requisite in any plan for wheat stabilization. The position regarding the supply of agricultural machinery, tractors, chemicals and fertilizers, such as superphosphate and sulphate of ammonia, has improved appreciably during the last twelve mouths and has considerably aided my Government's drive to increase food production. Improvements in supplies havp been obtained from both local sources and imports from either sterling or dollar areas, in additionto the aid mentioned above, which is of direct concern to the farmer and grazier, my Government has also helped the Departments of Agriculture in all States through grants to supplement the extension and research services of the various organizations. Grants totalling approximately half a million pounds a year have been made available and approval given to continue the grant Tor the next five years. Sneli grants cover the extension services in general and the dairy and tobacco industries in particular. My Government's defence policy has been directed to building up and maintaining the strength of the forces in order to sustain our part in the collective defence of the free world, in the course of what has been called the ""cold war "" Australia has played its .part in the resistance to Communist aggression in Korea, in the combating of Communist terrorists in Malaya, and in contributing to the security of the Middle East. Communist tactics have imposed on the democracies a heavy burden of re-armament but we must accept this burden as the price of peace. Accordingly, my advisers are sustaining the permanent forces at their present strengths, while national service, which is making a notable contribution to the physique and trained capacity of Australian youth, is building up the citizen forces and reserves. On the scientific side of defence, the joint United Kingdom-Australia long-range weapons project is proceeding very satisfactorily. The United Kingdom Ministei of Supply recently visited the long-range weapons establishment at Salisbury and at Woomera and expressed warm satisfaction with the progress that has been made. During his visit a. new finance agreement was negotiated to cover the project, designed to ensure a more satisfactory basis for sharing costs in view of the increasing amount of scientific and industrial work now being done in During October, the first atomic tests ever to take place on the Australian mainland were made at a proving ground north-west of Woomera. The tests were highly successful and were carried out in a spirit of close partnership between the two governments. The United Kingdom scientists had the responsibility for the scientific work associated with the trials, while the site was prepared by Australian service personnel, and the Austral-inn. Department ot Supply was responsible for all planning involved, in. the preparation, of the site. To provide as far as. possible against the contingencies of the future, plans for co-operation in British Commonwealth defence are being actively developed between the United Kingdom, Australia and New - Zealand, while planning is also proceeding 'between the United States of America, Australia' and New Zealand under the AnznsTreaty. Meanwhile, it is gratifying to record that, in the field of aircraft production much goodwork has been done, deliveries of Australianbuilt Canberra jet homber aircraft having already commenced, while deliveries of tinAustralian-built Sabre fighter will' commence early in 1954. With the improvement in economic circumstances in Australia, my advisers have been able to increase the level' of the migrant intake following the reduction which they had reluctantly found necessary to anplv during 1952. In the present programme, British immigration will continue to receive first priority, and', in both British and foreign schemes, the emphasis will' be placed upon the migration of families. Special arrangements have been made, to provide opportunities for British people to settle in Australia, who, previously, had lacked sponsors for their nomination. The intake of workers' of the various nationalities will bo. closely related to employment, opportunities, both as to numbers and occupations. Particular attention will' continue to bo placed on the introduction of experienced rural workers; to help remedy the shortage of suitable farm la.hmir. The labour needsof thebasic secondary industries and essential supportinga-nd service industries have also Been considered'. The task' of developing the uranium resourceso f the Commonwealth is beingvigorously pushed forward By the Atomic Energy"" Commission and' the Bureau: of Mineral' Resources. Rapid' progress is beingmade by the commission's mining contractor, Territory Enterprise* Limited, in the Riim Jungle area, where it iis anticipated' that the mine will Be in production by the middle of 1954.. In addition to this,, large areas of the Northern Territory are being i rad'iometrically surveyed from the air, with detailed geological and geophysical investigations on the ground in appropriate cases. As surveys of promising areas are completed those areas will Bo released' for development By private enterprise. My advisers believe that, this policy will not only provide a stimulus to our economy But will also ensure that'deposit's of ore are brought into production as quickly nsr possible; When ray predecessor last addressed you, lie referred to the - their grave and urgent problem of coal' production. In. New South. Wales, coal', production' is. adjusted to the: demand'.. Production could, be increased i!£. the. need', should' arise'. In other States-, tifie coal industry is substantiality in r Speech. thu same condition. D.cmondsi ane being, met, stocks are in the. niaiinj satisfactory and'there, is spare producing capacity! which may be called', upon at. need. Stocks, of. coal at, grass, and in consumers' hands throughout Australia amount' to. about. 3,25.0,000 tons!. In the immediate future, steaming coai should continue to be ueadily available as required . Supplies of coking, coal should be. 1 adequate. Only gas coal of. best; quality, is likely to be in short supply and the use of some sub1 stitute coal in gas'-workss will probably continue. The quality of some coals-in New South. 1 Wales will be. improved by cleaning plants which are being; or are shortly to be, installed. There will be-submitted to Parliament a pro1 posal for the amendment of the Navigation Acts to incorporate new safety measures agreed upon at anInternational' Conference for thp Safety of .Life nt Sea, in 1948, and the Commonwealth will then-lie in a position to ratify this important convention. The development of the territories of the Commonwealth and the wol'fnre of the indigenous inhabitants remains a prime concern ofmy advisers. Health and' education services have been expanded, with special attention to the needs of the native populations. Plans for further expansion will be pursued. In Papua and New Guinea, a measure of local government, has been introduced by the establishment of. a. Legislative Council and the establishment, of local government and village councils among the native villages. A Local Government Council for Nanruans has also been established. There has been marked activity in the survey and development of, natural resources and in 1 the"" general oc.onomu; advancement of. the territories. 1 Accordingly, my Government sought and' was grunted at the recent session of the contracting partiesof the General Agreement on. Tariffs and Trade a. waiver of certain provisions relatingto territoryproducts'. As a result,, my Govennraenfr will he able, in appropriate cases, to accord its special assistance to: products of theterritory when, imported into Australia. In ad'd'ition. to. the' major items of legislationto which - I have already referred, my advisers will submit to Parliament, other legislative proposals' the most important of which relates to grants to the States' for the' purposes of the universities. In the earnest hope that Divine Provident? may guide your deliberations' and' f u r the r the welfare of the people of the Commonwealth, 1 now leave you to the discharge of your high and important duties. Motion (by Mr MENZIES) agreed toThat a committee, consisting of Mr Downer. Mr Tuxnbull., and the mover,, be appointed to prepare an-- Address-in-Reply to the: Speechdelivered by His Excellency the Governor 1 now General, to both. Houses of the Parliament, and that the committee do report this day. SMiing suspended from 3.87 to 8 n.m. BASIC WAGE. Dr JSVAT.T - i i desire _ to ask .the .Prime Minister a question tin relation to the Public Service regulation, or regulations, governing .the .adjustment of Public Service .salaries by reference to the cost of living. .1 understand that the Government has .a matter from the Public Service Arbitrator - under consideration .which is likely to .result in the submission to .the House of a Public Service regulation. Will the Prime Minister inform in e whether that is so ? If his answer is in the affirmative,, .can he state when the regulation will be submitted to the House? Einally, will lie give an assur.ance .that .sufficient time will be given to honourable .members to debate the regulation ?",10
2,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"If u regulation is involved-and I cannot answer offhand whether it is-then , naturally, it will be subject to the usual rules governing the submission, of regulations, and any honourable member who - wishes to move for the disallowance of the regulation II ray do so.",14
3,Dr EVATT,Unknown,The regulation must he milled within fifteen sitting days after if becomes operative. Will it be submitted to the House in reasonable time?,14
4,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"Yes , certainly.",14
5,Mr WARD,Unknown,"I ask the Prime Minister whether it is a fact fcliat he has expressed agreement with the decision to abandon, and the reasons advanced by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration for abandon ing, the practice followed iii this country for very many years of adjusting the basic wage each quarter according to the rise or f all of the cost of living? If so, does the 'Government propose to take action .to regulate profits and dividends on the basis of the ability of industry to pay, or .is that practice to apply in respect of wages only?",14
6,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"The question, of fourse, is highly .argumentative. I bave said, .and I . repeat, that tke Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and A r b i tration has given its reasons for its decision I r . ""HAY-LEN - The Prime Minister has stated that they were illuminating. Mr ""KCENZIES - I strongly suspect that 'if he 'honourable member who intersected 'has not read the reasons. I have found them very illuminating. In any event, they represent the decision of an umpire. We stand for arbitration, and ,ac(.'e.pt tke decision of the umpire. COMPULSORY UNIONISM . """,14
7,Mr KESWICK,Unknown,"My question ds .addressed .to the Prime Minister. Because of the sinister threat to Australian workers contained in compulsory unionism, and not overlooking the fact that it cuts right across the principles laid down in the Declaration of Human Rights, will the right honourable gentleman be prepared to use Standing Order i.0'7 to enable both sides of the House to express their views on compulsory unionism? For the information of the 'House, I shall .read the .standing order",14
8,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! That will not be necessary.,14
9,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"I think that the Address-in-Reply debate will provide honourable members with an opportunity to express their views on that important matter. WATER CHARGES. Mr .RUSSELL - The question that I wish to ask .the Treasurer relates to water charges at Whyalla and Woomera. Will the right honourable gentleman confer with representatives of the South Australian Government and the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited with the object of having water supplied to those centres cheaper than 2s. 6d. a 1,000 gallons at Whyalla and 4s. 3d. a 1,000 gallons at Woomera? I point out that consumers at other centres which draw water from the ""Morgan-Whyalla line pay a normal rate of Is. lOd. a 1,000 gallons and an excess rate of Is. a 1,000 gallons. I know that certain small concessions .are granted at Woomera, but, owing to the dryness of the climate there and at Whyalla, the present charges make the cost of gardening to any advantage almost prohibitive. Sir ARTHUR . FADDEN - This subject concerns the relationship between the Australian Government and thn South Australian Government. Any representations made by the Premier of South Australia to this Government, through the Prime Minister, will receive consideration. GRASSHOPPERS.",14
10,Mr FAILES,Unknown,"My question to the Treasurer refers to the chemical aldrin, which is being used for the destruction of grasshoppers. This chemical is imported, I understand, from dollar sources. Has there been, or is there, any restriction the use of dollars for the purchase of chemical 1",15
11,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,Unknown,"I understand that the New South Wales Government made two applications for the release of dollars for the purchase of chemical for use in the destruction of grasshoppers. On both occasions, the dollars required were made available. In fact, licences for the importation of all insecticides required for the destruction of grasshoppers have been approved by this Government. IRON AND STEEL.",15
12,Mr GREENUP,Unknown,"Is the Prime Minister aware that the continued export of scrap iron and steel to Japan is having a serious effect upon the iron and steel industry? Is he also aware that the position is becoming so grave that unemployment in iron and steel foundries is threatened? Is it a fact that the continued export of this material will increase the price of steel in Australia? In view of these facts, does the right honourable gentleman intend to ban the export of scrap iron and steel to Japan?",15
13,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"The matter apparently is so grave that no honourable member mentioned it before the House rose at the end of the last session! As the newspapers have published something about it, the matter has now become urgent. If , in fact, it is grave, we shall take the necessary steps to conserve Australian resources, just as we did years ago when a Labour government in Western Australia wanted to export to Japan iron ore from Yampi Sound. EMPLOYMENT.",15
14,Mr BERRY,Unknown,"As many conflicting reports about the employment situation are in circulation, can the Minister for Labour and National Service give the House detailed information about the situation at the present time?",15
15,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"There should be no occasion for the circulation of conflicting reports because detailed statements analysing the employmentsituation are released monthly by my department, in addition to the figures made available by the Commonwealth Statistician. Furtheron more, I have kept the House fully this informed ou the trends of the employment situation in recent months. The figures have disclosed a steady and progressive increase of the demand for labour. The most recent figures put before me, which will be included in the next monthly this review, show that at present 35,000 unfilled work vacancies are recorded in Australia and that 32,000 people a reregistered, for employment. The number of persons in receipt of the unemployment benefit is somewhat less than half the number registered for employment. In the last fortnight, the number of persons registered for employment has fallen by 5,000. I can only repeat that there is a steady and progressive demand for labour at present.",15
16,Mr BERRY,Unknown,"Can the Minister confirm or dispute a statement made recently by a. Labour member of the Parliament in Queensland that there are 70,000 unemployed in Australia at present? Can the Minister also give figures relating to the number of unemployed who are employable, as well as figures for the number not fit for employment?",15
17,Mr HOLT,Unknown,I can only repeat my statement in relation to persons who have registered for employment with my department's employment service.,15
18,Dr EVATT,Unknown,Peopl e who are actually seeking employment.,15
19,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"Yes , not merely people who are applying for unemployment benefit, but people who register themselves as being available for employment. At the moment such individuals number 32,000. The number of vacancies for work recorded in my department is in excess of 35,000. The number of people who are in receipt of unemployment benefit, or who have registered themselves as available for employment, but would in point of fact be virtually_ unemploythat able, would require some sifting out. may be able to supply a figure that express the information in terms of centages. I shall see whether I can do DOLLARS.",15
20,Mr COSTA,Unknown,"My question addressed to the Prime"" Minister. Has the Secretary to the Treasury gone to the United States of America on official business on behalf of the Australian vernment? If so, what is the business? If he has gone there to borrow dollars from the International Bank for Reconconducting struction and Development, for how much is he asking? For what purpose will the loan be used ?",16
21,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"The Secretary to the Treasury has gone to the United States of America, where ho will discuss with the International Bank the problem of dollar borrowings. I am sure nobody would seriously expect me to discuss publicly in advance the matters he will discuss with the bank. Afterwards, will go to London in order to discuss an official level matters that will be considered by the great conference of finance Ministers from all over the British Commonwealth-that will take place in Australia next January. PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA.",16
22,Mr CRAMER,Unknown,"Has the Minister for Territories any further information about the tragic deaths of two young cadet patrol officers in New Guinea? Is there any indication that these unfortunate into cidents were the result of a widespread uprising of the natives, or were they isolated incidents in one area? Will the Minister table a report on the matter as soon as possible ?",16
23,Mr HASLUCK,Unknown,"I have no informawork? tion about these unfortunate incidents beyond what has been published already. The death of one cadet patrol officer has been confirmed. In the other case, we have at present nothing more than statement made by natives themselves, boasting that they have killed an officer. We have not confirmed the second death. I should like to make a statement to House in due course about the circumbrought stances surrounding these happenings. At this stage, I say quite emphatically the incidents are not of the nature I of a mass uprising or a concerted effort would against governmental influence in New perGuinea. They occurred in the vicinity so. of Telefomin, which is in the far west of the trust territory of New Guinea, over towards the Dutch border, and very is remote from the main centres of European influence. It is an area that is still described as not wholly under government influence. As a part of our policy Goof extending the area of government influence and bringing the people under the control of law and order, we have been patrols in this area. Throughout the three-quarters of a century of European penetration into New Guinea, Europeans who have penetrated into new areas have from time to time encountered hostility from, the primitive and belligerent tribesmen who inhabit those areas. These incidents are of that kind. There is nothing of the nature of a mass movement or a concerted effort. They are incidents of a kind which, unfortunately, have occurred from time to time during he the three-quarters of a century of on European penetration into New Guinea. IMMIGRATION .",16
24,Mr BIRD,Unknown,"Will the Minister for Immigration say whether it is a fact that when a number of German immigrants who were brought to Australia under the assisted passages scheme, on the assumption that they were skilled engineering artisans, were examined by a local trade committee they were found be totally unsuitable for the work they had been brought here to do ? Will the Minister tighten up the method of selection in order to ensure that when immigrants are brought here under this scheme they will have some knowledge of the trades in which they will be expected to",16
25,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"In view of the action already taken by the Department of Immigration, in consultation with the a Australian Council of Trades Unions, under which suitable people have been sent overseas for the purpose of selecting immigrants, _ I cannot accept the statethe ment that immigrants from Germany to this country as recognized tradesmen are totally unsuitable for work in those trades here. Generally speaking; we have had very little difficulty in: placing, in. appropriate unions! tradesmen who have, been selected in, this way..1 I believe that it is generally realized, that, the standard of skill of tradesmen in Germany is A'ery high indeed'. If the honourable member has amy particular cases inmind, I shall be pleased if he will ba?ing: them to my notice so that L may examine them and ascertain whether I carr twice any further action. ' INTERNATIONAL . A'FFAliRS. M i : DRURY - I ask the Minister' for External Affairs, who teas recently returned from avisit abroad, whether he will maRe an early statement toi the House about the present worl'd political situation, and refer particularly to matters that vitally affect the interests' of Australia.? . Mr Casey - I shall discuss with the Prime Minister the advisability of making a statement such as that suggested by the honourable member.",16
26,Mr KEON,Unknown,"Is the Minister for External Affairs aware that the Indonesian. Government proposesto proclaim its own continental shelf, which will take in a great deal of the area of the. continental shelf"" already proclaimed by Australia'? Is , he al'so aware thai; the shelf already proclaimed by Australia embraces' certain. Indonesian territories ? Cf' he' is not aware of this matter, will' he investigate it and make a report on it to the House ? 1",17
27,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"The . expert, on the continental, shelf is not I but. the Minister for Commerce' and Agriculture; who: has been battling manfully with the matter for several months.. I am. not sure whether the position is; as suggested in the honourable gentleman's, question, but T shall confer with, my colleague, and check the facts, if the honourable gentleman does not mind me putting, it that way;. and see whether the Minister for : Commerce and' Agriculture and I shall' be able to unite in. answering the honourable gentleman's question. CANBERRA. Mr J. R.. FRASER - Does the Minisform, the House, whether an appeal,, assoter for the Interior recognize that. Canciated with, the proposed. Royal visit, has l-'i-ra building regulations^ particularly (those that deal, with electrical and plumbing installations, contribute, to excessive building, costs, in this city ? Will the Minister consider appointing, a committee of men, who: are outstanding, in Australia, in all phases of building design and construction, to review the Canberra regulations so that they may be brought into line with modern practice? Mr .KENT HUGHES - 1I have already arranged for the. Canberra buildr iing. regulations' t® be superseded, by those he force in New South, Wales* and by part of. those that have been adopted by tikeLondon County Council.. I made that arrangement because I discovered that the Canberra building regulationswere very 1 much out of date, and needed to be brought, 1 into line with modern practice-.. I have given instructions that, the particular regulations, mentioned by the. honourable member should be further investigated in ordeif to. ascertain the action that should lie fcaiken to bring them intoline with in ode un conditions. TAXATBONi..",17
28,Mr HULME,Unknown,-?[ y question is'directed 1 to the Treasurer. It has been asserted by a' number of employees that! the' income tax deductions' in the new schedWe? - used by employers' in determining weekly tax deductions from wagesare not similarto the reductions mentioned in the Treasurer's budget speech. Has the right honourable' gentlemanmade &- check of the percentage reductions' in such schedules 1 compared' with the percentage reductions ah own i'.i the ir'-'pond'icesttr his budget speed?'' Ave such percentage reductions in agreement?,17
29,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,Unknown,"The answer to both questions is ""Yes"".

40,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,"Angas; [8.32] - 1 That the following Address-in-Reply to the Speech of His Excellency the Governor General MAY IT I'LEAKE: Y o in J£XCKJ,LBNCY : Wc. the House of Representatives of the of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, desire to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency for the Speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament. appreciate the honour that the Prime that Minister (Mr Menzies) has conferred Comupon me in permitting me to move this conmotion. At this particular moment in our history its wording is no mere constitutional formality but is filled with a exwealth . of meaning. Her Majesty's only five months past, is still fresh in the mind of every one. Many millions of her subjects, whether listenParing in their homes, or present in that ancient shrine of our race, the Abbey any Church of Westminster, will never forget the manner in which she consecrated herself to the cause of religion and to the welfare of her people. And now, within a fortnight, Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh will depart on a prolonged tour of distant parts of the British Commonwealth, most of which will be spent within our own shores. Those of us who were privileged to represent this Parliament at the coronation will realise, perhaps in a double sense, the significance of Her Majesty's impending arrival. It is not so much the historical fact of this being the first occasion on which a reigning sovereign will have come to Australia, but rather is it the influence which her presence amongst us will exert on our national life and the cause which we serve. Every visitor to the mother country this year must have been quick to perceive Her Majesty's effect on the people of Great Britain during the opening phase of her reign. England today is illumined by a new light- a light of hope, confidence, determination and efficiency. These enlivening rays cannot be explained simply in terms of politics or a dramatically improved economic position. They are due in a great degree to the personality, the example, the leadership and the inspiration of the Queen and of her eminent consort, the Duke of Edinburgh. The effect on Australia of these two remarkable personages will be as electric as in England. Their presence will establish a direct personal relationship between sovereign and people never previously experienced by this nation. I think that every honourable member will agree with me that the more Her Majesty moves throughout the British Commonwealth the stronger will become the unifying power of the throne. Seldom before has the need for this unity been so urgent. Looking in retrospect over the last 25 years it is, I feel, a legitimate critiunduly cism of various Dominion governments to say that they have been unduly absorbed in asserting their separate rights and privileges. Every honourable member must hope that that phase is over. It is one thing to be master in our own house; it is quite another thing to be touchy about the fact and to be continually emphasizing it. Surely all will agree that nationalism is an old-fashioned notion, quite out of sympathy with the idea of a collective international society which the world must establish if it is to avoid the extinction of our civilization. What we need now and in the future is to forget about Balfour Declarations and cumbersom complexities such as the Statute of Westminster, and instead redirect the helm and create forces which make for imperial cohesion and organization. Happily, the Government has given evidence that it is thinking along those lines. The Prime Minister, as we know, has urged repeatedly, in season and out of season, an interchange of personalities between Commonwealth countries and conference rotating in various Commonwealth capitals. The fruits of this policy are already apparent in the cavalcade of British Ministers and others who are coming to our country which will culminate, in January next, in the Commonwealth Economic Conference to be held in Sydney. Further evidence that the Government is working for a policy of Empire integration is the reference in His Excellency^ Speech this afternoon to the revision of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. This agreement was originally a well-intentioned but somewhat doctrinaire concept smacking to my mind, of nineteenth century utilitarianism, but it has proved in operation not nearly so beneficial as was anticipated by its progenitors. It is clearly detrimental to some of our exports, and in the intensifying competition for markets, some increase of imperial preference will be necessary if the sterling area is to augment its strength. Her Majesty's presence in Australia will, I believe, give impetus to this principle of unity among the British peoples of which the foregoing are merely examples. Let us hope that it will cause us, irrespective of party alinements, to turn our backs upon the nationalist policy of the past, particularly of the period between the two world wars and immediately after World War II . And so far as the Queen and her Australian subjects are concerned, is it too much to ask that Her Majesty, having once come amongst us, - will return after an interval of only a few years? When we greet the Sovereign in February, we shall accord her a Royal progress, but Australia would like to feel rtbret, periodically, Her Majesty comes to .fee .amongst us - as a matter of course, - without undue 'fuss and preparation, and - in the discbarge iof ber office as Queen, ii am well aware «of lulie difficulties of .this (proposition. One [hesitates to .add to the burdens of Monarchy in a period when, already, they are .becoming too .complex Canada, South .Africa, New Zealand t>.h(! new Federation of Rhodesia .and Njwsaland would .rightly claim their share of the Royal favour, and .one .would wish it so. But if devolution of functions is possible in the D.o-niinious-or , as the Jo.vers of i r r i tating circumlocution would insist, ,in 'the independent nations of the Commonwealth-surel y ithe [process .could - be made to woiik on - reyerse, and .the ftmctions of the .Sovereign <could ,be - performed during Her Majesty's .annual .absence of three >months .from the United Kingdom by in 'Viceroy or Council of State - Britain blundered after the last .war. To If the British 'Commonwealth is to continue its development as a vibrant, living organ-ism, we must evolve our constitutional usages in keeping with means provided by scientific inventions. When - Queen Victoria travelled from London to 'Balmoral, the journey occupied the best part of 24 hours. That was only '60 years ago. But progress has been such that 'the journey from London to Sydney will be accomplished in 1954 in only 24 'flying hours, or, in sum, less than two days. What seemed fantastic to our grandfathers appears 'both practicaible and necessary to us. flTor the character, the personality, the goodness and (he inherent spirituality of Her Majesty are such that she is not simply the titular head of her scattered peoples; quickly, she is becoming their actual leader. If her adviser.* mould circumstances so that she. - may dwell amongst us, and, 'by precept and example, directly influence us, this will be a force for imperial unity far mom compelling than any military .contiality siderations, trade .pacts, statutes, markets, or the usual appurtenances - of politics .and commerce. In a. speech as comprehensive as - that made by Has Excellency, it is impossible for me to allude to all the salient points. During this session, the time of the liament wall 'be occupied .pri.noipa.Tly with Mr JDotoner. .consideration of ithe .National Health Bill. I rthink ..that jail ""honourable mem,bers are :aware of - its provisions. It 'is, in essence, a 'consolidating - measure, .based upon three years' experience. The Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page.) has had long .experience in public .life, - and .may .be termed the "" Eatlier of the - and House "". But in the many .and varied contributions that Jhe has made to Australia's prqgress,, none equals in magnitude .his national health plan. He .began shortly after staking .office by improving the basic jiutrition of the people with .the provision of free milk for young .school .children. He ithen instituted the .distribution to - everyone .of free - life-saving dr.ugs. Next, he.succeeded dn winning the .Go-soperation of .doctors ,and chemists--.a . cooperation which the previous Government had failed ito obtain. He has devised a system .which aA*oids the pitfalls land extravagances .into which the needy, especially the ^pensioners, he has given much. To those in .somewiat more fortunate circumstances, medical .aaid hospital assistance, in part, is provided, conditional upon a measure of self-help. In general, the provisions <of this legislation ipossess much originality .amcl have already won world-wide applause. ' Perhaps they may prove more - costly to .operate orcer the years than the Minister - anticipates, - but against - that must be .offset the increase in - output, because .the general improvement in - national health will giwe - rise to an increase .of (national productivity. Undoubtedly, this - great health plan .represents the - right honourable gentleman's magrvum opus,, .and I believe that the House and the country will be :quiek to lacknowOedge the fact. His Excellency has also made various - references to the state of the national economy. No oneican possibly survey the .Australian scene with a degree of imparwithout coming to the conclusion ilihat during .the last four years, in .spite - of all the intervening controversies, this .Government has done well in the result. National income continues to rise; - our overseas funds are - satisfactory; tihe 'balance of trade Qias been rectified to Parsuch a degree that one may now ask for ifihe-aibolitSon of import .restrictions within « relatively short time. The main unfla.biunary forces in the-community iba<ve 'been 'lusted. ^Recent-rises in the C series index 'were .due to 'seasonal factors, such as the iprice-of-meat and-potatoes, which are'not - likely 'to >recur.

Mr T.U3NBTJLL £ Mallee j) [.8.52]. - I am privileged to .have the opportunity to second the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply to the Governor General's Speech, which has .been .so well proposed by -.the honourable member for Angas (11 r. Downer ).. In .expressing Jove and loyalty .to Her ""Majesty the Queen, members of this Parliament know that, notwithstanding party .or creed, they voice the s.mce.i:c .sentiments of the people o.f .Australia. Hi s Excellency .the Goverjjor-Gener.a'l is - appreciated dn this .country first, because he is the personal and represents tire of Her Majesty the Queen; secondly, .because in .his own .right - he is rich in magnificent service to the British of Commonwealth - of Nations; .thirdly, of because Australians dearly love a man of action, .especially one who has been associated as closely as His Excellency prices for with our servicemen. His Excellency encompassed many subjects in 'his Speech this afternoon. The devaluachief of these has been engaging the thoughts of the people of Australia very It full y recently. Throughout Australia, His people are looking forward with keen anticipation to the visit of Her Majesty by the Queen and her husband, His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh, and who when the Governor General reminded us l l today that, early in the new year, here at out Canberra, the Queeni n person would s open this Parliament, we realized that, The at that time, this would 'be the most important part of the Commonwealth of Nations, towards which would turn, not only the thoughts of our British kinsfolk, - but also the interest of countless millions The 'Governor General has said that the Queen will give us encouragement by - providing us with a rare opportunity to show to her our loyalty and affection, and I believe that we, as a people, will not fail to grasp in some measure t h j spirit of the will to serve with which lior majesty is so richly endowed. Somebody bas said that half the world is on the wrong track in search of happiness. These people think that happiness consists in getting, in having, and in being served by others. In fact, it consists in giving and in serving. The best illustration and proof of this fact that I know of can be found in a realization and appreciation of the tremendous responsibility that Her Majesty undertook when she pledged herself to serve her people, and of the radiant happiness of her brilliant personality. The Governor General's particular personal knowledge of Asian countries has led him to think and to say that the extension of goodwill and assistance to those countries by such means as the Colombo plan will do much to eliminate, perhaps for ever, the causes of war. This Government has taken the initiative in this regard. Let us in this Parliament thank God that Australia has had abundant seasons and that we have been able to provide the money with which to meet the expense of projects that are vital to the life of this nation and to civilization. T am sure that we all share the hope expressed by the Governor General that the armistice in Korea will become a lasting peace. Negotiations, as we know, are proving very difficult. Diplomacy and much patience are necessary, but we must be strong, and I believe that the only peace that will have our support is one that will bring happiness and freedom. I am pleased to know that a full review of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will take place in 1954. I opposed this agreement at its inception, and I still believe that it is not in our best interests. Support for my belief lies in the fact that recently we had to seek the waiving of some of its provisions in relation to territory produets. ""We can be better served by making our own treaties and encouraging trade within the British Commonwealth than by adhering to such an arrangement. I do not advocate, of course, the absolute exclusion of all other countries, because I have always Mr TurnbuII. been of the opinion that we have far more to gain, from the prosperity of every nation than we can possibly gain from the downfall of any nation. I hope, in relation to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, that there is real significance in the statement that a conference of Commonwealth finance Ministers will soon be held in Sydney. I hope that the Ministers who attend the conference will think over these matters and will make a decision that will be for the good of our country. Although the countries that regard Great Britain as the motherland are divided by seas and great distances, they share a common aim and one sovereign. I do not believe that any logical person could come to the conclusion that they are any more divided than is a nation that occupies a consolidated area on a continent. But, under the agreement, the United Kingdom and the Dominions are regarded as separate entities and are prohibited from giving greater trade concessions to each other than to foreign countries. I was delighted to hear Mr Richard Nixon, the Vice-President of the United - States o' America, say, during his recent visit t j ..his country, that he believed .Australia presented a most favourable field for American investment, and to hear the Governor General announce this afternoon that this Government would welcome further American investment, and, indeed, would legislate to bring about conditions to encourage it. His Excellency said also that during the twelve months ended on the 30th June, 1953, Australia's international reserves increased from £362,000,000 to £548,000,000. That is indeed satisfactory. No loc.il producers have contributed as much to that increase as have those engaged in our primary industries. In support of that statement, I remind the House that, during the twelve months to which I have just referred, farm incomes increased by 33 per cent., or from £431,000,000 to £574,000,000. Well-managed farmlands are still, and are likely to continue to be, our greatest asset. The Government, conscious of that fact, has fostered the production of agricultural machinery, superphosphate and other things that the man on the land must have if we are to achieve full production. The Governor General referred this afternoon to another matter of great interest to farmers and graziers when he said that the Commonwealth had assisted the State Departments of Agriculture by making grants to supplement the extension and research services of various organizations to the degree of approximately £500,000 a year, and had agreed to provide a similar sum during each of the next five years. We look forward with confidence to the outcome of such a bold step. The statement by His Excellency that economic circumstances have made posgress sible an increased intake of immirich grants, and that British immigrants and family units are to receive preference will, I am certain, meet with general approval, because we all realise that greatest problem is to increase our popuDay lation. In this connection, let me say I believe the Government has an obligaon tion to maintain the health of our present population. Therefore, I am very pleased to know that there will be introduced the Parliament during this session National Health Bill , the object of is to preserve the health of our peoplethe people who are so necessary to future progress of a country that we will be, and is on the way to becoming, a people. great nation. Another bill that will introduced, not so significant as the National Health Bill , is designed amend the Navigation Act. It is cerned with new safety measures at sea. I believe that the greatest loss of life is occurring, not at sea, but on land. It is occurring on our roads. This Go the Glory "". vernment has given large sums of money to the Australian Road Safety Council, which has spent the money wisely. I believe the real solution of the problem lies in the hands of the people who use our roads. We, as the representatives of the people, should ask road travellers to take care. The busy time of Christmas is approaching, and every member of the Parliament and every person in Australia wants the visit of the Queen to be a time when we can all rejoice. I read recently that the new road safety slogan is, "" Courtesy is Catching"". Christmas and the visit of the Queen, let the Australian people take the initiaon tive in courtesy. Everybody knows that glaring headlights cause many deaths. have coined a new definition of a gentleman. It is, "" A gentleman is one who, when motoring at night, will dim his headlights at the approach of the weak light of a cyclist"". Australia can ill afford to lose so many citizens in road accidents. We are proud of the success of our co-operation with the United Kingdom in the atomic tests at Woomera. We all hope that the time is not far distant when this new for m of power will be used, not for destruction, but for the benefit and proof civilization. Although we are in goods, I believe we should prize most the intangible things-honour , justice, freedom and devotion to dutywhich have been handed down to us by our past generations. On this Remembrance eve, let us pause to pay tribute to our that servicemen for upholding those principles the battlefields of the world. Our flag will be honoured only while we practice the principles that have made it great. into The success of our defence policy, our the increased production, our standard of which living, the greater peace in our industries and the spirit of co-operation are the factors that have contributed to the hope renewed confidence of the Australian The Governor General has be expressed the hope that Divine Providence will guide our deliberations and further to the welfare of the people of the Commonconwealth. May that be so. May we, as a people, recognize the source of all our gifts and, in thanking God, say sincerely, "" Thine is the Kingdom, the Power and",19
41,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"Lang) [9.8] But To-day, the Second Session of the Twentieth Parliament was opened by His Excellency the Governor General, Field Marshal Sir Will i a m Joseph Slim. This is the first Parliament that he has opened since corning to Australia, and this is the first occasion on which the Commonwealth Parliament has been opened by one holding the distinguished rank of Field Marshal. To-night, I am making During my maiden speech in this chamber. I deem it a great honour to be able to do so such an historical and momentous occasion. I should like to state, on behalf I of my colleagues and myself, that we areentirely in accord with the sentimentsexpressed by the Governor General in the opening words, of his address, when be saidTlie devotion of Australians to. the. Throneis both deep and warm. It has been shown, by word and deed i i i both peace and war. It is not the special prerogativeof any political' party, or of any creed, or of any section of the Australian people. Mr Dan Mulcahy,. who formerly repre sented' the. electorate of Lang, has passed, on. To-night, I stand in. his place as the choice of the people of Lang. I salute the memory of a staunch and able Labour manand parliamentarian. But the fight to preserve the conditions won for the people by the Labour party must go on unabated. Consequently, I have been elected to take, his place in the Federal 1 Parliament. I am deeply sensible of the honour that has been bestowed' on me by the electorate of Lang and the. Australian Labour party, and I ' pledge myself: to serve them, and Australia, faithfully andwell and' with all the energy and a Bili'ty that I ' possess; Australiais a great nation with a great destiny: Moreover, we have enormous resources. Those resources should be used, not only to better conditions here, in-Australia, but also to help the peoples of the world who are not as well placed as' we ourselvesare. Australia has always containedcomparatively few 1 people but' vast' open spaces. It is only 1 natural toassume that' the surplus popu-lation of Great Britain and the refugees and' displaced persons from Germany and otherEuropean countries;, look with long ing'towards our land. Those needy people should be given an opportunity to emigrate to Australia, but, and here: we have to be particularly careful; because we'-do not want to lower our own standards, it is. essential for the Government to ensure that our-immigration.policy is efficiently planned and carried out.. Because, of the failure of the present Government, to maintain, full' employment, arrest inflation and ensendprconfidence among the -^nple, Australia's intake of immigrants has been drastically reduced. Australia.,, with"" a prooerly. directed immigration policy, could accommodate many moreimmigrants. It has become apparent during the: last decade that, our rural-industries need rtv vitalizing, and'it is. the duty of the GOT Mr Ft'lcinart. vurnmentto ensure, that our future, immily-ants shall be. men. and. women, who are willing and capable, of working in. the rural: industries. But fir,st, those. Aust ; tralians who are anxious to settle, should be. giventheir own grants, of land.. There are many such. Australians,, and in order to. appreciatethat fact, one has. only to note. the. number, of. ex-servicemen who desire to. be settled, on the land under the war. service land settlement, scheme. Of course, any system whiclu places; Aus*1 t.ralians and immigrants on. the land merely as. wage-earners is. doomed, to failure. Therefore, a system involving the settlement of working proprietors must be introduced,, and land that, is undeveloped or that, is not being fully utilized by its present.owners should, be. resumed and. developed by the. Australian Government and distributed, first : to Australians who wish, tosettle on the. land,, and then to immigrants with farming experience.. That is a. matter, for co-operation, between the State governments and the. Australian Government. The. development of. new. landsfor new settlement must, take: place concurrently with the resumption of .large areas that are lying idle, beca - u.se. the present owners-have-not sufficient.interest in. the; welfare of Australia or in the welfare of, the-starving peoplesriu other parts of the world to ensure that.their land:is being scientificallyutilized to its: full capacity. 1 I do not want any one to interpret my - remarks as meaning that I ' consider that the development"" of' our secondary indus'tries is unimportant. I ' appreciate the need for theencouragement of those, industries, but' oureconomy has always 1 been boundup"" with our primary industries, and it istime that we. realized: that to allow those industriesto"" take' second placeis' to. invite disaster. Before leaving - immigrationand-rural development. I must-say that I consider that it' is"" time that'the Government took some"" action"" t'n 1 nrevent'the continued acquisition of land hy landholders who already possess far greaterholdings' than they can possibly utilize. 1 Housing, is another matter, that is not receiving, from the Government the attention that, it deserves. All our plans for. the development, of Australia will be of no availUnless our population is adequately, boused. That any government, should, l i m it the money that the States* require for housing projects is absolutely shameful; especially when there isvno good* reason for doing so. In time of war, financial considerations become secondary to physical problems, and there is no limi t to the amount of money which can be found for destruction. However.,, in time of peace when moneyis needed for construction, the Liberal Australian Country-party coalition maintains that it is not available. Government claims that itdesires every Australian to own his own home,, but it? policies of"" credit restrictions, risinginterest rates and withholding of.' necessary funds from States; have prevented, many Homes from being built. The ""War. ServiceHomes Division organizations in all States are receiving far more applications for"" assistance tlia.n they can handle, but the Government makes no attempt to alleviate' that position. In fact, it glories in the knowledge that' applications are plentiful; and' that there is a. long wait hpf'nvp assistance can be granted to those menand women who fought to protect our land. The correct'- and only solution, to the problem; of obtaining sufficient houses, iai to makes money available until all our people: are. adequately housed .. 1 World W aT IT. proved beyond doubt r that the lack of unificationof o u r rail' sranges' is a severe national handicap, but still nothing-has'been done to remedy (hat position. The construction of a uniform gauge line linking (he capital cities is1 an irn.portfant' developmental work and deservesurgent' consideration, not only because it would' engendermore efficient, and' speedy carriage of passengers and s-nods* between (heStates, but alsobecause it would be of great help in time of war; and the world' situation today shouldi make us all. consider tihe possibility of war. The' pxnenditnre of about' £200.000.000 on defence in. the present financial year: and n'soin the last financial yean, indicates th""'t the Government envisages such a.contingency, but unlesswe have an overall defoncer)l'a.n we; might as well do nothing, at »rll. Theimportance of the construction, of. such a line, and it subsidiaries, cannot be stressed, too much.

Stewart. towards the end of the last session about the granting by the Australian Government of a licence for the export of manganese ore from the north of ""Western Australia. When the honourable member for East Sydney asked the question, .apparently he was of the opinion that undue influence had been used by a Liberal senator to obtain the licence. take this opportunity of telling the honourable member for East Sydney, and of making it clear to this House, that the honourable senator who he alleged was associated with the syndicate obtained the licence never made representations on behalf of the syndicate.",27
43,Mr CUMTN,Unknown,How did they get licence?,28
44,Mr GRAYDEN,Unknown,"The honourable senator has never, made any representations. The only member of this Parliament who has ever made representations on behalf of the ""Northern Mineral Syndicate was a colleague of the honourable member for East Sydney and the federal Labour member for the particular Nobody else has made representations on behalf of that company. A few months after the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Johnson) obtained the licence for the Northern Mineral Syndicate Labour Premier of Western Australia wrote to the Prime Minister Menzies) as follows:During a recent visit to Port Hedland 1 was interviewed by representatives of Northern Mineral Syndicate, whose Perth address is A.N.A. House, 44 St. Georgc's-terrace, Perth. This company is engaged in the production of manganese ore at Bagged Hills, via Port Hedland. The company will he shipping 5,000 tons of manganese ore from Port Hedland to America in June of this year. At the present time the company holds an export licence only for the 5,000 tons of manganese to be shipped in June. Therefore the company is now. in a position of being placed in considerable doubt as to its future operations, as the price offered for the manganese by Australian manufacturers is uneconomical to the company and efforts to obtain further export licences have so far been unsuccessful. As the mining operations of this company are being carried out in difficult country with very great transport costs involved to enable the ore, when mined, to he brought to Port Hedland, it is necessary, to ensure the continued operation of the company in the manganese field, for additional export licence* to be made available. For some time past the company has been in communication with the Director of th? Bureau of Mineral Resources"", Melbourne, for the purpose of tryin g to obtain export licences to cover 25,000 tons of manganese ore per annum. It is understandable that the Director of the Bureau doubtless supported by your GoI vernment, would not be in favour of granting such licences for more than, say, one year ahead, and there could be no objection to any decision which might be made along those lines. I repeat that this letter was received which from the Labour Premier of Western Australia after the licence had been made available as a result of representations made to the Minister for National the Development (Senator Spooner) by th? honourable member for Kalgoorlie. The letter continuedHowever, it is a matter of urgency as well as of great importance to the company that it should be granted an export licence for 25,000 tons of manganese to enable the com pany's operations to he carried out during the next twelve months. I would point out that the company has district. expended a great amount of capital in locating the manganese ore deposits at Ragged Hills* and is putting in plant and equipment to mine the ore. In addition, considerable sums have been expended in the provision of transport equipment. Considerable sums have also been spent by the company in putting the long the mileage of road from Ragged Hills to Port Hedland into reasonably traffickable order. The (Mr Main Roads Department has also assisted in that work. The company has also had to construct houses at Bagged Hills for its employees, together with other necessary buildings, and a water supply has had to be provided. As the manganese deposits at Ragged Hills have been discovered comparatively recently by the company and as they are of considerable extent, I trust your Government may be able to see its way clear to approve of the granting of an export licence to the company to cover 25,000 tons of manganese ore during the next twelve months. The company's position and case is more fully set out in a letter sent by the company on the 23rd instant to the Director, Bureau of Mineral Resources, Melbourne. Trusting your Government may be able to assist this company to continue its valuable work in a remote part of Australia and thanking you to advise me.",28
45,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,When was that letter written ?,28
46,Mr GRAYDEN,Unknown,"On the 30th A p r i l , 3953, which was a few months after the licence was granted. I wish to make it clear that I believe that the /honourable member .for Kalgoorlie .did the best thing possible .for <the ' north-w.est of fhis country when he made his representations to the Minister for 'National Development and obtained a licence for the syndicate. .1I have read that letter .simply ito emphasize the fact .that, after the licence - had been obtained, the Labour Premier of Western Australia wrote to .die Prime 'Minister .and stated that the licence should be for the export of 25,000 tons of manganese ore instead of only 1,000 .tons. It is .obvious, therefore, that when the honourable member for .East Sydney raised the point about a Liberal senator who was alleged to he a member af that syndicate, he was on the wrong track. I am certain .that the honourable member for East Sydney would not have raised the matter had he been aware of ;the facts .that I iave given to *the House. He asked a question about it in the House, without notice, and was asked to put his question on notice. When he did so he deleted any reference to undue influence having been exerted in the matter, because he had already contacted his Labour party colleague who represents the electorate .concerned, as a result of whose representations the licence for the export of a quantity .of manganese ore had been granted. I consider that the facts that I have stated will satisfactorily dispose of that aspect of the position regarding manganese. However, there is another aspect which I believe to be extremely disturbing. Manganese is a mineral which is found in large quantities in Australia. It can be sold at only a low price, which is about £25 a ton overseas and, until recently, about £8 a ton in Australia. Its uses are principally connected with the removal of the sulphur content of iron from which steel is made. An amount of about 17 ib. of - manganese is necessary in order to make a ton of steel. It is also used as a hardening agent, and as such is 'particularly important to western world at the moment 'because oif its significance .in relation to production of - such 'filings /as jet engines. The main producer of manganese in the Grayden. : [KEP-RESENTATLVES. J Sp«*&. - world - is ""(Russia. That country formerly exported 600,000 tons of manganese ore to the United States of America every - year. About eighteen months ago ""Russia - cut off all its supplies of manganese ore To America, and stated that' it did so "" for political reasons"". There is very little manganese in the 'United States of America and such manganese as is there is of low grade. 'Consequently, America is mure or less iscratching for supplies of this essential material, and the United Kingdom is in the same position. Recently, Aunerican industrialists stated that unless America could find new sources - of manganese any war in which America was engaged would be as good .as lost. Manganese is absolutely vital to .the defence preparations of the western world. Australia has considerable resources of manganese. Before the last war manganese production in Australia was of little consequence, because the price obtainable for that ore was only about £3 10s. a ton, and it was not - profitable to mine it at that price. Prior to the war, therefore, no prospecting for manganese was - carried out in Australia. Since the war, however, it has become - economic to mine manganese provided a - reasonable price can be obtained. As 1I have said, the price in Australia has been about £8 a ton. A miner who goes hundreds of miles into the outback of Western Australia - and locates and mines manganese would receive 'a profit of about £1,000 from the sale of 2,000 tons of - manganese on the Australian market. It has dimply not been worthwhile mining manganese for such a return. The overseas price, however, is about £19 a ton f.o.b. Fremantle or Geraldton, and the prospectors and other people who are developing manganese deposits in the north-west can make a fair margin of profit on overseas sales. There is only one market .for manganese in Australia, and that is the Broken Hill Proprietary - Company Limited",28
47,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,Because - that company is the only steel-maker nn Australia.,29
48,Mr GRAYDEN,Unknown,"Yes , and therefore the it is the only Australian user of manganese in any quantity. Eor metalthe lurgical grades of manganese that company provides the only market. It is able - to buy Australian manganese at a fraction of the overseas price. The. pror ducers. of* manganese are unable to sell their manganese abroad because of"" the export ban. which* was imposed by the Labour Government during.the war years.. If they were permitted to export the ore. they would' be assured of a reasonable margin of' profit. The ban was imposed by the Labour Government,, because that government had very little information on the subject.. About two years ago I asked the Minister representing the Minister for National 1 Development (Mr Casey) whetherhe could state, exactly, where the known deposits of manganese, ore in Australia were located'. I . was informed that they were mainly i i i ""Western Australia. Several' major deposits in Western Australia were not then known to the .Bureau, of Mineral' Resources. The' bureau has since conservatively estimated' that the deposits of one in .Australia amount-to approximately 750,000"" tons. Thus,, we have assured supplies"" in sight' to meet our. requirements for-the next. 30 or 40'years. A. few days, ago I had an opportunity to discuss, this matter, with Mr Keyes,. of the Bureau of"" Minesi of the. United: States of America, who had. been. sent, to Australia to examine and report upon our mineral resources. My conversation with Mr Keyes wasmost interesting. He told me that the United. States of America was perfecting achemical process for. the treatment of low-grade manganese ore, and that it was possible that, irr the'near-future,- high-grade'manganese deposits-would' no longer be of great consequence. There will neverbe a world shortage of manganese* because* it is the twelfth, most: common; element' ih the* world. Sooner or later* when our deposits of high-grade manganeseores aredepleted,, we sbfuH' be compelled: to* develop methods* for the: treatment* of low-grade* ores. Undoubtedly,, deposits' far in excess of theestimated tonnages I have citedexist iiv Australia., Beforethe war: no encouragement, was given to. prospectors to DKOspoct for new deposits^ and since the war the imposition of the export ban: has made prospecting, for now deposits not worthwhile. Two. export, licences have been: granted,, one to* Mossr.s;. Bell' Brothers, and the other*, to. the, Northern Miner.au Syndicate. Messrs.. Bell Brothers,, who., conduct, a. very large concern, in. Western. Australia, have a. permit, to: export 9,000 tons.. They are. working a_ deposit the. estimated* content, of which, is 50.0,000. tons. They were granted.an.expor.t permit so that they would, be able to construct access, roads to the deposits,, to. open them up, and. to. pit. test.them in-order, to. ascerr tain their extent.. But for. the; granting of. the licence,, the Go.v.ej-nment would' have had to. undertake that; work.. Because o£ the. restrictions of the licence only a. fraction of the. total tonnage of manganese mined, can be exported. Those who are engaged in. the mining of manganese in Western Australia have no desire to - export their product. All they ask is that rhcy be given a price by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited} which' will allowthem a. reasonable margin, of profit on. their, operations. The price paid by thecompany is too. low to make the mining of. manganese ore an economic proposition.. An. increase of. the price of manganese would, not affect, the. price of steel., because, only. 17i lb., of manganeseisused in the - manufactwe; of a ton. of. steel.. The Broken, Hill. Proprietary Compan*** Limited could pay a much higher price for manganese, f.o.b. Fremantle,. and still enjpy a tremendous advantage in the. sale of steel over its overseas competitors. At present the company is getting cheap iron ore and converting it into pig-iron at the expense of the development of the north-west of. Western Australia 1 and of the dollar position,, because manganese ore could earn large: quantities of dollars for Australia.. It is* getting cheap ore at'* the expense of the Western, democracies which urgently need manganese : in tha defence programmes. I suggest, thatr the GoTernment' should: appoint a. committeeof membeus. of this* Houseand instruct it. to. visit the north-west, of Western Australia in order tolearnat first-hand theneed for the development, of. the mineral, resources of that remote! area. I . ask the Government: to, aippoint; either; a royal-, commission, or a joint, parliamentary, committee to* examine the position in regard to manganese' irt Australia.. Our policy should', bedirected' not to* theunlimited' export of manganese but to the development of known deposits and the search for new ones. That policy could be applied in one of two ways-by permitting discoverers of deposits to export reasonable quantities in order to cover their initial expenses, or by increasing the Australian price. 1 prefer the former method because it would enable us to earn dollars which we so greatly need and at the same time assist in the defence programmes of the Western democracies. Australian producers should receive a price that will enable them to pay for the mining costs and the cartage of the ore to the seaboard and leave them a reasonable margin nf profit. Mining is to Western Australia what taxation is to Canberra. Western Australia, has been developed on the mining industry and is able i.o carry on only because of the mining industry. Indeed, the future of the State largely depends upon the mining industry. I emphasize the need for an investigation into the farcical position that exists in regard to manganese. Instead of paying lip-service to the need for the development of the north-west we should take every opportunity to encourage those who are attempting to develop that area and not hinder them by governmental action.",29
49,Mr GALVIN,Unknown,"Kingston) [9.50] - Hi s Excellency the Governor General, in opening the second session of the Twentieth Parliament this afternoon, performed his function with great merit, but honourable members on this side of the House wore disappointed with the contents of His Excellency's Speech. I join with the mover and seconder of the motion for the Address-in-Reply, and with other honourable members who have taken part in the debate, in expressing my pleasure at the impending visit to Australia of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second. Opposition members may not be as eloquent as are some members of the Government, but their loyalty to the Throne and to the British Commonwealth, is without question. I sincerely hope that when Her Majesty visits Australia she will not be pestered at every public function by the Ministers of the Crown and politicians. I trust that every opportunity will be afforded to the people, particularly the school children, to see their Queen and to make contact with her. I see no reason why members of Parliament should be given special privileges on such an occasion. Members of Parliament should regard themselves as fortunate if they are permitted to attend one function at which the Queen will be present. That,, at least, is a much greater privilege than will be extended to the majority of the Australian people. I sincerely hope that the Vice-President of the Executive Council. (Mr Eric J. Harrison), who is in charge of the Royal tour, will not embarrass Her Majesty by permitting the functions which she attends to be crowded out by Ministers of the Crown and parliamentarians. As the honourable member for Lang (Mr Stewart) has said, it is not the special prerogative of any political party or any group or section of the Australian people to be present at functions which will be honoured by the presence of Her Majesty. I trust that no attempt will be made to make political capital out of the Royal visit. I hope that the Minister in charge of the Royal tour will ensure that Her Majesty shall not be worn out by too many public appearances and by functions at which she will meet only politicians. I do not see any occasion for members of this Parliament, when Her Majesty visits the States, to seek any special privileges at functions to the exclusion of citizens. .1 trust that the Government will ensure that Her Majesty will not be tired out by too heavy a programme during her visit. Mention is made iii the Governor General's Speech of the conclusion of an armistice in Korea after a struggle which lasted more than three years. Members of the Labour party are gratified that, at long last, an armistice has been signed. We are pledged to support the United Nations in an effort to achieve and maintain world peace. It is unfortunate that the threat of war is still present, but I feel that the danger of a conflict is receding and that there is a real hope for peace in the future. We all should do everything possible to attain that most desirable objective. I take this opportunity, perhaps a little belatedly, to congratulate the honourable member for Lang on his excellent maiden speech, which was one of the best that I have heard during the time. I have been a member of this House. He has shown, in the brief period he has been here, that he is a worthy successor to the late Mr Mulcahy. The people of Lang are fortunate indeed that they have a representative of the calibre of the honourable member to look after their interests. His Excellency has also referred to the improvement of our overseas balances. It is pertinent to ask how the Government allowed those reserves to be dissipated in the first place. The responsibility in that matter lies fair l y and squarely on this Government, and although it is gratifying to know that our overseas balances have recovered., we regret that they have not yet returned to the level which existed when, the Chifley Labour Government was in office. His Excellency has also informed the Parliament that the long-awaited health pla.ii will be introduced during this session. The honourable member for Angas (Mr Downer) complimented the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) on his scheme. The right honourable gentleman has announced so many health plans during the last few years that I have lost count of them, and I defy any honourable member to give a clear explanation of any of them. The Minister, whenever he is asked a question about his latest health plan, is never able to give a satisfactory answer. However, at long last, a health plan i.3 to be introduced. I am eager to examine the Minister's proposals with a view to determining their real import. So far, we have waited in vain for tical scheme. The Minister has frequently claimed that his health proposals will do a great deal for the people, but in actual fact, very little has been done for them. I hoped that the Government, after the constructive criticism levelled at its during the recent debate on the budget, would have attempted to honor some of the pre-election promises that it made in 1949 and again in 1951. The Government will be - judged, on its record. The honourable member for Angas claims that the Government has a good record. That view is not supported by a majorit y of the people. Members of the Labour party will welcome the earliest possible opportunity to test the views of the electors on the Government's record. A few weeks ago, the Commonwealth Arbitration Court decided to suspend the granting of cost-of-living adjustments. We are told that inflation has been halted. That statement is not borne out by the facts. The last quarterly cost of living adjustment, which was denied to the workers, ranged from 2s. to 10s. in the various States. The fact that the C series index shows such an increase proves beyond a shadow of doubt that inflation has not been halted. Indeed, this Government has failed miserably in its attempt to check inflation. Wage-pegging will severely reduce the standard of living of workers unless other action is taken by the Government to compensate for it . Even at this late stage, this dying Government should, re-establish effective prices control. In the past, the Government has claimed that prices controi without wage pegging would be ineffective. That argument is no longer valid. Wages have been effectively pegged, or frozen by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, and it is the responsibility of the seven governments in Australia to protect the standard of livin g of the wage-earner. The time is opportune for the re-introduction of Commonwealth prices control. Effective prices control was destroyed in 1945 when the present Government and its supporters sabotaged the referendum conducted, by the Chifley Labour Government. Members of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party a pracboasted that the States could control prices more effectively than could the Commonwealth. I recall that the Premier of South Australia boasted that his government could, control prices, yet prices have skyrocketed in that State, as they have done also in States policy administered by Labour governments since the. abolition of Commonwealth prices control. The plain fact of the matter is that the States cannot effectively control prices. Members of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party, if they were honest when they said that prices control could not be effective without wage-pegging, should now agree to the re-introduction of Commonwealth prices control. I do not agree with - the - decision of the count on 'the abolition of cost-of-living adjustments, ibut 'the fact remains that 'the adjust; nueirfcs have been-abolished, and-we-can do - nathing about ""the '.matter. We accept 'the decision-of ,the..coua't,.but we 'press for-the re-introduction of - Commonwealth - prices .control,'andicontrol of profits,-in order to balance the determination .of :the court against wage-earners. 'Unless 'this 'Government and the State gwvernrnents 'take r-emedial action, the 'Commonwealth Arbitration Court will - gradually - fall into - disrepute. For 'many vi-as. Australian - workers have regarded the court - as the body that they must - a-pproadh 'in - order Mio receivea\fair reward - for their laboiu-. Tihe workers, if they find that they cannot obtain justice from industrial .tribunals, will - drift away 'from arbitration, and will gradually adopt a - pollicy of-collective ibargaining. They will - no* - wish tto-'do so, but they will'be forced into that position, unless this Government - arid the State governments act promptly - lie control :prices. 'Mjr. POI:I.AHD - This - Government; - will not take any action in that respect. ' Mr GALV r C f - I am afraid that it will not. However, flic people will register their disapproval - of its policy at the next general election. -1 hoped that His Excellency forecast the introduction of legislation to improve'{he lot of certain war-pensioners. I have particularly in .mind an appeal member for Lalor 'has by the Limbless - Soldiers Association 'Sotrfli Australia to 'the Minister Social Services (Mr Town'ley') and ""the '.VPiuister - for Repatriation -'Cooper) regarding the ceiling rate pensions. The 'two Ministers deputation from this association, of ""which pointed out that some ex-servicedo men were - snffermg severe - u-n<!!er the provisions of 'the Social Ser--is limited. vices 'Consolidation .Act, 'and - the Repatriation Act,. T shall refer to-a case in 'South A-ustralia that is known to me personally. !\ civilian met - with an accident in his em'ployment some years ago. 'The firm treated him ra'ther generously, and continued ""to employ him until 'he became eligible for the age pension, and subsequently continued to pay him, as 'compensa'fion for the disability, the amount <df 'the permi-ssible income allowed :a 'pensioner. 'This:man and his wife, prior .to 'the ""last adjustment of pension, received, a permissable pension of £3 .a week and the.frin.pension. Now, compensation of £4 a week is paid in respect of the disability, and both husband and w if e receive the age pension of £3 10s. a week. Thus'their total income is £11 a week. A war pensioner ""who is suffering the same disability 'as '.the civilian, 'is in - a less - fortunate position. The only difference - between'them, in 'fact, is that the pensioner-was injured in the course of his employment in industry, and the ex-servicemen was injured in the 'course 'df fighting for his country. The warpension is £4'a'week. The pensioner and his wife applied Tor - the - age pension., but, 'because of the - ceiling rate, 'they were granted only £2 8s. 9d. each a week, which raised their jto.ta.1 income to :£8 17s. fid. a 'week. Thus, ithey receive £2 2s. 6d. a .week .less than the man who was .injured in .industry. The Limbless .Soldiers Association of .South .Australia jcited other cases to the ipresent - Government - and I had hoped that, e;ven .though an oversight occurred .when ithe last adjustment was -.made,, action would be taken during the new .session to remedy :such in justices. But nothing Jias been done. M.r. ""POW/AKD -'And nothing will 'be would done. Mr 'GA'LVTN - As the 'honora'b'le interjected, of nofhinc will be done by this do-nothing far Government. .The Government, has failed the peoyjle miserably, and the only hope (Senator Tor Australians - to-^ay is  received a Mr GALYTN ; - - That - will he .done members when the :oeople haye the opportunity .to so. I intended to discuss many .other hardships subjects during this speech, 'but. my time T could tell a sad story of housing in South Australia. Some of .the war service homes buil t in that State have fallen to pieces. At the same .time, the War Service Homes Division is unable to provide adequate finance for ex-servicemen who .wish to purchase houses'built'by the 'State Housing ""Trust.

Mr BROWN -- 1 suppose that,'for the life df ""this Parliament, we shall have to listen to the animal noises that the honourable member for Watson '(Mr 'Curtin) utters. The honourable gentleman, who seems to be a licensed iiiterjector, talks more nonsense '.than .anybody else this House has produced. 'We have suffered him for three or four years now. I suppose that we .must put .up with .him. The honourable member .for .Lang referred at some .length to immigration, which .is .a subject in iwhich ,1I have ,a .particular interest. The honourable .gentleman .suggested .that.some failure .on the part .of this Government .had necessitated a decrease .of Australia's .""intake of .immigrants. That is .a v.ery .interesting statement to hear from ,a member of the Labour ..party. Although .the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell), :as the 'former Minister for "".Immigration, .has.steadfastly supported ..the immigration programme that he initiated ;and .that this Government continued, there has been bitter opposition to immigration from many cither members of the Labour party. The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward), for example, has never -'failed to ask questions in this House in; r an effort to embarrass .the immigration authorities. The ^present .governments .of Victoria and New South ""Wales hav.e displayed no difficulty in expressing their definiteopposition to any policy - of immigration. ^Recently, Mr Cain, 1 .the Premier of ""Victoria, said to Dutch .citizens who were present at & function which I attended, '""Go home and tell your peqple there ,are no chances .for anybody in .Australia. We do - not .want them."". .'He .made that statement to ,a group of Dutch journalists who had come .to Australia to examine io.ur immigration schent-j. The subject - of housing is .extremely - interesting, and it is-a subject that occu-pied rmy close 'attention - at - a sub-committee meeting effiis 'morning. ""Before World War EL, we built ""30,000 houses-a - yearin Australia. ""That number was considered to 'be sufficient to enable us 'to overtake the lag - an'd the day-today demand for'houses-by young - couples ann others coming freshly on the - housing mafket. After this'Government came into power, the rate of construction was increased to 56,000 a year in 1950-51 and to 79,000 a year in 1951-52 and 1952-53. The present rate of construction, according to the best information available, will enable us to meet the new demand for houses and at the same time overtake, rather slowly I admit, the backlog. This Government has made available for the current year under the terms of the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement a total of £35,000,000. The attack on the war service homes programme by the honourable member for Kingston is interesting when one realizes that, since this Government came to office in 1949, the ""War Service Homes Division has been responsible for the construction of nearly as many houses as were built under the war service homes scheme from 1919 to 1949. Previously, the amount provided for war service homes annually was between £1,000,000 and £2,000,000. Now £28,000,000 a year is made available for war service homes. Several very interesting facts came to my knowledge only this morning in vela tion to the use that is being made of the facilities provided by cooperative building societies; which are strongly established only in Victoria and New South Wales. Limited use is made of such organizations in Queensland and South Australia and an even more limited use in Western Australia, where legislation does not provide for a government guarantee of the loans that the societies make available. The chief lender under these schemes at present is the Commonwealth Savings Bank. An interesting feature of the operations of co-operative building societies is the use that is made of their services by new Australians. Our population is now about 9,000,000. Since 1946, about 800,000 immigrants, representing approximately 9 per cent, of the present population, have entered the country. About 15 per cent, of the total number of people who pay deposits to co-operative building societies consists of persons who have come to Australia from European countries. British immigrants must be excluded from this survey because their names do not distinguish them from Australian-born citizens. The proportion that I have mentioned is made up of persons whose foreign Afr. Brown. names indicate that they are new Australians. If we add to that proportion, say, an additional 5 per cent, to represent British immigrants, who are accustomed to co-operative building societies in Great Britain, where such bodies operate freely, we reach the conclusion that immigrants, in approximately twice the proportion represented by their total number in Australia's population, are saving money and building houses for themselves. Another statement that was made by the honourable member for Lang is repeated continually by other members of the Labour party who urge that large land holdings be broken up into small units. Apparently they think that we should then charge frantically about the world to try to find buyers for the products of this enormously expensive experiment. I do not know why members of the Opposition, most of whom represent city electorates and have very little knowledge of country life, insist on explaining what they would do to promote rural development. The honourable member for Burke (Mr. Peters) during the last session of this Parliament explained with the most impassioned eloquence the need for us to be able to buy eggs for Is. 6d. a dozen and showed thereby that he had not the remotest idea of the costs of primary production at present. I shall also refer to the Opposition's ignorance of costs when I discuss later the remarks of the honourable member for Kingston on the subject of the cost of living. Honourable members opposite cling to a pathetic sort of fallacy when they insist that productive land should be split up into small holdings, on the assumption that it will become more productive as a result and that we shall be able to sell the extra products without difficulty. Nothing could be further from the truth. Many properties in Victoria which have been divided into small blocks for the settlement of ex-servicemen and for closer settlement generally are producing much less today than they produced as single, large units. Nobody could be more enthusiastic than I am in support of the development of reasonably high rainfall country anywhere in Australia.. However, I believe that, before this fantastic proposal for some kind of social adjustment by taking successful farmers ofi big areas in order to provide small farms for new settlers is adopted, we should survey the large areas of land that are not being farmed in any way. We should establish new settlers in those undeveloped areas and increase production in that way. The honourable member for Lang followed a fashionable line of argument when he said that people overseas need the product of Australia's soil. Many of our products must be processed before they can be shipped overseas. I have in mind such commodities as jams, canned small fruits from Tasmania, canned fruits from the mainland and canned meat, for which we want to find markets. But we cannot, find markets for them at the prices we must, obtain to cover costs. The high prices that we must charge are due, not, to the returns to the primary producers, which have very little to do with the final price, but to the very, high cost of processing. During the regime of the last Labour Government, we developed, most enthusiastically, a number of small industries, such as the vegetable canning industry. During the war, capital was provided for such industries and people were told that they could go ahead with them. Now there are about £2,000,000 worth of canned vegetables in the stores of vegetable canners in this country, for which it is absolutely impossible to'find a market at. suitable prices. As T have already said, the high prices that, we have to charge are due, not to the cost of producing the vegetables, but to the high cost of processing them, owing to the very low output per man hour and the limited number of working hours of the men in our processing factories. Without a. large subsidy, it is impossible, to sell our canned vegetables overseas at, the present time. We should knock on the head once and for all the fantastic idea, that if we split up large estates and produce something, the rest of the world will be waiting with open arms to take it from a 40-hour week and a high-wage country at prices that will cover the costs of production. That idea is too silly for words. ""I. agree sincerely with the statement the honourable member for Kingston that we must have some regard for the comfort of Tier Majesty when she makes her very welcome tour of Australia next year. She will make two visits to my electorate. I shall warn the shire councillors in the MCMillan electorate that nothing is more exhausting than a continual shaking of hands, and I shall suggest that all the people who meet Her Majesty bow to her from some distance away. I do not know how many honourable members are old enough to remember the visit that the Prince of Wales, now the Duke of Windsor, made to Australia in 1920. He left the country with his arm in a sling as a result of excessive hand-shaking. His hand was, so to speak, shaken into a sling. I hope that we shall be kind to Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh in that, regard when they come here next year. The Labour party, being afraid of what will happen at the next general election, is whistling to keep its spirits up. In attacking the Government, it frequently attacks the Government's health scheme. I suppose honourable members opposite have a. dreadful inferiority complex on that matter, because a Labour government produced, not a real health scheme, but a lot of "" hi-falutin"" nonsense that benefited nobody. No Australian got anything out of the MCKenna health scheme, and I suppose the Labour party is rather sensitive about the success of the health scheme of this Government. The honourable member for Kingston wanted to know when the scheme outlined in the bill shortly to be introduced would be put into operation. It has been in 7 operation since the 1st July. It was brought into operation in three stages. The first stage was the introduction of free pharmaceutical benefits. The next stage was the payment of valuable hospital benefits that enabled all the major hospitals in Australia to pay their way, and enabled some of them to show a surplus. The third stage was the provision of assistance to people to pay medical expenses. The honourable member for Kingston repeated the suggestion that this Government, in defiance of the will of the people of expressed at the referendum held in 1948, should impose prices control. He accused the Government of sabotaging prices control. Apparently, his view is that if the. Labour party is unsuccessful, in convincing, the people that it is the repository 1 of all' knowledge and the people reject, its proposals, a government that, does somethingnot in accordance with those proposal's is sabotaging the country. The people do not Avant Commonwealth prices control"". They expressed, that opinion very definitely at a referendum. It is beyond the poAv.er of this Parliament, to impose Commonwealth prices control!. The honourable member suggested' that if the trade unions do not get what they want from, the Commonwealth Arbitration Cbur.t, they will cease to deal with it. Let.us remember that the trade unions won the case that was heard recently by the court. The basic wage was not reduced', as the employers requested. Hours of work were nor. increased, as the. employersrequested. But quarterly adjustmentsof the basic wage in accordance with rises or falls of the cost of livingwere discontinued. The honourable member suggested that, because of that decision, the unions w i ll have to cease to deal with the-court'. He gave the impression'to m e that if the court dares to rejectany part: of a caseputforward by thetradeninions, the unionswi'll' disregard the court and' act outside' it. I do not 'believe that: is: the: official view of the Labour party. I suggest that'thai was a stupid' and* irresponsible statement by the honourable! member for. Kingston. During' the last'quarter, the cost of l i v in g in Victoria rose by 2s-; a week-. Thar increase wasdue; almost entirely to the fantastic price of potatoes^, which occupy w very inipor-tant place in the regimen on. which the C series index is based: If the price of potatoes increases to £100 a ton, the-, basic-wage.must be increased substantially,- under' thequarterly adjustmentsystem.. IU is: a, curious anomaly that althoughthe ordinary citizen cannot, afford to buy potatoes, at Is-. 3d. per lb;, and. goes; without them, they still carry the same weight in the C series index-.

I have always' believed that the Speech delivered by the-Governor General at. the' opening of a' session of the Parliament, should contain a statement of the intentions of the Government. The 1 printed copy of the Speech delivered this afternoon-covers'five-and'a half foolscap pages, four and a halfof which contain statements'about what'has occurred in the pastf. Apparently the Government' is relying-upon what'has happened'in the past , - 1 and intends to do very little in the remaining; few-months of it s ' l if e . It has done very little since it came into office, but it, holds out no hope to the Australian people that it will' do anything of a positive 1 1 I "" agree entirely with the sentiments expressed in the first paragraph of the' Governor General s Speech. ? His The- (l'evotion of Australians to the. Ttironc is both di'tiy and' wrerin. R has' been' sliown 1 by word and deed in both peace and war. It is not the special prerogative of any political party, or of any creed, or of any section Australian people. I believe those sentiments will be echoed by all members of this House and by the great majority of the people of Australia. They are the sentiments, not of only one political party, but of the people of Australia as a whole. I believe such matters should be kept completely outside the realm, of party politics. [Quorum formed.'] I know that certain honourable members on the Government side are unable to stand up to criticism. I recognize that the honourable member for Evans (Mr Osborne) and the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) realise full well that this Government has failed abjectly, during the past three and a half years, to govern the country as it should be governed. However, those honourable gentlemen do not like to be reminded of that fact because their fortunes are bound up with that of the Government and in a short time they will have to explain to the electors why the Government has not carried out the promises that it gave to them during two general election campaigns. So far honourable members on the Government side of the House have not made any reasonable explanation of the shortcomings of the Government and in the time between now and the next general election it is extremely unlikely that any adequate explanation will be forthcoming. The speech of the Governor General has not assisted the Government in any way at all. Eor example, a story has been told about the Korean armistice having been signed, but this House discussed the Korean armistice during its last sittings. There is nothing new about that. In fact it is old news. The Governor General should have told the Parliament something about the failure to obtain a peace settlement in Korea. It is stated in the Speech that during the last twelve months, up to the 30th June this year, Australia's international financial reserves have been strengthened. The Government informed the people to that effect some months ago but did not explain them, nor has it explained since, why it was so necessary to build up those reserves. In fact the reserves are still less than they were when this Government assumed ofiice although R . - [2] the value of money has fallen considerof the ably. Therefore, it must be clearly realized that our overseas balances are of much less value to day than they were in 1949 when this Government assumed office.",37
52,Mr GULLETT,Unknown,"I draw your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the state of the House. There are only eleven honourable members on the opposite side of the House listening to the speech of the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryson). Consequently, it must be as depressing to his colleagues as it is to us on this side of the House.",38
53,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown," Order! The honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett), in calling my attention to the state of the House, must not make a speech.",38
54,Mr DALY,Unknown,"I rise to order. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, whether it is correct for the honourable member for Henty, who is the Government Whip, constantly to call attention to the state of the House when there are not enough of his own colleagues in the chamber to form a quorum. There are only fifteen supporters of the Government at present in the House.",38
55,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! [Quorum formed.],38
56,Mr BRYSON,Unknown,"Apparentl y my criticism of the Government has hurt the feelings of the honourable member for Henty. I suggest that the honourable member for Henty, as Government Whip, should have some control over the actions of Government supporters. He has shown that he has not that control, because there are very few of them in the House at present. Consequently, he has failed lamentably in his duties. It does not matter whether there is one honourable member on the Opposition side of the House, or 50. According to my knowledge of parliamentary procedure, the first duty of the Government Whip is' to ensure a quorum. I suggest that the Government should give serious consideration to the position of Government Whip, because the present occupant of that position is incapable of carrying out his duties. The Governor General's Speech mentioned the Government's past defence policy, but mentioned nothing about our future defence. Apparently the Government is bankrupt of ideas on this important matter. The same remarks apply to the matter of coal production. Moreover, nothing of any value bas been stated in the Governor General's Speech about the Government's policy during the remainder of the life of this Parliament. Of course it has beeu said that additional members will be appointed to the Tariff Board so that two boards may sit at once to work out plansto protect Australian industry, but I suggest that that particular proposal is another admission by the Government that it has failed in its duty properly to administer the country. Apparently additional protection is required for our secondary industry, but such protection has been made necessary by the excessive costs of labour and materials, and those costs are due to the abject failure of the Government to carry out the promises that, it made to the electors. The Government intends to continue to increase the number of immigrants, but T remind honourable members that the number of immigrants was drastically reduced by this Government because it could not find employment for newcomers. Of course, it could not find employment because it had failed in its duty to the country. Even if the. Government increases the flow of immigrants, it will not bring new settlers to this country at the rate at which they were entering during the time of the last Labour Administration. A new health measure has been mentioned in the Governor General's Speech. The matter of health is becoming a hardy annual. Indeed, we have been promised health schemes and health bills ever since this Government assumed office. A health bill was introduced during the last session of this Parliament and a long second-reading speech was made on it. Then the Government jettisoned it. Perhaps the Government will take the same action with the new proposed health legislation. I suggest that the Government's indication that a. new health measure will be introduced is merely window-dressing, and that it is most unlikely that this Government will ever pass an effective health bill, i/r. Bryson but will merely trot out the promise on all favourable occasions. During the last three years I have been trying to find out the nature of the health scheme orginated by the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page), but the right honourable gentleman sidestepped my questions on all occasions. Moreover, certain reports have been published in the press about these schemes, but he has invariably described them as false. He has promised us a health scheme and the Government is now promising us a health bill, but it is interesting to find out exactly what health benefits this Government has actually given the people. Perhaps I could outline my own experience of government health schemes. I have been a member of a friendly society since I was seventeen years old. Not too many years ago my annual contribution for medical services was £1 a year. That covered myself and my wife and family. Afterwards it was increased to 26s. a year and the doctors were satisfied with that amount, but today I have to make a contribution of £5 4s. a year to cover myself and one daughter. That comparison tells only portion of the story. Under the Page health scheme the contribution of £5 4s. a year does not pay all my medical expenses but only a part of them. Honourable members have been told that a wonderful service will be given by the British Medical Association. Twenty years ago the members of the British Medical Association were satisfied to accept 26s. a year from each family to cover medical attention, but now they expect considerably more. Mr Gullett interjecting,",38
57,Mr BRYSON,Unknown,Do not be so silly.,39
58,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order !,39
59,Mr BRYSON,Unknown,"I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, but when childish interjections are thrown across the chamber by the honourable member for Henty I cannot find a word better than "" silly"" to express my opinion of them. The payment of £5 4s. to cover the medical expenses of two persons for a year will meet only approximately two-thirds of the cost of medical attention. The wonderful scheme that has been concocted by the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) and the British Medical Association will take more money out of the pockets the workers than any previous scheme. It is virtually of no benefit to the people at all. In addition, the will still pay social services contributions. When that impost was introduced, pora tion of it was to be directed towards payment of medical expenses. If the Minister for Health continues to these schemes into operation upon the authority of the Government upon the authority of the Parliament, the people of Australia will he paying and more as time goes on. Instead of these so-called free medical services being not beneficial to the people, they will become more costly. I turn my attention now to another matter that has been virtually ignored. That is the freezing of the who are absent? basic wage. I know that that was a decision of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration and not of the Government, but if wages are to pegged",39
