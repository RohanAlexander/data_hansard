0,NA,ZZZZZ,"line of defence, not only as far as defence is concerned but also as far as the illegal migrant, the drug running and all of the other things are concerned, and they do require some additional consideration. Certainly,· I hope that the defence aspect of the Northern Territory could be built up to a greater degree than it is at the moment, where only token forces are represented by the three Services. So I have pleasure in supporting this Bill, as does the Opposition. I just bring those matters to the attention of the House to indicate that there is real discrimination not only in the Territories but in the north of Australia in prices, transport and so many other areas. Isolation often means neglect and forgetfulness by those people who should take a more real part in the management of those areas. The people of Canberra have up until now been denied the right to vote on referendum matters. I believe this legislation will give effect to the ing that Canberra people have to be more closely associated with the rest of Australia in their industrial, commercial and social life. Only then might we get a more tolerant view of the situation in the rest of Australia.",37
1,Mrs KELLY ,ZZZZZ,Are you saying I am a social outcast?,37
2,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ZZZZZ,I did not say that at all; I just said it would give them a better feeling. I not say what the feeling was outside. I do not regard these people as social outcasts at all but lieve it would be better to treat the people of Australia as one and give them all the same rights. After all they all claim to be Australians. We should work towards that common cause.,37
3,Mrs KELLY ,ZZZZZ,"Canberra) (4.36)- Mr Deputy Speaker, I begin by congratulating you on assuming the chair for the first time. I ask you to pass to the Speaker my congratulations on his assuming his high office. Before I conclude my congratulations it would be most appropriate to point out to the House that when the honourable member for Henty ( Mrs Child) took the chair earlier today it was an historical occasion because it was the first time that this House had been presided over by a woman. I congratulate also my colleague the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Reeves) on a very fine maiden speech. I think we can see from that maiden speech that he will make a great contribution to this Parliament and be an effective lobbyist and member for the Northern Territory. I support the Referendum (Constitution Alteration) Amendment Bill 1983 because it will give residents of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory the right to vote in Federal referenda. The Bill is longoverdue and it is an absolute disgrace that until now approximately a quarter of a million Australian citizens have been disfrachised merely because they happen to live in a Territory, either the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory. The right to vote is a fundamental principle of all democracies and yet the right of Australian Capital Territory residents to vote in national referenda has been ignored until now. It has taken a Labor Government to recognise and respond quickly to this glaring deficiency in our electoral system. I know that all territorial residents will appreciate the speed with which the Labor Government has acted to ensure territorial voting rights in referenda. The Labor Government took action to correct this electoral deficiency within its first weeks in Parliament. This speedy attention to the rights of Australian Capital Territory residents feelcontrasts sharply to the previous Government's lack of attention to those rights. The previous Government let the matter slide for almost six years, and even after all that time showed no signs of rectifying the situation. That is how much consideration was given to the rights of the people of the Territories. It will be recalled that the 1977 referendum gave Territory electors the right to vote in referenda but from 1977 to the time of the March election this year the previous Governdid ment took no action to give legislative effect to this right. What a shameful record. Yet it is typiI be- cal of the way the previous Government treated the people of Canberra. As all honourable members know, there is no form of local or State government in the Australian Capital Territory. We have only an advisory House of Assembly. So Canberra residents depend entirely on the actions of the national on Parliament for their well-being and future development. When the national Parliament ignores the rights and needs of Australian Capital Territory citizens there is no other avenue of appeal. Too often in recent years the needs of Australian Capital Territory citizens have been ignored, overlooked or given the lowest priority. In many vital matters affecting the day to day lives of local residents the previous Government adopted a most cavalier attitude, making ad hoc decisions overnight which often caused havoc in the local economy. I am reminded of the many decisions taken by the previous Government which had little support from the community but which were pushed ahead simply because they were Government policies and had a very serious and damaging effect on the community-for example, the razor gang decisions. In Canberra the previous Government was able to impose Its will and indulge in its simplistic free enterprise rhetoric out interference. Those days are over and the people of the Australian Capital Territory demonstrated quite clearly in the most recent Federal election what they thought about that Government's policies. We have now been rewarded for the way we voted by getting what is our right. The people of Canberra will welcome this Government's initiative in ensuring their voting rights in referenda. It will be a refreshing change to have a national government concerned and interested in the rights and needs of Canberra, and I congratulate the Government on taking such quick action on this matter.",37
4,Mr YOUNG ,ZZZZZ,"Port Adelaide-Special Minister of State) (4.39)-in reply-I thank the honourable members from both sides of the chamber who took part in the debate for their support. I am amazed at the way they have been able to stretch the Referendum (Constitution Alteration) Amendment Bill to cover the matters that have been raised. I congratulate the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Reeves) and the honourable member for Canberra ( Mrs Kelly). The areas which will benefit from this Bill are represented completely by Labor members, and that augurs well for the people of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. I must say to the honourable member for the Northern Territory that in spite of all the predictions made by the so-called experts at the time of the 1983 election, including myself, we were very nobly surprised when his name went up with the majority of votes, and we will take more notice of what he says next time about the Northern Territory than of what we down here think. May I make a quick response to the honourable member for Boothby ( Mr Steele Hall). 1 welcome him back into the fray of politics after 12 months on the back benches, or in the back blocks. He has been longing to get back on to the front bench and say a few words about the Australian Labor Party. 1 hope he picks better issues upon which to have his fights in future. My interpretation of what he said is that he has now come round to supporting public funding of political parties. He probably thinks that that is a good idea. Obviously if he looks back over the years in which 1I have served in the Parliament-this week I start my tenth year in the House of Representatives-he will see that I have been saying the same thing about public funding over that period more often than anyone else in the House. My view is based not only on my experience since I became a member but also on my experience when I was campaign director in both State and Federal arenas for the Australian Labor Party. He should take into withaccount, when he makes accusations about political parties and what mayor may not have happened, the fact that it was John Valder who said just before the Federal election that the Liberal Party was broke. It spent $lOm, so either it was not all that broke or someone must have made some very substantial donations. The honourable member had better look at the evidence that goes before the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform, which we have now set up, and the way in which we will deal with the legislation later in the year. Honourable members will get plenty of opportunity to debate these matters. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee The Bill.",38
5,Mr STEELE HALL ,ZZZZZ,"Boothby) (4.45)-1 take it that honourable members on the Government side know how many referenda there have been since the 1977 referendum, which is the parent of this Bill. It must be somewhat confusing for the Committee to be told that the previous Government had a shameful record in this matter. 1 would like to put the record straight in case the honourable member for Canberra ( Mrs Kelly) is not aware of the facts. Perhaps the Special Minister of State ( Mr Young) can help her. As 1 said, the referendum in 1977 was the parent of this Bill. Without that question's having been put and successfully passed by a majority of over four million Australians, this Bill would not be practicable today. It was the Liberal-National Party Government that put that question to the people of Australia. I ask the Minister: Has there been a referendum since 1977 that would in any way validate the previous speaker's claim that the previous Government had a shameful record on this? That statement does not tally with the facts as 1 understand them. Perhaps the Minister can help the Committee by telling us whether there has been a referendum since 1977 and perhaps he can clear up the matter of whether any questions have been put in that way to the Australian public. Perhaps he will acknowledge that it was the previous Government that put the question to the Australian people to answer that brought about this Bill. Otherwise, I feel there will be some confusion. If anyone from the Australian Capital Territory were to read the previous speaker's speech, he would not be aware that in fact it was the Liberal-National Party coalition that brought about this measure; he would think that it was in fact a Labor party initiative. That would be in error. Perhaps the Minister can help the Committee by clearing up that point.",38
6,Mr YOUNG ,ZZZZZ,"Port Adelaide-Special Minister of State, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the House) (4.51)-I am not too sure of the point that the honourable member for Boothby ( Mr Steele Hall) is making. If he is making the point that there was no opportunity for people. of the Territories to vote in a referendum since 1977, that seems to me to be a very poor excuse for the previous Government's inactivity over the past six years. Bill agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted. Bill «)n motion by Mr Young)-by leaveread a third time. NA Debate resumed from 4 May, on motion by Mr John Brown: That the Bill be now read a second time.",39
7,Mr YOUNG ,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Port Adelaide-Special Minister of State, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the House) (4.S3)- Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have your indulgence to suggest that the House has a general debate covering this Bill, the Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Amendment Bill 1983 and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1983 as they are associated measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate.",39
8,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Mr Rocher)-Js it the wish of the House to have general debate covering these measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",39
9,Mr MOORE ,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Ryan) (4.S4)-The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1983, the Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Amendment Bill 1983 and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1983, which were introduced last week, will not be opposed by the Opposition but I will move an amendment at the second reading stage to the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1983. The first of the three Bills gives effect to decisions of the Industries Assistment. ance Commission and the Temporary Assistance Authority, along with a number of other decisions of the previous Government, and is supported by the Opposition. The Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Amendment Bill gives effect to certain charges that are levied on coal exports throughout Australia. It is worthwhile recording at this stage the enormous amount of money that is collected from these charges. I have figures from one operator that show that, of a gross income of $487m, State government charges amounted to $120m or the 24.6 per cent, Federal Government charges which included corporate income tax amounted to $218m or 44.9 per cent. A total of 69.5 per cent of all income derived by this particular organisation of coal mines went in government charges. The figure of 30.5 per cent of income remained with the corporation. That shows the enormous amount of government impost that has been put on the mining companies. It is something which will have a bad effect in the long run on the develThird Reading opment of some of the projects because quite clearly cash flow is important in the development of mines, particularly in the first five years. With those sorts of charges being levied, where 69 per cent plus of income goes to governments, that 1983 must have an inhibiting effect on those Second Reading developments. The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1983 relates to charges and excise on petroleum, natural gas, beer, tobacco products and some other petroleum products. These changes are consequent upon the 1982 Budget, with the exception of the duty on crude petroleum which reflects the new Government's election policy and the devaluation. It will be in this area that I will move an amendment. In doing so I wish to draw attention to the facts. During the election campaign we heard a lot about petrol prices. Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) said in his policy speech: As part of Labor's anti-inflation package and in recognition of the burden of extra taxation levied by the Government on people affected by the wage freeze, Labor will reduce the price of petrol by cancelling the January I oil price increase of $3.23 per barrel. This will have the effect of reducing the price of petrol by the order of 3 cents a litre. There was the promise. What was the action? The action was that the Government decided that, rather than meet that obligation, it would in fact reduce the price of petrol by I.Sc a litre; it would go halfway.",39
10,Mrs KELLY ,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,That was because of devaluation.,39
11,Mr MOORE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"I am interested in that comI am pleased the honourable member made it. The Prime Minister said in his policy speech that we should not take any notice of devaluations or currency movements. He said that we ought to accept that if the price of Saudi crude oil goes down on the world market from $35 or $34 a barrel to $29 a barrel, which it did, that that should be reflected in cheaper prices in Australia. That was the Prime Minister's position. He said that we should disregard movements in currency. But when the Labor Party came to Government the first thing that happened was that it immediately took into account the devaluation and discounted the promised cut of 3c a litre. That is the sheer, stark reality of a Labor promise. The Government promised a reduction of 3c a litre and promised to take no notice of currency movements. Its action was to reduce the price of petrol by a half of what it had said it would-by 1.5c a litre-and attribute that to the devaluation of currency. The second point that is interesting is that the Prime Minister not only alluded to the fact that not only should one not take into consideration currency movements but also that the people of Australia should get the full benefit of the price drop in Saudi oil. He said that the Saudi price of $34 a barrel really did not matter much; that we ought to buy on the spot market-that is, at the convenient price at the time. At that time the spot price of oil on the world market was around $25-in other words about $8 a barrel less than what we were contracting to pay from Saudi Arabia. As a consequence, that price flowed on as a benchmark price for Australian crude oil. Of course, that was a convenient election ploy. Today the spot price is over the going bench price for Saudi crude. It is over $29 a barrel. If that policy had been pursued, once again we would have been in for a rise in petrol prices. The Government went about explaining the movement of prices in a quaint way. It led the people of Australia to believe that there would be substantial cuts in petrol prices and that there would be a review, presumably, of the benchmark mechanism. The fact that we would have a situation in which only the price set by the Saudis would count and it would not be affected by a revaluation or devaluation was agreed to in April with the joy of yet another broken promise. As a consequence of that the Australian public has now received a reduction of 1.5c a litre rather than a promised 3c. I will not pursue the three Bills any further except to indicate that I will move an amendment at a later point to the third Bill, the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill.",39
12,Mrs KELLY ,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,Canberra) (4.56)-As I listened to the honourable member for Ryan ( Mr Moore) I was amazed at the hypocrisy of the gentleman as he discussed the Australian Labor Party's policy on the pricing of petrol when under his government the Australian electorate saw the biggest increase ever recorded in the retail price of petro\.,40
13,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,Mr Rocher)Order! The honourable member is not permitted to use the word 'hypocrisy'. I almost missed it. I ask her to withdraw.,40
14,Mrs KELLY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"I withdraw the term 'hypocrisy'. However, I repeat that I was amazed at the insincerity of the statement of the honourable member for Ryan about the Labor Government's policy on petrol pricing when it was his government which presided over the largest increases in the price of petrol ever recorded in this country. He complained that, in fact, the discount on petrol at the bowser under Labor is only 1.5c a litre instead of 3c a litre. At least it is a decrease in the price of petrol rather than a consistent increase which we witnessed under the previous administration. I wish to comment on the effect of the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill on petrol prices. This Bill will reduce the excise duty to be paid on stabilised crude petroleum oil to take effect from 1 April 1983. This measure reflects the earlier Cabinet decision of 16 March this year to reduce the price of Australian crude oil by $2 a barrel. If this is fully passed on to the motorist it should result, as the honourable member for Ryan explained to us, in a fall in price at the petrol pump of 1to a litre. As predicted by the Labor Party last year, the official price of the market crude oil-that is, Saudi Arabian light-fell from $34 a barrel to $29 a barrel earlier this year. The previous Government took no account of prevajIing market conditions, the international glut of crude oil or the resulting price cutting carried out by most international oil exporters. By changing the price only twice each year, that is, on 1 July and 1 January, the previous Government took no account of changing exchange rates or changing market conditions in between these periods. The result was that all Australian motorists paid dearly for their petrol and any market forces which could have resulted in lower prices for consumers were totally ignored. While the domestic crude price was set at only six-monthly intervals, discrepancies between the domestic price and what might be termed true import parity occurred. However, the Labor Government recognises that rapid changes of conditions in the international oil market can and do occur frequently and is determined that, as far as possible, the benefits will be passed on to motorists. At its Cabinet meeting on 16 March this year, a little over a week after it was elected, the Hawke Government took action to ensure that the drop in international crude oil prices was passed on to the Australian motorist. That shows how the Hawke Government is living up to a commitment that it made in the election campaign. Whereas the previous Government-Mr Moore-Only halfway.",40
15,Mrs KELLY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member for Ryan said: 'Only half way'. It is a lot better than anything that his Government ever did. All his Government did was increase the price of petrol. Whereas the previous Government saw fit to increase the barrel price by $3.23, and I ask honourable members to remember that was only on 1 January this year, and ignored the international market situation-so much for the integrity of the honourable member's Government-the Labor Government took immediate action to lower the price by $2 a barrel. The $2 reduction took account of the lower price for Saudi Arabian light and the variation of the exchange rate. The new import parity price for Bass Strait crude oil is now $36.90 a barrel. This price should now flow on to motorists. If it had been up to the previous Government there would be no price variation. If there was it would not have occurred anyway until 1 July and consumers would have been ripped off once again. The Petroleum Products Pricing Authority, which sets wholesale prices for petrol throughout Australia, last week reduced the maximum wholesale price of petrol by I tc a litre. In the the Petroleum Products Pricing Authority has generally accepted the arguments of the oil companies for increases in prices. This has caused concern to some organisations involved in the retailing of petrol which believe that the oil companies' submissions should be more closely investigated. For example, aside from the official reduction in the price of Saudi Arabian light crude, prices being charged by members of the Organisation for Petroleum Exporting Countries and other crude oil exporters vary considerably below the official price, and at least some of the refining and marketing companies in Australia are taking advantage of low spot market prices in obtaining their requirements of imported crude oil. Of course, the companies would also benefit from discounts on contract prices. All of these factors should be taken into account in setting the maximum wholesale price of petrol and could perhaps result in further price reductions. Of course, the Petroleum Products Pricing Authority can set only the maximum wholesale price throughout Australia; it does not set retail prices. At the retailing end of the oil industry the situation is nothing short of chaotic. In most States, a pricing authority determines the maximum re.tail price. However, within these arrangements the oil companies implement their own differential scale of prices to retail operators depending on whether they are commission agents, licensed dealers or independent site operators. Of course, the oil companies have preferential prices for their commission agents operating on oil company-owned sites and, in many cases, the prices are structured so as to drive competitors out of business. In some cases the oil companies' retail outlets are able to sel1 petrol at a price below the wholesale price of their competitors. The dealers become the meat in the sandwich. They are unable to trade under normal market conditions and, in many cases, are forced to operate at margins which send them broke. In the Australian Capital Territory the marketing of petrol is not control1ed by any State-type authority and the conflict between oil companies and retail outlets is unmitigated by any official body or legislation. For years Australian Capital Territory residents have been paying dearly for their petrol as a result of the oil companies' discriminatory pricing policies. Petrol for Canberra and surrounding areas is freighted by train to the Fyshwick depots and is then sold in service stations in Canberra and the surrounding areas of New South Wales. This same petrol is sold at a higher price in Canberra than it is in Queanbeyan which is across the border. New South Wales has past a State pricing authority; Canberra does not. The result has been that Canberra motorists have consistently paid higher prices-up to 7c or 8c a litre higher-than those paid in New South Wales. Currently Sydney prices are as low as 37.9c a litre, which includes a 3c a litre State tax. In comparison, prices in Canberra average between 46c and 48c a litre. The previous Minister for the Capital Territory, the honourable member for Denison ( Mr Hodgman), was quite unconcerned about this rip-off and refused to implement the Price Control Ordinance and to take any action at al1 to oil control petrol prices in this Territory. In fact, he was so unconcerned about this issue that he even abolished the Price Control Ordinance altogether. However, the Hawke Government and the new Minister for Territories and Local Government ( Mr Uren) are very much more concerned about the interests of motorists in Canberra and throughout Australia and will be taking steps to ensure that consumers get a fair deal on petrol prices. Transportation and petrol prices constitute a significant proportion of cost of living indexes, namely 16-!- per cent. The Government is committed to policies which will ensure that consumers are protected from any unnecessary increases in costs of living and is prepared to take immediate action on such issues as the 16 March reduction in the barrel price of oil indicates. However, the whole structure of petroleum products pricing in Australia needs to be reviewed. Under the current arrangements the Petroleum Products Pricing Authority sets wholesale prices. Variable State pricing policies and differential oil company pricing structure have resulted in a complex and confusing situation. What is needed is a thorough national inquiry into the oil industry as a whole, including importing, wholesale and retail prices and the issue of divorcement of oil companies from ownership of retail sites. Such an inquiry would be able to investigate all these matters on a national basis and make appropriate recommendations for reform. Consideration needs to be given to establishing realistic dealer margins and ensuring fair competition and trading conditions in the market-place. For example, in relation to the Trade Practices Commission recommendation that lessee dealers be allowed to buy 50 per cent of their petrol from other oil companies, Victoria and Western Australia have included this in State legislation, while other areas such as the Australian Capital Territory have no legislative controls at all. Wellintentioned Trade Practices Commission recommendations are, of course, no use on their own without adequate legislative teeth, and a national inquiry would go a long way towards regularising the market conditions throughout Australia. Reform of the petrol industry is long overdue. Petroleum products are a vital part of modern life and an important part of the national economy. The oil industry cannot be allowed to operate without the public interest being adequately protected by legislative means. It is not good enough to rely on the goodwill of individual States or, in the case of the Australian Capital Territory, on the public spirit ness of the responsible Minister, for the regulation of this industry. A national inquiry into all aspects of the oil industry is long overdue and I hope that every consideration will be given to establishing such an inquiry and, hopefully, a set of national guidelines for the industry as soon as possible. The Labor Government has already proved its commitment to the interests of all Australians by its actions in reducing the wholesale price of crude oil, and will closely monitor future price fluctuations in order to ensure that all Australians gain the maximum possible benefit.

Motion (by Mr Moore) proposed: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House notes that the Government has failed to honour its election commitment to reduce the price of petrol by 3c per litre and its pre-election undertaking to disregard currency fluctuations in setting the price of Australian produced crude oil'.",41
16,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Mr Rocher)-Is the amendment seconded? Mr Ruddock-As you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, with a great deal of pleasure I second the amendment.",42
17,Mr JOHN BROWN ,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Parramatta-Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism, Minister for Administrative Services and Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry and Commerce) (5.12)-Of course, the Government will not accept this amendment. In fact, we oppose it for quite a number of reasons. It strikes me as quite odd that the honourable member for Ryan ( Mr Moore), for whom I have the utmost respect as an individual, would have the gall and the arrogance to come into this House in the second week of this sitting and suggest that this Government is about to break an election promise. That such words could emerge from the group on the other side of the House simply amazes me. I have sat here for seven years and seen the previous Government build up a record unparalleled since Federation not only of breaking promises but also of having an absolute disregard for any form of decency or honesty in its conduct of government in this country. A Prime Minister now removed had the peculiar 'honour' of having a rather responsible newspaper one day devote the front page of its publication to three simple words, namely, 'lies, lies, lies'. The basis for this' honourable member come in here now and suggest that this new Government is breaking a promise is simply beyond imagination. Let us have a look at the text of the honourable member's amendment. It is true that the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) in his election speech said that we would reduce the price of petrol and also that we would disregard movements in currency in order to implement that promise. But let us examine the context in which that promise was made. Mr Fisher-You are wriggling.",42
18,Mr JOHN BROWN,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"I am not wriggling at all. The honourable member will be wriggling when I am finished with him. At that time, of course, the truth had not been revealed about Australia's financial position. It took the election of the Labor Government to establish just what our situation was. The Labor .Government was advised by the Secretary of the Trt<asury that we were in fact facing a deficit of $9.6 billion. That was the prospect that was facing an incoming government. The position was bad enough when we thought we were facing a deficit of $6,OOOm. But the deceit of the previous Government, the deceit of the then Treasurer in not revealing to the Australian public what our financial position was, certainly has great relevance to whatever commitments the Prime Minister may have made in his election speeches. Let me turn to the reason why this Government needed to devalue. Perhaps it might embarrass the honourable members opposite a little more when they realise why we had to devalue. I will tell them why. The now Leader of the Opposition EmptyHere started speaking as often as he could about how this new Government would have to devalue. The effect of that was, of course, that money flowed out of Australia by the bucketfull. Thousands of millions of dollars of overseas investment in Australia was taken away. The now Leader of the Opposition had broken every decent convention of this Parliament. It is never Opposition to suggest there is ab'out to be a devaluation of the currency. In Opposition, we certainly desisted that temptation because of the deleterious effect it can have on the nation's economy. The now Leader of the Opposition was immoral enough constantly to parade himself around and to tell people that now there was a Labor government in power there would be a need to devalue. Of course his suggestion became to the fact. It was a self-fulfilling prophecy, because the only way in which the incoming Government could stem the flow of capital from Australia was to ,devalue and, of course, it took the responsible action of doing just that shortly after assuming the Treasury bench. No one in Australia, least of all the economic writers, suggested that that was anything but the correct action to take. The result was the the proposed reduction in petrol price was discounted to the extent of the devaluation. That is why it became 1tc a litre, not 3c a litre. So it ill becomes honourable members now in opposition to criticise the incoming Government for having taken that very responsible action-action forced upon it by two circumstances that were the result of actions of the former Government. Firstly, that Government misled the Australian public as to the extent of the economic disaster which faced Australia when it left the Treasury. Secondly, we had the ill-founded and ill-advised statements of the present Leader of the Opposition, who suggested that there would be a devaluation. As I have explained, that forced investors to take their money out of Australia and eventually forced this Government to devalue. The result of all that was a diminution in the promised reduction in the price of petrol. Thus, the Government feels no sorrow and no guilt whatever in that regard. If any guilt is to be apportioned it can be fairly sheeted home to the former Government. Therefore, we discount the amendment and refuse to accept it. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr John Brown) read a third time. GOVERNOR-GENERAVS SPEECH Address-in-Reply Debate resumed from 5 May, on motion by Ms ever the estate of an Fatin: That the Following Address-in-Reply to the Speech of His Excellency the Governor General be agreed to: MA Y IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY: We, the House or Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, desire express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency For the Speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament. MR DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mr Mountford)-Before I call the honourable member for Phillip, I remind the House that it is the honourable member's maiden speech and she should be heard in silence.",43
19,Ms MCHUGH ,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Phillip) (5.18)-Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. It gives me pleasure to begin by congratulating you on attaining your office and in asking you to pass on my congratulations to the Speaker and the Chairman of Committees. Also, I congratulate those new members who have so successfully preceded me in the Address-in-Reply debate. I will try to make my comments as relevant as were theirs. The Australian Labor Party won the seat of Phillip as part of the strong swing against the policies of the former Government, which had allowed Australia to develop chronically high unemployment, unacceptable inflation and interest rates, growing inequality of wealth and incomes and a deep and widespread feeling amongst the people of division and lack of direction. That feeling has now been replaced by one of cautious hope, generated I think by the change of government itself that the electorate had the courage to bring about. There is amongst people now a good will towards the new Government that is almost tangible, certainly as I go around our electorate. The swing against the former Government occurred in Phillip because it represents a microcosm of the Australian electorate. Most people know something of Phillip-either the beautiful beaches from Bondi to Coogee, Randwick Racecourse, or the University of New South Wales, the largest in Australia. The electorate is superbly positioned. It is 20 minutes from the airport and, with the advent of the Eastern Suburbs railway, it is now less than 20 minutes from the city. It is not a bad place to live if you are a professional person, well-heeled, with concern for your time, health and petrol savings; in fact, it is a great place to live. But should it be available only to the wealthy, only to those who can afford to live there? Property values are naturally as high as they are anywhere in Australia. The rise in property values has resulted in demographic changes of significance to the character of the area and, of course, to voting patterns. In this tiny area, the smallest Federal electorate in Australia, all the diversity, contrasts and inequalities that exist in Australian society can be found. Australia is an unequal society. In Phillip to those in-qualities are very evident. One can see affluence and poverty in the same suburb and in the same street, side by side and across the road, looking at each other. As well as the luxury units and the $300,000 bungalows, Phillip cOrisistently has above average unemployment figures and a far above average number of single parent families. Despite the strong conservative element in the electorate Phillip has, almost more than has any other electorate of Australia, a high number of non-traditional families. We have also a great many age pensioners. This mix of people decided that the former Government had to go. As a matter of fact, we still do not know just how many of the residents of our area actually wanted a change of government. So many did not have the time to get on the rolls. We will not know until we get a better system than one which allows a Prime Minister to call an election at whim, giving insufficient time for new electors to enrol. The new electors include the young and those who move in and out of an electorate such as Phillip, which has such a high turnover of residents. Also, there are' in our area a lot of people who, for reasons of their own, understandable to them, hesitate to register with any sort of authority. They are the people who need a Labor government and who very bitterly resented the fact that, for once in their lives, they wanted to vote and did not have time to get on the rolls. Thank heaven they got a change of government anyway and fortunately that situation will not occur again. From all sections of this multilevel society in Phillip people came to help us, the rank and file branch members of the Labor Party, to win Phillip from the previous Government. I want to mention two groups in particular, not just to acknowledge their role in our campaign, but to declare my commitment to a common cause with them. One group is the Tasmanian Wilderness Society . Young people in their thousands turned to Labor on the issue of South West Tasmania. Labor, for them, offered the promise of stopping that bit of carnage of a part of their environment, their land, their heritage. They are not single issue people. They represent the aspirations of the young and the sensitive in our society to protect the beauty in our natural environment from the ravages of short term commercial interest, generally exercised for the profit of a few. I share their aspirations and so does my party. In government we need even more the support of these people to carry through our policies. It was and always will be a matter of great pride to us in the Australian Labor Party branches in Phillip that we were joined in our campaign by so many men and women fr-m the trade unions. - s unionists they came to gIve generously of then work and comradeship, as part of the broad labour movements' effort to achieve a Labor government in Canberra. The trade unions and the Labor Party were originally formed because there was a need for them. That need still exists and always will for the majority of Australians, that is those who have to work. The strength of a Labor' party and a Labor government lies in its links with the union movement because they are the links with the Australian working people. I want also to thank the women of New South Wales for their support and for their joy in the result in Phillip, a joy which crossed all party lines. Not once since Federation had a woman from New South Wales been elected to the national Parliament. We have waited so long and so many should have been here before. I am very proud to have on my desk a pair of scissors and a paper knife that belonged to the magnificent Jessie Street. They were given to me because among the many paths that the great Jessie Street first trod bravely for us was the path that could have led to this place. She stood for the seat of Phillip when it was created in 1949. The fact that at this time this particular woman enter Parliament is part of an evolutionary process. I am a link between the older women of the Labor Leagues and today's younger feminists. The older women fought the first battles for women's rights in the work place and for equal pay. I love and honour those women. Today's younger women have taken on, as well as the old continuing struggles, the demands to meet new circumstances and new expectations in areas such as child care and women's refuges. All these women fought against the forces of oppression and intolerance which would not allow a woman to make her own decision, no matter how painful or distressing, in relation to child bearing. I am glad that, thanks to the courage and common sense of generations of responsible women, the single issue campaigns of the intolerant have become irrelevant and ineffective. . By chance, I have become that inevitable link between the all male representation from New South Wales of the last SO-odd years and the many women from that State who will from now on take their places in this Parliament, both here and in the other place, with their male colleagues. But by far the most important thing for me is that I will be, 1 hope, a link between those generations of full time housewives and mothers whose 'duties' kept them isolated at home, politically either unaware or uninvolved, and those full time housewives and mothers who from now on, I hope, will become active participants in the decision-making process. I have never thought that the entry of individual women into the Parliament would, of itself, necessarily better the condition of women in Australia. I must admit, though, that it is not a bad job for the individual women who come into parliament. After my 23 years outside the paid work force, I think it is perhaps one of the few jobs available for which I am still qualified. However, as individuals in Parliament I think we can be swallowed up by the system. There are other women whom we must think of. Society depends to a very large extent on the unpaid work of women at home. I want those women to start asking back from society a fair return for the contribution that they make to it-a fair return by way of better education, better housing, better health care, better transport, et cetera. Women must use their political potential to gain these better conditions. The issue that is politicising women at present more than any other is that of disarmament and the nuclear arms race. It reminds me of how we were politicised nearly 20 years ago by the Vietnam war. Now, as then, women particularly have joined so many others and decided to show their concerns-and yet they are called dupes, just as we were then, by those who refuse to acknowledge that we care about human suffering caused by war. I am reminded that in the last election the Vietnam veterans, when asking both parties for an independent inquiry into the problems that had occurred as a result of their serving in Vietnam, were quite clear in their recognition of where we stood. One burly soldier said to me: 'I couldn't understand you, love, when you marched down the street in the moratorium years, but I certainly understand you now. The Government that sent us to Vietnam has dumped us. You care.' I am reminded of the misunderstanding and misinterpretations implicit in the advice given to us not to talk about things like disarmament, because we might get into trouble, and certainly not to mention a word like 'peace', which has become a bit of a dirty word. In this Parliament I would like to rehabilitate three words that mean a lot to me: 'Peace', 'unions' and 'socialism'. I resent good concepts being besmirched through misrepresentation. I am tired of being called naive because I join those who want to prevent war. I think it is more likely that those who do not realise they are being manipulated by the arms merchants are the naive ones. More and more Australians are becoming aware of the dangers to world peace because of the increase in nuclear weapons. On March 27 last, 200,000 Australians took to the streets to show their concern. A Labor Government, as our policy sets out, must reject the escalation of nuclear weapons and work to bring about positive disarmament negotiations. Our Government has the responsibility to call on all nuclear powers to reduce their nuclear weapons arsenals and to declare that we will not be part of a nuclear war machine. It is wrong, in my view, to allow Australia's uranium to circulate in such a way that it will inevitably enter the world nuclear weapons chains. I have long opposed the use of nuclear energy in any form and I have long been convinced that Australia should not mine or export its uranium. The other disgraceful situation that comes about by the world's preoccupation with war is the huge expense involved. Perhaps there would be no starvation in the world, no want, no uneducated kids, no homeless people and probably fewer international tensions if we could find to stop spending the $1.5 billion each day that the world spends on armament. What a sad reflection on our civilisation that so much money is wasted! What country can be so rich that it can squander its richness in such a dangerous manner? It is an indktment of our society that billions of dollars go into the arms race yet people still hold raffles to get money for cancer research and women still work in voluntary canteens in schools to get pens and paper for their children's education. It is a further indictment of our civilisation in this age of science that more scientists are living today than in the combined history of the past 1,000 years and the majority of them are today employed to invent more and more weapons of war. We can put our scientists to so much better use. Our technological base has not changed much since the 1950s. New skills are required for the 1980s. Viable alternative employment opportunichant ties are being encouraged and promoted. The Labor Government can invest dollars and faith research to establish new high technology 'sunrise' industries. These include biotechnology, software for personal computers and communications technology-a great deal of work in this area being done in our electorate of Phillip at the versity of New South Wales. Either we will have to develop our own technology in consultation with the workers or, as with most things to date, we will have to buy from overseas. To meet the demands of Australian society, the economy must generate more wealth. There is no guarantee of time. success of course, but there is the guarantee of further economic regression if industry and government fail to take up the challenge of the new, high technology industries. Mr Barry Jones-Hear, hear!",44
20,Ms MCHUGH,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"The people at the University of New South Wales are delighted by the enthusiasm of the new Minister for Science and Technology ( Mr Barry Jones). Finally I wish to talk about the reason for which this Government was elected and the task ahead of us. The problem of unemployment in Australia was one of the key factors in the election campaign. The unemployment rate rose from 5 per cent to 10 per cent under the previous Government. For the young it rose to 28 per cent. Of course, it was worse for women and girls. The Fraser Government promised more of the same policiesthat is, it promised more unemployment-and it lost office. Labor is committed to addressing the unemployment problem. We carry no illusion that it will be easy. Governments in other industrialised countries with socialist objectives such as our own have been elected with similar mandates and a way. clearly have been unable to make any but very slow progress. But socialist parties have advantages over conservative parties in addressing the problem of unemployment. We are prepared to acknowledge one of the key aspects of the long term unemployment problem throughout the industrialised world, that is, that the economic system as it has evolved, motivated by profit, increasingly dominated by monopolies and integrated on a world wide basis, is no longer able to provide full employment and a reasonable standard of living for all. We cannot accept the philosophy that says to working people: 'You can have a job, if you are prepared to work at the internationally going rate of pay'. We are not prepared to underwrite such a massive drop in the standard of living of Australians. In this approach we are joined by many of the small business, merand professional groups. We are prepared to look honestly at the causes of unemployment. in We are prepared to take the far-reaching steps necessary to provide jobs and decent living standards for all. We are prepared to intervene in the economic system and to stimulate employment is through both the public and private sectors-a Unislow but sure process. We are prepared to consult and to plan for the longer term. I take this opportunity to tell the electors of Phillip that I too am prepared to consult and to listen. I certainly hope they will be listening to me and consulting with me and that the dialogue will continue for a long",46
21,Mr BURR ,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Wilmot) (5.37)-1 would like to congratulate the honourable member for Phillip (Ms MCHugh) for her first contribution in this House. I know what a harrowing experience it is. I think that she handled her first speech with confidence and that she will go from strength to strength. I would have liked her to congratulate the former member for Phillip, Mr Jack Birney, for the contribution that he made during his years in this place. I know that he was a hard working member. He represented the people of Phillip very well in this Parliament. I would also like you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to pass on my congratulations to Mr Speaker for his election to that most responsible position. Having worked with him over a number of years, you can assure him, Mr Deputy Speaker, that he has my full confidence and support for the years that he will occupy the chair. Australia, along with all other industrialised countries, needs urgently to plan a range of policies for the year 2000 and beyond. I am delighted to see that the Minister for Science and Technology ( Mr Barry Jones) is in the House to listen to the comments I want to make. Advancing technology is causing the most dramatic changes to our social and economic environment since the industrial revolution. That technological revolution cannot be coped with by hanging on to the thinking, the ambitions and the standards and power structures of the past. Australia desperately needs statesman-like leadership, leadership that can take this country through the technological revolution in an orderly, humane and dignified manner. We need statesmen in government, business, unions and community leadership. The first important requirement is for all Australians to have an understanding of the social and economic upheaval we are facing as a result of the technological revolution. The second requirement is for leaders at all levels to plan for bold new rections rather than to try to hang on to the power structures of the past. The explosion of new technology is forcing dramatic changes to our traditional social and economic patterns. We can expect that that process will continue and accelerate in the future. Past social and economic structures have been based on the production of goods and services by human effort with the help of machines-the work process being a major economic, social and psychological activity for our people. However, new technology is providing large increases in productive capacity by using dramatically fewer people. The economic output and the economic efficiency of a country or an industry can certainly be increased by using advanced technology. The problem is that the needs of displaced people are being ignored and we have not even begun to plan for the problems of future generations. That planning must be undertaken urgently if we are to avoid the social chaos that accompanied the industrial revolution. In the past governments as well as industry and union leaders have allowed their planning to be dominated by economic factors with an underlying ambition to hang on to their power structures. However, in the future as much or more attention must be given to social planning as is given to economic planning. Power structures will change. It is to be hoped that statesman-like leadership will allow those changes in power to occur by orderly means rather than by chaotic social upheaval. There is still an overriding and widespread desire to hang on to what has been socially and economically comfortable in the past. But our thinking must change quickly. Technology is forcing changes to our economy. The urgent need is for our thinking to change so as to look to the future rather than to try to hang on to the past, to keep our social planning in harmony with the technological revolution. The Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) has made an important start by calling the National Economic Summit Conference. I trust that the change in thinking by our leaders will begin to accelerate from that point. Economic and social changes will occur as technology increasingly takes over the production process. That will continue to force dramatic changes in work patterns. In turn, it will force changes in income, educational and leisure patterns. They will need to be planned. But changes in the political structures are also required if those plans are to be implemented properly. The process started after the Second World War. Agriculture changed from being labour indi- tensive to become capital intensive. As bigger and more efficient machines allowed a higher level of production with less manpower, dramatic social and economic changes were forced upon people in rural areas. Many people moved to industrial centres to get jobs while governments and rural authorities tried to diversify factory locations in order to provide jobs in rural areas and, therefore, minimise the social upheaval. The most recent example is in the mining industry. During the past 25 years, enormous mining developments have occurred and now provide about 30 per cent of our export income. But because of the high level of mechanisation, those projects employ a very small percentage of our total work force. The technological revolution is now causing dramatic changes to the work patterns and opportunities in the traditionally labour intensive manufacturing industries and also in some service industries. That process will continue and accelerate. As it does, the jobs available in industry will become more technical in nature. That, in turn, will require higher levels of education and training. At the lower level of the work environment there will be a growth in jobs in the service industries, particularly in the travel and hospitality industries. But over and above all of that, it is likely that there will not be anywhere near enough jobs for the numbers of people who want full time work. I think that that reality has to be faced by honourable members on both sides of this chamber and by people who are planning our economy outside this place in industry and in unions. In a recent paper entitled 'Challenge to Australia', Sir Barton Pope suggested that a great deal could be done with the unoccupied work force to develop the sparsely populated areas of the north. However, as developments in the Pilbara and the Bowen Basin have shown, enormous economic and developmental activity can be undertaken by using relatively few people. Regardless of such worthwhile projects, as Sir Barton suggests, we will stili have a rapidly increasing number of unoccupied and underoccupied people in the densely populated industrial centres of Australia. Such conditions are idly tearing Australia apart. The resultant social unrest could easily lead to widespread violence if the causes of the social cancer are not corrected quickly with the hope of longer term social and psychological stability. People need to feel part of and be accepted by the community in which they live. They also need the psychological satisfaction of knowing that they are making a useful contribution to the maintenance and improvement of their community. As well as that, they need to have the economic security of knowing that they can provide for the physical needs of themselves and their families. All these conditions are met simply by having a job. But if there are not enough jobs for all who want them, other methods have to be found to satisfy the human, physical and psychological needs of our people. Failure to do so will lead to increasing levels of crime, drug taking and other anti-social activities with a real fear of widespread internal armed hostility. I am sure that all of us would agree that such a prospect in this country is frightening. Leadership must be given from the top. Good morale or bad morale never starts from the bottom and works its way up, it always starts from the top and filters down. Our political structures need to change to allow people who are elected to represent others the scope and opportunity to make an input into the decision-making process. The process of parliaments and governments cannot continue with the bitteqlivisions that we have known in the past. Such partisan divisions may be of some satisfaction to the very small percentage of the population which is involved in party politics. But to the vast majority of the population the political machinations of so-called leaders simply undermines their confidence in the process of government and in the people who are supposed to be their leaders. The parliamentary process must be broadened so as to allow a breakdown in partisan differences and to allow all members of parliament to have an input into the decision making and administrative structures but also to provide longer term planning that will be followed through regardless of which party is in power. I have advocated for some years that the Opposition of the day must be given a responsible and functional role in the administrative process. Failure to do so simply disenfranchises at least 45 per cent of the people-those who have voted for the opposition party. I have not changed my views simply because I am now in opposition. I have held those views for some time and have said so often in the past in this place. I am encouraged by rap- the announcement by the Special Minister of State ( Mr Young) to establish a more responsible parliamentary committee system. I trust that his final proposals will reflect the statesmanlike approach that I mentioned earlier, but at this stage we are still to hear the details of the committee system that has been suggested by him. The relationship between the Commonwealth and State governments needs to be brought into line with the demands of the twenty-first century. The constitutional divisions of power was designed to bring the States together as one nation and was based on the knowledge of the l890s. Over the years that has led to a costly duplication of administration and services. Financial dominance by the Commonwealth has led to the endless bickering, parochialism and division of the nation. We now need a constitution that will unite Australia and allow for more efficient administration. While a constitutional convention exists, there does not appear to be any dedication to bring about constitutional reform. The Constitutional Convention met in 1977 and again in 1983 but the need for reform is far more urgent than only those two meetings indicate. I suggest that in seeking reform we must also seek a reform that can be accepted by all Australians and by all institutional authorities in Australia. We cannot have constitutional reform that is in fact a dictate of the Commonwealth Government. I fear that some of the suggestions being put forward by Senator Gareth Evans are not to effect a genuine reform of the Constitution but rather to centralise power in this place-in Canberra-at the expense of other power bodies and other forms of government at State and local level throughout Australia. That is not reform, What we need is a genuine consensus reform of our Constitution. Governments need to plan for much longer periods than a single term of parliament, hence the need to have bipartisan agreement for long term plans. That would give a direction to the country rather than have the wild swings in policy whenever there is a change of government. In turn it would allow businesses and other leaders in the community to plan with more certainty, to provide stability in the community and to eliminate much of the division in Australia. Our industrial relations must improve. We cannot continue with the divisiveness that is presently an inherent part of our industrial relations structure. The objectives of all Australians, whether in government, unions or management, are the same-that is, steadily to improve our economic and social standards of living. But while we share those common objectives-I do not think anyone on either side of the House would dispute that the constant division between capital and labour has caused untold damage to this country. I am not excusing one side or the other because faults have occurred on both sides. Legal requirements, as we have known, are not the answer. We have tried the legalities of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and other legal processes and they have led us further and further into this industrial division that is tearing our country down, holding back our potential for development. What is needed is an attitude of tolerance and understanding from all sides that will allow common objectives to be realised. If the social upheaval of the technological revolution is to be coped with our industrial leaders must adopt more intellectual vision than they have displayed in the past. It is impossible in one brief resume to span the scope of economic and social problems that will be faced in the lead up to the twenty-first century. It is equally impossible for one individual to pose all the solutions. What is urgently needed is realisation and an acceptance by leaders in Australia that the technological revolution is forcsheep, ing wholesale economic and social changes. When that inescapable fact is accepted Australia will in a position to start planning with the necessary degree of dedication and urgency. I urge leaders in government, business and unions to give more attention to the future of our country than they do to their personal ambitions. If our leaders are prepared to become statesmen, instead of simply people who hold positions of responsibility, Australia can look forward to the twenty-first century with great optimism. If they do not, they will deserve all the condemnation that will be heaped on them by generations as yet that is dictatorship. unborn. Debate (on motion by Mr Ronald Edwards) adjourned.

22,Mr MCVEIGH ,ADJOURNMENT,"Darling Downs) (5.53)-1 take this opportunity again to focus attention on the grave situation in the shearers dispute and this Government's apparent total inability to get its comrades in the trade union movement to abide by the laws of this country. It is now a fact that this Government is nothing more than a puppet of the trade unions. It is simply not prepared to take any action whatsoever to upset trade union manipulation .and dictatorship of our industrial affairs. Consensus, to the Labor Government, means avoiding issues which might upset union mates. One has to look only at the deal that has been worked out with the building industry unions to see the proof. The Government has said: 'You cannot have a pay rise, but you can have increased allowances'. What a charade, what an absolute cop out by the Government simply to save itself from getting into a fight with the building industry unions. The Government cop out is even worse in the shearers dispute. Here is a situation that is rapidly getting worse by the day. People are being beaten up, intimidated, subjected to abuse and hostility and having their property damaged. The case that occurred near Coonamble yesterday is the latest incident. I am at a loss to understand how any depro- cent minded Australian can condone such aca tivity, especially when the grazier has been force into the situation where, unless he shears his they will die. There is a very important animal welfare consideration involved in this as well. be Furthermore, unless the grower can shear his sheep and sell the wool,he will go broke. Do not some of these people, the Ecobs and others of this world, realise that many sheep farmers are literally on the breadline following years of drought? Do they not have concern for the women and children who have real fears for their future? The Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) has a mind that is musclebound by bias towards trade unionists. I am at an even greater loss to understand how any Australian can involve himself in such despicable behaviour. This dispute has been steadily worsening for six weeks. All that the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations ( Mr Willis) has had to say about the violence and intimidation is that they are matters of concern to the Government. There is no concern or interest for those who are getting bashed up. The Minister for Primary Industry ( Mr Kerin), who seems to be permanently overseas, seems to have decided that the issue has nothing at all to with him, even though we are talking about a major industry that accounts for 10 per cent of our total export earnings. The Government claims to have a special relationship with the unions. It claims to be able to bring about consensus and co-operation. If that is truly so, why has the Government, over the past six weeks, not been able to get these violent elements in the Australian Workers Union to toe the line? The fundamental failure of the Government is that it has totally failed to stand by the decisions of its own instrument of justice, namely, the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The Commission itself has now ruled twice on the issue. Yet, after some 2,500 pages of transcript from Commission hearings, the Government supports a union application for yet a further hearing. I understand that today's hearing in Sydney has been adjourned and that a recommendation will be put to striking shearers tomorrow to the effect that they return to work under current award provisions, and that' they recognise the authority of the Commission's decisions. I sincerely hope that that recommendation is agreed to, so that there can be an immediate end of this senseless violence. But again I stress that none of this should have started in the first place. The Government should have been more forceful long ago. It should have insisted that decisions of the Arbitration Commission are final and must therefore be upheld by all parties concerned. The Government should have stood by its Arbitration Commission and not backed the A WU's application for a further hearing. By doing so, the Government and the Prime Minister stand totally condemned.",49
23,Mr KENT ,ADJOURNMENT,"Hotham) (5.57)-On 29 Febr-ary I attended a meeting of parents of handicapped children associated with Lowrie Lodge, The Catch and Raelene. At the meeting the parents bitterly complained against the practice of. the Department of Social Security to withhold payment to parents of handicapped children when they are placed into a home for short periods to enable the rest of the family to go on holidays or just simply to have a short rest from their heavy responsibility and burden that most other families, fortunately, do not have to endure. Time will not permit me to explain here in detail what a heavy task is undertaken by parents of handicapped children who decide to care for them within the family instead of placing them into an institution. It is not only that the children require special care in these cases, but the parents themselves need counselling and cqmmunity support to enable them to dedicate themselves to the enormously difficult task of providing the necessary, do care that a handicapped person requires. The selfsacrifice of such parents requires and fully deserves the support of the more fortu!,\ate part of our community, if for nothing else because of financial savings to the community by their decision to care for the handicapped children themselves instead of placing them into homes. The Whitlam Labor Government acknowledged the difficulties faced by such families and introduced the handicapped child's allowance, to compensate at least partly for the extra expenses faced by the families concerned. As the Fraser Government did not dare to withdraw the handicapped child's allowance, as it would have required legislation which would certainly have caused a public outcry, it decided to erode the value of the allowance by deducting the allowance from those who, for the purpose of relief as I have mentioned previously, placed their children in homes for short periods, such as, for instance, during school holidays. What is worse, the Department has been directed by the former Government to withhold not only the handicapped child's allowance but also the family allowance. To illustrate this, I quote from a letter written by the Department of Social Security on 15 February to Mrs Elizabeth Martin, which in part reads: . Family allowance and handicapped child's allowance is paid to you in respect of your child Ian who was in residential care at E.W. Tipping Home between 26 November 1982 and 5 December, 1982. . That is ten days, Mr Speaker: The letter continues: Your family allowance and handicapped child's allowance in respect of Ian should not have been paid to you while he was attending E.W. Tipping Home. Family allowance and handicapped child's allowance continued during this period, however, resulting in an overpayment of $36.49, This amount must be recovered, and it will now be withheld from your family allowance and handicapped child's allowance payments from 15.1.83 to 22.1.83. How inhuman, how morally bankrupt can a government be when a Minister orders the Department to harass and pinprick those less fortunate in our community, those who deserve our admiration for their fortitude, those who deserve our sympathy and those who need help from the rest of the community in caring for handicapped children, while at the same time allowing a Minister to spend $5,000 a week on chartered aircraft and hired limousines. Government members-Shame! Disgusting!",50
24,Mr KENT,ADJOURNMENT,"It is a shame. The letter to Mrs Martin is not a single instance. Only last Friday, one of my constituents rang me complaining that the Department deducted $20.83 from her handicapped child's allowance and family allowance. I have made representations to the new Minister for Social Security (Senator Grimes) and further to my written communication to him on this matter I ask him here and now to direct his Department to discontinue the petty deductions from the handicapped child's allowance and the family allowance, so that employees of the Department can use their time and energy to assist their clients instead of harassing them.",51
25,Mr ROCHER ,ADJOURNMENT,"Curtin) (6.2)-1 start by congratulating you, Mr Speaker, on your election to the position of Speaker. I wish you well in that task. In the mid-1960s the Commissioner of Taxation adopted a policy of issuing public information bulletins, or PIBs, intended, in his own words,to provide information: for the convenience of the taxpaying public and ation advisers. After PIB No.8 was issued in July 1966, the practice was discontinued. Since then, the Commissioner has issued pamphlets, other bulletins and circulars, from time to time, although they have not gone as far towards explaining how discretionary powers vested in the Commissioner were to be exercised. Since PIB No.8, only one set of major guidelines has been issued, despite a substantial increase in the number of discretions vested in the Commissioner and despite the increased complexity of the Act. Interestingly, that one exception arose out of freedom of information legislation. Because of what may be said to be an abundance of discretionary power exercisable by the Commissioner, it is both difficult and necessary to obtain advance rulings. I use the word 'rulings' for want of a better word. Even when it is given or promised, the time taken in getting advice from the Commissioner is often a constraint-on commercial decision making, and the whole process warrants attention. In chapter 22 of the Asprey report, this was said on the subject: The publication by the Commissioner of rulings, guidelines and information . . . is desirable and creates a better understanding of taxation laws and practices. Published information . . . also helps to dispel the frequently voiced criticism . . . that the Taxation Office is endeavouring to assume the role of 'rule maker'. I have already indicated that advance information is no longer published. Consequently, in many cases it is not known how the Commissioner may exercise his discretion on a tax matter, or matters, of critical importance before a decision can be taken as to whether to proceed with a particular commercial venture. Because tax is frequently an important consideration in business decisions, an absence of, or delay in, obtaining advice from the Commissioner effectively prevents calculation of a subsequent tax liability. The current practice of making requests for advice by the Commissioner need not be, and indeed frequently requests are not, answered in time to be of any use to the taxpayer, or should I say the potential taxpayer. The likely effect of some new legislation on business planning cannot be overstated because, amongst other reasons, tax is more and more being treated as a cost of doing business rather than something that is paid out of pre-tax profits. Of course, that has always been the case with sales and other so-called indirect taxes. Nor is it only new legislation which presents problems to commercial interests. I instance uncertainties surrounding which superannuation schemes are acceptable, Part IVA and sales tax changes which, their taxgiven the discretionary powers of the Commissioner, pose more than real problems. It is one thing to say that ignorance of the law is no excuse but Australian tax law, where it confers discretion on the Commissioner, makes knowledge of the law and its application impossible. Short of encouraging business to adopt an attitude that it should do nothing if it cannot be certain of its tax obligations, some procedures must be devised whereby it can obtain answers quickly. I thoroughly recommend to the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) and the Government that they look for remedies. One answer could be that the Commissioner be required to give binding rulings, perhaps on payment of a fee of $500, and that such rulings be given within 30 days of receipt of the potential taxpayer's submission. Favourable consideration should also be given to the Commissioner of Taxation again issuing public information bulletins stipulating how he will exercise discretionary powers, as well as advising modifications to earlier decisions as may be necessary in the light of experience. The pleas and recommendations I have made deserve serious consideration, not just in the interests of the business munity but because they will facilitate economic endeavour vital to Australia's economy and with positive benefits for employment.",51
26,Mr MAHER ,ADJOURNMENT,"Lowe) (6.7)- Mr Speaker, tonight I wish to raise a very sad migration case that I have been trying to assist with. It involves a gentleman from Lebanon who entered Australia on a visitor's visa in December 1980. The gentleman in question is blind. His name is Samir Sukkar. His brother lives in my electorate, in the Sydney suburb of Ashfield. The blind visitor is a single man, born in 1930, who has two brothers and two sisters living in Australia. We all know that the tragic civil war, or a war anyway, broke out in Lebanon. At that time the former Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs granted an extension of visa to this blind gentleman. Unfortunately, the brother he lived with in Lebanon, who was also a bachelor, has disappeared and cannot be found. The family in Sydney is very reluctant to send this blind brother back to Lebanon. I and many other members of parliament, both State and Federal, have been making representations so that this visitor may be allowed to remain in Australia on compassionate grounds and become a permanent resident, mainly because his family is here. He can speak English. It would be very distressing for him to go back to a situation which he may have no home and in which his next of kin cannot be traced. I made representations to the former Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I was sent a copy of representations made by an honourable senator who was then a member of the Government. All the circumstances were explained in the Minister's letter, but unfortunately the representations were declined. I have since made further representations and the matter was being negotiated between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. Many questions and many inquiries were raised as to whether this blind gentleman's brother was still alive and it was suggested that my constituent contact the International Red Cross. There was no progress on this matter at all. More recently, since the change of government, I have kept pursuing the matter. In the interregnum the departmental head said that the chap has to go. I have since contacted the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs ( Mr West). Unfortunately this Minister has granted an extension of stay only until 30 June. The family is quite distressed and, like all Australians of Lebanese extraction, wants only to see the foreign troops out of their homeland. The family is very worried about the wherecomabouts of their brother in Lebanon who cares for this blind person, who is living in Sydney now on a temporary entry permit. I am raising this matter tonight to appeal to the Minister in these most unusual circumstances involving a person without sight who has come to this country under great difficulty from Lebanon. In view of the fact that the Lebanese nation has been so strife torn, so destroyed and so violated, I do ask that the Minister reconsider this matter, that he review all decisions made in this case, and there have been many, that he review all the representations made, and there have been many, and that he sympathetically allow this visitor from Lebanon to remain in Australia with his two brothers and two sisters.",52
27,Mr DRUMMOND ,ADJOURNMENT,"Forrest) (6.11)- Mr Speaker, may I take this opportunity of congratulating you on your election to your very high office. I wish you well and I know that you will do an outstanding job in that position. No doubt the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) is finding it difficult to cope with the burdens of office, particularly, I guess, as he has had so little experience in the area of finance. This may be the reason why he apparently failed to understand a direct question I asked him last Thursday at Question Time about inflation. I hope it was simply a failure to understand; otherwise he gave an answer that involved in misleading this House .. There may be a good reason for his seeking to do so. After all, the Treasurer's speech to the National Economic Summit is totally at odds with the Government's present policy, to the extent that no one understands what that policy really is. The question I asked last Thursday was: I ask the Treasurer whether it is a fact that, in his speech to the National Economic Summit Conference, he said: The fundamental risk to the recovery we are seeking lies with inRation. I stressed the word 'fundamental' at the time. The question continued: How does he reconcile this statement with the Government's preference for scenario A, which forecast an inRation rate over the next three years almost double that of the more responsible and restrained scenario CScenario C involves the creation of 130,000 more jobs than scenario A. I was surprised and disappointed at the Treasurer's attempt to deny the accuracy of what I had to say. His comment that I was wrong and that, in fact, inflation under projection C was only 5.3 per cent compared to 6.4 per cent in projection A, or nowhere near half, is simply misleading, either intentionally or unintentionally. The facts are that the figures he quoted relate only to the first year of the three-year period I specifically asked him about in my question. The facts are that in the second year, 1984-85, inflation, under projection A, is forecast at 4.9 per cent as against 2 per cent under projection C-far more than double-and in the following year is forecast at 6.5 per cent against only 3.7 per cent. As I said in my question, over the three years the inflation rate in projection C is about half that of projection A. Yet the Government has deliberately decided to prefer scenario A even though it involves a far worse unemployment rate than under scenario C. We should be grateful to the Summit for providing us with the information that shows how the CPJ AWE Wages, salaries, supplements real after tax, per employee excluding Medicare (a) Real household disposable income Saving ratio (%) non-farm (%) Private consumption (real) Private Gross Fixed Capital Expenditure Dwellings Business (b) Non-farm wage share (%) Non-farm profit share (c) (%) Gross fixed capital expenditure (d) to non-farm GOP (%) Public Sector Demand (real) Final domestic demand (real) Gross non-farm product (real) Deflator Gross domestic product (real) Employment Unemployment rate (%) Exchange rate (TW1) Current alc deficit ($m) %of GDP Net exports (e) Budget deficit ($m) %of GDP Money supply M3 (a) real after-tax wage income per employee, excluding disposable income approximately equally. Similar and consumption figures (b) adjusted for the sale of Eraring to the private sector (c) non-farm gross operating surplus, (d) excluding dwellings (e) percent contribution to growth of GPP Government has decided to reject the ecollornic course that would do the most good for the most Australians. Scenario C, which the Government has rejected, and which has the lowest increase in wages of the three scenarios presented to the Summit, gives the best result for all the major economic indicators-for the cost of living, for real household disposable incomes, for real private consumption, for private capital expenditure on both dwellings and business, for real domestic demand, gross non-farm product, gross domestic product, employment, unemployment and the money supply. To prove this point, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a summary of the three scenarios proposed for the Summit as in the National Economic Summit Conference document. Leave granted. The document read as followsNA Scenario 'A' Scenario 'B' Scenario 'C' 83-84 84-85 85-86 83-84 84-85 85-86 83-84 84-85 85-86 6.2 4.9 6.5 13.0 13.8 13.4 5.3 2.0 3.7 5.5 5.3 8.8 18.1 15.6 15.8 2.8 3.0 4.5 5.8 7.6 11.9 17.2 15.6 16.6 3.4 6.0 8.2 -0.3 -1.2 1.6 0.9 -0.1 1.9 -1.5 -0.4 0.5 0.3 0.2 1.6 3.1 1.2 1.8 -0.9 1.0 0.6 2.2 1.9 4.9 1.2 1.0 2.0 2.3 2.8 5.0 12.7 12.3 12.6 12.3 12.3 12.7 12.6 12.5 12.5 12.7 12.5 12.5 12.6 12.4 12.5 12.6 12.8 12.5 1.1 2.3 4.6 0.5 1.0 1.4 1.3 2.8 4.9 -0.1 9.5 11.0 -1.1 4.0 6.0 1.0 12.0 12.0 -10.3 4.1 7.4 -12.2 -2.7 1.7 -8.5 5.3 8.9 64.0 63.4 63.5 67.0 67.1 67.2 63.0 62.9 62.4 . . . . 36.0 36.6 36.5 33.0 32.9 32.8 37.0 37.1 37.6 18.9 18.8 18.9 18.8 18.5 18.5 19.0 19.0 19.1 4.5 4.1 ·3.0 4.5 4.1 3.0 4.5 4.1 3.0 0.7 3.1 4.6 0.1 1.5 2.0 1.0 3.7 5.0 2.1 3.9 4.9 1.1 1.5 2.3 2.4 4.5 5.4 7.0 5.2 6.6 14.4 14.2 13.8 5.9 2.2 3.6 2.7 3.9 4.8 1.7 1.6 2.4 3.0 4.5 5.3 0.4 2.0 2.7 -0.4 0.2 0.8 0.7 2.6 3.3 10.0 10.1 9.7 10.6 11.7 12.2 9.7 9.5 8.7 -6.6 1.0 0.5 -6.6 -6.9 -5.6 -6.6 3.9 3.2 7100 7050 6900 7650 8300 7500 7250 7200 7000 4.0 3.6 3.2 4.1 3.8 3.0 4.1 3.8 3.4 0.3 0.0 -0.1 0.0 -0.2 0.3 0.2 -0.1 -0.1 8550 7350 7050 5900 790010550 9200 7150 7250 4.8 3.8 3.3 3.2 3.6 4.2 5.2 3.8 3.5 8.5 8.25 10.0 14.5 15.0 15.0 8.0 5.75 7.5 financing of Medicare, which reduces both consumption and adjustments could be made to the household disposable income percentage of non-farm GOP at factor cost",52
28,Mr DRUMMOND,SUMMIT SCENARIOS,"It is also important to recognise that in the Summit documents an outstanding case is made for the total rejection of the Australian Council of Trade Unions' cry for a catch-up but the Government has not had the courage to reject that cry. The document makes the following points: All cases involving payment of catch-up, whether paid in 1983 or 1984, involve continuing high rates of inflation throughout the next three years; the lowest inflation rates are obtained from those scenarios in which a wage pause is maintained throughout 1983 with no subsequent catch-up; and a return to strong employment growth requires a substantial and sustained increase in the rate of growth of output, perhaps to a rate of 5 per cent per annum. Only one projection, projection C, envisages a growth rate of more than 5 per cent. One of the great lessons from the material provided by the Government for the Summit is that inflation, excessive wages and unemployment are completely linked. It is evident from the Treasurer's misleading reply to my question today that he is trying to back away from the very clear statements made to the Summit which are now clearly-MONICA",54
29,Mr SPEAKER,SUMMIT SCENARIOS,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,54
30,Mr WELLS ,SUMMIT SCENARIOS,"Petrie) (6.16)- Mr Speaker, it is astonishing to hear the honourable member for Forrest ( Mr Drummond) tell us which of the three scenarios presented to the National Economic Summit Conference should have been chosen since it was the Opposition that said not very long ago that we should not have a Summit at all. When it argues that we should have adopted scenario C, we can see its credentials as an economic manager. The credentials the Opposition has provided as an economic manager is the state of the nation. I would like to say more about the state of the nation and the economy which the Government has inherited. The world knows that we are in the midst of a depression, but it is a ter of comparison. It is not good enough to say, as some people tended to say during the election campaign, that we are in the middle of a depression and therefore the Fraser Government cannot be blamed for Australia's economic ills. One of my constituents said to me during the campaign that if she had been cooking the same recipe for seven years and it had been giving people food poisoning for seven years she would think it was about time to change. I want to demonstrate that it is not just the world recession which has afflicted Australia during the last seven years of Liberal Government. Figures from all comparable nations show that the depression has been comparatively worse in Australia. The statistics of which I will inform the House come from the Commonwealth Parliamentary Library Statistics Group. The most recent figures available show that in the November quarter Australia's consumer prices were increasing at the rate of 10.9 per cent. That was the highest figure of all the comparable countries. Compare that 10.9 per cent in Australia with the figue for Japan of 2.3 per cent; Canada, 9.8 per cent; the United States of America, 4.6 per cent; France, 9.4 per cent; Germany, 4.7 per cent; and the United Kingdom, 6.3 per cent. That is inflation. What about unemployment? The most recent figures available for those countries are for December. In Australia the figure was 8.6 per cent. In Japan, it was 2.4 per cent; Canada, 12.7 per cent; the United States of America, 10.6 per cent; France, 8.1 per cent; Germany, 7.1 per cent; and the United Kingdom, 13.1 per cent. In that respect Australia is a middle-range country. I refer now to interest rates as indicated by the yields on long term government bonds. Of course these influence all other interest rates as well. The December figures were: Australia, 14 per cent; Japan, 7.5 per cent; Canada, 11.69 per cent; the United States of America, 10.55 per cent; France, 15.71 per cent; Germany, 7.9 per cent; and the United Kingdom, 10.2 per cent. It can be seen from those figures that Australian interest rates were the second highest in that group. This demonstrates that the depression which hit Australia and the rest of the world hit Australia particularly badly. The reason that it hit Australia particularly badly was the policies of the previous Government. It is not an end of the argument to say: 'But there was a world-wide depression'. Of course there was a world-wide depression but if a person has a cold he can do one of two things-either he can go home, take some antibiotics and hope he gets better by staying in matbed or he can go out in the rain and paddle around until he ends up with pleurisy or double pneumonia. When this Government took over from the previous Government it was taking over from economic practitioners who were leading this country to a state of pleurisy and double pneumonia.",54
31,Mr GOODLUCK ,SUMMIT SCENARIOS,"Franklin) (6.21)-During the National Economic Summit Conference I, like many other Australians, listened intently to many of the speakers. I listened very intently of course to the manager of Ampol Ltd, who said that the petroleum industry was overregulated. I could not help thinking about that industry, which has been described as chaotic and discriminatory. It has been suggested that the marketplace has been prostituted on many occasions. The honourable member for Hotham ( Mr Kent)-a good, sincere member-talked about the disabled and their problems. I agree with him. He brought a little politics into it and said that there was a waste of money in a certain area. I cannot help thinking of all the families in my electorate. Most of them are paying lOc a litre more for their petrol than similar families in Victoria. Mr Hollis-Free enterprise government!",54
32,Mr GOODLUCK,SUMMIT SCENARIOS,"I will explain that in a moment. I am trying to be conciliatory tonight. I do not really want to get into an argument; I want to try to bring us together. Last week I tried to divide us, purposely, but tonight I want to try to bring us together. Sometimes we come here and twiddle our thumbs on committees; for example, I love to think that we could, as a bipartisan approach, set up a select committee to look into the problems of the oil industry. Incidentally, I would be the man. The taxpayers of Australia have paid millions of dollars for inquiries into the oil industry which have examined the price of petrol, how it is marketed and so forth. Still we are no further advanced. There is even a discount war commencing in Sydney this week which will cause the price of petrol to drop by 1Dc a litre. There are various prices all over Australia-country people are paying a lot more than city people, et cetera. I do not really criticise what most of the States have done, although I must admit they have Labor governments. They have put a freeze on the wholesale price and on the retail price of petrol. In Tasmania and Queensland market forces determine the price. The oil companies have got themselves into such a bind that they are really starting to feel the pressure. Where there is a freeze on the wholesale price and on the retail price they cannot pass on any increase. They are starting to battle. Their shareholders are starting to say: 'Look, you are not making enough profit'. As a consequence, States such as Tasmania and Queensland are feeling the pressure-particularly Tasmania. Every time there is an increase in Tasmania we accept it. Mr Cunningham-Why don't you put a freeze on it?",55
33,Mr GOODLUCK,SUMMIT SCENARIOS,If we all did that we might as well say that the oil industry has had it. start to withdraw a few of its investments from New South Wales. It is all right for supporters of the Government always to criticise the multinationals but we need them to provide employment and to find and develop alternative sources of energy. Unfortunately honourable members opposite have such a narrow approach to this matter that sometimes it makes me sick. What they suggest would not sort out the oil industry.,55
34,Mr HODGMAN ,SUMMIT SCENARIOS,They hate Tasmania.,55
35,Mr GOODLUCK,SUMMIT SCENARIOS,"As the honourable member for Denison says, they really hate Tasmania. When we start talking about paying lOc a litre more they start to complain. Would it not be a good idea to form a select committee? The Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) is not here; the honourable member for Lalor ( Mr Barry Jones) is at the table. I will not talk about him. However, I suggest to him that it would be a good idea to form a select committee of interested people. We could go to every State and start talking about the petroleum iridustry. It would not cost $1.5m like the Collins Royal Commission on Petroleum. It was pigeonholed for the term of its natural life. I made one speech about the petroleum industry back in 1976. The Australian Labor Party forgot about it. chair- Mr Hawke was involved in the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Solo project. They started to prostitute the market. It is all forgotten. I should forget it. But it would be a good idea to form a select committee to look into the problems of the oil industry and then we might get a bit of sanity.",55
36,Mr MILTON ,SUMMIT SCENARIOS,"La Trobe) (6.26)-Having seen one of the recent television broadcasts by the public broadcasting company, Open Channel Cooperative Ltd, I take this opportunity to congratulate it on the quality and creativity of its work. Unfortunately my electoral engagements meant that I was able to view only one film of the series so far. The film was called Jacob-Everbody's Allowed To Cry and it was introduced by the film maker, Lyn Bugden. The film was a most moving documentary of the life of one small boy, Jacob, and his family as he went through a series of operations and a prolonged period of hospitalisation. Although almost all of the sequences were shot in the hospital, there was a clear and thoughtful attempt by the film maker not to interrupt the hospital routine and yet to capture the great courage of Jacob and the compassion and the patience of his mother in intimate episodes of preoperative and post-operative conditions. The film was an excellent example of what can be done by public television and a team of It might dedicated volunteer workers with high professional standards. Open Channel has not just sat back and waited for the Government to provide assistance but has organised members and volunteers to produce the series of films which are presently being shown by courtesy of the Special Broadcasting Service, Channel 0-28. The aim of Open Channel is to provide an alternative television service to the existing Australian Broadcasting Commission and commercial channels. Of course, it is true that the potential audience will be small because the program will not be aimed at a mass consumption audience. As in the film about Jacob, there will be a conscious effort to bring the reality of life, with all its starkness its poignancy, into the homes of the viewers. Such films cannot be watched with complacency and voyeurism. In its 1980 election campaign, the Liberal Government promised to establish public television early in 1981. This was another of those porkbarrelling exercises of the previous Government, which likewise broke its promise with regard to television translaters to improve the television reception in the Dandenong Ranges in Victoria. No policy on public television was ever announced by the previous Federal Government and no licences were ever issued. The response to previous broadcasts has indicated that there is a sufficiently widespread interest in public television to warrant the continued development of a public television service. In the areas of health and community welfare there is a great need to make people aware of the services available to them.",55
37,Mr GOODLUCK ,SUMMIT SCENARIOS,What are you doing about it? You are in government now.,56
38,Mr MILTON,SUMMIT SCENARIOS,I am sorry about these interruptions from the honourable member for Franklin. He is obviously not interested in public television any more than the previous Government was.,56
39,Deus ex machina,SUMMIT SCENARIOS,Government members interjectingMONICA,56
40,Mr SPEAKER,SUMMIT SCENARIOS,Order! I think the honourable member for La Trobe could also do without assistance from some of his colleagues. They are not helping. I call the honourable member for La Trobe.,56
41,Mr MILTON,SUMMIT SCENARIOS,"Public television could provide a means of reaching a group in need which includes many people who are not print orientated. In the areas of community education, conservation of natural resources, energy conservation, road safety and infant welfare-just to name a few-public television could provide programs of great value to audiences which would normally not have an opportunity to view such programs. All three levels of government have an interest in supporting public television. Local government has a regional responsibility for local community groups which can obtain a voice through public television. State governments can use a public television service for the dissemination of important information in education, the arts and welfare. Finally, the Federal Government should support public television as a necessary part and as an important strand of the total broadcasting system in Australia. I am proud that I am a member of Open Channel. Once again, I congratulate it on the high quality of its recent teleand vision programs shown on Channel 0-28. I commend the programs to honourable members and I hope that those honourable members who live in Melbourne and Sydney will all watch the second series of television programs commencing on Saturday, 14 May.",56

45,Mr KEATING ,SUMMIT SCENARIOS,"BlaxlandTreasurer) (6.30)-The honourable member for Forrest ( Mr Drummond) made a personal explanation after Question Time to which I was not able to respond owing to appointments. I believe he has since raised the matter in the adjournment debate. It relates to a question which he asked of me last week and to the assumption in his question relating to the inflation component of scenarios A and C put to the NationalEconomic Summit Conference. In the answer I gave him the other day I said that his assumption on inflation was wrong. It was not wrong but I misunderstood that his question referred to the three year projection rather than the 12 month projection to which I referred in the answer. Nevertheless, I make the point that, in accepting the basis of the honourable member's question, it does not detract from the sense of the reply which I gave to him which was that the members of the technical committee expressed strong reservations about the assumptions in scenario C and said that in some respects they were unrealistic. In the answer I made the point that non-farm wage share under senario C would be lower than those levels which prevailed historically in the 1950s and 1960s. I instanced those figures. Not only do I stand by that answer but forthose interested, I will read into the Hansard record part of the editorial in today's Sydney Morning Herald which mentions scenario C and the arguments in favour of it put by the Australian Industry Development Association. The editorial notes that the Australian Industry Development Association, while arguing the case that was implied in the question of the honourable member for Forrest also said in its exposition on the subject: ""Leaving the industrial relations credibility of these scenarios aside . . ."" However, The Sydney Morning Herald states: The industrial relations credibility of the competing scenarios could not, of course, be left aside. And the sad fact is that Scenario C lacks credibility. Scenario C purports to produce a profits share of national income greater than Australia has previously experienced. Does anyone seriously imagine that wage earners could be induced to accept protracted partial indexation while profits rose to unknown heights? To embark on Scenario C would be to guarantee a wage explosion. The interests of the unemployed will best be served by a wages policy based on realism, not idealism. Employers will best contribute to the restoration of economic stability not by hankering after the impossible, but by uniting with the Government and union moderates to ensure that an achievable degree of wage restraint is actually achieved. This is a sufficiently daunting task. That is the view of the leader writer of the Sydney Morning Herald. In the respect that the editorial talks about the wage share being different from those which have prevailed historically, that view accords with the view I put in answer to the honourable gentleman although I do him the courtesy of indicating that the basis of his question on the three year projection was correct.",56
