1,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"I have just had .placed in my hand, and have not had 'time to read it carefully, another letter from the Premier of New South Wales regarding the quarantining of Sydney. As honourable members had an opportunity to read the letter in this morning's newspapers before I got it , I hasten to l a y ' it on the table of the House.",12
2,Mr WEBSTER,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"I wish to know from the Minister of Trade and Customs if he is correctly reported in the Age to have said that when he was in Sydney recently he discovered that the legislation that was being promulgated hy the Government of New South Wales was not that which was demanded by the Federal - Government, and he refused to raise the quarantine until legislation in harmony with the ideaB of his Department was brought in ?",12
3,Mr GROOM,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"I have not seen the repor t in the Age, but the .statement .made just now hy the honourable member is certainly not correct.",12
4,Mr CONROY,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,I have been assured that it is true.,12
5,Mr GROOM,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"It is not correct. The honourable member for Gwydir asked me for certain information regarding smallpox contacts. I told him yesterday that I had forwarded his request, and the following reply came yesterday evening:(a) Eighty-three contacts have been detained at the station since the commencement of the epidemic. [i) The Health Department of New South Wales state that it is impossible to state what persons have and have not been contacts, and; therefore, it is impossible to say what proportion of contacts has not been isolated. EXPORTATION OF MEAT .",12
6,Mr TUDOR,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"On behalf of the honourable member for Bendigo I ask the Minister <ef Trade and Customs whether he has been able to obtain the information which the honourable member desired a few days ago ? If so, will he give it to the House ?",12
7,Mr GROOM,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"My replies to the honourable member's questions are that I bave seen the Age article referred to, and that the measures taken by the Department to control the export of meat are theseOn the and May, 1.911, a proclamation under tie Custom* Act m t issued prohibiting the expert of meat unless .certified to be fit for export by a qualified inspector appointed under the Commerce Act. Whilst a reasonable standard is maintained, it .cannot be provided that all meat exported shall be of superior quality. The conditions governing the .export of meat to the various countries must be uniform. It would be impracticable to impose different standards f s r different countries, especially as meat sent to one country is, on arrival, frequently transferred to another. The inspectors are men specially qualified for the work, and they have been fully impressed with ihe necessity, in the interests of our export trade, of maintaining a very careful watch over exports. SUGAR EXCISE. COLLECTION OF DUTIES .",12
8,Mr HIGGS,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"Is it not the invariable rule to collect duties immediately on ihe introduction of a taxation Bill? I ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether Excise is now being collected on Australian sugar, and, if not, why not? Mr - GROOM - I am afraid t h at to answer the question would be to open <gp a - discussion of. measures on the not i copaper. I explained yesterday the provisions of the Excise Tariff (Sugar) Bill .",12
9,Mr HIGGS,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"Is it not a fact that the Standing Orders would prevent the discussion at this stage of measures on the notice-paper? ' The question I ask the Minister is, whether it is not the in variable rule to collect Customs or Excise immediately on the introduction of a taxation Bill , and, if so, why has not Excise been collected under the Excise Tariff (Sugar) Bill ?",13
10,Mr GROOM,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"When it is desired to impose general taxation under a law that is to have continuing force, such as a general Customs or Excise Act , the procedure indicated by the honourable member is followed, but in this instance, as I explained yesterday, we are imposing Excise for the recovery of a specific amount of duty, and the investigation and collection of certain facts is necessary before that can be done. viding that the measure shall come into force on a certain day to enable the exact amount of duty to be collected which, in justice to all parties concerned, should be collected. Later:",13
11,Mr HIGGS,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"I desire to ask the At torney-General a question arising out of the answer given by the Minister of Trade and Customs, that in the case of a Bill relating to general taxation it is the custom to 'Collect the duties immediately, and his statement that the measure in question is one dealing with special cases, anddifferentiating, of course, between individuals and the community. Does the Attorney-General consider that the Excise Tariff (Sugar) Bill is a constitutional measure ? Of course, in anticipating that it is possible",13

13,Mr BRUCE SMITH,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,This is an essay.,13
14,Mr HIGGS,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,No one ever reads the honourable member's essays..,13
15,Mr BRUCE SMITH,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,I would not them; you want brains for that.,13
16,Mr SPEAKER,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,Order !,13
17,Mr HIGGS,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"I want to know whether the Excise Tariff (Sugar) Bill , which is on the notice paper for the third reading is, in the opinion of the Attorney General, constitutional. May I say in explanation that I think that the House, as well as the country, is entitled to his advice and ooinion on such a point? Mr W . . H . IRVINE - I do not admit that I am either entitled or bound to answer legal questions asked in the House, or to disclose to honourable members the legal advice which I am bound to render to my colleagues. But in this particular matter, I think that I can answer without the slightest difficulty. I see no reason why the Excise Tariff (Sugar) Bill now before the House is not perfectly constitutional. Last session there was passed a Bill repealing the existing duties of Excise. It is always competent for Parliament in another session to pass a Bill imposing fresh duties of Excise. That is the case in this instance.",13
18,Mr HIGGS,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,I want to know,13
19,Mr SPEAKER,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,Will i the honourable member allow me to interpose?,13
20,Mr HIGGS,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"Yes , sir.",13
21,Mr SPEAKER,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"The honourable member has asked a number of questions already in reference to one subject. It is We are pro- contrary to the practice of Parliament to allow a debate arising out of the answer given to a question, but a practice is growing up daily in this Chamber of practically conducting a debate on answers given to questions by means of a series of fresh inquiries in reference to the same questions and answers thereto. That is a practice which is quite contrary to all Parliamentary precedent, and should be discontinued. Though on occasions it is allowable to ask a further question if it is necessary to the elucidation of the answer given. . Mr Webster - May I ask the At torney-General whether there is any justification for differentiation in the administration of a particular Customs and Excise Act, as against the measure which is before the House at the present time? Mr W . H . IRVINE - Does the honourable member mean that Customs and Excise duties are imposed from the time the preliminary resolution is introduced in the ordinary way ? ask Mr Webster - That is right. Mr W . H . IRVINE - In this case the duty is not imposed at once, but after a certificate is given. I might remind the honourable member that the ordinary practice of collecting duties of Excise or Customs before the House has agreed to them, and afterwards getting, an indemnity, is one which, though irregular constitutionally, is adopted in order to prevent persons from taking goods out of bond, and thus causing a loss of revenue to the Commonwealth. That reason does not exist in the present case because the Excise duty imposed by this particular Bill does not depend upon the particular goods remaining in bond. It depends upon a certifithat cate given as to certain facts, which main the same whether any taken out of bond or not. GEELONG WOOLLEN MILLS .",13
22,Mr KELLY,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"Yesterday the honour the able member for Corio asked a question regarding the temporary stoppage of work Navigation Act? on the Geelong Woollen Mills. I told him that we were waiting for the supply of steel trusses for the roof, and I now informed that tenders for these trusses were called on the 11th April, accepted on the 10th May, and the condrafted, tract signed on the 23rd May. The first in a few days. delivery was to be within five months, that is, on 23rd October; and the final step? delivery within seven months, that is, on the 23rd December, the weight of material being about 450 tons. The Director General ofWorks statesAlthough the execution has been stopped porarily, it is an advantage to allow the foundations to consolidate (for concrete floors as the Typothetae. and machinery)-before putting on the roof. the point of view of completion of the factory, the stoppage will not entail a delay. building will be ready to accommodate the textile machinery when it is delivered in tralia in about next March. COMMONWEALTH RAILWAYS. KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA - PINE gentleman. CREEK TO KATHERINE RIVER.",14
23,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"Has the and, Honorary Minister any information to give the House regarding the laying rails on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway ?",14
24,Mr KELLY,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"There are now with the track-layer at Port Augusta six bogie waggons with a pilot-car complete. The engine is to be tested tomorrow, and expect to be in a position to lay rails the end of the week. So far as Western Australian end is concerned, orable members. twelve bogie waggons are now en route to Fremantle. We expect to have them all ready at Kalgoorlie in a few weeks' time, when Mr Joubert, the expert, have gone there from Port Augusta, and then we shall begin laying the rails.",14
25,Mr THOMAS,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"I ask the Minister of External Affairs, regarding the nonacceptance by the Government of tenders for material for the construction of the line from Pine Creek to Katherine River, whether that will not mean that nothing can be done for a period of twelve months, because of the rain setting in?",14
26,Mr GLYNN,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"I have no advice to effect. I do not think that our reaction will cause a delay of twelve months, goods are or any similar period. NAVIGATION ACT.",14

33,Mr HOWE,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"Inasmuc h as Mr Justice Higgins, in his award in the postal electricians case, decided upon, not a specific, but a minimum, rate of wages- I emphasize the word minimum-and as, according to his statement yesterday, men whose services were heretofore appraised at and paid for at the rate of 9s. 6d. per day are now being paid for at a rate as low as 5s. 4d., wil l the Postmaster General, in the public interest, and in justice to the men concerned, approach the Public Service Commissioner with a. view to the settlement of this dispute ?",14
34,Mr AGAR WYNNE,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"The matter is in the hands of the Public Service Commissioner. I knew nothing about it u n t i l I received a communication by telephone the night before last. The rate of 5s. 4d. is, I believe, being paid to lads, not to grown-up men.",15
35,Mr HOWE,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"Is the statement of Mr . Justice Higgins correct, and were not the Postmaster-General and the Public Service Commissioner joined as respondents in the postal electricians' case ? The honourable gentleman having appeared at the hearing of the case as a respondent, is he not equally responsible with the Public Service Commissioner for the proper settlement of this matter ?",15
36,Mr AGAR WYNNE,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"I ask the honourable member to give notice of his question.  mitted anomaly in the cost of Inter-State telegrams, will the Postmaster General, institute at least a uniform charge for press telegrams between the States ?",15

Will he endeavour to devise some means whereby the whole of the work in connection with applications for country telephones can be brought right up to date, and, if necessary, a larger trust f u nd set aside whereby the works can be undertaken quite apart from those which are mentioned in the Estimates each year?",15
38,Mr AGAR WYNNE,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"This matter has been causing me considerable concern lately. I have been reflecting as to the best means of getting over the difficulty. While coming in this morning, or perhaps going home last night, it occurred to me that the simplest plan to adopt-as I am afraid the Department cannot overtake the arrears-woul d be to call for tenders for as many lines as possible, and thus see if we can get over the difficulty in that way.",15
39,Mr KING OMALLEY,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"I wish to ask the Postmaster-General a question. Some time ago a thriving mining town called Rosebery, in Tasmania, applied to the Department for a telephone at the hospital. The people are scattered a b it in that country, and through the interminable red tape of the Department in Hobart",15

42,Mr AGAR WYNNE,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"Some time ago I gave instructions to have this matter looked into, but I do not think that I have yet received any information on the point. I shall make an effort to get hold of this "" steeplechaser.""",15
43,Mr SINCLAIR,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"I desire to ask the Postmaster-General whether it is possible to bring the postal management of a border town in a State under the control of the Deputy Postmaster-General in the adjoining State? As an example, I may mention that the greater part of the postal and other business, at Tweed Heads is done with Brisbane. Is it possible to bring the postal - management of Tweed Heads under the control of the Deputy Postmaster-General at Brisbane?",15
44,Mr AGAR WYNNE,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"I have f e lt for some time that the present system of working a large State from one centre demands too much from the Deputy Postmaster-General. I think that these officers have too much detailed work to do, and are tied up in their offices. What is in my mind, if I have an opportunity of doing it , is to cut up Australia into districts and to give the postmasters in each district more power and more responsibility, and if you like, to have a supervisor in each State. The postmaster at a place like A l b u r y , for instance, would manage that district, and so at Broken Hill and other places.",15

46,Mr AGAR WYNNE,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,I do not think it is possible for one man to manage the whole of the postal business of Queensland or New South Wales. Later:,15
47,Mr FRAZER,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"-Advertin g to the statement made just now by the Postmaster General that he intends to delegate to postmasters the authority to do certain things, will the honourable gentleman state whether he intends to make this change by regulation or is it his intention to bring down legislation to enable what he jjroposed to be carried out?",16
48,Mr AGAR WYNNE,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"I merely gave an outline of what was in my mind in regard to this matter. I feel that the Deputy Postmasters-General are overworked and tied to i much to their office stools. If this change can be done by regulation I shall endeavour to have it carried out in that way. I shall be prepared to take the responsibility if I believe that it is the.right thing to do. On the other hand, if the change can be effected only by legislation, I shall have the necessary Bill drafted by-and-by. I propose to have a conference with leading officers in my Department to ascertain whether what is in my mind in this respect can be carried out.",16
49,Mr KING OMALLEY,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"Will the Postmaster-General extend this delegation of authority to some of the under officers who are not allowed to have a say, but know a lot more than some of the top gentlemen ?",16
50,Mr FINLAYSON,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"In the Ministerial statement presented to the House we have outlined a proposal on the part of the Government to appoint Commissioners to manage the Postal Department. Will the Postmaster-General state whether his proposal in regard to the delegation of certain authority to postmasters is to be carried out at once, or does he propose to delay the initiation of that system u n t i l the Commissioners have been appointed ""and have had time to consider it?",16
51,Mr AGAR WYNNE,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"AB i ll has been, or is being, drafted to provide for the appointment of Commissioners. I was merely telling the House what I thought of doing if I remained long enough at the head of the Department to make certain improvements. NAVAL BOARD.",16
52,Mr CHARLTON,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether it is a fact, as reported in the newspapers today, that Captain Onslow has been suspended from the Naval Board, and, if so, will he give the House the reasons for such suspension ?",16
53,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"I must ask the honourable member to put that question on the notice-paper, and I will give him a fuller answer later.",16
54,Mr FRAZER,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"Touchin g the .announcement in this morning's papers re^ garding Captain Onslow, I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he does not think that the fact that a highly recommended and qualified naval officer has been relieved from duty is of sufficient im portance to justify a statement on his part as to the reason or reasons that have led to this rather unusual action on the part of the Government?",16
55,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"I have to say in reply that I distinctly remember that my honourable friend's colleague, when Minister of Defence, declined absolutely to furnish information concerning the retirement of a naval officer on a previous occasion.",16
56,Mr FRAZER,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,That is no answer.,16
57,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,Then my f u r ther answer is that the honourable member should put his question on the notice paper.,16
58,Mr FRAZER,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,It is shocking treatment of an important naval officer. NORTHERN TERRITORY. DEATH SENTENCE ON ABORIGINALS.,16
59,Mr JH CATTS,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"About a fortnight ago I asked the Minister of External A f fairs a question with regard to the death sentence passed on some aboriginals in the Northern Territory, and a report in the press which seemed to show that they had not had a fai r t r i a l. I wish to know whether the honourable gentleman has since inquired into the matter, whether he has had time to look into Professor Baldwin Spencer's report on the manner in which aboriginals are treated in the Northern Territory; and, if so, whether he has reached any conclusion ?",16
60,Mr GLYNN,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"The papers have not yet reached me from the Northern Territory. Of course, when they do come, I shall give them the most careful consideration. I think that the honourable member may allay any anxiety on his part, because the Executive will approach the matter with a very deep sense of responsibility. I have read the report, but of course it does not really touch the question of whether the death sentence in these cases should be commuted or not. COMPULSOR YTRAINING .",16
61,Mr JH CATTS,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"I wish to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence a question regarding the taking into custody by the Militar y Department of a lad named Isaac Slingo, of 71 Bridgeroad, Camperdown. Will the honourable gentleman see if there are not circumstances connected with the case which might warrant the release of the boy, who is the sole support of a widowed mother and so on; or, if not, can an allowance be made from the Department to the widowed mother during the lad's custody by the Militar y Department?",17
62,Mr KELLY,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"I shall bring the honourable member's question under the notice of the Minister of Defence, and ask him to furnish an answer; but, in order to facilitate that happening, may I suggest to the honourable member that he should place on the notice-paper a question giving the particulars of the case?",17
63,Mr JH CATTS,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,If you will do that it will be all right.,17

65,Mr SHARPE,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"Has the Attorney General issued special instructions to institute proceedings against newspapers that advocate Labour politics throughout Australia for the publication of unsigned articles; and, if so, will the Liberal newspapers also be prosecuted for doing the same thing ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - I have not issued instructions for the prosecution of any newspapers. ELECTOR AL ROLLS. OBJECTIONS: REMOVAL OF NAMES.",17
66,Mr JH CATTS,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,I ask the Honorary Minister if he has made inquiries about the removal of names from the electoral roll* for the Cook division which he promised yesterday afternoon to do?,17
67,Mr KELLY,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"I put the matter into the hands of the Chief Officer yesterday morning. He has wired to Sydney, but told me this morning that he has not yet obtained the information desired.",17
68,Mr JH CATTS,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"I wish to ask the Attorney-General a question in connection with the removal of names from the electoral roll. I do not know, sir, whether I am allowed to quote his statement on the 24th September, as reported in Hansard.",17
69,Mr SPEAKER,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"The honourable member may refer to the statement, but he cannot quote it .",17
70,Mr JH CATTS,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"The honourable gentleman stated that the electoral officers would have to make inquiry into every case, and that the name of a person transferred from one district to another district would not be taken off one roll until his name was placed on another roll. Yesterday, I drew attention to some hundreds of names having been objected to in one subdivision of Cook, and wish to ask the Attorney-General whether the Returning Officer for the district has to personally institute an inquiry into every case, whether it is possible for him to do that with such a large number of cases to be inquired into? Will the honourable gentleman also see that his statement as to the names of persons not being removed from the rolls is sent out to the Returning Officers for the various districts ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - I think that there is a little misapprehension in the question. In the first place, instructions have been issued by the Chief Electoral Officer, and have been laid on the table of the House. Upon those instructions, and those alone, as I understand it-cer tainly not on any other intimation from the Government-the Electoral Registrars are authorized to act. These in structions do not, and can not, under the existing^ law, authorize a name to be removed from one roll before it is placed on another. They expressly require that the officers-no t the Returning Officers, but the Electoral Registrars, who, at the time of an election, are usually Returning Officers-shal l make full inquiry before they take any action. If they do not, and have not time to make that in quiry they cannot remove the name. In other words, a name cannot be removed u n t i l the inquiry has been made. That is the position. Por further information in Electoral detail, as to what is actually being done, I must refer the honourable member to the Department in which the Chief Electoral Officer carries on his work. Later:",17
71,Mr JH CATTS,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"If the Attorney General will pardon me for asking him another question in connection with electoral matters, and arising out of his previous answer",17
72,Mr SPEAKER,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"Order ! I have already pointed out that it is contrary to the practice of Parliament as recorded by recognised authorities to permit answers given by Ministers to questions to be debated, and although a further question is permissible to make clearer a reply already given, a practice is growing up here of practically raising a debate oh ah answer to a question by a series of further questions arising out of the answer already given, and upon subsequent answers. This practice is irregular, and should be discontinued.",18
73,Mr WEBSTER,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"On a point of order, sir, will you kindly state, for the information of the House, what is the object of a question? Is not the privilege which honourable members have of addressing to Ministers questions concerning matters of public importance granted with the object of enabling information to be obtained, and are not honourable members justified in putting questions until they obtain the information for which they ask? Is not an honourable member entitled to obtain a full reply to a question put by him to a Minister?",18
74,Mr SPEAKER,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"The honourable member is asking two questions. Dealing first of all with the second question put to me-whethe r an honourable member is entitled to obtain a full answer to any question he may ask a Minister, I would say that that is a matter entirely at the discretion of the Minister to whom the question is addressed. As a matter of fact, a Minister is not bound to answer any question put to him without notice. It is entirely within his own discretion whether he shall do so or not. As to the first part of the question which the honourable member, on a point of order, has addressed to me, he desires to obtain certain information, and I have before me a number of extracts from various authorities on parliamentary procedure dealing with the subject-matter of his inquiry. He asked for guidance in regard to the asking of questions, and I would refer him to page 249 of the 11th edition of May, where it is stated thatThe purpose of a question, is to obtain information, and not to supply it to the House. A question may not contain statements of facts, unless they be necessary to make the question telligible and can be authenticated; nor should a question contain arguments, inferences, imputations, epithets, or controversial or ironical expressions. Nor may a question refer to debates or answers to questions in the current session. Discussion in anticipation upon an order of the day or other matter, by means of a question, is not permitted; nor can a question be asked regarding proceedings in a Committee which have not been placed before the House by a report from the Committee. A question which publishes the names of persons, or statements not strictly necessary to render the question intelligible, will be refused a place on the notice paper. The expression of an opinion cannot be sought for by a question, nor the solution of an, abstract legal case, or of a hypothetical proposition. Nor is it in order to ask merely whether certain things, such as statements made in a newspaper, are true; but attention may be drawn to such statements if the member who put the question makes himself responsible for their accuracy. No question can be asked which reflects on the character or conduct of those persons whose conduct, as stated on page 278, can only be dealt with on a substantive motion; and for the same reason a question is not permitted which makes or implies charges of a personal character. Nor can any question be asked regarding character or conduct, except of persons in their official or public capacity. A question also which might prejudice a pending trial should not be asked. This statement generally covers rulings and practice governing the asking of questions.",18
75,Mr JH CATTS,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"As a matter of privilege, sir, I regret that you interrupted me before you heard my question. You gave me the call, and I was about to state my question",18
76,Mr SPEAKER,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,The honourable member immediately connected it with an answer given to a previous question.,18
77,Mr JH CATTS,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,Certainly .,18
78,Mr SPEAKER,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,The honourable member will recognise from the quotation I have just made that he was not in order in doing so.,18
79,Mr JH CATTS,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"My question does not come within the category which you, Mr Speaker, have just referred to. It was perfectly legitimate, I submit, and I was asking it in good faith. It arises from a misunderstanding in my mind as to the Attorney-General's answer.",18
80,Mr WH IRVINE,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,If there is any other information I can give the honourable member I shall be glad to supply it .,18
81,Mr JH CATTS,LETTER FROM NEW SOUTH WAXES,"I understood the Attorney-General to say that when objections were lodged inquiries would be made, and that the names would thereafter be removed from the rolls by the registrars in the different; districts. I inwish to be clear whether it is really the Registrar or the Returning Officer with whom rests the responsibility of removing names. Mr W . H . IRVINE - As a matter of fact it is neither. In the case of transthe fers it is the Chief Electoral Officer of the State who is responsible. ' Mr JH CATTS - But when tion is lodged what is the position ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - I am speaking now of a matter which is not related to tion on the paper? my Department, and only from a recollection of the provisions of the Act and gulations. A u official inquiry is by the Registrar and, as I understand the position, the result is reported Chief Electoral Officer of the State. The question first put by the honourable member was whether names were being rematter. moved where there was not an opportunity for full inquiry. That is possible under the law, nor is it prescribed under the instructions issued by the Chief Electoral Officer which, by the way, were laid on the table of the House the other day. Inquiries have to be made. As whether the Electoral Officer in each d vision has the power under regulations does, in fact, remove any names without reporting to the Chief Electoral Officer of the State, I am unable to state without refreshing my memory with regard to the going on. provisions of the Act and the regulations. But no name can under the law be reorable moved from a roll on the ground that person concerned has removed from the district to which that roll it is put on to another roll, and no authority has been given by the Government or by the Chief Electoral Officer for such a thing to be done. Inquiry must be made ral, upon noticeby the Electoral Officer concerned.",18

NA INTER - STA TE PRODUCE.",21
109,Mr ATKINSON,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"Wilmot) [11.38] - I move That, - in the opinion of this House, the monwealth should forthwith take over the inspection and effective control of produce passing from State to State. This is not a new matter. I moved in this direction in 1910, and on that occasion the Minister of Trade and Customs of the day, the honourable member for Yarra, after a lengthy discussion on the motion, promised me that if it was withdrawn he would gather all the information he could concerning the subject and let me have it . Whether the honourable gentleman was unable to obtain the necessary information or not I cannot say.",22
110,Mr TUDOH,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,I let the honourable member have all the information I was able to obtain.,22
111,Mr ATKINSON,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"The information supplied to me did not touch the question. This is not a revolutionary matter, as the changes involved, in giving effect to my motion would be comparatively unimportant. At present, when we have an unfortunate visitation in the shape of some disease or pest, the Inter-State trade is thrown into a state of chaos. The producer does not know whether his produce will be received on the market for which it is intended, while the merchant is doubtful about how or when to buy, or to otherwise regulate his business. Altogether, there is much indefiniteness and confusion; and it therefore seems to me that if Federal officers were used instead of the State officers, much uncertainty and undesirable anti-Federal feeling would avoided. Produce is now inspected at the port of shipment, and also at the port of entry; and, if in the State of the port of entry there has been a good season for the particular produce shipped, and Rail- the imported produce is rejected, a suspicion arises that the inspection laws are being used for some ulterior purpose, such as 'reserving the local market for the local produce.",22
112,Mr JENSEN,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,I thought the honourable member was a State Righter ?,22
113,Mr ATKINSON,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"This is not a question of State rights, because all the powers that I suggest should be exercised are given to the Commonwealth under the Constitution. Inter-State trade is on the increase, and will continue to improve as the population grows, so that there can be no doubt as to the importance of the issues involved. When sound, wholeCom- some produce, fit for human consumption, passes from one State to another, there should be some guarantee that it will be permitted to go on the market. My desire may not be so easy of accomplishment as one would like, but the constitutional, legal, and other difficulties are not insuperable. It is quite right that) the States should have powers of inspection, because it is their duty to protect the health of the community; and for that reason I l i m it my proposal to sound, wholesome produce. There will be no more danger of infection if my proposal be carried out than there is at present; the only difference will be that the produce will be inspected by officers with a Federal standing, and the producer will be satisfied that the inspection is impart i a l. As I say, there is much antireally Federal feeling caused by the fact that the produce of one State is rejected in another State; and, however fairl y treated people may be, they cannot get it out of their heads that the inspection laws are used for some ulterior purpose. Surely it should be possible for the Commonwealth and State authorities to come to some amicable and satisfactory arrangement, and thus bring about more settled conditions in Inter-State trade., Any surplus over the cost of inspection at present is, by section 102 of the Constitution, the property of the Commonwealth, and there ought to be sufficient to meet the expense of a Federal service.",22
114,Mr TUDOR,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"In some cases the fees be meet the expenses, 'but not in all .",22
115,Mr ATKINSON,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"At any rate, there would be very little increase on the present cost. The question is, bow far the Constitution will allow the Commonwealth to go before we arrive at the point where we run counter to the reserved police powers of the States, which are exercised chiefly by means of the inspection laws? For instance, in New South Wales and some of the other States there are Acts dealing with vegetation diseases; and I am not sure that we can go as far as I suggest in my motion. Commonwealth, however, ought to have sufficient power to guarantee the producer that, when sound stuff is placed on the wharfs, it will be permitted to go on the market. Section 92 of the Constitution declares that Inter-State trade shall be free; and any State law which conflicts with that section is void. tion 102 of the Constitution there is power to annul the inspection laws of the States if these are used for any purpose that is not regarded as legitimate; but still there is some difficulty as to how far we can control the produce if we decide to undertake the inspection ourselves. There ought to be power, when a Commonwealth officer has guaranteed the produce, to insure that it shall not be blocked on the wharfs by any State authority.",22
116,Mr SAMPSON,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"Would the member favour inspection at the port of entry, the port of departure, or both?",23
117,Mr ATKINSON,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"I am prepared to leave that to the authorities after the system I advocate is instituted. sonally, I should like to see inspection at port of entry only, in order to save expense.",23
118,Mr TUDOR,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"If there was inspection at the port of entry only, exporters might ship bad goods.

I do not propose to speak at any length the business-paper today. upon this motion, because it seems to that it merely seeks to provide for an act of common justice. I recognise that if I wish to secure an expression of opinion ou the part of the House upon it , it would be unwise for me to discuss it .",23
120,Mr TUDOR,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"I rise to a point of order. The I wish to know if the motion is in order, seeing that at the present time we have before us an Electoral Bill which deals with this and other matters cognate to it ?",23
121,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"On the point of order, I submit that the Electoral Bill does not make any provision for the reform which I seek to bring about under By sec- this motion. This is the reason why the motion appears upon the business-paper. I congratulate the honourable member for Yarra upon his endeavour to interfere with every electoral reform that is proposed in this House.",23
122,Mr WEBSTER,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"I contend that while it is perfectly true, as the honourable member for Eden-Monaro has stated, that no provision is made in the Electoral Bill for the innovation which he desires to bring about, it is quite competent for him honourable to submit an amendment to that effect in Committee. It is idle for him to placard the country in this way.",23
123,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,Do not throw out innuendoes about placarding. The Perhonorable member is the greatest placarder i u the House.,23
124,Mr CONROY,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"This is a specific motion, and I submit that if we are to be excluded from considering it on the ground that certain matters may be brought forward when the Electoral Bill is under review, we may be placed in a very awkward position. The question at issue really is whether the proposal of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro is dealt with under that measure. I submit that it is perfectly competent for us to discuss this proposal.",23
125,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"I have no whatever in arriving at a decision upon this matter. I would point out that Mr Speaker has already had the motion of the honourable member for so Eden-Monaro under his observation, and it was for him to decide whether it was Obviously, if it had not been in order it would not have appeared upon Further, it me seems to me that the motion does not come within the scope of the Electoral Bill, and therefore I rule that it is quite order.",23

128,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"I am ters sorry that I cannot return the compliSurely ment. In Australia there are quite a number of places at which forty or fifty votes are polled, and under the electoral law as it stands at present we have to there. assume that the electors recording those votes are not honest enough to be intrusted with the counting of them. Very often ballot-boxes from these have to be despatched, perhaps 100 miles, to a larger centre, where they are counted. This procedure involves great delay, prevents the people in little townships from knowing what votes have been polled.",24
129,Mr AHCHIBALD,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,And what persons have voted there.,24
130,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,Exactly . of My experience is that persons who vote country towns have no desire to conceal the way in which they vote. We know how nine-tenths of them vote before of the ballot-papers are counted.,24

Labour supporters in the country are not so dreadfully ashamed of the way in which they vote, that they fear to have the votes cast at small centres counted  ballot? That is what the honourable memsmall centres ber is advocating.",24

I know places at which 200, 300, and 400 votes in are recorded, and yet Under the existing system those votes cannot be counted locally, but have to be forwarded, perhaps any many miles, to another centre.",24
137,Mr FENTON,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,There is a place in my constituency where I would not have the member's votes counted for anything.,24

142,Mr CONROY,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"If I told the honourable member he would not know, because he has no acquaintance with the geography of New South Wales. The only places of which he has any knowledge are bhose in which he has actually been. He appears to think that only the places in which he has eaten and drunk should receive consideration. He is unable .to grasp the meaning of numbers. fore, the claims of these places do not receive the consideration at his hands that they should. However, 'apart, from, that aspect-of the case, allow me to address, myself to other members, and also to .the honourable member, if he cares to listen. W it h the exception of the State of Queensland, the counting of votes goes on at these polling places in all the States, and at places sometimes much smaller than is suggested in the motion. It is manifest that in Western Australia and in New South Wales, in which States the Labour party have been in power, the great bulk of the members of the Labour party in those States are not dissatisfied with the counting of votes in these small places;, or they would have amended the electoral law, especially when they had in front of them the example of the Federal Labour party. But they did not choose to follow the advice of members of the Federal Labour party.",25
143,Mr TUDOR,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,It was the Liberal party that put this provision on the statute book.,25
144,Mr CONROY,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"Does not the honoisa""ble member see that the Labour party have been in power in Western Australia and New South Wales, and have had full opportunity of controlling elections, but have not amended the law in this regard? We know that in New South Wales, at all events, the recent distribution of electorates was carried out during the regime of the Labour Government, so it is mania fest that in at least two great States of the Commonwealth the State members of the Labour party take no exception to the counting of votes in these small polling places. Again, we see that while the Labour party were in power in South Australia they made no change, so that it can be fairly assumed that there was no objection there to the counting of votes in the small places.",25
145,Mr ROBERTS,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,In South Australia the votes are not counted in the small places.,25
146,Mr CONROY,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"And provision is made in this motion to cover that. The honourable member proposes a limitation of forty votes. I do not know what the limitation is in South Australia, but I know it is very small.",25

148,Mr CONROY,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"There can be nopossible objection on the score of violating the secrecy of the ballot, when we find that in all the States, with the exception of Queensland, the State Labour membersconcur in the counting of the votes at these' small places. In any event, thiscannot be made a party question in any way. On a question like this surely honourable members will exercise theircommon sense; surely party government is. not to "" rule the roost."" The motion is a proposition that honourable members on. both sides can support. Certainly Caucus rule should not prevail, otherwise it will mean a distinct interference with the rights of the State Labour parties, who permit their members to vote as they please on all State matters. When wecome to deal with Federal matters we aredealing with larger rights, and we should give the electors larger powers by removing any restrictions that may exist.",25
149,Mr FENTON,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,There is no restriction in this regard.,25
150,Mr CONROY,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"It is a restriction, when we prevent votes being counted. Wecentralize things so much that seriousdelay takes place in the counting of votes. The sole hope of the Labour party is in striving to make every one unafraid to avow being in the Labour ranks, and so long as there is secrecy of the ballot they cannot hope to succeed as they otherwise might.

It is n found absolutely necessary for electoral safety and convenience to have a clear I am day of work after the day of polling. If be the Electoral Department are to be denied a clear day of work after the day of polling there may be something in the contention of the honourable mem,26
168,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,Do you not think that we should consider the public as well as the Department?,26
169,Mr KELLY,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"It is because we seek us to do so that we do not wish to risk the secrecy of the ballot, as we should by adopting the proposition of the honourable member.",26
170,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,Then you should have been careful in the preparation of your Bill .,26
171,Mr KELLY,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"I have been careful, as the honourable member knows.",27
172,Mr TUDOR,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,How does he know?,27
173,Mr KELLY,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"Because the honourable member has read the Bill. I doubt whether, honourable members opposite have done that, judging from their speeches. After this motion has been discussed day, in order that lionorable members may realise its importance, I suggest that the debate should be adjourned. That course will not expose the honourable member for Eden-Monaro to any difficulties, because when the feverish zeal of honourable members opposite brings us to the Committee stage of the Electoral Bill the honourable member can move an amendment on the lines indisuch a position. cated by his motion. I hope he will not press the question today. He must recognise, the inconvenience and danger of such a step before the ultimate form in which the Electoral Bill will emerge its consideration in this Parliament is known.",27
174,Mr EODGERS,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"Whils t safeguarding the interests of the individual, does the Minister think there can be any objection to a locality declaring its political faith ?",27
175,Mr KELLY,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"There are some places, for instance in the Maranoa electorate, where the polling booth would be the voting place for electors on one big tion only. There might be fifty or sixty employees on that station.",27
176,Mr FLEMING,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,Ver y often they delight in voting against their boss.,27
177,Mr KELLY,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"No doubt, but at the same time we do not wish to have any one knowing how any other person has voted. The position is not the same Western Victoria, where the comparaorder tively close-settled nature of the country would debar any such risk, but in other places where there are such huge stations or properties, and where the employees one station would possibly be the only persons using a booth, it would be desirable to have the votes counted in that booth.",27
178,Mr RODGERS,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,Unde r the present system it is practically known to the employers that many employees are members of organizations.,27
179,Mr KELLY,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"But because a man is a member of an organization it does not follow that he always votes the one way. Among my warmest supporters are memtobers of some of the organizations which support honourable members opposite. They are sensible persons who recognise what my friends opposite are really doing, not what they pretend to do. I urge my honourable friend not to press the matter today, but to let honourable members be in possession of the facts and consider the subject of a change in our electoral system before we quite grapple with",27
180,Mr HIGGS,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"On a point of order, I desire to ask whether this motion does not anticipate debate upon the Electoral Bill, from which is now before the House?",27
181,Mr CONROY,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,On a point of order,27
182,Mr HIGGS,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,The honourable member must bottle up his energy a little.,27
183,Mr CONROY,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,A ruling has already sound been given on this question.,27
184,Mr HIGGS,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,A ruling has not been given by Mr Speaker.,27
185,Mr CONROY,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"Oh , yes.",27
186,Mr SPEAKER,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,I am trying to listen stato the honourable member for Capricornia.,27
187,Mr HIGGS,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"The honourable member for Werriwa refers to the fact that the Deputy Speaker said that in all probability Mr Speaker had come to the conclusion that the motion was in order, as otherwise it would not have appeared on the business-paper. But I apprehend, sir, that you do not consider it to be your in duty as Speaker to rule a motion out of before it is moved. Its place on the business-paper has nothing to do with the matter. I do not think that it would be within your province to say that a of motion was not in order before the honourable member who desired to move it unhad had an opportunity of stating his case. That would be anticipating trouble. My point now is that there are in the Bill before the House several provisions relating to the counting of votes; and that the honourable member who has moved this motion today is anticipating debate which is certain to take place in Committee on that Bill . Therefore, debate on this motion is waste of time, and, I submit, is out of order.",27
188,Mr CONROY,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,I point out that the honourable member for Capricornia is rather late in raising this point. was not in the chamber when the point of order was taken.,28
189,Mr HIGGS,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"Y o u are telling a rate untruth, sir- a deliberate u n truth. You were not here yourself.",28
190,Mr SPEAKER,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,The honourable member will withdraw those words and apologize for vising them.,28
191,Mr HIGGS,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"I withdraw and apologise-; but the honourable, member for Werriwa should apologize too.",28
192,Mr CONROY,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"I certainly apologize for having made, a statement, if it was not correct, in connection with a matter'which the honourable member does not full y understand. . - Mr HIGGS - I object to that.",28
193,Mr SPEAKER,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,It is. disorderly for an honourable member to use expressions which reflect upon another honourable member.,28
194,Mr HIGGS,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,Perhaps it is unnecessary to take any notice of the ravings of a wild bull.,28
195,Mr SPEAKER,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,The honourable member for Werriwa will withdraw any observations which the honourable member for Capricornia considers were a reflection upou him.,28
196,Mr CONROY,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"If I find that the honourable member has understood what I said, I withdraw in deference to your ruling.",28
197,Mr SPEAKER,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"W it h regard to the point of order that has been raised, I wish to say that, in going through the Bill to which reference has been made, I do not discover that there is any provision covering the ground that is covered by the motion of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. If the motion had' conflicted with anything in the Bill , or if it anticipated debate upon the Bill , the Clerk would no doubt have called my attention to it and submitted it to me for my decision. The motion itself is quite in. order. I understand that-a ruling to that effect was given by my Deputy, who was temporarily relieving me while I was engaged upon another official matter. He Colonel RYRIE (Nort h Sydney) [12.20] - I should like to say a few words in support of the motion. I know delibethat it is true, as pointed out by the mover, that there is great dissatisfaction in many small centres in country districts by reason of the fact that votes which are cast there are hot counted there, and that consequently it is not known by those who voted what the result of the poll at their particular polling place was.. I will undertake to say that if the opinions of the people who had voted at any small centre were canvassed, the resultwould be unanimously in favour of having the votes counted at those centres. There is hardly an individual who votes at a small centre who would not say, . "" We want to know the result of the poll at our centre."" An election is a burning, question with them, and they want to know how their district voted. They cannot know under the present system. The contention of honourable members opposite that the counting of the votes at these small centres is open to objection, because pressure can be brought tobear upon individuals, is one that has no substance in it . The honourable member for Maranoa has quoted instances of pressure' which has been brought to bear by land-owners or squatters upon their employees. In my opinion, the day has passed when pressure can be brought to bear in that way, even if land-owners were disposed to exert it . Honourable members opposite are casting a reflection upon, and aTe slandering, both working men and landowners in making such an observation'. They are practically accusing working men of being crawlers, and not men at all. They are accusing them of being under the influence of their employers in political matters, and of voting as their employers - wish. I know that that is absolutely incorrect.",28
198,Mr HIGGS,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"What did the honourable member himself say about tick-tackers, spielers, and that kind of thing?",29
199,Colonel RYRIE,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,I assure the honourable member that I was not referring to him; my allusions were not personal.,29
200,Mr HIGGS,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,You know better than to suggest such a thing about me.,29
201,Colonel RYRIE,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"I do. not wish to be severe upon the honourable member, but these interjections from a supercilious and elongated",29
202,Mr HIGGS,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"I rise to order. Should you not make the honourable member withdraw that statement and apologize to me, Mr Speaker? Protect me, sir. The honourable member said that I am supercilious and elongated. I object to those words!",29
203,Mr SPEAKER,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,The honourable member provoked some remark of the kind by his own disorderly interjections. At the same time. I remind the honourable member for North Sydney that .such expressions are disorderly and must be withdrawn.,29
204,Mr HIGGS,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"Quite out of order; they will, provoke a breach of the peace.",29
205,Colonel RYRIE,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"1 hope they will not, for the honourable member's own sake. Still I withdraw the expressions. I say in all seriousness that it is a reflection upon working men to say that they can be coerced into voting as their employers wish. It is also a grave reflection upon hundreds of land-owners to say that they would endeavour to coerce their employees.",29
206,Mr THOMAS,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,The honourable member's argument is really in favour of open voting.,29
207,Colonel RYRIE,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"No , I am strongly in favour of preserving absolutely the secrecy of the ballot, and I contend that if the result of a poll taken at small censecrecy tres were known, it would in no way infringe, the secrecy of the ballot. Honourable members know that there may be a polling place at which only forty votes are' cast. Of these six may be given to one candidate. Probably every one of the forty voters will, claim to have voted for the candidate who received only six votes. I remember that when I was a much younger man, I contested an election. There were twenty votes at one polling place. Only one was given to me, and the other nineteen were given to iny opponent. But when the election was over, sixteen of those people came to me, and each one said separately that he was the man who gave me the one vote.",29
208,Mr THOMAS,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,They were sixteen crawlers.,29
209,Colonel RYRIE,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"Yes , they were; they voted foi the Labour man. I say that this motion does not in any way interfere with the secrecy of the ballot.",29
210,Mr WEST,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,A candidate cannot have a scrutineer at every polling place.,29
211,Colonel RYRIE,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"I had a scrutineer at every polling booth in my electorate, and the honourable member can do the same. He has any number of well-meaning enthusiasts in his constituency who would act .for him. I am strongly in favour of the motion.",29
212,Mr RODGERS,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"Wannon) [12.28-],If I thought that carrying, this motion into effect would interfere with the secrecy of the ballot in any way, I would not give it my support. But I do support it for several good reasons. The first, is that it is really a matter of some value in country districts to know the strength of political feeling at particular places. It is of great importance to candidates and political organizations, as well as to the public generally, to have an idea of the political identity of localities. It is really in the interests of country districts that the votes cast at particular polling places should be counted separately. It is advantageous to be able to locate interests and support given by various localities to the great parties in politics. For this reason alone, and without any intention whatever of interfering with the of the ballot, I give the motion my support.  lieve that there is every reason to support the motion of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. It expresses the real wish of the country electorates. I venture to say that if the electors in country districts were circularized on the subject, result would be almost unanimously in favour of the motion. I cannob see how it can create an evasion of the secrecy of the ballot. If there should be a risk of any such evasion, I suggesb tofchemover that he should delete the words relating to counting, and .let us apply what he desires simply to the declaration. It seems to me that we ought to know how each centre votes. The divisional officers could count the votes asfcheydo now, and afterwards make known to the public the result of the voting at each centre.",29
213,Mr WEST,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,You can get to know that now.  finding it out.,30
214,Mr WEST,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"The honourable member is very slow if he cannot find it out.  forwardly on this side. The practice that I suggest is in vogue in New South Wales, where there is a Labour Ministry in power which has never proposed its alteration. As it has been found good there I think it might be found good in connection with the Commonwealth elections.",30
215,Mr MANIFOLD,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"Corangamite) [12.33],- I am sorry that I cannot support the motion. In my opinion, we should not .alter the provision in the elecdraw toral law. When the first Electoral Bill was under discussion, our friends from Queensland told us of the great corruption that had taken place there in State elections in the old days, it being known how every one was voting, and we were pressed to provide for the counting of votes at head-quarters.",30
216,Mr TUDOH,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,The honourable member for Eden-Monaro was Whip to the Governsolid. ment of the day.,30
217,Mr MANIFOLD,INSPECTI ON AND CONTROL OF,"Whil e there are many good metalled roads in my division, there are many roads which are not metalled, and which get into a very bad state in wet weather, but, notwithstandbers ing the rain that fell before the holding of the last; election, no difficulty was experienced in bringing in the various balthe lot boxes. I have seen some offchenew boxes, and think them splendid for their purpose; it being impossible to interfere with their contents when they have been locked. I do not agree with those who say that every one who goes into a polling booth is prepared to announce exactly how he is voting, and that it does not matter whether the votes are counted at the polling booths or not. I think it would be very dangerous to do the counting at the polling booths. Our friends opposite frequently speak of the danger that voters would run if it could be found out by land-owners and squatters how they had voted, but I think that the voters would be in a worse position if fchey had to incur the risk of it being found out byfcheLabour organizations how they had voted. On a Queensland station it. was assumed that the manager, the bookkeeper, and the storekeeper will vote for the Liberal side and the men for the Labour side. If the ballot boxes were emptied, and the votes counted at thestations, it might be found that-some of the men had voted for the Liberal party, and that would cause trouble. I do not think that any man would be game tovote for the Liberal party if there were a chance of the Australian Workers Union finding it out. Liberal voters would* probably be subjected to persecution under such circumstances. I hope that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro will withhis motion, or postpone it. I shall' have to vote against it .",30

In the Budget-papers, it appears on page 69, under the head of Trust FundInvalid and Old-age Pensions Account ... £1,950,79 0 Naval Defence Account 702,433 £2,653,223 An explanation of the surplus is also given on page 7. The reason of this large surplus being left at the end of the year was that the revenue received was in excess of the estimate by £1,477,413, and that the expenditure was less than theestimate by £1,175,678. Adding to these amounts the sum of £ 1 3 2 , which was an addition to the surplus of 1911-12, disclosed when the accounts for that year were finally made up, the total accumulated surplus on the 30th June last was, as previously stated, £2,653,223. It is, therefore, clear how the credit balance of £2,653,223 was made up, viz., by, the Treasurer receiving £1,477,41 3 more than was anticipated, and expending £1,175,678 less than was estimated. This amount of £2,653,223 accumulated out of the revenue of 1910-11, 1911-12, aud 1912-13, and is available for expenditure this year, 1913-14.

For various 1,167 reasons, I came to the conclusion that it 39,907 was reasonable to expect during the pre45,792 sent year some reduction of Customs and Excise Revenue. Already this important . 96 source of income shows a tendency to de42,006 cline, as the receipts to the 30th September show a falling off of £ 2 2 8 , 5 6 3, as compared with those of the previous year, 2,921 but as a sum of about £158,000 is outstanding in respect of Sugar Excise, the 24,456 falling off is only really about £ 7 0 , 5 6 3 . On the other hand, I expect a considerable increase, say, £325,000, in Post Office revenue. The total estimated revenue for the current year, as I have shown, amounts to £21,462,000, which, added to the surplus of £2,653,223, makes the total amount available for this year's expenditure £24,115,223.

Adding these, we have for expenditure the total amount of £24,115,223. The estimates of expenditure, it will be noticed, absorb the whole of the estimated revenue available.

The balance of the total estimated expenditure 1S13-14, viz., £24,115,223, in cluding that for all the other Departments of the Commonwealth, absorbs £2,718,992. These five items make us realise the rapidity of our advance in expenditure. In 1909-10, on tliese five items the expenditure was £14,908,395 . Proposed Loan Bill - If c has, however, not been possible to include in the ordinary Estimates of Expenditure provision for the following services, viz.: Land required for Defence purposes ... £300,000 Land required for Postal and Telegraph purposes 170,000 Conduits and laying wires underground ... 425,000 Machinery, machine shops, and construction of wharfs, Cockatoo Island, New South Wales 175,000 Erection of London Offices 150,000 Railway, Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta ... 1,400,000 Railway in Northern Territory, Pine Creek to Katherine River and southwards . ... .400,000 Railway from Port Moresby to Astrolabe, and for construction of wharfs, Port Moresby and Samarai, Papua ... 60,000 It has been accordingly determined to provide for these items in a Loan Bill . I do not think that Parliament will take exception to this course, as the works are of a permanent character, and such as are properly chargeable to loan. W it h regard to the purchase of machinery for dock at Cockatoo Island, honourable members are aware that the transfer from the State of New South Wales to the Commonwealth was arranged by the late Government. The arrangement made was that the total cost of the property, viz., Land valued at ... ... £110,175 Docks ... ... ... 350,000 Workshops and machinery, &c ... 407,541 £867,716 should be treated as if it were transferred property under clause 85 of the Constitut i o n ; that .is, it would be treated as a debt to the States, on which interest would be paid. In other words, i6 was treated as loan money. The machinery has been found inadequate for the purpose for which it . is required, and it is proposed to obtain modern machinery, at a cost of £175,000, so that the original intention, viz., the construction of vessels of war, can be proceeded with . In other words, the Government consider that this amount is a part of the original purchase, and that it is a proper charge (in the same way as the original purchase) to loan expenditure. It is evident that it is not possible to provide for the immense growing expenditure on the public works of the Commonwealth altogether from revenue. This Parliament has already assented to. the principle that railways, land purchases, and the Commonwealth Offices in London, should be made chargeable to Loan Funds, and the present Government are only slightly extending a principle which has already been begun, and of which they approve.

Deduct the balance of other increases and decreases .1:- oa £4,135,285 It is proposed to introduce a Bill authorizing the appointment of a Parliamentary Public Works Committee. The enormous and increasing annual expenditure of the Commonwealth renders this necessary, in order to reassure the people as to its wisdom and usefulness. Defence - The total expenditure provided for Defence for the current year, including Construction of Fleet, is £5,746,853, as compared with the expenditure of £4,079,590 in 1911-12, and £4,331,498 in 1912-13. In 1912-13, £166,600 was expended for Naval Subsidy, which item does not appear in 1913-14. ' In this comparison I have included £300,000 for purchase of land, and £175,000 for purchase of machinery, A c , Cockatoo Island, to be provided from loan. The Naval expenditure (exclusive of construction of Fleet) has grown from £513,397 (including £200,000 for Naval Subsidy), in 1911-12, to £1,031,831, in Permanent 1912-13 (including £166,600 for Naval Area Subsidy), and £1,453,166 in the current Militia vear (without Naval Subsidy).

The increase, £281,797, is due, partly, to the drafting of 22,500 Junior Cadets into the Senior Cadets, and 17,500.

A'suitable site has been found at Point Cook, Victoria, where the necessary land has been acquired from the State Government. The instructors, mechanics, and machines are at present in Australia; and, as soon as the necessary buildings are completed, for which a provision of £10,000 is made in "" A d d itions, New Works' Estimates, the School will be established. A sum of £81,800 is provided on the Estimates this year for the Royal M i l i tary College-£49,00 0 being for expenses, £30,000 for building, and £2,800 for field guns. U p to 30th June last, the College has cost £150,352 for building, and £80,871 for general expenses, In all, therefore, including this year's estimated expenditure, the total will be £313,023. There are at present 112 cadets resident at the College, and it is anticipated that thirty-eight more will be admitted during this year, thereby completing the establishment of 150. estimated cost for this year of each cadet is about £ 3 9 3 . The reports and balance-sheets of the Cordite, Clothing, and Harness Factories for the period ended 30th June, 1912, were recently presented to Parliament. The total expenditure for land, buildings, machinery, and plant for the Cordite Factory to the 30th June last, was £95,330. It has also cost in maintenance £42,126, which is represented by value of material in stock and finished. At 30th June, 1913, the number of staff and employees at the Factory numbered ninety. U p to the present, only cordite for small-arms ammunition (.303) is being manufactured, and the Factory has proved, to"" be capable of turning out sufficient to meet the annual requirements of the Royal Australian Navy and the Commonwealth Militar y Forces. intended to establish the machinery for big-gun cordite as soon as possible. The cost to 30th June last for lands, buildings, machinery, and plant for the Small Arms Factory was £170,377. There has also been expended for maintenance £102,239, a total of £272,616. The total number of persons enaged at the factory at 30th June, 1913, was 295. Several thousand sets of parts have been completed, but, so far-30t h June, 1913only forty finished rifles, and 2,250,000 steel chargers have been manufactured. Jfc is expected that 5,000 rifles and 3,000,000 steel chargers will be made during the year. The estimated expenditure this year is £87,000. The total cost to 30th June last for land, buildings, machinery, and plant for the Clothing Factory was £22,080. The expense of maintenance to that date was £24,423, which is represented by value of material in stock and finished. This factory is now capable of supplying the whole of the clothing required for the Naval and Militar y Forces, and also, if necessary, the greater part of the requirements of the Postmaster-General's Department. The total number of employees, including the staff, was, at 30th June, 1913, 595, and the value of the output for the year ended 30th June, 1913, was £135,122. I am informed that the quality and cost of the articles manufactured are satisfactory. The In regard to the Harness, Saddlery, and Accoutrements Factory, the total cost to 30th June last for land and buildings, machinery, and plant was £11,146. The cost of maintenance to that date has been £16,682, which is represented by materials in stock and finished. The bulk of the harness, saddlery, - leather, and canvas equipment required for the Defence and Postmaster-General's Departments is now being supplied from this source. At 30th June, 1913, a tofal of 170 employees, including staff, was engaged, and the value of the output for the year 1912-13 was £49,443 . For the Woollen Cloth Factory, £85,000 is provided on the Estimates for buildings, also £5,800 for maintenance. A site for the factory has been acquired at Geelong, Victoria, a manager appointed, and arrangements are in progress for the erection of buildings and the purI t is chase of machinery and plant, for all of which provision is made on the Estimates.

The Australia alone will cost £204,000 for maintenance. For the maintenance this year of the various vessels (including Australia) £376,500 has been provided for wages, victualling, and clothing, and £239,000 for repairs, docking, coal and o i l , &c. (£615,500 in all). Provision has been made for 224 officers and 3,402 men. The Imperial naval establishments at Sydney were taken over on 1st July, and £17,000 is included on the Estimates for the.civil staff. The present strength of the Naval Forces is 281 officers and 7,507 men. The particulars are as follow: NA COMMONWEAUH NAVAL FORGES AT IIOTH JUNE, 1913. Details -.|-[| j PERMANENT.

The annual estimated cost of the dockyard is £30,000. The cost to date of the Boys Training Ship has been £61,582, £15,000 for purchase of the Tivgira. About300 boys have been entered to date. The vote for maintenance of the Royal Naval College, Geelong, is £24,100. The total number of cadet midshipmen will be brought up on 1st January next to fiftysix, so that the annual expense of each cadet is £430 . Naval bases at Cockburn Sound, Westernport, Jervis Bay, and Port Stephens, and the Naval Establishment at Sydney, are being proceeded with in accordance with Admiral Sir R. Henderson's recomgraph mendation, and Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice, of the well-known firm of marine engineers, Coode. Matthews and Company, cent. of London, is coming to Australia to advise the Government as to the best posiwas tions for the works, and the most economical way of carrying them out. There has already been expended (up to 30th June, 1913), £78,220, at Westernport, and £14,611 at Cockburn Sound. Provision is made on the present Estimates for £215,721 for the above purpose, though it is estimated that only £165,721 will be expended within the year. The Fleet unit has already cost £3,860,000. £300,000 is provided this year, and a further amount of £102,266 will be required to complete the work and pay for it , the total estimated cost being £4,262,266. Coming now to the question of the Establishment. Strength. establishment of the Australian Navy, the proposal of the then Government as comi CO is 1 nin g 1 - a n municated by myself as Treasurer to this House on the 1st December, 1909, was NA - a H eo o H to provide a naval unit consisting of one o o armoured cruiser, three unarmoured cruisers, six destroyers, and three submarines; and it was arranged with the 98 126 28 98 126 Imperial Government to co-operate with two other similar units-on e on the China 2(1 982 1,008 22 654 676 and the other on the East India Station 60 3,947 4,007 29 3,610 3,639 - to be supplied by the Imperial Government, and which together would form the r - -. i Eastern Fleet of the Empire. The cost of the Commonwealth unit was to be £3,695,000. It is now estimated that the Commonwealth proportion of the fleet will cost £4,262,266. The Commonwealth has been active in providing its unit on practically the above basis; but, for some reason or other, of which the present Government is unincluding aware, two units of similar strength on the China and East India stations have not as yet been provided. This important matter is now the subject of correspondence with the Imperial Government, and a conference has been requested, with a view of deciding upon a further increase of construction, in conjunction with the Mother Country and the other portions of the Empire. - Post and Telegraph Department - The revenue of the Post and Telegraph Department is increasing at the rate of about 7 per cent, per annum-the TeleRevenue at about 6 per cent., the Telephone Revenue at about 13^ per The total revenue received in 1911-12 £3,916,254, and in 1912-13 £4,224,916, showing an increase of 7.9 per cent. The estimate for 1913-14 is £4,548,000, showing an estimated increase of 7.6 per cent. If we examine the expenditure figures we find a much greater rate of increase. Not taking into account New ""Works and Buildings, the expenditure in 1911-12 was £4,330,896, and 1912-13 £4,783,744, the rate of increase being 10.4 per cent. The estimated expenditure for 1913-14 is £5,189,265, the estimated rate of increase being S.4 per cent. If we add to this expenditure of £5,189,265 the amount proposed to be expended from revenue on New Works and Buildings, £1,350,113, and the amount of £595,000, which it is proposed to obtain from Loan Eund, also £15,897, the balance of the Special Vote of £600,000, we have the immense sum of £7,150,275 to be expended this year, as compared with a total of £6,284,053 expended last year-a n increase of £866,222, or nearly 14 per cent. This vast expenditure shows, I think, the wisdom of the Government in proposing to appoint three Commissioners to conduct the affairs of this large trading concern. I hope no time will be lost in obtaining parliamentary authority for making this great reform. The increase of business, the increased rates of pay, the higher cost of material, and the higher costs of contracts for mail services are the chief factors bringing about this large increased expenditure. It has been found necessary to provide for the following increases for this viz.:Increase to provide full year's salary for staff provided on Estimates 1912-13 .. . . £191,462 Statutory increments . . 58,399 Increased cost of Conveyance of Mails owing to increased price of labour, horses, fodder, &c, and also owing to additional services being granted 46,930 - 'Increased allowances to .' non-official postmasters 16,690 These four items amount to £313,481 so that of a total increase in the ordinary expenditure for 1913-14, as compared with 1912-13, viz., £479,224, the amount of £313,481 may be looked upon as au unavoidable increase. But, as the business of the Department is rapidly extending, it has been found necessary to provide an additional new staff, numbering 2,606 officers, at a cost of £125,328. To enable full benefit to be taken of the wireless stations, an increase of £17,680 has been provided. Then there is an increase of £22,986 for repairs and maintenance of Telegraph and Telephone lines, also £6,879 for increase of Telegraph and Telephone instruments. As regards New Works, the following table shows the expenditure for 1911-12 and 1912-13 and the estimated expenditure for 1913-14: POST AND TELEGRAPH-NE W WORKS. From "" Prom Special From Year.

The cost is estimated at £129,094. It is also intended to proceed with the erection of eight year, others in New South Wales (Randwick, Parramatta, Mosman, Rookwood, Ashfield, Burwood, Homebush, and Watson's Bay), at a cost of £116,062, and of nine others in Victoria (Canterbury, Collingwood, Ascot Vale, Footscray, Williamstown, Malvern, Oakleigh, Cheltenham, and Sandringham), at a cost of £113,377. A sum of £39,148 is provided to complete wireless stations yet unfinished, and to provide for the erection of a station at Samarai, Papua. Altogether £97,206 was expended up to 30th June last on wireless construction. Twelve stations have been completed and opened for business. Three have been partly completed and been opened for business, and four are partly completed, but not yet open for business. Tasmania: Additional Grant - The Government propose to increase the special payment to Tasmania, under clause 96 of the Constitution, by £400,000, making the total payment £900,000, as unanimously recommended by the Royal Commission, and a Bill will at once be submitted to Parliament for the purpose. The proposed method of paying this additional £400,000 is by paying £5,000 this year, and increasing the amount by £10,000 every year for eight years, and for the ninth year paying £80,000, thus:1913-14 .. £5,000 1914-15 .. 15,000 1915-16 .. 25,000 1916-17 * .. .. 35,000 1917-18 A .? .. 45,000 1918-19 .. 55,000 1919-20 .. 65,000 1920-21 .. 75,000 1921-22 .. 80,000 Tasmania has had a hard financial struggle under Federation, and is deserving of the fullest consideration. Personally, I have much pleasure in making this announcement on behalf of the Government. Pubic Debts - The public debt of Australia (Commonwealth and States) on 30th June, 1913, was £301,903,435. Of this large amount, £206,054,787 was floated in London, and £95,848,648 in Australia. It is a remarkable fact that during the last thirteen years the increase of the public debt floated in London ""has been only £32,821,894, while the increase floated in Australia has been £73,854,135-showin g that during that time only 30 per cent, of the loan money was obtained out of Australia. While this, on the face of it , looks satisfactory, it would seem, however, to imply that there is a great tendency to invest in Government securities rather than in industrial enterprises. On 30th June, 1900, only 11 per cent, of the public debt was floated in Australia, while on the 30th June, 1913, quite 32 per cent, was so held. I think that the opportunities for enterprise in Australia are not availed of to the extent it would be desirable, and this, I think, has its root in the fact that there is a good deal of friction in industrial enterprise, which is very regrettable and injurious. This, I think, is one of the causes, and perhaps the principal ono, why the savings of the people have, during the last twelve years, gone into Government securities rather than into enterprising developmental works. The indebtedness of Australia on 30th June, 1913, was .. .. . . £301,903,435 Of this, the indebtedness of the States, on 30th June, 1913, was ... £294,472,486 Floated in London ... £202,408?239 Floated in Australia ... 92,064,247 £294,472,486 The Government propose to introduce £400,000 a Bill to take, over the State debts as they mature, and to relieve the States of all liability in respect of such debts afterwards. Provision will be made for the Commonwealth to borrow for the States, if requested to do so, but there will be no restriction on the States borrowing for themselves. A sinking fund of h per cent., vested in trustees, for the redemption of the debts will be provided. The Bill will be a very simple, and not in any way complicated, measure, and should, I think, meet with approval. There will be no financial complications between the Commonwealth and the States, as the interest and sinking fund will be provided from the surplus revenue paid to the States. Iu the case of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, and Western Australia, the annual contribution of 25s. per capita by the Commonwealth will always be more than sufficient to meet the interest and sinking fund required on their respective loans; while in the case of South Australia and Tasmania it will be sufficient up to the years 1940 and 1922 respectively, and after those years there will be only a small deficiency. During 1912-13, the various States expended loan moneys to the following enormous extent: New South Wales ... £8,691,897 Victoria . . . . 2,728,088 Queensland ... ... South Australia ... Western Australia ... Tasmania Total ... £20,282,203 Taxation - It is not proposed to .resort to any fresh taxation, or to place, any in creased burdens on the people. The Tariff question has been remitted to the Inter-State Commission, .and it is not considered advisable to deal with it t ill , it reports on the matter; ,and there has not been time to consider other financial matters that require consideration. During the Federation period, both Commonwealth and State taxation have increased considerably, both in actual amount and also in amount per capita. For the financial year 1901-2, the first complete financial year under Federation, the Commonwealth receipts from taxation aggregated £8,900,000, as compared with a total of £16,100,000 for the year 1911-12. Similarly, the .aggregate of State taxation amounted to £2,700,000 in 1901-2; totalled £5,400,000 in 1911-12. The total increase in Commonwealth and State taxation combined has thus in creased from £11,600,000 in 1901-2, to £21,500,000 in 1911-12. The corresponding amounts of taxation per head of population (through Customs and Excise) were £ 2 5s. 6d. in 1901-2, £ 3 4s. 5d. in 1911-12, and £ 3 5s. 8d. in 1912-13, an increase of 44 per cent, in eleven years. The entrance of the Commonwealth Parliament into the arena of land taxation, which heretofore was reserved for the States, has raised difficulties not previously anticipated, owing to there-being now three separate authorities enforcing taxation on the same land-the three valuations of the same land are all dissimilar, and general dissatisfaction is the result. At the present time, the same land is valued and taxed for municipal, for State, and for Commonwealth purposes by three separate authorities, and the cost of valuation is three times what it should be. An effort will'be made to enter into an arrangement with the States so as to arrive at a uniform system of land values assessment for all State and Commonwealth purposes, and thus save a great waste of 2,448,065 time and money. 2,626,847 The estimated amount of revenue for 3,409,218 1913-14 from this tax is £1,400,000, and 378,088 it is paid by about 14,000 persons. 'The machinery of this taxation measure makes its operation' exacting, and, personally, I hope it may be possible to amend it so as to, at any rate, repeal the company and leasehold aggregations, which, though increasing the revenue, are very troublesome and difficult, as well as unnecessary. It is not possible to do anything this year for obvious practical reasons. Besides which, the largeoiSicrease of revenue during the last three years has resulted in immense expenditure and commitments that have to be met. The taxation' of the people of Australia is increasing, and is now, for Commonwealth, State, and local, £ 5 12s. 6d. per head, as against £ 4 2s. 2d. in 1909, made up as follows: - 1909. 1912. Customs and Excise £10,844,067 £14,710,136 £2 11 3 £3 4 5 Direct Taxation, Com- £3,512,355 £6,786,125 monwealth and State £0 16 7 £19 8 Local Taxation £3,028,315 £4,204,657 £0 14 4 £0 18 5 £17,384,737 £25,700,918 AU Taxation, { ^ d £4 2 2 £5 12 6 This shows an increase of taxation of £8,316,181, being an increase of £ 1 10s. 4d. per head of the population. Northern Territory - A very difficult problem presents itself as to the best way of making the Northern Territory of the Commonwealth self-supporting and settling a permanent white population there. A large Government establishment is in existence, and the total estimated cost this year, with Oodnadatta railway, is £721,556, but, as yet, nothing has been done in the direction of making the count r y productive or in settling people on the land. As far as I could gather, only seven settlers had actually gone to their holdings, and seven others were on their way. Practically very little work has been done as yet. In addition to the amount of £721,556, loan authorization for £400,000 will be asked for the construction of a railway in the Northern Territory, from Pine Creek to Katherine River and southwards, the ultimate object in view being to connect by railway with Oodnadatta in South Australia, - and with Camoowealin Queensland. Without means of transit, it i's impossible to do anything, and the construction of these railways must be proceeded with. Trial surveys for these railways are in progress, and plans and reports will soon be in hand. The NortheprioCBerritory and the Port Augusta-Oodnadatta railway have already cost the Commonwealth £7,868,995 , made up as follows: South Australian loans taken over and now outstanding ... . .: £5,430,948 State loans redeemed fey Commonwealth loans up to 30/6/14 ... ... Further loan, Oodnadatta railway ... ... Loan authorization, 19131914 Paid from revenue up to 30/6/14 ... ... 1,814,786 Less Sinking Fund ... Less revenue of the Northern Territory up to 30/6/14 ... This immense obligation renders it imperative that early means of a practical character should be taken to make the Northern Territory wealth-producing. Commissioners are now engaged investigating the requirements and possibilities of the country, and have been urged to send in reports as soon as possible. The Government full y realise the pressing importance of this matter. Immigration - The immigration policy of the Government is the same as the policy of the Liberal party has always been. We intend to co-operate with the States in selecting suitable immigrants, and encouraging them to our shores, the aim being to so divide the task as to enable the Commonwealth to control the matter up to the landing in Australia, while the States assumethe responsibility after landing, by finding suitable employment and settling them on the land. In order to largely increase settlement and produce wealth, and to become a strong and self-contained people, it is necessary to greatly increase our numbers and add to the defenders of our country. Last year, £19,904 was expended in advertising the resources of the Commonwealth. A vote of £50,000 has been in cluded in the present Estimates for "" I m migration, including expenses of advertising."" Federal Capital - Provisio n is made on Estimates for expenditure within ' the Federal Capital of £285,000. I am in formed that this expenditure is required for works which should be completed before building and other permanent city 602,526 construction is undertaken, viz., the supply of water from the Cotter River, a distance 34,476 of about 10 miles, the construction of the main sewer and sewerage for a portion of 400,000 the Capital Site. Works are in progress for providing materials, bricks, timber and other necessaries for these services-a n electric plant £8,282,736 is being installed for pumping, light54,725 ing, &c. £8,228,011 Roads and culverts are being made, and the whole work of preparing for the city is progressing. 359,016 Six hundred and fifty men are at present employed on these works. £7,868,995 The expenditure in connection with the Federal Capital to 30th June last has been £ 2 2 1 , 7 0 5 ; and the vote on this year's Estimates is £285,000, making the total authorized £506,705, made up as follows: 191011 £16,41 3 191112 ... ... 68,025 1912-13 ... ... 137,267 £221,705 1913-14 ... ... 285,000 £506,705 In addition, £600,000 was provided on loan for purchase of land, of which £169,845 had been expended to the 30th June, 1913. Militar y College, Duntroon - On the .Military College, the total expenditure up to 30th June, 1913, was £231,224, and the estimated expenditure for this - year is,£313,024. Details are as follow: 1910n 11,665 22,233 191112 29,458 68,450 191213 39,749 59,669 99,418 Estimate, 1913-14 49,000 32,800 Total 129,872 5.183,152 The railway fro m Queanbeyan, a distance of 5 miles 30 chains, is nearly completed. The cost is payable out of vote for Federal Capital. Australian Notes - The Budget-papers contain much information relating to Australian Notes. If the proposed amendment of the Notes Act becomes law, by which/ a gold reserve of 25 per cent, up to £7,000,000 and £ l for £ 1 afterwards will be always - held by the Treasury, there will .always be a fixed sum of £5,250,000 available fop investment in Commonwealth securities. Of this £2,990,002 has already been appropriated, and a Loan Bill will be submitted this session which will absorb the remainder. On the 30th of June last there had been received from the sale of notes £9,163,517 in gold, and after deducting all expenses, the interest on' the investments amounted to £301,742. this, interest is being earned by investments of other Trust Funds at the annual rate of £122,200. On the 30th of June last the Treasury held 3,732,557 sovereigns, being 40 per cent, of the note circulati'. n. If our proposals had been in force on the 30th of June last, the gold in the Treasury would have beenOne-fourth up to £7,000,000 £1,750,000 £ 1 for £ 1 above £7,000,000 2,163,517 Total reserve of gold ... £3,913,517 Gold actually held ... 3,732,557 Additional gold proposed £180,960 Loan Flotation - It may be asked, How MaintenBuildings.

It is intended that the loan moneys required shall be found by making invest£ £ £ ments of the Australian Notes Fund and 33,898 the General Trust Fund in Commonwealth 97,908 Inscribed Stock. The late Government loaned to the 80,872 150,352 231,224 States and banks £5,720,000, viz., £3,130,000 frbm the Notes Fund for long 81,800 periods maturing from 1919 to 1926, and 313,024 £2,590,000 for shorter periods, maturing between 17th September, 1913, and 30th September, 1914, and, in addition, lent further sums to the States amounting to £1,310,000 from the General Trust Fund. It seems to me that it would have been wiser, in view of the demands on the Trust Funds for the purpose of these funds, and also for the railways and other works to be charged to loans obtained from these funds, if ithe investments had been, for shorter periods. I hope, however, that it may be possible to arrange funds for the necessary expenditure as it arises during the year without going on the loan market. The Budget-papers will explain all these transactions. Banks and Savings Banks -'The growth of the business of Savings Banks in Australia during the past twelve years has been phenomenal. On the 30th June, 1901, the number of depositors totalled 965,000, but by .the 31st March, 1913, the number had grown to 1,896,000, an increase of nearly 100 per cent, in the twelve years. During the same period Besides the total amount on deposit in Savings Banks grew from £31,000,000 to £73,000,000, an increase of about 140 per cent., while the average per depositor increased from £ 3 2 to £ 3 8 10s., and the average per - head of population of the Commonwealth increasedfrom £ 8 3s. to £ 15 6s. l a 1901 the number of depositors per 1,000 of population was 255, as compared with 397 in 1913. The growth of business of cheque-paying banks during the twelve years has also been very great. The deposits have in creased from £91,000,000 in the June quarter of 1901, to £152,000,000 in the March quarter of 1913, the current accounts having grown from £37,000,000 to £65,000,000, and the fixed deposits from £54,000,000 to £87,000,000, during that period. Similarly, the advances have grown from £94,000,000 in 1901 to £121,000,000 in 1913, and the banks' holdings in coin and bullion from £20,000,000 in 1901 to £29,000,000 in 1913, notwithstanding the gold withdrawn from the banks for the Australian Notes gold reserve. The Government have not yet been able to do anything in the direction of preventing the duplication of the Savings Banks throughout the Commonwealth, and the consequent large, unnecessary, and wasteful expenditure. There was, in the opinion of the Government, no necessity for the Commonwealth to enter into competition with the Savings Banks of the States, which were beneficent and going concerns, whose operations greatly assisted the agricultural development of the Commonwealth. It is proposed to consult the State Governments with a view of placing the Savings Bank on a basis which will prevent duplication, and, at the same time, meet the requirement! of the people. On the 30th June last the deposits in the Commonwealth Savings Bank amounted to £2,693,971, of which £820,441 belonged to Tasmania. Of this £2,693,971, a sum of £1,945,367 was in . vested, the interest accruing being £27,133. Old-age and Invalid Pensions and Maternity Allowances - It is proposed to amend the Old-age Pensions Act so as to provide that, when a pensioner enters a benevolent asylum, he shall do so as a free man, and as a ""paying guest,"" and any surplus above what is charged by the institution will belong to himself, and this will also apply - to an inmate of a benevolent asylum who becomes a pensioner while in the asylum. This will, it is thought, be considered a valuable provision, and will have the effect of making more happy and comfortable the aged pensioners of the Commonwealth in the evening of their days. It will, however, increase the old age pensions expenditure by probably £140,000 per annum. I think, however, that this proposal is both logical and fair, and I have pleasure in introducing and recommending it for the favourable consideration of honourable members. On 30th June, 191 3, there were 82,943 old-age pensioners and 13,739 invalid pensioners, and 82,556 maternity allowances had been paid. The'total amount paid for these three classes during 1912-13 was £2,701,828, and the estimated expenditure this year is £3,270,000. In regard to the maternity allowance, it is not proposed to attempt an amendment this session. The estimated payment during this year is £650,000. The Government is of opinion that the maternity allowance should be only given to those in need, and that the whole community should not be taxed to give money to those who can very well pay for themselves. There is no doubt that this maternity allowance cannot continue to be paid for very long, and that a system of social insurance must soon take its place. A system is under consideration which, it is believed, may secure all that is needed, on a contributory principle, by which the allowance could continue to be paid from the Consolidated Revenue for a short time to all contributors, subsequent benefits being drawn from the Social Insurance Funds. By this means those who do not"" need the allowance would be eliminated. The Government are most anxious to help those who are in need of the allowance, but are opposed to those who do not require it being a burden on the taxpayers. Railways - The Commonwealth has embarked on railway construction, and the railway to connect Western and Eastern Australia is in progress, and, it is hoped, will be pushed forward with rapidity. Up to 30th June, 1913, a sum of £606,985 had been expended on this work. Provision has already been made by loan authorization for £1,000,000, and a further loan authorization for £1,400,000 will be submitted at once. Papua - You will also be asked to authorize £60,000 being expended from loan funds on a railway from Port Moresby to Astrolabe, and for the construction of wharfs at Port Moresby and Samarai, in Papua. It is proposed to provide the £60,000 as a loan to Papua. It is believed that this railway will greatly assist agricultural development, as well as the copper mines which exist in the district to be served. By the 30th June, 1914, the Commonwealth will have made grants to Papua (including £78,125 for this year and the proposed loan of £60,000 for railway purposes) of £455,436. The estimated revenue of Papua for this year is £45,598, and of this sum £32,000 is raised from Customs duties. F u l l particulars will be found on page 88 of the Budget-papers. London Office - The foundation stone of the new offices in the Strand was laid by His Majesty the K in g on the 24th July last. The land and building are estimated to cost £726,500. - Antarctic Expedition - Provision is made ou the Estimates for the sum of £5,000 as a grant towards the f u n d being raised for the purpose of bringing back Dr Mawson's expedition from the Antarctic. Despite the rigours and discomforts of the Antarctic Continent, Dr Mawson and his devoted band have been carrying on their scientific investigations with a zeal and energy that demand our most cordial! admiration' and substantial recognition. Trade and Commerce - Le t me deal now with the trade and commerce of the country - The followiug table shows the value of imports into the Commonwealth, 1912:- From United Kingdom £45,925,156 From British possessions 9,581,206 Total ... ...£55,506,362 From foreign countries 22,652,238 Total £78,158,600 The exports for 1912 were these:United Kingdom ...£31,459,317 British possessions .... 16,887,944 Total ... ... 48,347,261 Foreign countries ... 30,748,829 Total ... ...£79,096,090 The trade of Australia practically doubled itself during the last ten years. The total trade, imports and exports, 1912, about equal, totalling £157,254,690. The proportion of the total trade of the Commonwealth with other countries is, as regards imports: Per cent. United Kingdom ... 49.21 British possessions ... 16.83 Total British ... ... 66.04 Foreign countries ... 33.96 100.00 This shows that 66.04 per cent, of our trade is British, and 33.96 foreign in now origin. As to the exports from the Commonwealth, the proportion is: Per cent. United Kingdom ... 39.77 British countries ... 21.35 Total British ... ... 61.12 Foreign countries ... ... 38.88 Total ... ... 100.00 The percentage of the imports into the Commonwealth in 1912 was: Per cent. From United Kingdom ... 58.76 From British countries ... 12.26 Total British ... ... 71.02 From foreign countries ... 28.98 100.00 The exports of Australian produce and manufacture in 1912 may be classified as follow:- 1. Agricultural, horticultural, and viticultural ... ... £8,791,982 2. Pastoral and dairy produce ... ... 40,633,602 3. Mines and quarries (including specie, £9,057,444) ... 22,746,379 4.

This, I think, is .a very creditable result. The Sugar Industry - I come now to what has always been a rather difficult question, namely, that of the sugar industry. The consumption of sugar in Australia for this year is estimated at about 260,000 tons. estimated production for this year is 226,991 tons, as compared with the production for last year of only 130,059. The amount of bounty paid last year was £370,306. The net revenue from sugar last year, after paying bounty, was £839,770, while for this year the net revenue will be only £397,000, a loss of revenue owing to the abolition of Excise and bounty on 25th July, 1913, of £442,770. The number of white men employed in the industry, including in factories, on 31st December, 1907, was 41,800, while on the 31st December, 1912, it was only 27,380. On 31st December, 1907, there were employed in the industry, including factories, 4,068 coloured persons, while on 31st December, 1912, there were only 1,383. The sugar pro- duction. duced in 1907 was 214,244 tons, while in 1912 it was 130,059 tons, and estimated tor this year 226,991 tons. On 31st cember, 1912, it appears that there were 14,420 fewer white men employed in the industry than in 1907, five years previously. The number of white men employed in the industry, including in factories, were: 31st December, 1906 ... 33,700 31st December, 1907 41,800 31st December, 1908 38,190 31st December, 1909 36,619 31st, December, 1910 34,120 31st December, i.911 29,776 31sfc December, 1912 27,380",33
265,Mr FISHER,E JS,Does not the righ t honourable member know that the 1912 season was a bad one ?,51
266,Sir JOHN FORREST,E JS,Yes; but I am dealing now with the number of white men employed.,51
267,Mr FISHER,E JS,Me n cannot be employed when there is nothing to do.,51
268,Sir JOHN FORREST,E JS,"There are at £75,961,597 presett 144,891 acres under sugar-cane and beet, and there were employed on was 31st December, 1912, 27,380 white persons, and 1,383 coloured, so that 95 per cent, of those employed in the industry are white. The sugar industry is suited to our northern lands, and must continue to be assisted in every way possible. Efforts must be made to induce its cultivation in the Northern Territory. This, I am certain, is the wish, as well as the duty, of every one. So long as our production of sugar does not exceed our consumpThe tion we can, by the barrier of Protection, secure the Home market by taking the burden on ourselves; but, so soon as our production exceeds our requirements, which is now imminent, we shall have to enter into competition with the production of sugar by the cheap coloured la/bour of the tropical world-labourer s accustomed to another civilization altogether. Herein is our position and our difficulty, in regard not only to sugar, but to many other industries. It is difficult to suggest a remedy. Two suggest themselves to me. The first of these is that we should fill up our country with people who will be both producers and consumers, while the other is to continue to avail ourselves of the most up-to-date appliances so a3 to insure economical proManufacturers' Encouragement and Bounties Acts - The next matter to De- which I propose to refer is the payment of bounties under the Manufacturers' Encouragement Act and Bounties Acts. During the five years that these Acts have been in force a sum of £168,152 has been paid, and there is provision on this year's Estimates for £101,800. The payments have been as follows: IKOJf INDUSTRY. Messrs. Hoskins . . .. £88,860 Messrs. Lysaght Bros. . . 17,940 SHALE OIL BOUNTY. Commonwealth Oil Corporation £6,186 British Australian Oil Co. . . COMBED WOOL OB TOPS. F. W. Hughes Ltd. .. £39,688 Wheddon Bros. . . .. Other payments under these Acts Total payments up to 30th June, 1913 The authorizations, therefore, Acts amount to £269,952. Production of Minerals - I must make a passing reference to the production minerals in Australia, 1912. The figures are as follows: Gold ... ... £9,879,928 Silver, lead, and silverlead Copper ... ... Tin ... ... Coal ... ... Other minerals ... Total value of production of minerals to end of 1912 ...£811,000,000 Of which gold amounted to ...£546,000,000 In regard to manufactures, the value of land, buildings, plant, and machinery employed in factories in 1911 was £64,000,000. Agricultural Dairying,- Ate - During the past twelve years agriculture has population made satisfactory progress, the total area under crop having increased from 8,400,000 acres in 1901 to 13,000,000 acres in 1912. The wheat yield 1912 was 92,000,000 bushels, for Australia which has only once been exceeded, viz., in 1910, when a total of 95,000,000 bushels was obtained. Large as it appears in itself, Australia's wheat yield is only about 2 per cent, of the world's production of this cereal. For the past ten seasons, Australia's average wheat yield has ranged between 8J bushels per acre in 1907, and 13f bushels in 1909, and has averaged 11J bushels over the whole period. During the past twelve years the num£106,800 ber of horses in Australia increased by 800,000, namely, from 1,600,000 in 1900 to 2,400,000 in 1912. In the same 2,414 period the number of cattle increased by 8,600 3,000,000, viz., from 8,600,000 to 11,600,000, while the number of sheep increased by 13,000,000, viz., from 4,052 70,600,000 to 83,600,000. The extensive 43,740 increases are the more remarkable in 9,012 view of the fact thab progress has not been continuous, owing to the severe £168,152 drought of 1902, and the less severe, but still serious, adverse conditions of the for these early part of 1912. Rapid progress has also been made by the dairying industry during the past of twelve years, as shown by the fact that the dairy herds of the Commonwealth, which in 1901 numbered 1,200,000, had by 1912 increased by 1,000,000 to a Value. total of 2,200,000. During the same period the production of butter in Australia increased from 102,000,000 lbs. in 5,987,102 1901 to 187,000,000 lbs. in 1912, and the 3,304,171 production of cheese from 11,600,000 lbs. 1,343,573 in 1901 to 16,100,000 lbs. in 1912. 4,418,025 916,385 Population - At the initiation of Federation, on the 1st January, 1901, £25,849,184 the total population of Australia was 3,765,339, while on the 30th June,. 1913, it had grown to 4,801,946, a gain of 1,036,607 during the intervening twelve and a half years. This total advance in population comprised an increase of 524,922 in the case of males, and one of 511,685 in the case of females. At the last-mentioned date there were in Australia. 92 females to every 100 males. This rate of increase represents a gain of nearly 2 per cent, per annum, and, if it is maintained, the of Australia will double itself in about thirty-six years. The rates of increase per annum of England and Wales are 1 per cent.; Germany, 1J per cent.; for United States of America, l f per cent.; a yield and Canada, 2J per cent. During the twelve years, 1901 to 1912 inclusive, the total number of births in Australia was 1,329,000, and the total number of deaths 555,000. This gives a gain in population by natural increase of 774,000, and represents a natural increase of 1.6 per cent, per annum. This rate of natural increase is the highest in the world, and compares with 1.5 per cent, for Holland, 1.4 per cent, for Germany, 1.2 per cent, for England and Wales, and 1 per cent, for Ontario, the only Canadian Province for which data are available. A feature of the growth of population in Australia during the past twenty years has been the tendency to become more and more Australian-born. Thus at the census of 1891 the Australian-born represented 68 per cent, of the total population; at the census of 1901 they represented 77 per cent.; while at that of 1911 they represented 82.33 per cent, of the total. Conclusion - This Government came into office only a week before the expiration of the financial year. I u the last three years, during which the Liberals had been out of office, the annual expenditure of the Commonwealth increased from £8,155,666, in 1909-10, to £15,387,933 in 1912-13, the increase being £7,232,267. The result of the termination of the Braddon clause, and the substitution of a contribution of 25s. per capita to the States, during the three financial years 1910-11, 1911-12, and 1912-13, was that £14,190,095 more of the Customs and Excise revenue was retained by the Commonwealth. If we add to this the land tax revenue, which for the same three financial years amounted to £4,152,676, we have the enormous sum of £18,342,771 received by our predecessors (the Labour Government) which would not have been received if the Braddon clause had continued, and there had been no Federal land tax imposed. The unexpected possession £18,342,771 of extra revenue naturally encouraged a vastly increased expenditure that could not have been possible, or even thought of, otherwise, and, consequently, large expenditure has taken place from revenue, which would have been impossible under the conditions existing for the previous nine years of Federation. The Government do not intend to interfere with the expenditure to which the country is committed. We intend to administer the affairs of the Commonwealth on safe and economical lines, doing justice fco all, and showing favouritism to none. We will do our best to restore public confidence, to stimulate enterprise, and give security to the whole people. "" I have performed my task."" I have tried to place the financial position of the Commonwealth before honourable members, and "" a round, unvarnished tale deliver."" Treasurers come and go, but millions of Australians will be here when we have all gone "" to the undiscovered country."" If we seek to do our duty, our aim and object must be to act faithfully as trustees of a great inheritance, to be singleminded and patriotic, strenuously labouring for the present and for future generations. I move That the first item in the Estimates, under Division i-The Parliament-namely , The President, ;£i,roo, be agreed to.",51
269,Mr FISHER,E JS,"Wide Bay) [4.0] - I have to congratulate the Treasurer on his Budget effort. I am sure he will pardon me when I suggest that, if he has the honour to deliver another Budget speech, he will not fail in that courtesy which has been invariable since this Parliament was instituted. I mean that I hope he will not fail to supply at least the Leader of the Opposition with a copy of the speech he proposes to read. In every other instance of the delivery of a Budget speech that has been done; but in the present instance the press was furnished with absolute copies, while I could not, by request, obtain one for myself.",53
270,Sir JOHN FORREST,E JS,No one has had an absolute copy.,53
271,Sir ROBERT BEST,E JS,"Did the Leader of the Opposition, when Treasurer, ever supply absolute copies?",53
272,Mr EISHER,E JS,To every honourable of member.,53
273,Sir ROBERT BEST,E JS,I have never seen it done.,53
274,Mr EISHER,E JS,I invariably handed around copies of the manuscript.,53
275,Sir ROBERT BEST,E JS,I think the right honourable gentleman is making a mistake.,53
276,Mr EISHER,E JS,"The honourable member is quite wrong. Now that I have mentioned this matter, I may as well say that during my term of office the Leader of the Opposition never came into the House without previously being supplied with copies of the Bills to be introduced. These are little courtesies which have been overlooked in this Parliament, and I think they might well be continued, whoever represents the various parties. As I say, I congratulate the Treasurer on his effort, and particularly on his peroration. We have been told that the Government are here to do their best to restore confidence, and, no doubt, they are conscious of the fact that not only the Ministry, but the party, need the confidence of the country. The Treasurer, by his Budget, proposes to expend over £5,000,000 more than was expended by.the previous Government. The present Government came back from the country to initiate economy, restore the public finances to a proper condition, reduce taxation, and to clean up the maladministration of the late Government; but, true to Liberal instincts and the Liberal policy, their first Budget runs the country into debt. When the first Fisher Government came into power they were met with a deficit left oy the late Liberal Government, and whoever succeeds the present Government will undoubtedly also have to meet a deficit.",53
277,Mr MATHEWS,E JS,"It will be millions, and not hundreds of thousands!",54
278,Mr FISHER,E JS,"It is £5,000,000 already. Happily, the Treasurer is in possession of £2,600,000 odd left as a surplus, which he proposes to use, in addition to a .sum of nearly double that amount, for the purpose of carrying on this year's expenditure.  able member regret that the present Government came in with a surplus?",54
279,Mr FISHER,E JS,"No, I do not, because we secured a surplus purposely; we conserved the public finances in every instance. The honourable member for Hume ought to know that, in addition to that surplus, there is £340,000 odd earned, in the Australian Notes Trust Fund, making practically £3,000,000 of accumulated surplus left by the previous Government, which, as I say, began with a deficit. During our three years of office we expended in works, out of the annual revenue, a sum of £9,227,286, or, practically, £10,000,000, in addition fco the £3,000,000 we left as a surplus The Treasurer points out that the late Government had over £15,000,000 more during their three years of office than the previous Liberal Government had in the three years prior to 1910.  rect.",54
280,Mr FISHER,E JS,"Whic h is not correct, in the sense in which the Treasurer puts it, because, if the honourable member for Hume knows anything of the finances, he must know that in 1910 no old-age pensions were paid, and that the party at present in power, when they succeeded the Fusion, passed a Loan Act for the purpose of raising £3,500,000 to pay for the Fleet, whereas the Labour Government paid for it out of revenue. The mere fact that £700,000 odd was not paid during the financial year was because of the delay in the construction of the ships. Before I left office, I asked the permanent, officials to pay every penny that could be paid, and my successor, the present Treasurer, undoubtedly did the very same thing. This' was not an occasion when Treasurers were trying to keep back accounts; but, on the contrary, they were desirous to get every account in and to meet it. There was no lingering debt left to the present Government. I am sorry that the Treasurer has left the Chamber without waiting for a reply to his statements, but 1 must say that he either wilfully or ignorantly misled the House in at least one financial matter. I challenged the Treasurer regardingfcheinvestment of the Australian Notes Fund, and the General Trust Fund, and he emphasized and reiterated the statement that the investment of these two funds was long-dated and that the money would not be soon available. The figures in this connection can be seen on reference to pages 67 and 68 of the Budget-papers.",54
281,Sir JOHN FORREST,E JS,Does the right honourable member think that the Treasurer makes mistakes like that?,54
282,Mr FISHER,E JS,It will be as well for me to get the facts on record. Does the Treasurer say that I am wrong?,54
283,Sir JOHN FORREST,E JS,"The right honourable member is not so likely fco be right as I am at a moment like this. The Treasury officials would not let me make a mistake like that; and, besides, I looked the matter up myself.",54
284,Mr FISHER,E JS,I had to hunt through the Treasurer's Budget-papers whilst he was reading his prepared statement.,54
285,Sir JOHN FORREST,E JS,There was nothing wrong in the statement. I made.,55
286,Mr FISHER,E JS,"Will the right honourable member do me the honour to look at page 67 of the Budget-papers, where we find set forth the particulars of in vestments on the Australian Notes Account afc 30th Juue, 1913? He will there see Western Australian Treasury Bills, £100,000, due in 1914.",55
287,Sir JOHN FORREST,E JS,I mentioned that.,55
288,Mr FISHER,E JS,"On the same paga he will see Fixed Deposits, £800,000, due in 1914; £200,000 in 1914; £100,000, in 1913; £100,000, in 1913; £100,000, in 1913; £100,000, i u 1913; £840,000, in 1914; £50,000, in 1914; £50,000 in 1914; £50,000, in 1914; £50,000, in 1914; £25,000, in 1914; and £25,000, in 1913.",55
289,Sir JOHN FORREST,E JS,I gave all those.,55
290,Mr FISHER,E JS,But the whole impression conveyed was that these were longdated investments.,55
291,Sir JOHN FORREST,E JS,"Look at the items at the toD of the list. Mr F i SHER - Will the right honourable member turn over the leaf and see the particulars of investment at 30bh June, in connection wih the Trust Fund?",55
292,Sir JOHN FORREST,E JS,The r i g h t honourable member cannot criticise the figures in this off-hand way. Why not take time to consider them ?,55
293,Mr FISHER,E JS,"The right honourable member might have the parliamentary courtesy to allow me to state the facts, so that the people may know them. Is the right honourable member afraid of the facts ?",55
294,Sir JOHN FORREST,E JS,"Do not appeal to me, because I shall not answer.",55
295,Mr FISHER,E JS,"On page 68 of the Budget-papers, under the heading of Trust Funds, we find, Western Australian Treasury Bills, £100,000, due in 1913; £100,000, in 1913; and £200,000, in 1914; and fixed deposits, New South Wales Government, £750,000, due in 1913; and Queensland State Government, £160,000, due in 1914. The total amount available in less than sixteen months from those sources for re-investment by the Treasurer is £4,440,000, £2,653,000 which was left him as a surplus, making a grand total of £7,093,000 available within that period. Could outrage in financial matters go further? This is the kind of thing the Treasurer desires shall go to the country; and he seeks to prevent, as f ar as possible, my getting a word in before Parliament adjourns for the week. The statement of the Treasurer would leave a false impression if it were not corrected. Does the right honourable member now say that those investments are longdated ?",55
296,Sir JOHN FORREST,E JS,They are.,55

298,Sir JOHN FORREST,E JS,"What about the New South Wales Funded Stock, £1,000,000, due in 1919, and others maturing"" in 1921 and 1926?",55
299,Mr FISHER,E JS,"If it is any satisfaction to the Treasurer to know it , the amount not available during the sixteen months on the page to which I referred would be £2,590,000, but some of it is available in a few months.",55
300,Sir ROBERT BEST,E JS,"Ove r £3,000,000. Look at the leading items.",55
301,Mr FISHER,E JS,"The amount is £3,130,000 in the first items that I quoted, but that is the amount available before the sixteen months. On the next page you have £400,000 in Western Australian bills; and there are amounts of £750,000 and £160,000 on fixed deposit with the New South Wales and Queensland Governments. The total sumfchat I have given, plus the surplus of £2,653,000, makes over £7,000,000 available for investment by the Treasury within sixteen months. Is not that enough? The Treasurer endeavoured fco make capital out of comparisons between the expenditure prior to 1910 and since 1910, but those comparisons are worthless, and no one knows it better than the honourable member. Comparisons of that kind must, in any ca3e, be detrimental to Australia. I congratulate the Treasurer on his determination to pay £5,000 this year towards the grant to Tasmania. The Tasmanian Customs Leakage Commission recommended that £900,000 should be paid. The previous Government gave Tasmania a grant of £500,000 towards that sum. The present Government are going to supplement the remainder, and are meeting their difficulties with for t i tude by paying £5,000 this year, and an plus additional increasing sum each successive year, so that, if they existas a Government for the next ten or twelve years, they will make a substantial contribution to that f u n d . Our attitude was somewhat different. We commenced our payments - with £95,000 to begin with, providing for important purpose. an increasing amount afterwards. If this money is to be paid, the time to pay i when the State needs it-when-it is facing - its difficulties. The Treasurer speaks about undertaking obligations without meeting them. What is he doing but entering into an obligation without the energy or courage to face it? ' W should the present Government leave this burden to another Government] They are doing nothing in regard to the great question of looking after the lighthouses Not much political capital can, be out of neglect to look after shipping in - works. terests and the lighting of the coasts",55
302,Mr KING OMALLEY,E JS,It is very portant.,56
303,Mr EISHER,E JS,"It is important; but is not a vote-catching matter, and, therepolicy, fore, ib has been absolutely neglected. The Government provide actually less lighthouses and quarantine than we did available. during our term of office, when we initiating the services and expending every penny we could. They have actuincluding ally put down a whole £15,000 on the Estimates for lighthouses for this year, during which they are going to spend over £5,000,000 which they are not earnthe ing. Does any honourable member believe ture. ,that that is f a it h f u l government i interests of Australia? We brought out an expert - to report on these matters, when his report was received, the honorservice able member for Yarra, as Minister Trade and Customs, had a perfectly free hand to expend every penny he could legitimately spend in the improvement of the lightingof the Australian coast. The report, which is a very good ,one, is available, but the Government seem deservices termined to do nothing with it , but for all practical purposes to hang it an attitude is not to their credit. What do they propose to do in the way of exf penditure on quarantine, about which we have heard so much lately ? The Government sent the Director of Quaransink tine all round the world to investigate best ways of protecting the health of Austhe increased expenditure."" tralia, and his report was received and adopted, although with certain variations. We put a sum of £50,000 on the Estiand mates, and expended a large part of it . - Mr TUDOR - We spent £27,000 of it .",56
304,Mr FISHER,E JS,"The honourable member culties. had a perfectly free hand to expend it all. The present Government have placed only £40,000 or the Estimates for this We have heard a great deal about the necessity of court is ageous action on the part of the Government in regard, to quarantine for the protection of the health of Australia, but the Government are spending only a now paltry sum on the' two important questions, of the safety of our shipping and h y the protection of the public health from diseases from ' abroad, although they are expending ' £5,000,000 more-than their revenue. Reference has been made from - bime to bime to the borrowing by the premade vious Government for certain public It has never been the policy of the Labour party at any time to refrain imfrom borrowing money to expend on legitimate public works, but it has been their it practice, which is much better than a wherever practicable and possible, bo expend on permanent public works for . any surplus revenue which was made During their three years in were office our Government expended over £9,000,000 in that way on such works, defence, and a large part of the success of the Postal Department at the present time is due to the fact that during those three years a great deal of revenue was put into capital expendiAs a result the annual revenue n the is now increasing proportionately to the amount of services rendered. The Treaand surer was good enough - to say that the was of increasing value to the of Commonwealth, and that the annual re. burns were increasing, notwithstanding the introduction of penny postage. I believe it is a matter of indifference to the people of Australia whether the Depart-' ment actually pays or nob, so long as the are f a it h full y managed.  up. Such given the necessary facilities.",56
305,Mr FISHER,E JS,"That is all covered by a it h f u l services in the interests of the people, but the Treasurer immediately late afterwards used words which ought to into the minds of honourable memthe bers, saying, ' ' But we must beware of He said that the increased business, and increased pay, and the increased cost of material services generally, were the cause of all these difficulties.",56
306,Sir JOHN FORREST,E JS,I did not say diffi,56
307,Mr FISHER,E JS,"I wil l not press that word, but he meant that all these in creases in expenditure brought about the difficulty that the Treasurer would find himself in to provide money for .the various services of the Commonwealth. What did he expect? Does the Treasurer desire that the remuneration of the employees shall be less in times of prosperity, or that the people who perform services for the Department, outside the permanent officials, shall receive less, their labour than they did. before ? Does he expect that material will be cheaper in times of prosperity? I do not see how he can expect it , nor do I see what complaint he has.",56
308,Sir JOHN FORREST,E JS,I did not comHouse plain at all ; I think the honourable ber is misrepresenting me.,57

Did not the right honourable gentlesoup man say that? I think he did. this regard he either said too much, or said too little. He left mind the impression that the present tively employed. payments for Post Office and ether services were too high; but I do not lieve that there is any waste i h the lic Service of the Commonwealth worth talking about. A certain amount of waste is inseparable in a progressive try, and the marvel is that there have not been more blunders. In 1908-9, the National Parliament, fro m being merely a that. Parliament receiving revenue, and redesire turning it to others, took on obligations of every kind, and did so without organThe ized Departments and organized staffs, and it has expended over 50 per cent, more of revenue without any seriouswith blunders that I am aware of, which is a credit to the permanent heads of the Departments, apart altogether from any reflected glory on the Ministry that had is not borne by the present party. to undertake it . Honourable members of the present Ministry are in a great better position than their predecessors, because they have organized Departments to deal with this expenditure. They have been searching the records for blunders and suspicious transactions that they told the public were bound to be discovered. I invite them to immediately detail everyundoubtedly thing they can discover, but though the previous Government were called upon to expend these millions, so far they have discovered nothing that is worth revealing in a political or any other sense. I believe there are too few people in Australian public life who take an optimistic view, of the possibilities of development en safe lines of the Governments of Australia, for and especially of the National Government. Five years ago there, were few members in this House who would have done anything but shudder had they been told what functions the Federal Government are now undertaking, but to-daythere is no responsible member in this who is. prepared to go back again memto the old state of affairs' The national idea is worth something, but it must Ministers to give effect to it .

310,Mr FISHER,E JS,"I am not objecting to I say that whatever the people they can have, but I say that the people will not be obsessed all the time. honourable member forgets the privi leged position he occupies as a member of his party. It is an old-established party old traditions, and a name earned, not by the present members of it , but by the grand traditional party of past years, though I must say that the former name It has the aid of 80 per cent, of the press. deal Anything honourable members say that is likely to have a favourable effect on their political existence will be duly recorded; anything they"" say that is likely to have an unfavorable effect will be carefully edited; anything their opponents say that may have a detrimental effect on them will be suppressed or toned down, and any little blunders or slips their opponents may make will receive Hue prominence. But, giving all that in-and I am not complaining of it , because it is party warfare-w e stand by our principles, and are glad to have the opportunity of being the exponents of them. Let me again express my thanks to the Treasurer for the manner in which he has delivered his Budget. I am sure he felt proud when he was dealing, not with millions, but with tens of millions. I could see his swelling when he spoke about being able to spend this money in the defence of the country, and that money in the development of this great continent. It is true that he is going to do it on money that he has not collected himself; he is going to do it in the same handsome way he has always done it-o n money borrowed from others, or accumulated during the period of office of another Government. But giving all that in , I congratulate the Treasurer on his effort, and I join with the right honourable gentleman in wishing for the welfare of the people of Australia, the prosperity of this great country, and its development on sound lines, and in the hope that every person who honestly gives his labour to the production of commodities of necessity, comfort, and pleasure, will have an ample and full reward. I propose to continue my speech on some future occasion. Progress reported. BUDGET-PAPERS. Sir JOHN FORREST laid on tableThe Budget 1913-14-Paper s prepared by the Right Honourable Sir John Forrest, P .

311,Mr JOSEPH COOK,E JS,ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [4.37] - I move That the House do now adjourn. We have already decided to adjourn until Tuesday.,58
312,Mr FENTON,E JS,"Maribyrnong) [4.38] I do not wish to detain honourable members, but I have a very important matter to bring under the attention of the Home Affairs Department, and, in the absence of the Honorary Minister, I trust the Minister of Trade and Customs will make a note of the matter. I refer to the way in which electors are receiving notices pride about being struck off the r o l l . I have a copy of a notice served on a farmer in my electorate. This man has been living in the same place for two and a half years, and has not been away from his residence more than three days at a stretch. It would seem that some one is exceptionally eager to have people struck off the roll, though these people have every right not to be objected to. This is the notice my constituent has receivedNotice is hereby given that objection has been lodged to your name being retained on the electoral roll for the division of Maribyrnong, in the State of Victoria, on the following grounds - That you have ceased to reside in this division.",58
313,Mr FISHER,E JS,On what grounds but political could that notice be sent?,58
314,Mr GROOM,E JS,The only way to deal with that is for the honourable member to hand me the papers.,58
315,Mr FENTON,E JS,"I am telling the M i nister of what has occurred. My constituent wrote to me on receiving this notice. He wished to know why he had been objected to though he had not been away from his domicile. I the immediately replied, advising him - to write to the Registrar, giving the full particulars, when, no doubt, the matter would be rectified; but later I received a letter from my constituent informing me that no reply had been received from the Registrar, and my correspondent said it was time he had heard something about the matter. Upon this, I communicated with the Registrar, and asked how it was that a man could reside in one place for two and a half years and be objected to. I received a letter from the Registrar telling me that everything had been fixed up all right, and that the elector's name had not been expunged from the list. But why should a man be harassed in that way ? I cannot conceive of electoral officers doing these things on their own in i tiative. I have another case-that of a railway employee. This man was living in one of those humpies, or miserable hovels, the State Railway Department supplies for some of the stationmasters, but, in this case, the Department saw fit to be a little magnanimous and liberal, and built a new residence a few yards away, in the same railway grounds. Because this man and his family moved out of the old hovel into the new house, four names on the roll for the old place have been objected to. This is a condition of affairs in connection with electoral matters that should be stopped at once by any reasonable Government, and if I continue to receive more notices of objection like this, I shall go as far as to move the adjournment of the Souse on every day it is sitting to call attention to every objection I receive; and I shall advise my electors, if they are to be objected to in this manner, that the best thing they can do is for ""the whole of them to send in fresh claim cards to the Electoral Office. Then there will be a nice picnic. But I am not going to have these people disfranchised, and I bring this matter forward now, even at the risk of trespassing on the patience of orable members; because to take away from a man a vote to which he is entitled is one of the worse things that can happen to a community. I hope that the Minister will take notice of the matter.",58
316,Mr TUDOR,E JS,"Yarra) [4.46] - I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister a similar matter. Last election day, in the Yarra division, a lady was prevented from voting, the objection being taken that her name had been struck off the roll. Afterwards I made inquiries, and found that it had been struck off because she and her granddaughter had the same names, and the latter was on the Ballarat roll. I wrote to the Electoral Department, and her name was subsequently placed on the roll again for the Abbotsford subdivision, but a day or two ago she received a card saying that it had been objected to a second time and her name had been struck off again, although she has been continuously residing in. the same house for many years. I have, of course, written to the Returning Officer for the Division of Yarra, asking him to have matters put right. I draw attention to the case here because, if names are to be struck off simply. because they are the same as other names, electors who possess names that are very common will run great risk of being disfranchised. If an elector can be struck off the roll, reinstated, and struck off a second time, although attention has been called to her case, goodness knows what may happen fco those with regard to whom no notice is taken.",59
317,Mr FISHER,E JS,"Wide Bay) [4.48] Having looked at the Budget-papers again, I find that £7,093,000 of invested money will be available for the Treasurer within twelve months. I overstated the time when I said just now that it would be available within sixteen months. There is another matter to which I draw attention. The Prime Minister, when interrogated this morning regarding a very important act of administration-the relieving from duty of the second member of the Naval Board, who came to this country with the highest recommendations from the Admiralty to assist in the development of the Naval Unit-aske d for notice of the question, and gave no information. There are some administrative acts which ought not to be paraded in Parliament, but this is hon- not one of them. An officer cannot be suspended or relieved from duty, which is practically the same thing, and the fact be kept secret. This officer occupied important positions before he came here, and has enjoyed the confidence of two Governments in an important Commonwealth position. ' His standing is such that we ought to know what is the difference between him and the Executive. Had I been present when the question was asked, I should have myself desired information from the Prime Minister. To-night, of course, we have sworn a truce, it being agreed that no controversial matters would be entered upon, but I ask the Minister of Trade and Customs to be good enough to inform his chief that I consider that he should take' Parliament and the country into his full confidence in regard to this matter at the earliest moment. Whatever may be the views of the Government, I regard this action as a serious one. We should know whether Captain Onslow"" has been suspended for incapacity, or because of some difference on a question of policy. The Government cannot use its power to - do an officer injury without giving an opportunity for the discussion of the action taken. I do not wish to press the matter further now. I am not speaking for Captain Onslow, because I have not been in communication with him, either directly or indirectly, nor have I been in communication with any of his friends, but things cannot be allowed to remain as they stand. I do not want to be in formed privately what the trouble is ; the information should be given to Parliament. I venture to say that Parliament will demand the reasons for the action taken. The creation and management of the Australian Navy is a matter of the first importance to the people of Australia, and Parliament cannot be safely left without the fullest in formation on any matter concerning it .",59
318,Mr HIGGS,E JS,"Capricornia) [4.54] - On the 23rd September I referred to a circular secretly issued by the Queensland Loyal Orange Institution . I condemned the secret issuing of that circular, and I think that most honourable members will agree with what I said on the subject. Since then, Senator Maughan has stated publicly in another place that those who were responsible for the publication had uo authority to include his name among the names of the persons therein recommended to the electors of Queensland as worthy of support. I am glad that he - has been able to do that.",60
319,Mr STUMM,E JS,Ha d they authority to in clude other names ? It was the honourable member's duty to ascertain that before .making use of a private circular.,60
320,Mr HIGGS,E JS,"If the honourable member was here when I spoke,, he must know that I wrote to Mr Charles Fish, the secretary of the Grand Political Committee of the Loyal Orange Lodge in Queenslaud, asking him what authority he had for saying fchafc I had pandered to the Roman Catholic vote, or to any other vote.",60
321,Mr FISHEE,E JS,1 understand that my name was mentioned.,60
322,Mr HIGGS,E JS,"It is stated in the circular that the, right honourable member was not worthy of support because he was a Home Ruler, and, worse of all, had included in a Cabinet the most militant Roman Catholic in Australia, Mr Mahon.",60
323,Mr FISHER,E JS,I have not seen the circular.,60
324,Mr HIGGS,E JS,"The honourable member for Lilley was recommended as a candidate worthy - of support. If he objects to the use of his name, why does he not rise in his place and condemn what was done? Why does he not join with me in denouncing the issue of a secret circular of that kind ? We are perfectly willing to meet circulars that are published openly, but it is only rarely that we have an opportunity of knowing of the existence of secret circulars. That such circulars have been issued for some time past is apparent, because of the statement, in the circular to which I refer, ""that information is contained in previous circulars stating that the Labour party is more pliant than any other party in regard to pandering to the Roman Catholic vote."" In the report of my speech which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald of 24th September- I do not complain of the length of the report, which extends over twenty or t h i r t y lines, because that is as much as one can reasonably expect in a telegram, no matter how long the speech may be-it is stated that I said that the issue of the circular would have been all right in the days of Henry VIII . I did not say that it would be right at any time. I do not think that at any period of history any body of men should issue a secret circular condemning parliamentary candidates, and appealing to sectarian prejudices. The same report that was sent to the Sydney Morning Herald seems to have been sent to the Brisbane Telegraph, and the passage to which I take exception appears in that newspaper. If the source of a report is inaccurate, the inaccuracy is published over a wide area. Probably the same report will appear in several country newspapers in Queensland. I wish, therefore, to make this correction, so that it may be printed in the pages of Hansard. Senator Maughan was the only Labour candidate in Queensland whose name was recommended by the Loyal Orange Institution of the State.",60
325,Mr THOMAS,E JS,I suppose they took him up because they would not have Mr St. Ledger.,60
326,Mr HIGGS,E JS,"If c appears to be their practice to take up one Labour candidate and put him on their ticket, to try to make the public think that they are impartial, and not opposed root and branch to - the Labour party. I warn wage earners-m e a who are working for 8s. a day, and have been working for that wage for twenty years, the men who are .suffering from those diseases which attack the workers in mines for long periods-thaf c they should not be misled. I warn them against the practices of in dividuals opposed to the Labour party, who are using the Loyal Orange Institution in favour of my Tory friends opposite, - including the Minister of Home Affairs. I ask them not to think that this institution is impartial because it recommends the giving of support to one Labour There can be no doubt that the political wire-pullers who issued this secret circular are totally opposed to the Labour party, and every wage-earner in Queensland ought to be made aware of that fact.",60
327,Mr STUMM,E JS,"Lilley) [5.0] - I desire to explain that it was absolute news fco me that there had been issued in Queensland such a circular as that referred to by the honourable member for Capricornia, and that the organization by which it was issued had connected with it a political committee. I shall not question the right of that organization, or of any other body, to issue to its members a confidential circular.",61
328,Mr HIGGS,E JS,Then the honourable member believes in it f,61
329,Mr STUMM,E JS,"No; - but I would not question the right of an association to issue a strictly private circular to its members, although I should object to its making a circular of this kind public. I hold the opinion that the honourable member should not have made use of the circular without first ascertaining whether it was issued with the consent or knowledge of the men affected by it . That is the course which a regard for the ordinary relations of life would dictate. In every-day life one would not think of making use of a confidential communication, except in so far as it related to oneself. That, however, is what the honourable member for Capricornia did not do. He would have been justified in quoting it in so far as it affected himself; bu t by his action he has compelled one of his own colleagues to make an explanation, and will cause others to do so. The honourable member has given to this circular a publicity that it would not have secured if he had not read it here. It will cause a lot of mischief.",61
330,Mr HIGGS,E JS,It will cause a lot chief to the Liberal-Tory associations.,61
331,Mr STUMM,E JS,"I do not know that they had anything to do with it . I have been able fco get along in this world without raising the sectarian devil, and I hope that I shall never hold a seat in this House, or in any other Legislative Assembly, if I can gain it only by such means. I strongly object to the honourable member using this circular for political purposes, and by that means stabbing other people.",61

333,Mr STUMM,E JS,"The honourable member might well explain how the circular came into his possession. I am not a member of the organization in question, and I repeat that I knew nothing of .the circular, nor did I know that this institution had a political committee connected with it .",61
334,Mr MATHEWS,E JS,Every one knows about it .,61
335,Mr STUMM,E JS,"It is news to me. As an old newspaper man, the honourable member for Capricornia ought to have known that, if he had a grievance against the Sydney Morning Herald or the Brisbane Telegraph, the proper procedure for him to follow was to write to those newspapers correcting the misstatement, in stead of availing himself of the forms of the House to do so. I am amazed, however, to find that the practice followed by him is quite a common one in this House. Speaking as a new member, and as a journalist, I do not think it is the correct course to follow.",61
336,Mr HIGGS,E JS,Will the honourable member guarantee me access to the columns of these newspapers 1,61
337,Mr STUMM,E JS,I do not think that any decent newspaper would refuse to publish a correction; and the Sydney Morning Herald and the Brisbane Telegraph are both reputable journals.,61
338,Mr THOMAS,E JS,"Why , the Argus, on one occasion, would not publish a letter which I wrote.",61
339,Mr STUM M,E JS,"Perhaps it would not publish it in the form desired by the honourable member. If these newspapers refused the honourable member the right to correct the misstatement', then, and only then, should he make use of the forrhs of the House to make the correction. ' I am sorry that I have had to refer fco this matter, and that the honourable member of misshould have made an improper use of a circular which, on the .face of it, is confidential",61
340,Mr HIGGS,E JS,The honourable member is sorry because he has been exposed.,61
341,Mr MATHEWS,E JS,It is known down here that the honourable member was on the Orange ticket.,62
342,Mr STUMM,E JS,Then I can only say that people down here knew more than I did. I do not know that this organization extended to me any support.,62
343,Mr HIGGS,E JS,"The honourable member . was on the ticket, aud his opponent was being stabbed in the back by this secret confidential circular.",62
344,Mr STUMM,E JS,I invite the honourable member to show that the name of my opponent is even mentioned in the circular.,62
345,Mr HIGGS,E JS,It is unnecessary to mention it . The organization issuing it supported the honourable member.,62
346,Mr STUMM,E JS,I did not know that. I presume that the circular is genuine.,62
347,Mr HIGGS,E JS,It is perfectly genuine.,62
348,Mr STUMM,E JS,"In this circular they gave the honourable member for Capricornia and others a political stab, and I gather, fro m the honourable member's reading of it , that at the same time they recommended my candidature. But, so far as I can recollect, no reference whatever was made to my opponent, so that it is incorrect to say that he received a stab. For some reason they appear to have preferred me.",62
349,Mr MATHEWS,E JS,Because the honourable - member is a Conservative.,62
350,Mr STUMM,E JS,Why ! the honourable member does not even know me.,62

354,Mr STUMM,E JS,I grant that.,62
355,Mr FRAZER,E JS,Kalgoorlie) [ 5 . 9 ] wish to ask the Acting Leader of the Government whether there will be any objection to proof slips of the Hansard report of the Treasurer's Budget statement being supplied to honourable members tomorrow morning ?

360,Mr THOMAS,E JS,He does not get on very well with Clarkson.,62
361,Mr MATHEWS,E JS,O r Creswell.,62
362,Mr FRAZER,E JS,This is too serious a matter for us to joke about. . The action taken in regard to Captain Onslow was apparently communicated to the press. This officer's reputation is at stake. He has years behind him to guarantee both his capacity and his integrity. Mr W . H . IRVINE - The Prime M in ister has promised to make a full statement when next we meet.,62
363,Mr FRAZER,E JS,I think that the Prime Minister has played a shockingly dirt y trick on this officer.,62
364,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,E JS,"The honourable member must withdraw that reHowever, I have mark. I regret that the",62
365,Mr FRAZER,E JS,"In deference to your request, sir, I withdraw it . So far as I am aware, I have never met this officer, and am not holding a brief for him . My sole desire is to see that justice is done where I believe that an injustice has been perpetrated. If there is any good reason for the action taken in relieving this officer of his duties, and giving in formation of that fact to the newspaper - I press, why not let us know of it at once ? Why does the Prime Minister say, ""Yes, I will give y o u the information next week"" ? Captain Onslow was drawn from the British Navy, and appointed to the position of second member of the Naval Board because of his ability and his recommendations. Surely he is uot to be removed, from such a position and a stigma allowed to rest upon him. But the Prime Minister says, "" I will give you a statement of the case next Tuesday."" There is nothing decent about that. IE is just such an attitude as might be adopted towards an individual unworthy of the slightest consideration. We know that the Prime Minister is now on his way to Sydney. I see that the Treasurer is now present, and I therefore repeat my request that honourable members may be supplied with a proof of the right honourable member's speech tomorrow morning.",62
366,Sir JOHN FORREST,E JS,I have no objection to any person who so desires having a proof.,63
367,Mr FRAZER,E JS,"We have not yet seen a copy, and the Treasurer did not extend the courtesy of supplying one to the respected Leader of the Opposition.",63
368,Sir JOHN FORREST,E JS,It has never been done anywhere.,63
369,Mr FISHER,E JS,"Oh , yes, it has.",63
370,Sir JOHN FORREST,E JS,How can copies be supplied when a speaker does not know what he is going to say?,63
371,Mr FRAZER,E JS,Why the right honourable gentleman read the speech!',63
372,Sir JOHN FORREST,E JS,It is very few times that I have read such a statement.,63
373,Mr FISHER,E JS,I do not think that the right honourable gentleman said fifty words that were not down in the statement.,63
374,Sir JOHN FORREST,E JS,That is only a coincidence.,63
375,Mr FRAZER,E JS,"This is the consideration we receive for permitting the right honourable gentleman to read his speech, although he was grossly out of order every minute he was on his feet. I may say that the Leader of the Opposition would not allow his supporters to challenge the procedure.",63
376,Sir JOHN FORREST,E JS,"Why , the Leader of the Opposition, when Treasurer, read his own Budget statement!",63
377,Mr FRAZER,E JS,"We are now considering the case of a naval officer of reputation, who is highly recommended by the Admiralty, and is the second member of the Naval Board; and although I have heard no suggestion of incompetency, he has been relieved of duty. So far as I know, I have never seen this gentleman; but it is only right that, we should see that justice is done to him, and to that end a statement ought to be made to the House. There is no doubt that indignity is placed upon this officer, and he ought to be given an opportunity to defend himself.",63
378,Mr KELLY,E JS,"Wentworth-Honorar y Minister) [5.20] - I rise to deprecate any further remarks by honourable members opposite at this juncture. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie informed us'that he did not speak as one holding a brief for this officer, and any one who followed his remarks must have recognised that he was not speaking in this officer's interest. It was abundantly clear that he was using this unfortunate incident as a means of attacking the Government, and was not considering the best interests of the Australian Navy.",63
379,Mr FRAZER,E JS,"The Honorary Minister always was a little cad, and nothing will improve him!",63
380,Mr KELLY,E JS,"I can hardly think that the honourable member is himself; otherwise he would knowfchafcsuch words from him are, indeed, a tribute, under the circumstances. However, I do not wish any heat to be introduced into this discussion. I point out to my honourable friends opposite that circumstances as unfortunate have arisen on previous occasions, and have not always been treated as an opportunity for the exhibition of party feeling. I can remember, for instance, that the ex-Minister of Defence had to dispense with the services of a very distinguished sailor.",63
381,Mr MATHEAVS,E JS,That is what I desire to say a word or two about.,63
382,Mr KELLY,E JS,"But let us know the facts first, and the facts are coming in due course. In that particular case an officer's services were dispensed with; but did any one seek then to attack the Minister?",63
383,Mr MATHEWS,E JS,"I did; I had a "" go "" at the Minister.",63
384,Mr KELLY,E JS,"It must have been in Caucus, for we never heard it in open daylight.",63
385,Mr FISHER,E JS,I can assure the Honorary Minister thatfchafcis not so.,63
386,Mr KELLY,E JS,"I do not say that it was, but the honourable member for Melbourne Ports says that he attacked the ex-Minister. Do I understand the right honourable gentleman to say that the honourable member did not attack the ex-Minister ? . Mr FJSHER - It is an impertinence for the honourable member to talk about the Caucus.",63
387,Mr KELLY,E JS,Does the right able member say there was no attack by the honourable member Ports in connection with this other case 1,64
388,Mr FISHEK,E JS,Yes .,64
389,Mr MATHEWS,E JS,Not in the Caucus.,64
390,Mr FISHER,E JS,There was no discussion in Caucus on the matter. This is one of the impertinences of the Honorary Minister.,64
391,Mr KELLY,E JS,I regret that I cannot sit at the feet of the modern Chesterfield in order to take lessons in manners or decorum.,64
392,Mr FISHER,E JS,"It is not pertinent to the subject-that is all I say. If the honourable member knows what language means, he will know that I mean his remarks are uot pertinent to the subject.",64
393,Mr KELLY,E JS,"I trust that, as the late Opposition did not in any way attempt to embarrass the Naval Board or the naval administration of the then Government, they will, as the present Government, receive, at any rate, equally generous treatment at the hands of the present Opposition.",64
394,Mr FRAZER,E JS,Tlii s is a Ministerial act.,64
395,Mr KELLY,E JS,"And so was the last a Ministerial act. We do not ask for any better treatment than was cheerfully and freely accorded to the preceding Minister of Defence, the then Opposition recognising that discretion and temperance were the best assistance we could give in view of the welfare of the Australian naval administration. In due course, I have no doubt, honourable members opposite will receive the replies they are expecting. Let them wait until there is an opportunity to ask the questions, to which the Prime Minister has promised to give consideration on Tuesday, when we can have the matter dealb with free from party feeling and heat There is one other matter to which I desire to refer. The honourable member for Maribyrnong, I understand- I was not present at the time-sai d he had some evidence as to names that had been objected to.",64
396,Mr TUDOR,E JS,"I brought a name forward, and spoke to the Honorary Minister privately about it . "" I intend to send the case on to the Victorian officer.",64

398,Mr FENTON,E JS,"If this wholesale business goes on, I shall recommend all my electors to send in fresh cards. .",64
399,Mr KELLY,E JS,"I do not think that honourable members should take the view that the electoral system has broken down,, because it has not.",64
400,Mr FISHER,E JS,No ; it has broken up !,64
401,Mr KELLY,E JS,"The most amusing feature of that remark is that it is seriously intended.. I suggest to my honourable friends that they need not take a gloomy view of electoral matters. The electoral officers, who also served the previous' Government, are addressing themselves to this matter with all the power and disinterestedness that is in them.",64
402,Mr FENTON,E JS,^People who have been living in the same place for two years and a half are objected to.,64
403,Mr KELLY,E JS,S u c h things have been happening on occasions for years^past.,64
404,Mr FENTON,E JS,This has not happened before.,64
405,Mr KELLY,E JS,"If the honourable member desires to have those errors rectified, and does not seek to use them as a stick fco beat the Government with , he ought to submit the cases to the Central Office, when every care will be taken to s if t bhem.",64
406,Mr MATHEWS,E JS,"Melbourne Ports) [5.28] - I should like to say a few words in connection with the naval sensation,' and in doing so I do not seek to make any attack on the Government, or the"" Minister. I have always conbended that the Minister of Defence should be a member of the House of Representatives. This is one of our greatest spending De^ partments, and, therefore, the political head ought, to be in the Chamber which has control of the public moneys. Honourable members, in dealing with the Defence Department, are always weakened by the fact that the Minister is represented by another honourable gentleman in this House, who is not full y familiar with all the affairs of the Department, and has really no responsibility in connection with it ; and I quite understand the position of the present Honorary Minister, and also the position that the honourable member for Adelaide occupied in the previous Administration. What I object to is that, whenever a man is appointed to the Naval Board who has proved of any use to the Navy of Australia, he is got r i d of, by hook or by crook. Captain Hardy, an efficient sailor and organizer, with a faculty for managing men, came out from the Old Country with credentials as long as my arm, in order to take superintendence of the Naval Depot at Williamstown. We all know how hard it is to satisfy a body of men; but it was admitted that Captain Hardy used every endeavour to secure efficiency at the Dep6t generally. However, he fell foul of the Naval Board, and it was a question whether he or the N a v a l ' Board should go, and, of course, he went. 1I have met Captain Onslow several times, and it is evident that he is a sailor, and not a social man. His record proves his. efficiency and capacity for the position to which he was appointed. I do not wish to speak slightingly of the other members of the Board; but, as a matter of fact, he was the only sailor amongst them. Almost the whole of the naval work is done in my electorate of Melbourne Forts, and these matters come under my notice; but I have always found that, try as one will to get justice, no matter what Government are in power, nobody can get justice from the .Board. By hook or by crook they have always managed to get the best of the Ministry. If the Naval Board is the best system of running the show, we might as well give it up at once; and I would suggest to the present Go-, vernment that we ought to bring a man from the English Navy out here who'will be able to undertake the management of affairs, in place of the ineffective system, and the ineffective men, we have at the present time. A1-* though the Minister of Defence for the time being is always the Chairman of the Naval Board, he is hardly likely to have a great knowledge of naval matters; and' it is certain that, up to the present, so far as the Naval Board is concerned, there has been nothing but dissension, which, if it continues much longer, will lead to chaos. It would have been better if the Government, instead of suspending only one man, had suspended the whole [66] crowd of .them until some improvement was made. I do not want to use threats, nor to take advantage of my position in this House to make a cowardly attack on any member of the Board, bnt they certainly take advantage of their position on the Board to make cowardly attacks on other men. It is highly necessary for the Government to introduce some system of controlling the Naval Department that would be beneficial to Australia, instead of continuing the hybrid system in existence today. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 5.35 p.m.",64
