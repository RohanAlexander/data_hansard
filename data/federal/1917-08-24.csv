1,Mr SPBAXEB,Unknown,"Hon, W. Elliot JvlinBon) took the chair at 11 a.m., and read prayers. PRICE OF BREAD.",4
2,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I ask the Honorary Minister, in the absence of the Prime Minister, whether, for the benefit of the residents of Melbourne, he will have a list of the prioes fixed for bread posted at the General Post Office, together with the namo of the official to whom any citizen may complain if charged higher prices.",4
3,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I shall bring the suggestion under the notice of the Prims Minister. Later:,4
4,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Accordin g to today^s newspapers, it was stated yesterday in evidence taken by the Inter-State Commission that nearly all the millers and about 80 per cent, of the bakers have enterod into an agreement not to sell bread below certain fixed prices. Bakers who sell below these prioes are not to be supplied by the millers. I ask the Prime Minister if he intends to establish a subbranch of the National Bureau to give protection to bakers who desire to sell bread at such prioes as they can afford to sell at, independently of t i e ring to which I have referred?",4
5,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I shall be glad to do so, provided, of course, that the bakers who say that they can sell bread at Od. a loaf are not making their profit at the expense of those who work for them. The man who gave the evidence referred to does not pay wages to his wife and Ms daughter, whom he employs in his business.",4
6,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Can the Prime Minister give us the name of the baker to whom he refers!,4
7,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I do not know his name. All I know is that a witness examined yesterday said that he was engaged in the business of making bread and pastry,' and that in estimating the cost of' his broad he did not allow for the value of the work done In his shop by his wife and daughter. That man is undercutting other bakers who employ assistance at union rates of wages. How can those who have to pay union rates meet such competition?",4
8,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Does the Prime Minister impugn this man's evidence? If so, is it his intention to have him prosecuted for perjury?",5
9,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I presume that what he says is true. It was the truth of his revelation that staggered me. Such a man should be put into gaol.,5
10,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister make special inquiry into the rumour that this baker is a German, and therefore unworthy of being taken notice of?",5
11,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Yes .,5
12,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," Severa l questions have been asked relating to matters arising out of a Minister's answer to a question. distinctly out of order to ask such supplementary questions, and I hope that the - practice will not be continued.",5
13,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"A constituent who, although a member of the Tramway Employees' Union, is standing by the authorities in New South Wales during the present strike, wrote to me yesterday to say that the baker from whom he has been buying bread for the last three and a half years now refuses to supply him, because he is supporting the Government. I ask the Prinie Minister if he will see whether this sort of thing can be prevented ?",5
14,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I cannot compel one man to sell goods to another if , for any reason, he declines to do so. This is a free countiy, in which a man may refuse to offer his services or to sell his goods. It is for the community or for those who feel aggrieved by such action to take such remedies as may be open to them. I shall not make fish of one and fowl of another. This conflict, which is engendering great bitterness among all sorts of people, will, in the end, work out its own salvation. Every man owes a duty to hia country and to his fellow citizens, and subject to the law each must determine for himself in what spirit he should perform it. INDUSTRIAL CRISIS. STRIKE COMMITTEE: TRADES HALL - LIST or ""WILD, RECKLESS, DISLOYAL MEN.""",5
15,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been directed to a statement in today's press to the effect that there is at the Trades Hall, Melbourne, a strike committee, guarded by sentries, and apparently defying the law of the land from an impregnable position, Will this be allowed under the Commonwealth, or State, law?",5
16,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"A number of persons are at present more or less openly defying the law, but my attention has not been directed to this particular case. Mr BRENNAN"" - Has the Prime Minister yet compiled a list of those to whom in a proclamation relating to the strike issued a few days ago over his name he referred as ""wild, reckless, disloyal men, dominated by secret German agents""? Has he, as the head of the Commonwealth Government, taken action Ib is in regard to them?",5
17,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I am endeavouring 'to take action as soon as possible - Perhaps the honourable member will supply me with names to extend the list already compiled. I shall be glad to have them, andfchehonorable meanber may help me to lay hands on the right men. I am particularly desirous that there shall not be included among those upon whom the wrath of the law will descend men who have been Snisled, designedly, by persons who keep in the background, who are urging foolish, credulous men and women to serve their own ends without regard to the welfare of Australia. GERMAN THEATRICAL ARTISTS.",5
18,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I understand that there is now in Australia a theatrical company in which a number of German artists are employed who masquerade under French, Russian, and Belgian names. I ask the Prime Minister whether the Commonwealth Government can protect Australian artists against the competition of unnaturalized Germans?",5
19,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"If .the honourable member will give me fuller particulars, I shall make inquiries. Unnaturalized Germans are not allowed to come here. COMPLAINTS OFFICERS.",5
20,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Recently the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) asked a question regarding the appointment of complaints officers. Some time ago steps were taken to extend the system of appointing such officers throughout Australia. < FOOD IN COOL STORES.,5
21,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Is ihe Government prepared to follow the example of the New Zealand Government and make available for local consumption meat and other foodstuffs in cool stores which, although intended for the British Government, cannot be sent overseas for want of freight?",6
22,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I do not know what has been done in this matter in New Zealand. If the honourable member will put his question on the notice-paper for Wednesday next, I may be able in the interval to ascertain the exact state of affairs, and determine what action the Government should take in this matter. LOAN FLOTATION.",6
23,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Will the Treasurer say when he gave instructions for the issue of a Commonwealth loan in London, and whether Sir Robert Nivison and Company were .permitted to underwrite it ; and if so, what underwriting fees the firm is charging?",6
24,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I suppose that the question is based upon a notice appearing in the press this morning. I believe that the information in the press is substantially correct, but I have not full information as yet. I have approved of the issue of the loan, and it is being issued through the Commonwealth Bank. The terms under which' it is being issued have heen approved by the Commonwealth Bank and its advisers, Sir Robert Nivison and Company, and also by the High Commissioner and the British Treasury.",6
25,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"The Treasurer has omitted to say whether Sir Robert Nivison and Company were permitted to underwrite the loan, or to mention what fees they are being paid.",6
26,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I ask the honourable member to give notice of his question. INCOME TAX . .SPECIAL IMPOST ON SPINSTERS.,6
27,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Will the Treasurer say whether there is any truth in a statement which has ibeen made, namely, that it is intended that the Bill which proposes to place a special tax upon bachelors will also apply to spinsters? (Sir JOHN FORREST - The proposals of the Government are in the hands of honourable members, and the honourable member will see that they Tefer to males only, and not to females. There is no truth in the statement referred to by the honourable member, as he ought to be aware. NA MEMBERS.",6

29,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"The honourable member will not be in order in doing so, unless it relates to business of which he is in charge. NA OFFICE. j  question arising out of the disability placed on people in outlying parts of Australia through the reduction of telegraphie facilities. The telegraph operator at Tibooburra has been removed, and a telephone service has been substituted. The Postmaster-General is absent, but I wash to ask whether the Government will stay the the hands of the Postal Department until the Postmaster-General can be approached directly concerning this matter.",6
30,Mr WATT,TIBOOBURRA TELEGRAPH,"I will see that representations are made to the Postal Department regarding the matter, and have inquiries made, and I will see that the honourable member is furnished with the information he seeks when the PostmasterGeneTal returns. "" LOADING "" OF INVOICES.",6
31,Mr KELLY,TIBOOBURRA TELEGRAPH,"the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice 1. Is it a fact that the Customs Department are "" loading"" invoices for dynamo electric machinery imported from the TJnited Kingdom; and, if so, by what percentage? 2. On what grounds is the "" l o a d in g"" based? 3. On what date did it commence? 4. What is the wording of the instruction issued by the Customs authorities under which the "" l o a d in g"" is done? 5. Are similar products from any other country than the United Kingdom similarly "" loaded "" ; if so, what are the countries, and on what date did the "" loading"" commence in each case? 6. Is the "" loading "" applied indiscriminately to all invoices fro m the United Kingdom' for dynamo electric machinery? 7. In cases where the manufacturers protest, are any inquiries made witli regard to the individual invoice on which the protest is made to ascertain whether the particular invoice has or has not given the correct value for Customs purposes ? 8. What "" loading,"" if any, is added to metal filament lamps imported from the TJnited Kingdom; and when was this "" loading"" first made? 9. What "" loading,"" if any, is added to the same class of lamps imported from Holland? 10. llow many officers of the Department have visited Holland to make inquiries regarding lamp prices there, and (a) what length of time was spent there in making investigations; (6) what works did they visit; (e) when was the first visit made? 11. Arc they satisfied that Holland lampmakers are not importing lamps from Germany into Holland to meet the enormous expansion of their business due to the war? 12. What inquiries, if any, were made on these lines, and what steps have been taken, if any, to make certain that German lamps are not being imported into this country after having been re-branded in Holland ?",6
32,Mr JENSEN,TIBOOBURRA TELEGRAPH,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low:1. Yes; by varying percentages, which are denoticependent on the extent of the difference between the export price charged to the Australian importer and the home-consumption price charged to domestic buyers, which i8 the statutory basis for duty. 2. On the ground that investigation shows that the manufacturers concerned allow buyers for export lower prices than are given to buyers for home consumption. 3. "" Loadings "" were imposed on the invoice values of certain firms as far back as 1905; but the "" loadings "" now in force were for the most part imposed in 1915. 4. Instructions of this, kind are issued for the confidential information of officers only. 5. Yes. United States of America. 1907. G. No. 7. That is frequently done. 8. "" Loadings"" at various rates are applied to the invoice values; sueh ""loadings"" were first applied in 1915. 9. No such "" loading "" is at present imposed on similar lamps from Holland,, as the Department is in possession of evidence which shows that the prices charged for export by the Dutch manufacturer, whose values it is believed tire intended to be referred to, are not lower than the prices' charged for home consumption in Holland. 10. Ko officers of this Department have yet visited Holland to investigate the domestic values of Dutch lamps; but the information as to the value was obtained from the special agent for the Government of New Zealand, who made personal investigations. That basis of value for duty in New Zealand is the same as in the Commonwealth. 11 and 12. Dutch lamps imported into Australia are accompanied by certificates of origin issued by the British Consul-General. [54] REPATRIATION BOARDS.",7
33,Mr HIGGS,TIBOOBURRA TELEGRAPH,"the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon noticel Having reference to the proposed six State v Honorary Repatriation Boards of seven members each, and the Central Honorary Board of seven members, will these Boards meet weekly or monthly, and what are to be their duties?2.

34,Mr GROOM,TIBOOBURRA TELEGRAPH,This information will be supplied d u r in g the debates upon the A u s t r a l i an Soldiers' R e p at r i at i o n Bill . WAR COMMITTEE.,7
35,Mr HIGGS,TIBOOBURRA TELEGRAPH,"the Treasurer, upon 1. Having reference to the item on page 298 of the Estimates 1917-18-""Expense s of Federal Parliamentary War Committee, including salary of secretary to honorary organizer, £000""-(a ) What is the name of the secretary referred to; (6) on what date was he first appointed, and by whom; (c) what are the terms and conditions of his appointment; (d) where does he carry out his duties; (e) what rate of salary did he receive to 30th June, 1917, and from 1st July, 1917, to date? 2.

36,Sir JOHNFORREST,TIBOOBURRA TELEGRAPH,"The P r i m e Minister ' s D e p a r t m e n t has supplied the following information: 1. (a) D. J. Quinn. (6) and (c) 14th October, 1915. The Federal Parliamentary War Committee requested that an efficient secretary- a journalist - be appointed to assist the honorary organizer, (Hon. J. C.

37,Mr MASSYGREENE,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"for Mr AUSTIN M A N) asked the Treasurer, wpon notice I. Has his attention been directed to the recent insurance legislation in the State of Queensland? 2. Will he ascertain from the Queensland State Government what has been the result of same?",8
38,Sir JOHNFORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w : 1. I am aware that such legislation has been passed. 2. The Queensland State Government will be asked to furnish official reports. METALS FOR MUNITIONS.,8
39,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"the P r i m e Minister , upon notice I. Seeing that finality has been reached in the negotiations between the British Government and the Queensland Government for the purchase ancl despatch of tungsten metals to be used in the manufacture of munitions, is it the intention of the Commonwealth Government to sanction the sale and despatch of these nietals direct by the Queensland Government to the British Minister for Munitions exclusively? 2. Would not such sale and despatch result in an increased price Of £25 per ton for 00 per cent, wolfram, and about £50 per ton for molybdenite, being paid to the miners?",8
40,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low : 1. Finality has not yet been reached between the Commonwealth Government and the IraS erial Government. Improved prices, at a at-rate on the field, have been arranged, pending settlement of negotiations for an extended contract. 2. Ko. MR. W. B. GRIFFIN.",8
41,Mr ATKINSON,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"the Minister for Home and T e r r it o r i e s , upon notice I.

44,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"The suggested amendment is not considered necessary. It is proposed that the sales shall be by auct i o n , and due notice will be g i v e n . AUSTRALIANIMPERIAL FORCE. NUMBER OF DIVISIONS .",8
45,Dr MALONEY,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, wpon notice I. Is it a fact that five Divisions of Australians are at the Front in Flanders and France, whilst Canada had, at late dates, only four divisions? 2. If so, is it a fact that there is being formed in England a 6th Division of Australians?",9
46,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. We have no information regarding the number of Canadian Divisions at the Front. 2. No. I NVALIDAND OLD-AGE PENSIONS APPROPRIATION BILL. In Committee (Consideration of Governor General's message) : Sir JOHN FORREST (Swan-Trea surer) [11.28] - I move That it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a Bill for an Act to grant and apply out of Consolidated Kevcnue Fund a sum for invalid and old-age pensions. The object of this Bill is to provide funds for the Trust Fund, out of which invalid and old-age pensions are paid. This f u n d was established at the inception of the payment by the Commonwealth of invalid aud old-age pensions. Moneys 'are paid into it from revenue, and no money can be drawn from it except for the purposes of the Invali d and Old-age Pensions Act. ""We have to provide the f u n d before we can make payments. Mr Hioos - Is it true that this Bill must be passed before old-age pensions can be'paid?",9
47,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,Yes ; in order to supplement moneys already in thefund.,9
48,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,Then where did the Treasury get the money for the balance of the past year?,9
49,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Fro m funds provided under similar appropriations to this oue. I ask the honourable member to have a little patience. I shall explain the position. The Trust Fund was also established for other reasons, with which honourable members who were in Parliament at the time are well acquainted. Anv balance [ 5 4 ] -2 of revenue over expenditure at the end of a financial year is paid into the f u n d , because there was some doubt as to whether the balance should go back to the States under section 94 of the Constitution. Under a decision of the High Court, any balance remaining at the end of the year can be paid into a trustfund . This is the fund into which balances are paid.",9
50,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,-Where do you get the money to put into this fund?,9
51,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Fro m the consolidated revenue, of course. This measure will authorize us to pay into it from time to time balances up to £10,000,000. Of course, we do not pay anything like that sum in old-age pensions in any qne year, but when we have any balance at the end of a financial year we pay it into this f u n d and draw upon it for old-age pensions. There is a safeguard in the fact that the money cannot be withdrawn, except for this purpose, no matter how much money is in the fund .",9
52,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,What is the utilit y of the fund?,9
53,Sir JOHNFORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"I have told the honourable member. We are asked year after year to explain these matters to honourable members who have been in the House for years. The same practice as I am proposing has been followed ever since old-age pensions were established, and it is necessary to have large appropriations. When the last financial year closed we had a surplus of about £2,000,000, and we might have had some difficulty, because we had almost exhausted the appropriation, and we could not pay the money into the trust fund unless we had an appropriation for the purpose.",9
54,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Y a r r a ) [11.33] - I understand that this procedure has been followed from time to time. Is it not a fact that there was £3,000,000 in this fund?",9
55,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"That was taken out for old-age pensions, and the amount was supplemented from revenue from time to time.",9
56,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"What is the purpose of asking for power to pay in £10,000,000?",9
57,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Onl y to prevent us asking Parliament for these appropriations too often. I think that we had naid up to £5,000,000 on a previous occasion.",9
58,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,I understand that unless any balance is paid into a trust fund before the end of the financial year there is a possibility of it being claimed by the States in addition to the 25s. per head.,9
59,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"That question might be raised, but appropriations of this kind prevent that being done.",10
60,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"I remember that when Mr Fisher was Treasurer he proposed a similar appropriation, but I wish to be sure that there is to be no juggling with the funds, and that money shall not be taken out of it in order to make the finances appear to be in a better condition than they really are.",10
61,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,That cannot p6ssibly be done.,10
62,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"I think Mr Fisher originated this fund in order to utilize surplus revenue so that it need not be paid back to the States in addition to the 25s. per head, but I do not think the fund was started with an appropriation of £3,000,000. I cannot understand why the Treasurer wishes to appropriate £10,000,000, because we are not likely to have that amount of surplus revenue. On the contrary we are more likely to have a deficit.",10
63,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,That will not affect the fund.,10
64,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Of course, the old-age pensions would require to be paid whetheror not there was any money in the fund.",10
65,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"We take out of this fund as much money as we can for old-age pensions, and obtain the balance from revenue.",10
66,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,Parliamen t must appropriate money for the purposes of the old age pensions.,10
67,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,I do not think so. The old-age pensions must be paid whether we have this fund or not.,10
68,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Sectio n 53 of the valid and Old-Age Pensions Act says that the old-age pensions shall be paid out of "" moneys from time to time to be appropriated by Parliament for the purpose."" .",10
69,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"It is not necessary to have this trust fund at all, but it has been established for convenience in order that balances may be paid into it. - Mr TUDOR- I am anxious that the balances should go into this fund, to which I have no objection whatever. I have no desire that there shall be any leakage of money to the States in addition to the 2""5s. per head. What I desire to know is, firstly, why the appropriation is so large; and, secondly, whether the pensions would not be paid even if there were no fund in existence ?",10
70,Mr BRENNAN,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,How much money is required for pensions for one year?,10
71,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"We shall require £3,830,000 this year. If we had £3,000,000 in the fund we should only ask for £830,000 from revenue.",10
72,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Do we not appropriate a sum of money for old-age pensions every year, apart from this trust fund ? I think we should take as much as possible of the money required for pensions from revenue, and take only the balance required from this fund. I do not know whether it is pertinent to this Bill to ask whether the Treasurer is making provision that old-age pensioners who are in receipt of military pensions, as a result of the death of their sons, shall receive the f u ll pension under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions. Act ? In some cases old people have lost their old-age pensions, because they are obtaining other pensions through, the death of their sons.",10
73,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"That will be discussed under another Bill, which, when passed, will prevent the happenings to which the honourable member is referring.",10
74,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"I think these old people should receive their full pensions. A widow came to me this week, who had been in receipt of an old-age pension of 12s. 6d. per week. Through the death of her only son, who was her sole support, she is to receive a pension of £1 per week, and her old-age pension has been taken away from her.",10
75,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,Anothe r Bill on the notice-paper will prevent that being In- done.,10
76,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Capricornia) [11.43] I asked the Treasurer whether this Bill was necessary and he stated that it was, and that we cannot pay the old-age pensions without it.",10
77,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,We must have an appropriation.,10
78,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,Ah !,10
79,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,I will not allow the honourable member to talk to me like that. The manner of his remark would lead one to think that I have been saying something untrue ,10
80,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"I shall try to be very polite to the right honourable gentleman, because he is at all times a Chesterfield in debate, and sets such an excellent example to others. . The Treasurer suggested that the old-age pensions could not be paid without this Bill. Do I understand him to say now that it is not necessary to pass this Bill in order to pay the old-age pensions?",11
81,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,If we did not pass this Bil l we should have to pass another appropriation.,11
82,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"That interjection would indicate that we cannot pay the old-age pension unless this Bill or some other like it is passed. I should not like to call the Treasurer's methods juggling with the finances, because that would not be polite.",11
83,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,It would be near enough for the honourable member.,11
84,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"The Treasurer does not like my criticism, because he knows that it is merited.",11
85,The CHAIBMAN,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE," Order ! I ask both honourable members to avoid personalities, and to adhere to the Bill.",11
86,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"At page 2 of the Estimates there appears the line "" Balance brought forward from previous year for payment of invalid and old-age pensions, £2,102,177."" - That is the estimate for 1917-18. ""We passed a measure similar to this to provide for a Trust Fund of £3,000,000 for old-age pensions; but we did not use the whole of that amount, as we drew upon the Consolidated Bevenue for portion of our requirements, and conse, quently this balance of £2,102,177 waa brought forward. When we had surplus revenues such a measure as this was necessary in order to prevent their going to the States. We did not, of course, tell the States in those days what was our object in creating this fund. Had we done so the critics of the Federation no doubt would have drawn attention to the' fact that we had surplus revenue which ought to be distributed amongst the States, and that we had smothered up the fact by passing a Bill, under which we appropriated it for the creation of an Invalid and Old-age Pension Trust Fund. The position today, however, is quite different, and I contend that this Bill is unnecessary. _",11

94,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"I am merely drawing attention to the habits and customs of the , Treasurer.",11
95,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,The honourable member is a great authority!,11
96,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"I shall have something to say as to the action of the right honourable gentleman in floating a loan on the London market, as reported in today's papers, without telling the Commonwealth Parliament anything of his intentions. The Acts No. 22 of 1911, and No. 18 of 1912, were merely special appropriations for the payment of invalid and old age pensions, and this is only a proposal to enable the Treasurer to present hia balance-sheet in a more or less satisfactory way. It will enable him to refrain from showing the true position of the finances of the Commonwealth. It is really designed to meet his exigencies, and to enable him to juggle with the revenue. He has no £10,000,000 available to be taken out of revenue, and paid into this Trust Fund. If he has he should not be borrowing. The Treasurer will have his own way, since he has a majority behind him, but we have no right to make a needless addition to our statute-book, and to incur the expense of printing a Bill merely to suit the right honourable gentleman, and to lead the public to believe that he is cleverer than he really is.",11
97,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Darling Downs-Hon - orary Minister) [11.50] - I am informed by the Treasury that in previous years as much as £5,500,000 has been paid into the Invalid and Old-age Pension Trust Fund. This is technically an appropriation to provide for the payment of old-age pensions. A Trust Fund is created, and the requisite sum is paid into it . A beginning of the present financial year there was standing to the credit of this Trust Fund a sum of £1,700,000, but that amount has been reduced by subsequent demands made upon it . When this Bill is passed, money will again be paid out of revenue into the f u n d . At the end of each financial year, in order to preserve to the Commonwealth the balance existing, the surplus is paid into this Trust Fund to save distribution amongst the States under the Surplus Revenue Act . We have to preserve our right to any surplus revenue because provision has already been made for what was agreed to be an adequate distribution amoug the States.",12
98,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,But for that fact we could do without this measure.,12
99,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,Quite so. The object of the proposed .appropriation is also preserve any surplus revenue to this Comstanding monwealth Trust Fund.,12
100,Mr MATHEWS,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Melbourne Ports) during [11.52] - I fail to understand why the poses. Treasurer should propose to appropriate a sum of £10,000,000, seeing that a measure of this kind is brought forward nually, and that he is not likely to expend £10,000,000 on invalid and old-age penreported sions in any one year. Does he intend provide also for war pensions out of fund?",12
101,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,No . What objecfrom tion has the honourable member to this proposal ?,12
102,Mr MATHEWS,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"To one who is not very conversant with the facts, it would the Opposition. appear that the Treasurer contemplated using some of this money for purposes other than the payment of invalid and old-age pensions.",12
103,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,Not at all .,12
104,Mr MATHEWS,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"It is remarkable that he should propose to provide adjust £10,000,000 for this purpose in respect of a year in which the expenditure on invalid and old-age pensions is not likely to exceed £4,000,000.",12
105,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"We did not anticipate a surplus of more than £120,000 at the end of the last financial year, whereas we had a surplus of £2,000,000. How can we tell what we shall have at the end of the year?",12
106,Mr MATHEWS,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"At all events, if the Treasurer hopes to have a surplus of t the £10,000,000 at the end of the financial year I trust that he will not endeavour to secure it by reducing expenditure on public works, and combing out public employment.",12
107,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,This is a purely formal matter.,12
108,Mr MATHEWS,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"If the right honourable gentleman were in Opposition and such a proposal as this were brought forward, I think ho would say at once that there was no possibility of a surplus of £10,000,000 at the end of the financial year. I hope that this payment of £10,000,000 into a trust f u n d is not in tended as a nest-egg to be used for a purpose other than the payment of old-age pensions.",12

114,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"I am merely pointing out that the Treasurer, on 6th March last, showed how he had dealt with the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Trust Fund - His predecessor in office had left a balance of £3,000,000 in that fund , but in order to his finances and to show a surplus at the end of the year, the right honourable gentleman took that amount from the^trust f u n d",12

If honourable members look at the table page 11026 of the Hansard report, they sible wil l find that, while in 1915-16 the sum set down was £3,000,000, there is a blank for the year 1916-17. What find out is whether this money can be used as a kind of. shifting quantity, that when the finances are likely to show the same purpose. a deficit, the Treasurer may lay his hand on the accumulated funds, and, by transcustomary ferring them to genera] revenue, come out with a credit. That is what the Treasurer did with the £3,000,000 ; and we fore. have a right to ask whether a repetition of this procedure is likely. The surer has asserted that he does not in tend to do so.",13

138,Mr BRENNAN,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"I heard the Assistant Minister's address on the subject, and I do not think that it was at all conclusive. The nominal object as disclosed by. the B i ll itself has to do with the trusts set out in the A u d it Act . What are those trusts? It is theatrical on .the part of the Minister for the Navy to say that we are opposing invalid and old-age pensions. It is perfectly obvious that this money is not to be used for that purpose, and will not be required for it.",14
139,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,Who says that?,14
140,Mr BRENNAN,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"The very estimate itself, to which the Treasurer referred, shows that there is a balance brought forward from the previous year of £3,000,000, and the estimate for 1917-18 is £2,000,000 odd. It is not contended for a moment that this money is to be used this year or next year. The Bill provides that there shall be out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, for the purposes pf the Trust Account sstablished under the' Audi t Act, known as the Invalid and Old-age Pensions F u nd - a mere technical description of the fund-the sum of £10,000,000 for invalid and old-age pensions.",14

147,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,I can only say that I should be perfectly justified in doing so.,14

It is a reasonable request to be informed for what payable purposes this money is being appropriated, seeing that it is perfectly clear it cannot be used foT pensions. The payment of pensions does not depend on the passage of the Bill, and, therefore, we ought to know the object of the imeasure. Mr LAIBD SMIT H (Denison) [12.10] - It is not my intention to take up time on a formal measure of this kind. It appeals to me as one similar to that introduced by Mr Fisher, whom - I sat behind in 1914, for the purpose of , obtaining money for invalid and old age pensions. It - is a sad reflection to me to find honourable members, with whom I was associated so long, and who were the means of introducing old-age pensions, now taking such a course as may compel the Treasurer to withdraw the Bill, and thus deprive the pensioners of their rights. The attitude assumed by honourable members opposite is purely for party purposes. I should like to know if it is not a fact that not long ago we had the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) telling the people of Darwin that, if the present Government were returned to power, old-age pensions would be abolished; that was the fulcrum on which honourable members opposite placed their lever in their efforts to defeat their opponents.",14

The honourable member for Maribyrnong, who should know better, said that £3,000,000 had been taken out of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Fund and spent in other ways than the payment of invalid and old-age pensions. When addressing honourable members on the 6th March last I said,. referring to the total estimated war expenditure necessarily payable from ordinary revenueI t is intended to pay the whole £6,903,551 from revenue, and that is possible because, from the year 1915-16, there was brought forward .in amount of £3,000,000 ear-marked for the payment of invalid and old-age pensions, whioh, altogether, will cost £3,660,000 in 1916-17. The honourable member for Maribyrnong said that it was shown on page 11026 of the Hansard report of last Parliament that this £3,000,000 was spent in 1915-16. But how' was it spent ? This was my statement on the 6th March regarding it Provision made for payment of invalid and old-age pensions carried forward to next year, £3,000,000. Every one should know that money put into this Trust Fund cannot be spent except for the purposes of the fund. This year we carried to the fund £2,000,000 from a surplus which we did not anticipate. We do not know what may happen in the future; we may again have a surplus ; but it is wise to make this provision. Money is placed to the credit of the fund only as it"" is needed. If we placed to the decredit of the fund more money than was needed to pay old-age and invalid pensions, we should not be able to get it out without the authority of an Act of Parliament. The plan adopted is to estimate the sum that will be needed for invalid and old-age pensions, and to place on the Estimates an amount sufficient, in addition to that to the credit of the Trust Fund, to pay the commitments for the year. were enough in the f u n d to do that, no amount would be put on the Estimates.

196,Sir JOHN FOREEST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,It has everything to do with it . They cannot be paid with out the Bill . We must have an appropriation.,17

199,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"It is difficult to make One's remarks in anything like a smooth and connected way when subjected to these continuous interruptions from the Treasurer and the Assistant Minister for Defence, who is evidently brought here as a kind of lieutenant to help the Treasurer in bulldozing the Chamber.",18
200,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,Is that a parliamentary observation?,18
201,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"The word ""bulldozing"", has often puzzled me. I could not find it in any standard dictionary, but I am told that a bulldozer is an American machine for bending steel.",18
202,Sir JOHNFOEBEST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,I now know why I found a big dictionary in the Treasurer's offiee.,18
203,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"The Treasurer taunts me with having obtained a dictionary. When I went to the Treasury I had great difficulty in getting any quarters-ther e was no room for a Treasurer - and it was necessary, for me to get certain things which are required to enable the Treasurer to cany on his duties. Of course I found volumes of Shakespeare there, which the present Treasurer found it necessary to obtain in order to brighten his Budget speeches.",18

213,Mr SPEAKER,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,I ask the Treasurer fco withdraw that remark.,18

222,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"The Treasurer has told us that there is nothing in the Bill . The Acting Prime Minister said that if we debate i the will withdraw it. Therefore my original contention that we should not encumber the statute-book with Bills that are not necessary holds good. The so called National Win-the-war Government has pledged itself to economize, and not to spend public money unnecessarily, but when the Treasurer brings forward a Bill which he describes as superfluous, it is a waste of public money. He is taking up the time of the House, and wasting your time, Mr Speaker, in the reading of messages from the Governor General, and he is wasting public money by having these messages and so many copies of the Bill printed, and by .having so many copies of the measure afterwards bound in calf. Every pound of revenue we waste will in volve the borrowing of more money in London or elsewhere.",18

I know that on one occasion I was nearly suspended, but the broad minded view taken by the Speaker of the day made that course quite unnecessary.

I should, howdecline to ever, like-the Treasurer to explain why, having regard to our present financial difficulties, he asks for the appropriation of so huge a sum as £10,000,000.",20
249,Sir JOHN,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,FORREST - We are not going to pay the whole of that amount at once into the fund . It is only a f u n d to which contributions are to bo made.,20
250,Mr FINLAYSON,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"The f u n d was created as a sort of reservoir into which would flow the.surplus moneys of. the Commonwealth, and it was determined 34 that out of that reservoir would be drawn 9 the amounts necessary to pay invalid and old-age pensions. According to the Bud25 get papers, the expenditure on these pensions last'y.ear amounted to £3,518,987, ATES. and the estimated expenditure for the current year is £3,830,000, so that, allowing for the balance carried forward, £2,139,039, the Government will need £1,700,961 to meet its estimated liability in respect of the f u n d for the current year. That being so, and taking the Treasurer's own statement, with which' I cordially agree, that we should finance ourselves from year to year, and should not unnecessarily mortgage ourselves in respect of Watt, W. A. future expenditure, why does the right honourable gentleman ask for authority to pay £10,000,000 into this fund.",20
251,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"We shall need NOES. £4,000,000 next year. We may have a large balance to carry forward, but, as a matter of fact, I do not think we shall. If the honourable member objects to the largeness of the amount, let him move to reduce it .",20
252,Mr FINLAYSON,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"I am not prepared to do that. During this debate the statement has repeatedly been made, by honourable members opposite that any attempt to reduce it would be used as an argument that we were opposed to the payment of invalid and old-age pensions. If I were so to move, the Treasurer would not hesitate to charge me with being opposed to them. I suggest that the right honourable gentleman, who is the responsible financial authority, should tell us why he wants this £10,000,000. Obviously Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. It will be time enough next year, when we estimate our liability under this heading, to make the appropriation necessary to meet that liability. To meet a prospective liability, three years ahead, seems te ' me to be a system of finance entirely opposed to the generally careful financing of the Treasurer.",20
253,Mr LAIR DSMITH,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,We want to absolutely insure the payment of these pengest sions for the next three or four years.,21
254,Mr FINLAYSON,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"I am certain that, no matter what Government may be i power, their payment is absolutely assurplus. sured. It is not a cogent argument to suggest that the amount paid into the only Trust Fund cannot be used for anything else. The point that appeals to me that if for this purpose the Government appropriate £10,000,000 out of revenue they must necessarily have £10,000,000 less revenue to use on something else. Sir JOHN FORREST:-We do not propose present itself. to do that. This Bill merely authorizes a total appropriation of £10,000,000 to this Trust Fund. B y providing for such appropriation we shall avoid the necessity of coming back every year, and having a long debate on a requisition for a further appropriation. We are looking two three years ahead.",21

Under section 2 of the Freight Arrangements Act 1915, the Treasurer was authorized to charge cost and freight received in respect of Australian produce only. These transactions were to pass through the banking accountentitled, "" Commonwealth Treasurer-Freigh t Arrangements Account."" However, in order to make the best use of the vessels, particularly i those on voyages to Australia, it has been found essential to utilize them for carrying cargo other than Australian produce; and this B i ll gives the necessary authority to enable the cost and freight on such business to pass through the banking account named.",22
275,Mr TUDOH,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Does this refer only to freight which is carried in the vessels owned by the Commonwealth, or does it refer also to freight carried by vessels which are chartered by the Commonwealth ?",23
276,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"When we send vessels away we desire that they shall come back with cargo, which, of course, will not be Australian produce. We wish to treat all cargo alike, and pass it through the same account. I forgot to add that this Bill will also affect trade between Inter-State ports.",23
277,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Yarra) [2.42] - As the Treasurer says, this is a technical BilL and it is one which, bub for the 'war, would not have been called into existence. It was owing to the difficulty in obtaining freight to carry away the harvest of 1915 that the A ct was passed, and I understand that this Bill is to amend that Act.",23
278,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,That is so.,23
279,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"I presume that the Bill will apply to the fifteen steamers purchased by the Prime Minister for the Commonwealth, and also to other steamers. The honourable member Henty (Mr Boyd) on a previous sion drew attention to the fact thab the Commonwealth at the time is compelling all freight to be ther powers? chartered through Government charterers. He and others have found faul t with present arrangement whereby all the freight business has to go through hands of the two firms that act as agents for the Government. These two firms position to be made plain. may be the most honourable in the world, but it may, nevertheless, not be advisable for us to concentrate the whole of [55] freight business in the way in which it is now concentrated. I have no objection to the systematizing of shipping by giving the control of it wholly to the Government, with a view to making the best of what freight is offering. We all hope that the time may soon come when freight will be looking for tonnage instead of tonnage looking for freight, which is the present state of affairs.",23

Was that statement correct? If so, is the agent acting on commission or is he paid a salary?",24
287,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Swan-Trea surer) [2:55] - The Bill does not affect the arrangementsfor management of the Commonwealth fleet; it is merely to meet a requirement of the Audit Act.

289,Mr ARCHIBALD,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Hindmarsh) [2.57] - I understand that the Bill which is to be introduced will practically give the Government full command of the shipping in this part of the world. Honourable members generally must be of the opiuion that a mistake was made when the British authorities did not, at the commencement of the war, commandeer all vessels then under the British Flag. The principal Act provides only for arrangements for freight on Australian produce, but the amendment will enable arrangements to be made for freight on other produce.",24
290,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,The Bill is needed to get over a technical difficulty.,24
291,Mr ARCHIBALD,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"It is well to get parliamentary authority for administrative action wherever that is possible. I do not censure the Government for what is being done, because I think that Ministers have been justified by the circumstances of the case. .The honourable member for Melbourne Ports, although he did not say so, seems to think that if the vessels purchased by the Prime Minister do not confine their voyages to Australian and British ports, they will not do what they were bought to do. Those who know anything about shipping know that it would not pay to send vessels here in ballast. That would not help our producers. To make shipping pay, it is necessary to get cargoes both ways, and, therefore, - these vessels have sometimes to be sent from the Old Country to America to get cargo for Australia. The honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd) appears to think that it is not wise that the Government should have the whole control of freight arrangements of Australia.",24
292,Mr BOYD,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Whil e I have no objection to the Government having control, I consider that that control should not shut out the any vessels that might be brought here by private owners, for the purpose of taking r away Australian cargoes.",24
293,Mr ARCHIBALD,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"I do not know what the position of the Australian producer or merchant would be if the arrangement of shipping had been left entirely in the hands of private individuals. The fact that the British authorities have practically all vessels sailing under the British flag under control has compelled us to follow suit, but I do not know that any great harm would happen if the Government should assist or take cognisance of any person who could get freight on his own account. No doubt the powers of monopoly that the Government are exercising do impinge upon our preconceived notions of the individual's rights, but we have Hobson's choice in the matter. The logic of facts, as Napoleon III . said, has been the guiding principle. The situation today is such that we have to exercise this monopoly, even to the extent of preventing any merchant from chartering a vessel on his own. Therefore, I do not see that any harm will follow our agreeing to the motion. It is but a logical conclusion of the Act that we have already passed.",24
294,Dr MALONEY,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Melbourne) l""3.3] This is the first opportunity we have had since 1915 of discussing the question of freights and shipping. I agree with honourable members that we have very little, information with regard to the vessels that were bought, except the scant paragraphs that one occasionally sees in the newspapers. I do not suppose that any honourable member knows how many .of these ships have visited Australia, or how many have been here on a second trip. No one will argue that the vessels should be permitted to come out here in ballast. People connected with shipping are very anxious to know if any commission has been paid on the purchase of these steamers. Under a previous Government various commissions were sought from the Navy Department, but, to the honour the Department, it must be said that these were checked, and not allowed to paid. There is a State Act which vents the payment of secret commissions. I wonld make it a criminal able, not by a fine, but by imprisonment, to take a secret commission. In regard to the matter of freights, the only shipmember owners who did not raise their freights at the outbreak of the war were the Western Australian Government.",24
295,Mr COBSEB,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,They lost money on their vessels.,25
296,Dr MALONEY,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"The latest returns show that a profit was made, but the matter must be regarded, not from the point of view of making a profit from vessels, but from the point of view saving to the public. Ask any one on the western coast of Australia will agree to giving up these vessels. The Western Australian Government dare not shut down on this venture. that the Prime Minister is the. only person who knows whether any commisbran sion was paid on the purchase of ithe monwealfch vessels. I do not believe he has told any member of his Cabinet or any honourable member opposite.",25
297,Mr BOYD,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"I think the Prime Minister made the public statement that a mission was paid to the brokers who bought the ships for us. I am not "" of the amount, but I fancy that it was £15,000.",25
298,Dr MALONEY,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"I would be very grateful if I could learn that that the amount of the commission paid, cause I am continually being asked men in the shipping trade what was amount. I have not yet met one them but he has said that a commission - was paid. I have no objection payment of any commission, bufc I do object to the payment of secret commisthe sions.",25
299,Mr ARCHIBALD,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"What does the hondanger, orable member know about secret comcarious, missions? If he knows anything, does he not bring it forward?",25
300,Dr MALONEY,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"I can back all I have that the honourable member money in his pocket, but I would not go into a witness-box and swear it . If there are no such things as secret commissions, why did the Victorian Government bring - in a Bill to deal with them ? No one can of point a finger at Messrs. Gibbs, Bright, and Company, or Messrs. Elder, Smith, be and Company, but it is not fair that these prefirms should be singled out from others equally honest, equally trustworthy, and offence punishequally business like. Sin JOHN FORREST - The honourable made no complaint in referencefco this matter when he was supporting the Government that effected the purchase.",25
301,Dr MALONEY,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Perhaps I did not have the opportunity of doing so. I have a suggestion to offer, that is, fco change our wheat into flour, and thus use two vessels in the place of three, because two shiploads of flour are equal to three shipthe loads of wheat; and to ship our flour to of the America, 'because two voyages can be made to America in the time taken to send whether he wheat to France or England.",25
302,Mr BOYD,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,And we would be keeping I believe the bran and pollard here.,25
303,Dr MALONEY,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"B y keeping the and pollard here we would be conComferring a greaf'benefit on our producers, that our poultry farmers, and our cattle raisers. As the' Pacific is free from submarines and other enemy vessels, it is practically safe so far as human beings can make it . Another benefit accruing comto Australia by carrying out my suggestion would be the large employment that sure would be afforded to people in every State The mills would be working full time. We should be able .to make an arrangement with America to ship one bag was of flour from her east coast to England befor every two bags that we land on her by west coast. While we have more wheat the on our hands than we need, America has of less than she needs. If necessary, our troops could also be carried in the vessels to the taking our flour to America. We know that mines have been laid as far south, in Atlantic as the Cape of Good Hope, that the Suez Canal route is dangerous, that the Mediterranean Sea is full of that the Gibraltar passage is preand that the Channel cannot be why protected as we would wish. Therefore, let us grist our wheat, and send that it across thePacific to America, has and save one ship in every three. 0 If we also send our soldiers by the Sydney-San Francisco route the combined fleets of the Allies and America need only protect the seaway from America to Erance. They can concentrate their ships of war between America and France in order to prevent submarine attacks on our shipping. We know that England, the heart of the Empire, is suffering from shortage of food, and if we can do anything to lessen the strain, it is our duty to do it.",25
304,Mr BOYD,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Henty) [3.15] - The Leader of the Opposition referred to a question I asked of the Prime Minister the other day with regard to the shifting of wheat from our shores. At present the whole of the cargoes of wheat are under the control of Elder, Smith & Co., and Gibbs, Bright & Co., and no freight arrangements can be made except through those firms. A firm in Sydney, on my advice, made application to the Government for permission to transfer a cargo of 6,000 tons of wheat to San Francisco, and the reply received by the firm from the Wheat Board was- In reply to your letter of even date, I regret to inform you that this Board cannot quote wheat f.o.b. for the Pacific coast, as desired by you. I suggest that you get into touch with the chartering agents, Messrs. Elder, Smith ft Co. L t d . , and Messrs. Gibbs, Bright ft Co., with a view to arranging a charter of the vessel referred to by you to the Wheat Board.' Our object today should be to get rid of the wheat we have in Australia.",26
305,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE," I am afraid that the honourable member is going beyond the scope of the Bill, the object of which is to allow Australian ships to carry other than Australian produce.",26
306,Mr BOYD,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"And that involves payment to the chartering agents at so much per ton. I am referring to a distinct offer to carry Australian produce to the Pacific coast. Yet the Government regulations have so tied up the freight question that no person can bring vessels to Australia to load wheat unless those vessels are chartered to the Government agents. Naturally, a firm says, "" We are not going to transfer our charter to the Wheat Board, because, if we do that, the Wheat Board may put the vessel into competition with the business of the owner."" The owner of the vessel in question is one of the biggest millers on the Pacific coast, and he desires to get Australian wheat for milling ""at San Francisco.",26
307,Mr ARCHIBALD,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,Is not that vessel under the American flag?,26
308,Mr BOYD,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,I believe it is. ' The Wheat Board says that the vessel must be transferred to the agents who control all wheat charters.,26
309,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,Do you think the owner will'do that?,26
310,Mr BOYD,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,Of course he will not. But the Government ought to allow any vessel that will come to Australia to carry away our wheat.,26
311,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"I moved the adjournment of the House two years ago on that question, and nobody supported me.",26
312,Mr BOYD,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,Perhaps the honourable member did not succeed in making his case clear to the House on that occasion. Perhaps if I read the correspondence I have received on this subject it may state the case more clearly to honourable members.,26
313,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,Does not the wheat belong to the British Government!,26
314,Mr BOYD,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,A lot of the wheat in Australia does hot belong to the British Government.,26
315,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,All that is to be exported belongs to the British Government.,26
316,Mr BOYD,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"We have sold to the British Government only a' definite quantity of wheat. The letter I refer to is as follows:DEAR MB . BOYD, As requested, we herewith give you the full particulars of our request to the Government « for a quotation for milling wheat f.o.b. Sydney or Melbourne (at the Government's option), and the result thereof. Our firm are representing one of the biggest milling concerns on the Pacific coast of the United States of America. About two weeks ago they cabled us for a quotation for 6.000 tons of milling wheat f.o.b. Sydney or Melbourne, one port of loading, the buyers to supply the steamer. We applied to the Australian Wheat Board for a quotation, and we were refused. We asked' for the reason of the refusal, which they also refused to give. We herewith hand you copies of letters that have passed between the Australian Wheat Board and ourselves. We also jrive you herewith copy of the cable received from America. The following are the details of the situation as it apparently affects the Government, and as it does affect ourselves and the community generally:Government policy - It seems that the Government's policy is to control all freight for the carriage of wheat to the United States of America or elsewhere, through their chartering agents, Messrs. Gibbs, Bright, and Company and Elder, Smith, and Company Limited, also that the sale of all wheat carried by the Government shall be sold through the sole agents of the Government appointed in San Franciso (Balfour, Guthrie, and Company). To show you the fallacy of this, the Government chartering agents cannot rule all freight between Australia and America for the carriage of wheat, for the reason that our American clients will not transfer the vessel to the Government chartering agents, and they are right in refusing to do so, because if they agreed to transfer the vessel which they hold at present to the Government chartering agents there is no guarantee-and the Government will not guarantee-that the cargo of such vessel would be sold solely to them. Therefore, what is the use of their transferring the vessel? It would be absolute folly on their part to transfer freight which they command to the Government, who might possibly sell the wheat by such vessel to their competitors in America. This is absolute proof in itself of one very great ness in the Government scheme. It is just possible that our clients are the owners of the vessel, although we cannot vouch for it, or, on the other hand, they may have it on time eharter. This will, therefore, show you clearly that we even could, not recommend to OUT clients to transfer such vessel to the Government chartershorter. ing agents. On the other hand, we contend that so as wo can prove to the Government that wheat is for a eompany composed wholly of American citizens, who are now citizens country allied with Great Britain, that there next crop is harvested. should be no objection to quoting us f.o.b. Sydney or Melbourne, as requested by our clients. It would be of the greatest benefit to the Commonwealth generally. If we could get an outlet for wheat, is at present rotting in Australia, and not making this latter statement without absolute knowledge, we would be very pleased take some members of the Government to some of the stacks lying in New South Wales, and them see the deplorable condition is heart-breaking to see the wheat lying here being riddled with weevil while we have means of shifting It at a very attractive figure to America, and at the same time such outlet is Co., this morning. blocked simply through, we think, the stubbornunder ness of the Government chartering agents endeavouring to hold to a policy which is practicable. If you can possibly shift the Prime Minister from his determination to stick to the present scheme, and induce him to allow ns, or any other firm that has the freight, to receive quotation for wheat f.o.b. Sydney or Melbourne, or whatever loading point the Government sire, we are confident you would earn the everlasting^thanks of the Commonwealth and of pen in this case. the wheat shippers generally, and we make remark knowing that we are backed up here some of the biggest exporting houses. From our stand-point,, there is only one man any. who can alter this at the present time, and that is the Prime Minister. We would like to have your views on the matter.",26
317,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,Has the honourable member interviewed the Prime Minister on the subject?,27
318,Mr BOYD,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"I spoke to the Prime Minister about it , and he said that if this man could send the ship here, he was quite entitled to a commission, and that the Government were prepared to make! the necessarjy arrangements. That, however, is not the point - The point is that if he transfers his vessel to the Government chartering agents, they may load her up for some other firm. This merchant requires the wheat to mill in his own mill in San Francisco. He will benefit us by buying our wheat and sending his own steamer for it , and, that being so, what is in the way of the Government giving him a charter and alweak- lowing him to bring as many vessels as he can to remove our wheat?",27
319,Mr MATHEWS,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,Would not the shipowner make more money by carrying the wheat to America instead of to Great Britain ?,27
320,Mr BOYD,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Yes ; the distance is This, however, is not an 'Australian ship. The main point I wish to long urge is that we should avail ourselves of the every means of removing our wheat and of a putting it into .consumption before the Anything that will help in that direction ought to be encouraged. We should not stand rigidly by the law passed some two years ago, which and which created a monopoly, as if it we are were a law of the Medes and Persians:",27
321,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,Does the honourable to member wish to make the point that the let sole chartering agents will not forego of same. It their rights ?,27
322,Mr BOYD,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"No . I spoke to Mr . the Bright, of Messrs. Gibbs, Bright, and He told me that the agreement they received 4d. a in ton on all freight shipped, so that it did imuot matter to his firm whether this vessel was brtought here car not. H is only point of difference with me was that he did not think the vessel would materialize. a He said he had heard of other vessels that were coming here, but which had denever arrived. That might possibly hapI understood Mr . this Gibbs to say, however, that his firm had by no objection to any vessels coming here.",27
323,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,They should not have,27
324,Mr BOYD,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"I believe they have none, but an assurance ought to be given to this man, who is prepared to send his vessel here, that he can obtain the freight he wants, and that he need have no doubt in his mind as to his being required to transfer it to the Wheat Board. The firm to which I have referred are quite satisfied to buy the wheat through the Wheat Board. According to their letter they applied to the Board for a cargo, f,o.b. Melbourne or Sydney, and were refused. They were told that the owner of this vessel would have to re-charter it to the Government chartering agents Mr Rodgers , - A proclamation has been issued that no vessel will be given clearance unless it is chartered by the Government agents.",27
325,Mr BOYD,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,That ought to be altered. I do not know whether we can remedy the position under this Bill .,28
326,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Is it not a fact that the price of all wheat for oversea is 5s. 9d. per bushel f.o.b., no matter going ?",28
327,Mr BOYD,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"I do not think so. am informed by a wheat shipper that freight is. while we are sending wheat to the East at 5s. 8d. per bushel f.o.b. we are sendare ing wheat to South A f r i ca at 6s. per bushel f.o.b., a difference of 8d. bushel in favour of the foreigner as ships. against our own people. I do not know whether that is so or not.",28
328,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,^Usuall y there are three prices quoted in the newspapers.,28
329,Mr BOYD,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"I do not attach much importance to the wheat quotations given in the newspapers. My purpose will been served if I have impressed upon the Government the necessity of so amendor ing the method of controlling the export of wheat through the Government agents as to enable us to loosen the strings the direction I have indicated. I do not want to abolish Government control over the shipping, but , at the same time, I per ton. should so amend the regulations that any man may be at liberty to bring a ship here secure , in the knowledge that he can obtain a cargo of wheat and carry it away to his own mills, whether they be in San Francisco or in any part of the pire. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended, and restatement solution adopted. Ordered That Sir John Porrest and Mr Groom do prepare and bring in a Bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. Bill presented by » Sir JOH N FOBBEST, and read a first time. SECOND READING.

330,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Yarra) [3.31] - Eve r since the Government entered into an arrangement for the carriage of our a wheat oversea, it has been impossible to ascertain what is the rate per ton for such freight. If there is any reason why such information should be kept secret, the Parliament should know if .",28
331,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Most of our wheat is being sent away in ships requisitioned by Great Britain , and not in ships chartered where it is by the Wheat Pool.",28
332,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Eve n in the case of 1 those vessels we do not know what the .,",28
333,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"So far as we concerned the price paid for the 4d. 3,500,000 tons, of wheat is f.o.b. The per Imperial Government have to find the",28
334,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Quite so. Prior to that no wheat was paid for f.o.b. This Parliament has a right to know what is the cost of the carriage of our wheat oversea. It must not be forgotten that, in addition to the 3,50t),000 tons to which reference has just been made, a further have 2,500,000 tons will be available when the present crop is harvested some f o u r ' five months hence. The rates paid for the carriage of wheat oversea prior to the war are well known to honi n orable members. Wheat was then carried oversea for 5d., 6d., or 7d. per bushel. The rates ranged from about 13s. to £ 1",28
335,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,The rate had not been under 25s. within two years of the war.,28
336,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"It was under 25s. after Emthe war had actually broken out. Ships were then available, bu t we had no^goods to send away. I do not wish to delay the passing of this Bill , but I think we are entitled to have from the. Government a as to what we have been paying in the way of freights on our wheat.",28
337,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Before the British Government bought, or since? Mr TTJDOB, - Fro m the sending of'the 1915 harvest. If I were the representative of a country district, I should want to know from the Wheat Pool what they were paying to the shipping agents for freight overseas.",29
338,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"I asked for a retiurn of* the freights paid, and the Government's answer was that it was not in the best in terests of the country to make the information public.",29
339,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"I cannot see that tnat applies. If the British Government are going to find the freight! in the future, it , does not matter to them what has been paid in the past. When I was Minister for Trade and Customs, we got freight through the Department for about 90s. a ton from Australia, when 150s. a ton was being paid from the Argentine. What I complain about! is the enormous rise that has been charged in freights by the British ship-owner. I agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr . Archibald) that had the British Government taken over the whole of the shipping at the outbreak of the war, they would have served the British Empire well. In not doing so, tihey made one of the biggest blunders possible. At the outbreak of the war, steel steam-ships could be launched at a cost of £ 8 per ton. To day j they could not be bought, even with the - two or three years of age upon them, ati less than from £ 6 0 to £ 7 0 per ton, and ship-owners today say they expect the cost to increase up to £100 per ton. Mr . Bonar Law stated in the House of Commons that where he had invested a sum of about £8,000 in fifteen shipping companies, it had returned to him £7,352 in two years, after paying war profits taxation and insurance to replace submarined vessels. These are the people who have been robbing the farmers at this end of the world, and the consumers at the other.",29
340,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,What is the use of railMinister ing at somebody beyond your dominions?,29
341,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,We have a right to know what is being paid to the oversea ship-owner.,29
342,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,But we sold wheat at a certain price.,29
343,Mr TUDQR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,Yes .,29
344,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,Then what does it matter what has to be paid freight?,29
345,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"As regards all the wheat sent from the 1915 and 1916 harvests, and all that will , be sent away up to the end of this year, the more that is paid for freight the less there will be for the person producing the wheat at this end.",29
346,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,Then cannot we find out the freight ?,29
347,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,I have asked for that information.,29
348,Sir JOH NFORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,I shall be glad to get it . I shall make a note of it .,29
349,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"In the early stages of the war, I had a good deal to do with shipping, and the gravest possible complaints were made that neutral vessels cominghere would not take wheat, but preferred to take coal to South America from here. Where you could buy a brand-new ship at £ 8 per ton, they were getting £ 2 0 a ton for the round trip from Great Britain to Puget Sound. Producers here have a righ t to know what has been paid for the freight on the article they produce, when iti is taken overseas. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

Clause agreed to. B i ll reported without amendment; refor ithe port adopted. Bill read a third time. - SUGAR PURCHASEBILL . In Committee (Consideration of Governor General's message):",29
355,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Swan-Trea surer) [3.44] - I move That it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a Bill for an Act to amend the Sugar Purchase Act 1915. This is a very small matter. The Act; of 1915 authorized the Treasurer to borrow money from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia for the purchase of sugar and the payment of Customs duty on sugar imported. The money was to be kept in an account called the "" Commonwealth Treasurer's Sugar Account,"" in the Bank, and the net amount to be borrowed by the Treasurer, after crediting to the account receipts in respect of the sale of sugar, was to be limited to 6£500,000. The Act mentioned empowers the Commonwealth Bank of Australia to charge interest ati the rate of 5 per cent, per annum when the debit balance of the account exceeds the amount at credit of the Commonwealth Public Account and the Commonwealth Departmental Accounts. The Bank has charged interest on the - verdraft without regard to the amount at the credit of the Commonwealth Public Account and the Departmental Advance Accounts, but such interest was immediately paid to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The present Bill legalizes this course The result is 'that the sugar business is charged with interest, which goes into.the Consolidated Revenue of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth Treasury found the money, and, of course, is entitled to the interest. The Bank, therefore, charges the sugar business with the interest, which goes into the Consolidated Revenue. That is the sole object of the Bill.",30
356,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Yarra) [3.46] -^The Pall, I understand, is for a certain purpose in relation to the interest, but there are one or two points in connection with the purchase of sugar which I think the House should have an opportunity to disouss; and this is the first opportunity presented. It will be_ remembered that in the closing days of the last Parliament the Prime Minister announced in the House that he had handed over to the Queensland growers £500,000;",30
357,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,Not handed over.,30
358,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Well , he made available to the sugar-growers of Queensland £500,000 in that financial year. This transaction was not carried out by the  I believe, oppose such a proposal, but by the present Treasurer.",30
359,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"We did not hand it over-w e did not charge it . We got £500,000 last year, but we shall get nothing this year.",30
360,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"I understand that when the sugar was sold to the public at 3^d. per l b . , there was a net profit of £500,000. The growers of Queensland took exception to the Dickson award, with which they said they could not comply unless they were paid an extra amount. The adjournment of the House was moved by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) for the purpose of ascertaining how the matter stood, and the Prime Minister announced that it was intended to make available to the farmers the £500,000 profit which had been made on the sale of the sugar. I took exception to this action at the time; indeed, honourable members on both sides took exception to it ; and I wish to know whether, under this Bill , the Treasurer will be empowered to charge the people of Australia more for their sugar than they ought to pay, and to hand over to the growers another £500,000, or a similar sum ?",30
361,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"The Common- wealth makes the sugar industry pay the interest, as ib ought to.",30
362,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"I agree as to that, but I think this a proper time to raise the other question.",30
363,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"As I said, we got £500,000 last year, but we will get nothing this year.",30
364,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,Because you have in creased the rate.,30
365,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,Not bo the public.,30
366,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,No ; but you are giving the grower more.,30
367,Mr BAMFORD,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,Surely the Leader of the Opposition does not object to the ' worker getting higher wages ?,30
368,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"It is not the workers who are getting the advantage. The Dickson award was given on the conditions then existing, and, after that, the Commonwealth made the present to the growers.",30
369,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Unde r the Dickson award, the industry could not exist.",30
370,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"I remember a deputation telling the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Chapman), when ha was Minister for Trade and Customsand the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Sinclair) was one of that deputation-that the industry could not pay the award of 4^d. per hour which the M in ister had made.",30
371,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,That is quite a mistake.,31
372,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"It is not a mistake ; the deputation did say that. I also remember that, on the occasion of every increase of wages, deputations have declared that the industry would be ruined,",31
373,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"In the case of the Dickson award, the Treasurer of Queensland himself admitted that the industry could not exist under it .",31
374,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"I do nob blame any Treasurer for doing his best for his State; but I do object to the Commonwealth handing over £500,000 to the growers at the expense of the consumers of the Commonwealth.",31
375,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"When money was transferred, was« there not a condition that the price should not be raised to the consumer 1",31
376,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"The Government absomake lutely controlled the price; and if growers are not content with £500,000, and wish to make additional profits out of the consumer, they are reasonable.",31
377,Mr CORSER,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Where was the £500,000 obtained ?",31
378,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,It was obtained by might charging the people of Australia more for their sugar than they ought to pay.,31

However, in the last hours of a dying 'Parliament, the Prime Minister announced that this money to be handed over to the growers; and honourable members behind the Governdo ment were as keenly opposed to this as were honourable members on this side.",31
381,Mr CORSER,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Wide Bay) [3.54] - 1 cannot understand the attack made by the Leader of the Opposition on this in dustry. In the first place, the statement that the Government handed £500,000 back to the growers is nob in accordance with fact; it went into the Consolidated [56] Revenue. Nothing was handed back, b ut at the eleventh hour the present Government have contrived to rectify an in justice, done by the late Government to the sugar industry. Because there was more political influence at the back of those interested in wheat, minerals, f r u it , and wool, they were allowed to sell at a higher price than ever before, and not one fraction of the profit went into the Consolidated Revenue. Queensland has not very many representatives, and, unfortunately, honourable members generally know very little about the sugar industry, although it is their duty to study it ; and the result is that the late Government have robbed that industry of over £1,000,000-no t £500,000. Why should any distinction be made between one class of producers and another ? If it was just to take £1,000,000 from the producers of sugar in Queensland, it would be equally jusb to take something that from the producers in the southern States of wheat, minerals, f r u it , wool, meat, and ot^her products. I never could, understand why this Parliament should fish of one and flesh of another. The the action taken was very nearly.the means the of closing practically the only industry which can be carried on on the great unnorth-eastern seaboard of Queensland in such a way as to justify the Commonwealth and the Empire holding that part of Australia against other nations who desire to occupy that territory for their surplus population. Instead of criticising the Government, for trying even at the eleventh hour to do justice to the sugar industry, which, for many reasons, is vital to the defence of the Comand monwealth, honourable members should applaud them. The action taken by the Government very nearly resulted in half the sugar-growers of Queensland Revenue going out of the industry.",31
382,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,We have heaTd that tale was for the last sixteen years.,31
383,Mr CORSER,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"If honourable members not heed it they will go on in the same direction until they have ruined the sugar industry - When, by following that course of action, they find the north of Queensland occupied by a coloured popu- lation, they will begin to understand who were really the friends of the White Australia policy. The action of the late Government was not in the interests of that policy, but quite the reverse. The only way in which the policy can be maintained is to keep the sugar industry alive as a. white man's industry. I should like remind honourable members that in one district of Queensland today 50 per of the sugar-growers are Italians ",31

I should like matter under notice. to have information with respect to the whole of the transactions connected with the sugar deal. So far we have been suptrade plied with very little information regardferential ing it . We do not know how it has been conducted, or exactly how things stand. We do know that an amount of some £500,000 is at stake.",32

390,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"I do not think do not wish to reflect upon the Temporary Chairman's ruling, but I may say that many honourable members were allowed more latitude in dealing with this quesprice tion than was allowed to the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser). The Government control the price of sugar Australia today, and, that being so, want to know why certain purchasers sugar are treated differently from others.",32
391,Sir JOHNFORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,I do not know.,32
392,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,That is just what honto orable members ought to know. They should be informed why the Colonial Sugar cent: Refining Company have been permitted to enforce an iniquitous rule by which a rebate is allowed to certain of their cusis attomers and refused to others.,32

394,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"We have information I that firms purchasing as much as from the £80,000 up to £100,000 worth of sugar per annum are allowed by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company but a very I limited rebate, whilst other firms purchasing not nearly so much are allowed out a rebate of 6 per cent., because they and happen to.be old customers of the comI have received complaints on this matter from firms in a very large When the Government undertake to fix the price of an article should see that these iniquitous trade customs are not used to prevent all purat chasers being placed on the same footing.",32

396,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"I have been told that ' what is done is in accordance with an old custom, but I contend that this diftreatment of purchasers of sugar should not be allowed to continue. As a matter of fact, instead of the Government controlling the price df sugar and the conditions under which it may be purchased, Mr Knox, of the Colonial with Sugar Refining Company, still practically controls the whole business.",32
397,Mr CORSER,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Thes e large purchases are for cash, and delivery is extended over n regard to eight or nine months.",32
398,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"The honourable member must be aware that rebates are made to old customers of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, whilst newer customers, so. I even though they are purchasers of greater quantities, have not the same privilege extended to them. I repeat that when the Government attempt to fix the of any commodity they should see that all trading in it are treated in the same way. The whole of the details coni n nected with the sugar' deal should be I made known to honourable members, and of I was hoping that, as we are now considering a measure dealing with sugar, they - would be fully explained, 'and we sliould be told what has become of the £500,000. Are the growers getting the whcla of this money, or are some of the rich millers, including the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, getting some of it.",32
399,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"The matter was fixed up by arbitration, by the Board fixing cane prices, between the miller and grower-.",33
400,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Then it is clear that the miller participates in the £500,000 as well aa the grower, and some of the biggest mills in Queensland are owned by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. It would appear that once more Commonwealth funds are being used to grease the fat pig.",33

In Committee (Oonsideration of Governor General's message):",33
411,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Swan-Trea surer) [4.10] - I move That it is expedient that an appropriation nf revenue and moneys be made 'for the purposes of a Bill for an Act to amend the War Loan pro- (United Kingdom) Act 1914-1916 and the War Loan (United Kingdom) Act 1915-1916. The Bill is purely formal. What is asked to be done is already being done, .but not in a legal manner. The War Loan Act of 1914 authorized a loan of £18,000,000, and the War Loan Act No. 2 a loan of £6,500,000, in the United King-, dom for war purposes. All such moneys were to be paid into the Consolidated Bevenue Fund. The money borrowed from the Imperial Government prior to the 30th . June, 1915-£14,100,000-wa s so paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Later it was decided that it would be better to pay what remained into the Loan down Fund, and the War Loan Act (United Kingdom) No. 1, 1916,' directed that the balance, namely, £10*400,000, should .paid into the Loan Pund. The amount paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund -£14,100,00 0 - was appropriated Parliament in the ordinary revenue mates, and the necessity for providing that the £10,400,000 should be paid into the Loan Fund was overlooked at the time, but not by me. The Bill , therefore, makes the necessary appropriation from the Loan Fund. The purpose Bill is' merely to put the transaction a proper footing.",33

In Committee (Consideration of vernor-General's message): Sir ' JOHN FORREST (Swan-Trea surer) [4.16] - I move That it is expedient that an appropriation revenue be made for the purposes of an Act to amend sections 4 and 22 of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act 1908-1916. The Bill gives a concession to receiving military pensions and allowbrought ances who are also the holders of old-age pensions. The definition of ""income,"" section 4 of the Invalid and Old-age sions Act necessitates allotments soldiers' and sailors' pay being regarded in some cases as income, and this affects the rate of the old-age pensions. Bill provides that these allotments - not in any way interfere with the of old-age and invalid pensions. It proposed to amend the clause so that sions granted to the dependants of soldiers shall not affect the old-age or invalid sions held by them. If the dependant ' m. cOldier has or applies for an old-age or invalid pension, any war pension that proposed. he or she may be in receipt of will not interfere in any way with the amount of that pension. Under the Act , parents who are adequately maintained by sons at the war are not entitled to invalid pensions, but the Bill removes this bar to the granting of such pensions.",34

A dozen ormore cases Estihave come within my notice during the last month in which old-age pensioners have had their pensions reduced upon the death of their sons killed on active service abroad. This is a scandal, and I am glad that the Treasurer is putting an end to of the it . I think it would have been righted on by any man occupying his position.",34
414,Mr FOWLER,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"Perth) [4.20] - I con- I do gratulate the Treasurer on proposing in these very necessary amendments of the diffiInvali d and Old-age Pensions Act . I that I was the first to draw attention to the disabilities which the Bill is designed to remove. One or two cases came before me, and when I mentioned last March, the Treasurer promised BILL- to have them rectified. Honourable members generally recognise that it is a serious Godefect of the existing law that a widow, supported by an only son, has her old- age pension reduced by the amount of the war pension she gets should he be killed of on active service. I am glad that this a - Bill for disability has been removed.  persons compliment the Treasurer on having forward the Bill , which is p r o bably the most humane piece of legislai n tion that we shall pass this session, and Penthe sooner it becomes law the better. One of or two honourable members on this side have taken a keen interest in the matter, and as they are not now present, it is The only fair to mention their names. As shall the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr rates Maloney) would say, a small ""meed of is praise "" should be given to the honourable penmembers for Hunter (Mr Charlton) and Newcastle (Mr Watkins) for what they penhave done in this matter.

Most of them are of a technical nature, and only two may be held to have substance in them. The first may be regarded by some as being worthy of consideration.",35
416,Mr KICHAKO FOSTEB,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,This is a distinct breach of faith. The Government made an agreement in regard to the business to be taken today.,35
417,Mr WATT,QUEENSLAND INSURANCE,"I know of no agreement. Clause 12 provides that the Minister may remove any Commissioner from office on an address praying for his removal 'being presented to the Governor General by the Senate and the House of Representatives in any one session, or iby the Bouse of Representatives alone in two consecutive sessions. The Senate has deleted the words "" or Iby the Bouse of Representatives alone in .two consecutive sessions thereof"" and the following words. effect of their amendment is that an address for the removal of the Commissioner must fee passed by both Houses..

When we were dealing with the Bill in Committee, honourable members brought forward the case of men who were serving on ships of war on our coasts, and were ordered out on active service. The first amendment has been made so that the men who are serving in the Navy shall be in the same position as those who enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force, and did not go to the Front. The next amendment deals with the question of accepting the certificate of a university, or other examining body. The Senate has added the words "" in any part of the British Dominions."" The third amendment deals with the question of temporary The employment. The provision was criticized, and I promised to reconsider it ; and, as a result, an amendment has been made in another place, the effect of whioh is that, if a report is given by the permanent head of a Department in which a returned soldier has been employed for six months on temporary work, stating that he has performed his duties satisfactorily, the period of his employment may be extended from time . to time by the Commissioner for such periods as ha thinks fit. - Motion agreed to.
