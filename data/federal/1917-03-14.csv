1,Mr RICHARD,Unknown,"FOSTER - As probably not 10 per cent, of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth understand the in tricacies of the present method of assessTrade ment, will the Treasurer suggest to the Conference now sitting in Melbourne, toms Tariff? that it might consider the drawing up of a form which would enable ordinary persons to understand the methods of the partment 1",4

14,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALT H ELECTORAL,"The honourable member for Newcastle asked a question concerning Indian ration allowance - A report just reached' the Department, and is at the present time under consideration. t is hoped that a reply may be available to the honourable member tomorrow. WHEAT POOL.",4
15,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALT H ELECTORAL,"I wish to know from the Treasurer if it has been definitely decided to make an additional payment on account of the 1915-16 wheat pool. If so, what sum per bushel is to be advanced, aud on what date will such payment be made?",5
16,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALT H ELECTORAL,"At the request of the Australian Wheat Board, the Treasury has agreed to make the necessary financial arrangements to enable a further payment of Is. per bushel, less rail freight and handling charges, to be made to the wheat-growers in the "" old pool,"" making a total payment of 4s. per bushel, less rai l freight and handling charges. involve making a temporary advance to the Wheat Board of a considerable amount in addition to the funds from sales coming to hand; but the whole amount advanced will, it is believed, be liquidated by the Wheat Board in a very few months. It ' is expected that this payment of Is. per bushel, less rail freight and handling charges, will be^made available about the end of A p r i l .  that the 1915-16 Wheat Pool is, to all intents and purposes, out of debt, will the Treasurer be good enough to review his decision and allow the farmers a further advance of at least Is. per bushel at their railway stations?",5
17,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALT H ELECTORAL,"I cannot promise to do anything more without consulting the Wheat Board. The proposal that has been made is a very liberal one, and the farmers have to thank the Government for it .  out of their money for a long time.",5
18,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALT H ELECTORAL,"The Wheat Board has not, received the money, because the wheat has not been shipped. It is only through the Government coming to its rescue that the Board has been able to do what I have just announced. CORNSACKS.",5
19,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALT H ELECTORAL,"The Prime Minister made the statement yesterday that it was the intention of the Government not to charge the duty on cornsacks to the farmers. I ask him now whether it would not be a better course to do as I suggested last week, namely, to wipe out the duty altogether, instead of adopting the circuitous method proposed.",5
20,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALT H ELECTORAL,"No doubt it would be better to do so. There are many things that could be done in that way if the House would agree, but once the portals of the Tariff are opened, where are we going to stop ? How can we draw the line between cornsacks and woolpacks? The honourable member for Maranoa has already made the suggestion that the duty on woolpacks should be remitted.",5
21,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALT H ELECTORAL,"Will the Prime M in ister also allow the raw material for the manufacture of cornsacks and bran bags to come in free, in order to place the This will manufacturers here on the same footing as the farmers?",5
22,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALT H ELECTORAL,"Certainl y they will be placed on the same footing, but I have ascertained that for all practical purposes no cornsacks are made in Australia. Sacks are made here, but not sacks for holding wheat.",5
23,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALT H ELECTORAL,Chaf f bags and bran bags are made here.,5
24,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALT H ELECTORAL,"I am talking of cornsacks. To the extent that they are made in Australia the raw material will be free of duty, just as the cornsacks are free of duty to the farmer. SEYMOUR CAMP.  ister representing the Minister for Defence a question with regard to the food supply at the Seymour Camp, and in order to make my position quite clear, I will read a very brief extract from a letter from a gentleman who writes in regard to his son and several other lads in the Seymour Camp, as follows: Hy son has just left Liverpool with a host of other Granville boys, and they are now in Seymour Camp, and every boy writes home complaining of the rotten food. My son says there will be a riot if the food does not improve. I understand that the soldiers in this camp are provided with meat which was purchased from the Queensland Government eighteen months ago, and has been in cold storage ever since. That is one of the gravest causes of complaint.",5
25,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALT H ELECTORAL,"I can promise the honourable member that I will make inquiries into the matter, but I think that the allegation that the meat has been eighteen months in cold storage is not correct. The meat was obtained from the Queensland Government, and killed under the supervision of Commonwealth inspectors. Every piece of meat sent, not only to this camp, tout also to the Old Country, on behalf of the Commonwealth is most caref u l l y inspected. I do not think that there is any country in the world in which there is more careful inspection of meat. would be glad if honourable members, in all such cases as this, would specify the particulars, because the difficulty in connection with general complaints is to get down to bed-rock. Honourable members would facilitate the work of investigation if they could specify, names and dates as far as possible.  personal explanation",5
26,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALT H ELECTORAL,"Order ! The honourable member can make a personal explanation at a later stage. SIGNAL CORPS, CHEVIOTHILL .",6
27,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALT H ELECTORAL,H as the Minister for the Navy the informatio n he promised to secure in regard to the alleged short rationing of the men in the Signal Corps stationed at Cheviot Hill ?,6
28,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALT H ELECTORAL,"The honourable member asked the question the other day, and I have had the matter investigated. The reply is as follows:Members of the Signal Corps at the Port War Signal Station, Cheviot Hill, are granted twenty-one days' leave per annum, the same as all other persons on mobilization duties. This station is somewhat isolated, but steps are being taken to insure that the men will be changed to other positions more frequently. The statement that no additional rations have been issued to the number of men employed over sixteen is not correct, as rations are issued for every man employed at the station in accordance with the ration scale. Fresh meat is supplied every day, except that a twodays' supply is issued on Saturday. The allowance is 1-J lbs. per man per day, 1J lbs. of bread is supplied to each man daily. Dry stores are supplied twice a week, the being for each man:Butter, 5 ozs. per week. Sugar, 2 ozs. a day. Flour, 2 ozs. a day. Raisins, 1 oz. a day. Pepper, one-sixteenth ounce a day. Tea, one-third ounce a day. Silt, one-half ounce a day. Coffee, one-third ounce a day. Mustard, one-sixteenth ounce a day. Potatoes, 1 lb. a day. Vegetables (mixed), supplied twice 8 ozs. for each man. NA (WAR - TIM E) BILL . Bill presented by Mr GLYBTN, and read a first time. PRICE OE WHEAT .",6
29,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"In order to stimuI late production, and provide food supplies for Great B r it a in during the war, will the Government consider the question of adopting the Imperial policy of guaranteeing the farmer a minimum price for his wheat for, say, two harvests ?",6
30,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"^-The honourable member is aware that the Governments of the four wheat-producing States, together of with the Commonwealth Government, have agreed to guarantee to the farmer a minimum price for the 1917-18 crop. If the honourable member now asks me whether we are prepared' to do the same in respect of the 1918-19 crop, I must say at once that I am unable to give that assurance. In the first place, the arrangement is one in which the State Governmenta jointly and severally take the liability of the amount, each for its own State, while the Commonwealth finances and, as it were, endorses their bill . Until the Wheat Board, as well as the State and Commonwealth Governments, have had an opportunity of considering the question of the 1918-19 crop, and what prospects, if any, there are of marketing that crop, I ' think it would be premature for ns to speak of what the Commonwealth can do. In respect of the coming crop, however, every farmer in the Commonwealth has the positive assurance that he has a guaranteed price of 3s. per bushel f.a.q. at the station. The Wheat Board has made a recommendation, and I hope the States will agree to it , to substitute for that a guaranteed price of 4s. per bushel f.o.b. The Commonwealth Government approve of that recommendation. quantities PAY OF THEAUSTRALIANNAVY .",6
31,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,H as the Minister for the Navy any information to give the House regarding the request for an increase of pay to the non-commissioned officers and men of His Majesty's Australian Navy in consequence of the in creased cost of living ?,6
32,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"I regret to say that I have no information to offer. The a week, matter has not come before me in any way since I have been in the Navy Office. ELECTIONS. SOLDIERS' VOTES .",6
33,Mr ORCHARD,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"As the large number of troops now at Fremantle. will , in 'all probability, be on the high seas on Ihe date of the Federal elections, I wish to ask the Minister for Home and Territories whether it is intended to allow those men facilities to record their votes before leaving Australia?",7
34,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Everythin g will be done to enable them to take advantage of the absent-voting provisions of the Act. They may take advantage of those provisions and vote before they leave. I do not think it likely that they will arrive at their port of destination before the date of polling, but, if they do, they may take advantage of the provisions of the B i ll which I introduced a few moments ago. Provision will be made, if possible, for voting on the vessels themselves. AUSTRALIANS IN NE W ZEALAND.",7
35,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Is the Prime M in ister aware that Australians in New Zealand who are unfit for military service have been denied the right to return to their homes in this country ? By way of illustration, I would mention the case of a man who has two sons at the front . A third son, who had been working in Zealand for six years, was turned down .as medically unfit for service, but he is not allowed to leave for Australia.",7
36,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,Owing to the passport difficulty ?,7
37,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"That is BO. Mr HUGHES' - I was not aware of that. If the honourable member will supply me with the particulars of the case to which he refers, so that I may deal with it . I shall make such representations to the New Zealand Government as w i enable Australian citizens who the military age or medically unfit to pass freely between the Commonwealth and Nsw Zealand. ENEMY TRADE MARKS.",7
38,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"In a letter from the Prime Minister's Department, which have recently seen, it is said, in reference to enemy trade names, that I have to inform you that at the present time "" "" is a suspended trade mark, and therefore no person other than a person in whose favor it is suspended can use the mark .in Australia. I desire to ask the right honourable gentleman whether it is the policy of the Government to continue to issue to favoured persons the right to use German trade names in Australia, or whether the embargo against the use .of German trade names in the Commonwealth is to be universally applied ?",7
39,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Jus t how this matter stands now I am unable, on the spur of the moment, to inform the honourable member, but I shall have inquiries made, and will furnish him with an answer from my Department tomorrow. DESTRUCTI ON OF RABBITS .",7
40,Dr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"It is stated that the fly pest, more particularly in New South. Wales, has resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands of sheep. It is considered that the destruction of bird life, as the result of feeding upon poisoned rabbits, has contributed to that pest. I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether, in view of this fact, as well as the scarcity and the high' price of meat, he will bring under the immediate consideration of the State Premiers the advisableness of prohibiting the poisoning of rabbits?",7
41,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"I have already done New so. I was not aware of the far-reaching consequences of rabbit poisoning on bird l if e ; but, owing to the fact that we have completed with the Imperial Government a contract for the supply of rabbits for the British Forces', we have requested the various State Departments to actively co-operate with us in prohibiting the poisoning of rabbits where facilities for freezing exist. Since rabbits now are no longer, as it were, a pest to be got r i d of at all hazards, but a means of affording employment to large numbers of people, l l and a source of wealth to the community, are above this has already been done. WOOL CLIP .",7
42,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"When the acquisition of the last clip was brought about, I take it that probably one-third of the previous clip had been sold. The new clip I will be coming in from the north in a few months' time. Can the Prime M i nister give the House any information as to when it is likely that the sales or appraisements of the present clip w i ll be completed, and if it is proposed to. enter into negotiations in connection with the new clip which will be shorn in Queensland in the course of a few months) Further, has he been able tn arrive at any decision in regard to the allowance of interest on such clips as will not have been sold, say, by the 1st April, the interest to be a first charge on the profits of all sur-pluB wools sold in the Old Country.",7
43,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"In hunting parlance, I might fairly call this question a "" rascal "" ; and, if I get over it, I think I shall do pretty well, considering the difficulty of the matter, and the fact that I did not hear quite the whole of what the honourable member said. The subject is most complex; and the assistance that my honourable friend, the member for Maranoa, gave me yesterday in regard to wool packs, will help me very much. Perhaps I might be permitted to furnish the House with what information is at my disposal in regard to the transaction generally. This will, at any rate, clear up some of the points raised by the honourable member for Wannon, particularly as to what interest may be expected, and, consequently, what probabilities there are of a writing-off or setting-off, as against a later appraisement, in the amount of the settlement. As this matter ie of great importance, I make no apology for setting out. the position in detail. At the close of last year, negotiations were concluded with the Imperial Government whereby the balance of the clip was sold at the rate of 15Jd. per lb. of greasy wool. The necessary machinery haa been installed, and put into working order. At'first, the work of appraising the wool was slow, but, now that appraisers have had experience with the operations, excellent progress is being made. The payments regularly follow the appraisements, and a deduction of 10 per cent, is retained by the Commonwealth Government to cover any contingencies that may arise through overvaluation of wool by the experts. In other words, 90 per cent, of the appraised value is paid at the close of each appraisement, and the adjustment will be made' at the close of the final appraisement on the 30th June next. The point to. whioh I wish to direct the honourable member's attention is that the money represented by the 10 per cent, deduction is invested with the Bank of England,-and is earning interest for the whole of the time, and the proceeds will be added to the ''wool-growers? account,""'and form part) of the final 'distribution. In addition to the interest earned on the 10 per. cent.. 1 deduction, a considerable sum of moneywill be returned on earnings from exchange as between London and Australia; The Central Wool Committee have also recommended that the manufacture of wool tops for export shall be controlled by the Commonwealth Government during the war period. This has. been confirmed, and agreements have been . prepared for the proper performance of the extension of contracts for wool tops for Japan. The price obtained . for the wool tops is that, fixed by the Imperial Government, so that the buying and selling prices are controlled by the Government. Substantial monetary guarantees have been lodged for the due performance of these contracts by the manufacturer. As to profits arising from these contracts, all documents and accounts will be investigated and audited by an independent accountant, and approved by the Central Wool Committee ; and of the net profits 50 per cent, will be paid to the Commonwealth Government, and the remaining 50 per cent, will be retained by the manufacturing company. It will be seen that it is proposed to divide the profits. It is probable that if this wool scheme be extended to cover next season's wool, in addition to the clip now in hand, sufficient money will be recovered by the Commonwealth Government to equal the amount flatpaid as bounties for the encouragement and establishment of the wool tops industry in Australia since its inception. There is this to be said, that the amount of the clip that is not required for Imperial military purposes will be sold to manufacturers* in Britain, and the difference between the flat rate of 15Jd. plus freight and insurance, and the price obtained, will be divided between the growers and the British Government. The grower, therefore, whether he hae his wool appraised early or late, is to look, first of all, to the fact that the 10 per cent, deduction is earning interest, then that he is making money out of the exchange, which he never did before, that he is getting the highest price he ever got in his life, and that he is going to get a still higher price, or half of the profit of all wool sold for other than military purposes; and, lastly, the community is to be congratulated on the fact that the wool top industry is to be kept going here, the export rates, being maintained, and we maintaining our manufacturing interest. - NATIONAL FLAGS ADVERTISING PURPOSES.",8
44,Mr FINLAYSON,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Has anything been done, or has the Prime Minister sidered whether anything can be done, to prohibit the use of the Union Jack or the Australian flag for trade purposes 1",9
45,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"I am not ity on heraldry or anything of the sort, but I do not think that those flags should be used for such a purpose, and the practice ought not to be allowed. Perhaps the honourable member will supgentlemen ply me with information as to the particuand, lar instances he has' in his mind, so that see. we may examine the circumstances, and, if necessary, stop the practice. SOLDIERS' FOOD ANDCLOTHING : COMPLAINT S.",9
46,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"The honourable member for Brisbane asked me yesterday to make it plain to the House whether members of the Australian Imperial Force abroad, in the matter of their treatment, have to seek redress from the Australian authorities, or whether their only appeal is to the Imperial authorities? In reply I have to say that Australian soldiers abroad seek redress, in the first instance, from their own Australian officers, who are bound by the Defence Act . They can then appeal to General Bird wood, an Imperial officer, who, with the approval of the Imperial authorities, was appointed by the Australian Government as the General Officer Commanding Australian Troops. The honourable member for Brisbane also referred to some other circumstances which, he said, indicated considerable dissatisfaction among the troops, and these will be inquired into, and the honourable member advised later. honourable member has sent me a letter in which several complaints are made in a very vague way. For instance, there is one letter containing an allegation that, when a soldier dies the blanket in which he is buried is charged against him . shall make inquiries concerning the general allegations, but, as I earlier said to the honourable member for Echuca, it would be much better if honourable members would specify time and place, and so on, so that we may at once get to bedrock. NATIONAL FEDERATION.  Prime Minister's attention been drawn FOR the fact that an organization calling itself "" The National Federation,"" is taking yet steps to oppose, at the general election, conthe honourable member for Ballarat and the honourable member for Corio, who are at present on active service ? If so, does advertising the Prime Minister, who, I understand, is the founder of the organization, apan authorprove of such action ?",9
47,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Firs t of all, I have the honourable member's word, and that, of course, impresses me very greatly. Secondly, I have his assurance that the named are on active service; as to this, we shall see what we shall For the rest, it is a political and electioneering question, and I shall hot answer it . OLD-AGE PENSIONS .",9
48,Mr ORCHARD,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"The Treasurer waa asked a question recently in regard to widows who are in receipt of old-age pensions. Immediately they become recipients of a war pension the old-age pension ceases. I understand that the Treasurer gave a sympathetic hearing to the representations made to him , and I ask bim if any steps have been taken to alter the practice in this matter?",9
49,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"The payment of old-age pensions is governed by the law which provides that the old-age pension shall be of such amount that the whole income of the pensioner shall not exceed £ 1 2s. Gd. per week. I will bear in mind the honourable member's representations, and give the matter careful consideration during recess. RED CROSS FUNDS .",9
50,Dr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Information has"" The reached me that the Bodington estate, at Wentworth Falls, New South Wales, was purchased for £11,000, the money being supplied by the Australia Day' Fund. As the correct valuation of the estate is reported to be only £4,300, will the I Prime Minister have inquiries made into this matter in order to prevent Red Cross funds being dissipated unjustly?",9
51,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"This question comes in the same category as that asked by the honourable member for Maribyrnong yesterday. I said then that the Commonwealth has no direct jurisdiction over Red Cross funds, but I quite agree that there should be some general supervision to of them. I am not aware whether the facts are as the honourable gentleman has stated. Eor the policy of the Government I refer the honourable member to my answer to the honourable member for Maribyrnong. We are endeavouring to arrive' at an understanding with the States as to the control of these funds. SOLDIER'S PAY .",9
52,Dr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"I am informed by a mother whose son has been wounded in Prance that her money has been stopped ever since news of his in j u r y was received for the alleged reason that his pay had been overdrawn to the amount of £ 3 5 , due to field punishments and fines in March, 1916. The soldier has written to his mother to say that he never receives her letters, although she writes every mail. Will the Minister representing the Minister for Defence inquire into this case, as the mother is busy in speaking of her injustice, and the case is calculated to interfere with recruiting ?",10
53,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,If the honourable member will supply me with particulars of the case I will make inquiries. MANUFACTUR E OF CIGARETTES . that,10

Are both imported and locally-manufactured cigarettes periodically submitted analytical examination? 4. Will the Minister state results .recent analysis? 5. Is it correct that spirits are regularly used in the manufacture of cigarettes? 6. Can the Minister say how much alcohol was so used by Australian manufacturers of cigarettes during the period named?",10
55,Mr JENSEN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as folof low :-'1. The number of cigarettes imported is not recorded, nor are the figures in respect of those locally manufactured yet available. weights of the cigarettes imported and factured are respectively as follows:(a.) 100,880 lbs.

56,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"the Prime M in ister, upon notice Whether, owing to the growers' inability to export maize, and thus being confined to a narrowed market that cannot absorb their product or yield a price that will pay the eost of production, the Prime Minister will confer with the Governments of the maize-growing States with a view to the formation of a maize "" pool"" to protect the growers?",10
57,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"I have already indicated, in reply to a question by the honourable member for Cowper, why a maize pool on the lines of the wheat pool is not possible.

63,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"As the current butter The export season is almost at an end, and manupractically the whole production of the Commonwealth will be absorbed in providing for autumn and winter requirements of the Commonwealth, no purpose would be served by increasing prices of butter to Australian consumers from de149s. 4d. per cwt. (Is. 4d. per l b . ) , as at present, to 190s. per cwt. (Is. 8d. per l b . ) . NA (WAR - TIM E) BILL . SECOND READING .",10
64,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) [3.50] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. I wish to mention one or .two of the facts of substance that this measure is in tended to cover. Its object is to provide for the men at the fron t an opportunity to vote. Our soldiers are fighting for that freedom without which our Constitution, political institutions, methods of election and the like would be futil e and vain. They have, in the most efficacious manner, recognised their supreme duty to their country, and by their deeds at Gallipoli, in France, and in every theatre of war in which Australians have been present, have won for their native country a prestige of achievement which it is for others to emulate as well as to praise. The Ministry consider that, however difficult it may be to obtain a proper method of voting, it would be a great pity if these men were nob given an opportunity-subject, of course, to military necessities, as to which we are in communication with the Imperial Government-to discharge one of the highest functions of citizenship, by voting for candidates for the next Commonwealth. Parliament. Provision was made for the voting of the men at the front on the Compulsory Militar y Service Referendum. The B i ll is intended to apply to the members of our Forces, who are defined in clause 5 to be the members of the Commonwealth Naval or Militar y Forces, of the Army Medical Corps, and of the Nursing Service.",11
65,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,Does not the Minister think that the men employed on the vessels which carry the troops should be given an opportunity to vote?,11
66,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,And the munition workers too?,11
67,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"The Bill covers all who belong to the Forces, and are at the front, or have returned home. If they are qualified in other respects, the fact that - they have discharged in the most efficacious way their obligations to the Commonwealth, and to the Empire, will give them the right to vote, even though they may not be enrolled. question was asked early in the day by the honourable member for Nepean concerning the men employed on the transports.",11
68,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,Does not the Bill cover those on a ship of war?,11
69,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"A transport is not a vessel of war, and, by international law, is not subject to the ordinary contingencies of war. It would be very hard to make provision for the voting of munition workers, who may be grouped in two classes. There are, first, those who went Home at the invitation of the Imperial Government, sent through this Government, and who may, therefore, be regarded as associated with our Militar y Forces, their names appearing on lists. It would be possible, though not convenient, to take the votes of these persons, because, instead of being in one or two places, they are so scattered about ithat it would be very difficult to provide machinery whereby their votes could be properly registered. In proportion to the number of men at the front, the number of Australian munition workers in Great Britain is small.",11
70,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"There are about 1,000 munition workers.",11
71,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Yes , but they are so scattered that it would be practically impossible to record their votes, and, therefore, provision has not been made for doing so. Those employed on the transports were allowed to vote on the compulsory military service proposal, but, speaking from memory, I do not think that more than 370 of them took advantage of the opportunity provided. They would have to vote under the Bill and law, after the issue of the writ, and either before leaving port or on arrival, which would be after the polling day. It would be very difficult to provide properly for the voting of these men. Their names are not on official lists, most of them w i ll be at sea when the vote is taken, and, in any case, their votes could not be easily allocated to particular districts.",11
72,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,Are not some hundreds of Australians employed at Messrs. Vickers' factory?,11
73,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"There are some there, but I do not know how many. I saw some of them myself. In addition to the munition workers who have gone Home on the special invitation of the Imperial I think a Government, there are others who have gone Home on their own account, for whose voting we could not make any provision, because we do not know their names, nor do we know their qualifications. The voting will be, not according to electoral divisions, but according to military lists. Ordinary Australians who are now visiting Great Britain , or are elsewhere absent from the Commonwealth, will not be able to vote, and tnese munition workers will be in the same position.",11
74,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,Thei r names are known to the Defence Department.,12
75,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Thei r names are not on any official list. As for the voting at the front, it would be impossible to follow the methods in vogue in the Commonwealth requiring the men to vote according to the electoral divisions from which they went away. In the Commonwealth there will be six Senate ballot papers, one for each State, and seventy-five ballot-papers for the divisions returning members to the House of Representatives. The men at the front, however, are not grouped according to their States, and it would be practically impossible to provide the machinery that would enable them to vote according to State and elec-toral divisions. What is proposed, therefore, is that their votes shall be recorded according to their place of residence as entered on the military or naval lists, or, where, through some oversight, their place of residence has not been recorded, according to the place of residence of their next of k in .",12
76,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,Suppos e the next of k in resides abroad?,12
77,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"In the casualty lists, one often sees England, Ireland, or Scotland mentioned as the place of residence of the person concerned. Will such persons be able to vote?",12
78,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"No . It would be impossible to provide for those cases. Canadians have adopted this system of voting, and many more Canadians have given as the place of residence of their next of k in somewhere in the Old Country.",12
79,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,What is done in those cases ?,12
80,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"O u r Bill practically adopts the Canadian system. . As the ordinary electoral method cannot be followed, it is 'proposed to allow our men abroad to vote for definite groups, that is, for Ministerialists, or for Oppositionists, as they choose. The Prime Minister will determine, within five days of the polling, which of the candidates are to be identified as Ministerialists, and the honourable member for Yarra will determine which of them are to be identified as supporters of the Official Labour party.",12
81,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,What about the poor Independents ?,12
82,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,They are provided for as well as we can provide for them. I do not think it would be well to provide for too many party divisions. There are so many degrees of independence that the task of distinguishing between them would present psychological difficulties beyond even the ingenuity of the electoral officials.,12
83,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,It was very difficult to find a name for the party to which the honourable member now belongs.,12
84,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"That is because it stands for so many things which are beneficial to the State that to pick out any of them as a name by which to call it would be invidious. As regards the Independents, those men who do not wish to vote according to the party ticket may select three names for the Senate.",12
85,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"I presume that the names of the candidates, and the parties to which they belong, will be cabled abroad.",12
86,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Yes . To-day several cables have been sent to the Old Country to say what is contemplated, and what is likely to follow. A man will be able to vote for the Senate by putting a cross after "" Ministerialists "" or after "" Oppositionists."" The names of the candidates will not appear on the ballot papers, but lists will be prepared and circulated giving all information.  names of the candidates be followed by a descriptive title, so that it may be known The whether they are Ministerialists or Oppositionists ?",12
87,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"List s will be printed and circulated giving that information, but the names of the candidates will not appear on the ballot-papers. Every candidate will be identified, so far as that may be possible. Mr RICHAR D FOSTER - Are you f o llowing the Canadian legislation in this matter ?",12
88,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Yes . The names of candidates will be associated with the party for which they stand, but I cannot promise to have every candidate labelled "" Minister i a l is t "" or ""Oppositionist.""",12
89,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Thos e certified to by the Prime Minister, or by me, will be labelled according to their party on the lists will be circulated ?",13
90,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"It is the grouped candiparty-tha dates who will be certified to. I do think that it is necessary for every who stands to be certified to. Out of or 400 candidates it would be hard to whether every man belonged to a different party or not. But it will be done so f a as it can be done. The identification of suspicion. a group is all that is necessary, and the men will learn from the printed lists cirthe culated among them the divisions for which the candidates are standing.",13
91,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"I think that they w look for the names on the ballot-paper, as they have been accustomed to doing. This proposes a limitation.",13
92,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Undoubtedl y it does, but it is brought about by exceptional cuinstances. To secure an absolutely perof fect system would be impossible. Canada has adopted this system, and I believe New Zealand is about to adopt it . I Canada the candidates are grouped as Opposition and Ministerial.",13
93,Mr HANNAN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"What objection could the Government have to using the term Official Labour party, instead of Opposiwill tion!",13
94,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"If our friends opposite think they should be designated as Official Labour party, there is really reason why the term should not be used, but there is nothing invidious in calling honourable members led by the honourable member for Yarra the Opposition. Furbut thermore, the designation of Opposition will cover any variation of humour and opinion inside or outside the chamber. Goodness knows, there are enough such variations in Parliament. If .honourable members opposite are for the time being persons. designated as members - of the Official Labour party, the significance of the may be varied from moment to moment. I think, on the whole, it would be to accept the suggestion made in the B under which the various parties are to grouped. Of course, the voting will sent voting, and as was the case into the recent referendum, the votes be sent to London to be counted, except that in the case of the men stationed German New Guinea their votes will sent to Rabaul. The head of onr Forces in London is Brigadier-General Anderson, and he will be the Commonwealth Electoral Officer in London. There will be another Commonwealth Electoral Officer at that Rabaul. The count will be made in the presence of scrutineers appointed by each t is, the Ministerialists and the not Opposition. Provision is made in clause man 17, paragraph (c) that the scrutineers 300 shall be an equal number, nominated by say the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition respectively. This should be r a guarantee that the voting will be above",13
95,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"What is the meaning of phrase, "" their allocation to respective divisions and States,"" in that paragraph?",13
96,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"The voting being by i ll groups, men's votes being assigned to divisions as indicated by residence entered on military lists, and the divisions not being set out in the ballot papers, the allocation to the various cir- - divisions will be made at the time the scrutiny by the electoral officers. They .will se© from the military lists that where each man's residence is, and n they will declare that his vote is to be attached to the division of the State according to those lists. That is the only convenient way in which the allocation of the votes'can be done. Some of the men not be enrolled, and it will be i m possible to get them to declare the district for which they would care to vote. Furthe thermore, experience shows that many no men who are enrolled cannot say at a particular time the divisions for which they 'are enrolled. Therefore, seeing that we are not following the present electoral roll , are enabling every man at the front over twenty-one years of age to vote, the provisions of our electoral law have had to be somewhat altered in order to meet the circumstances'. Part III . of the Bill deals with the disqualification of certain Clause 10 provides- "" Every naturalized British subject who was born in term an enemy country shall be disqualified from voting at elections."" This is a time better when we should take every precaution ill against danger, and it has been decided be that those who were born in any country be abwith which Britain is at present at war regard shall be debarred fro m voting at an will election so long as this measure is in force. No questions are to be asked. It in is simply a matter of disqualification for be the time being. We may have our differences of opinion upon this point, but on the whole, seeing that the Empire is at war, and that the war has reached such a critical stage, there is some justification for saying that the ordinary electoral rights of the persons covered by this part of the B i ll must give way to a reasonable degree of caution as to the possible effect of their votes at an election. Exemptions are provided in clause 10, sub-clause 4. This clause provides that the following persons shall be exempt: (a) Any member of the Forces who is serving outside Australia; (6) any person who produces to the presiding officer a certificate signed by the District Commandant of a Military District, or an officer thereto authorized by him, that that person is or has been a member of the Forces, or is a parent, or the wife, brother, or sister of a person who is or has been a member of the Forces; (c) any person who satisfies the. presiding officer that he is or has been at any time during the present war a member of the Parliament of the Commonwealth or of a State; (d) any person who satisfies the presiding officer that he is a Christian, and either a Syrian or an Armenian. Any person who belongs to a family which has discharged its duties by sending some member of it to 'the front will be regarded as one who can exercise his right co vote. It is also thought that Christian Syrians, who are devoted to the British Empire, should be permitted to vote. At the recent referendum, provision was made by which the parents who had a son at the front could vote; but this Bill extends that privilege to the parent, wife, brother, or sister of a person who is or has been a member of the Forces.",13
97,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Will that provision apply to persons inside Australia, or only to those overseas?",14
98,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"All the men at the front are entitled to vote. The parent, wife, sister, or brother of any one who has discharged his duty in this crisis of the Empire by becoming a member of the Forces is not disqualified by the Bill . The only disqualification is that of a person who was born in enemy territory, but there is a slight modification in the proviso to sub-clause 2 of Clause 10, which readsProvided that a person claiming to vote, who was a natural-born citizen or subject of France, Italy, or Denmark, and who arrived in Australia, and was naturalized before the date upon which the territory in which he was born became part of Germany or Austria (as the case may be) shall not be deemed to have been born in an enemy country, if he produces to the presiding officer a certificate in the prescribed form, which has not been revoked. A person covered by this proviso can obtain a certificate by applying to the Electoral Officer, and submitting reasonable evidence to show that he is entitled to one. All these matters will be provided for by regulation. The efEect of the proviso is that if a man was born in SchleswigHolstein,' or in that part of Poland which, after he came' out to Australia, became part of Austria, he is not to be regarded as having been born in enemy territory.",14
99,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,Would a man who would be entitled to vote abroad be likewise entitled to vote in Australia?,14
100,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"An y member of the Forces who has returned from abroad can vote, whether he is on the roll or not. ""Member of the Forces"" includes more than actual combatants.",14
101,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"If a soldier returns within two weeks of the issue of the writ, and his name is not on the roll, can he vote ?",14
102,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"In such a case, the soldier can get a certificate saying that he is entitled to vote, and he can present it at any polling place and vote. All the details are not set out in the Bill . They must be covered by regulations.",14
103,Mr HANNAN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Where would a soldier who has j.ust returned vote-at his present residence, or in the division where he resided prior to his departure?",14
104,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"I suppose that, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, the names on the military lists would coincide with the divisions in which soldiers who were enrolled prior to their departure stand enrolled upon the electoral lists; but in any case, the man who has just returned, and is not enrolled, can vote in accordance with his residence as it appears on the military list. Practically in all cases the division in which he was entitled to enroll as an elector would be indicated as his residence on the military list. Returned soldiers who are enrolled would vote for the division in respect of which they are enrolled. It will be necessary to take the military lists as a guide; but, as I have said, in nearly every case, the places of residence as given on the military list will coincide with the electoral divisions for which the men are enrolled. The only other provision in the Bill to which reference need be made covers the case of a candidate for the Senate who may die after the date of nomination. Provision is made by which the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition can nominate some one, as their parties may determine, to take the place of the deceased candidate on the list.",14
105,Mr TUDOH,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Is there any specified date within which that may be done? Mr Glynn"" - It may be done right up to the day before polling. There is no other point to which I need draw attention at this stage. The Bill merely provides the machinery to enable men to vote at the front, and while it is not, perhaps, as perfect in all respects as would be possible in ordinary circumstances, it is the best that can be brought forward under the conditions described. Debate (on motion by Mr TUDOR"") adjourned. NA SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 13th March (vide page 11312), on motion by Mr GROOMThat this Bill be now read a second time.",15
106,Mr FENTO N,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Maribyrnong) [4.21]. - When the debate on this Bill was adjourned last night, I was discussing the method by which the Prime Minister proposes to confer certain benefits upon users of cornsacks, and particularly the farmers of Australia. I wish to emphasize my objections to that method, which, in my opinion, is very questionable. A far more wholesome and legitimate course .would have been to submit an amendment of the schedule to this Bill. The Government might have embodied it in a small list of amendments, and have said, "" We require these amendments to be made, but are not prepared to go any further at this stage with the revision of the Tariff."" Had they done so, the Bill would have passed just as speedily as it will do in the existing circumstances. We are giving the Prime Minister unlimited power under the War Precautions Act to make regulations dealing, amongst other things, with the Tariff. If at any time an influential deputation points out some serious Tariff anomaly, and can sufficiently impress the Prime Minister, he may bring its representations before the Cabinet, and, provided that he can convince his colleagues of the wisdom of granting the request of the deputation, he may, by Order in Council or by means of a regulation under the War Precautions Act, do what the deputation asks. In this piecemeal way the Government can withdraw nearly all the benefits that the Tariff gives through the Customs House. I am not objecting to this proposal in regard to cornsacks merely because it is a concession to be granted to the farmers. In the existing conditions, I think that the remission of the duty on cornsacks would be unanimously agreed to by the House; but it is the method by which this concession is to be granted to which I take exception. Such a system opens the door to abuses, and will reflect no credit on the Parliament or the Administration which sanctions it. We already have a long list of concessions and innovations, made by way of regulation, in regard to various industries. As the result of a deputation which waited on the Prime Minister, and BILL. which consisted principally of the sugar growers and the sugar-millers, the Cabinet quite recently came to a certain decision with regard to the sugar industry. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which is one of the biggest combines in Australia today, and is in a position to make bigger profits than ever before, must be included amongst the sugar-millers.",15
107,Mr CORSER,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,The decision of the Cabinet does not alter the agreement.,15
108,Mr FENTON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"The honourable member is aware that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company owns at least half-adozen sugar mills in Queensland, and controls the industry in New South Wales.",15
109,Mr SAMPSON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,How is that to be got rid of?,15
110,Mr FENTON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"There is only one way to get rid of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and of any other company which is manipulating things in its own interest and against the public, and that is for the Commonwealth Government to take absolute control of the industry. The decision at which the Cabinet has arrived in regard to the sugar industry will mean the doling out of money already in the public purse. It is a most unwise one. At the behest of a deputation, the Treasurer is told by a majority of his colleagues to dip his hands into the public Treasury and to hand out to a section of the community a very large sum of money.",15
111,Mr CORSER,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,The honourable member has been reading the Age. It is not so.,15
112,Mr FENTON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"It is so. It is quite likely that, in respect of the current finanthe cial year, the. Commonwealth, as sult of this decision in regard to the industry, will lose nearly £1,000,000. The sacks ? arrangement is to continue during the war, and for the season following the of the war; so that it is quite possible that the taxpayers will have to hand out £2,000,000. That such a thing should done by regulation-withou t the consent of Parliament",16
113,Mr CORSER,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,I should like to ask honourable member,16
114,Mr FENTON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Speeches in this general House are seriously prolonged by interber, jections from the honourable member.",16
115,Mr CORSER,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,I do not like misstatetable ments.,16
116,Mr FENTON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"I am here as a rethat presentative of the taxpayers to protest against the immoral methods adopted by the Government in doling out to certain sections of the community hundreds of thousands of pounds. If there thing which the honourable member for secrecy. Lang, in common with a number of other honourable members, has voiced in this House, it is the feeling that this country should not be governed by regulations. ""We like to see everything placed in and white by the' Parliament itself. The Government, having a majority this House, could have submitted and have carried in connection with this Bill a proable posal to remit the duty on cornsacks. That would have been much better than their devious methods for making this wealth. concession to the farmers. The British Government today have practically control of the Indian jute mills. They have assumed that control for the reason that they require millions of sand bags connection with their military operations, end it is from those jute mills that we obtain our bags and the material for making bags. ""We are still a long way from the 1917-1S harvest, and I contend that the question of remitting the duty on cornsacks might well have been lowed to stand over until after the general elections. There would have been ample time, after the elections, to make provision for the 1917-18 harvest. Why has this concession to the farmers been announced just before a general election? The reason is obvious. I leave it to people to say for themselves whether these tactics should be adopted merely for sake of securing a political advantage. the re Mr SAMPSON - Would the honourable sugar member vo.te to remit the duty on corn",16
117,Mr FENTON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"The honourable memclose ber will have an opportunity to see how I shall vote, and when that opportunity arrives I hope he will be found on the side be of those whom he professes to represent. Concerning the question of Protection, much has been said, and the Labour the party has been blamed for its failure to deal with the Tariff. The last election took place on 5th Septem1914, and on 3rd December, 1914, the present Tariff schedule was laid on the of the House by the then Minister for Trade and Customs, Mr Tudor. At time no honourable member was conversant with the terms of the schedule. Only a ""few officials of the Customs Department were familiar with them. As we all know, the Tariff schedules must, of is one necessity, be framed in the greatest It would be wrong to the country to do otherwise, so that with the pxception of a few Customs officials and the then Minister for Trade and Customs no one in Australia knew what sort of a black schedule would be submitted. We were hopeful, however, that when we were in afforded an opportunity to consider it, the Protectionists in this HHouse would be to frame a schedule that would be in consonance with the opinions of the advanced Protectionists of the Common",16
118,Mr CORSER,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,Why did not the Labour full Government tackle the Tariff?,16
119,Mr FENTON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"As I have said, the Tariff schedule was laid on the table of in the House on 3rd December, 1914, three months after our return. Ifc has been declared that the only excuse we have for our failure to deal with the Tariff is in respect of the period subsequent to a certain announcement by the Prime Minister after he returned from Great Britain. alI f it was only then that the difficulty arose, there must have been a number of Rip Van Winkles in the Parliament. As a matter of fact, the Tariff schedule was no sooner laid on the table of the House than the great bulk of the members of this Parliament knew that the there was a menace ahead of us in connection with it . The honourable member for Wide Bay was not then a member of this Parliament, but if he will take the trouble to look up Hansard he will find that I had something to say about this question long before he was returned. If there were one reason more than another for the journey which the Prime Minister made to the other side of the world, it was that he should do something in this regard. That, so far as I was concerned, at all events, was the main reason why he undertook that mission - Unfortunately, things in that regard are still unsatisfactory. If we are not to do anything for the industries of our country merely because there happens to be a certain difficulty in the way, then we are recreant to the promises we made and to the principles we espoused when before the electors. October, 1914, shortly after the elections, I suggested to the then Prime Minister a means by which this country could be placed in a f ar better position than she is now to meet the times coming after the war. Our organization is almost n i l . Wo organization can be complete in this direction without a proper T a r i ff schedule. I see uo reason why even before we go to the electors we should not encourage our industries without giving offence to any nation, allied or neutral. We ought to have one common Tariff, without preference to anybody, and absolute prohibition of all articles which we can produce and manufacture here for our own use. Would such a Tariff give offence to any country, seeing that we should treat Great Britain just as we treated her Allies and enemies? It is absolutely essential, in the present state of Australian industries and the labour market, and in the in terests of the whole of the people, that drastic measures should be adopted. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Hav e we not sufficient Protection by the sweeping of commerce from the seas at the present time ? Is that not prohibition ?",16
120,Mr FENTON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"No doubt the honourable member regards that as sufficient protection; but to do so is to live in a fool's paradise. Please God, the time will soon come when the seas will once more be free to the commerce of the world ! Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - What is the use of commerce if we shut our ports 1",17
121,Mr FENTON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"-That , of course, is the Free Trader's idea. The honourable member would open our ports wide, and allow the products of all countries to come in , no matter what the remuneration or the conditions of labour may be in those countries.",17
122,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,Would you have ships come here in ballast and go away full ?,17
123,Mr FENTON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"The honourable member may, if he choose, argue in that way before his constituents; but if he advances such propositions to the workingmen electors of Lang, I shall expect to see his seat occupied by some one else after the 5th May. If honourable members knew the uphill task which we in the Labour party had to face on behalf of Protection during the past seven years, they would give us credit for the distinct advance in that In direction that there has been. At Maryborough, in 1913, the then Prime Minister, Mr Fisher, for the first time in the history of the Labour party, made the policy of Protection one of the chief planks in the platform ; and that was only as the result of continued agitation against great odds. In 1914, that declaration of policy was repeated; and then we had a kind of Tariff schedule laid on the table,",17
124,Mr CORSER,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,An apology for a Tariff.,17
125,Mr FENTON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"It may be called so; and I can assure the House that it was great work to get even that mongrel schedule. In the present state of the party, there are not more than two members .who might be called Free Traders, and even they have recanted. One of them, the honourable member for K a l goorlie, has assented unreservedly, and today he is undoubtedly Protectionist.",17
126,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,What about the honourable member for Maranoa?,17
127,Mr FENTON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Onl y last night he shed his last vestige of Free Trade leanings, and is now also a full-blown Protectionist. The honourable member for Dampier, in the course of his remarks, endeavoured to make us believe that the primary producer receives no benefit from the policy of Protection - I do not know whether that honourable member represents many producers, but I do not think he would find any number of his constituents to accept such a doctrine. We are all agreed, I think, that our cities are too large, containing, as they do, about one half of our total population; and for this, the better wages, and other attractions of city life, are held responsible. ' I am a country boy myself, and, if I had my 11498 Customs Tariff [REPRESENTATIVES.] choice, I should go ""back to the country, for I regard the life as the freest, best, and healthiest. I remember, however, when I finished my apprenticeship, was thinking of getting married, I found that my employer offered me no more than 35s. per week-having the idea of taking two boys on in my place; and this, of course, forced me to find better elsewhere. Similar conditions met the budding journeyman, whether a blacksmith, a wheelwright, or a printer, though at the present time, Wages Boards, things are a little This accounts largely for the flocking of the sons of farmers and other country residents to the city. At the same time, the honourable member for Dampier surely does not suggest that every son of a farmer should follow his father's occupation ? Boys are fitted for careers, and I feel certain that, if I were to go to the Newport railway shops, an agricultural implement factory, or any other place of business of the kind, I could find a great show of hands by those who had originally come from the country. man who grows wheat, barley, maize, oats, or auy other crop, is no more a producer than is the working man at Sunshine or any other place where agricultural ments and other machinery are out. The workman in the factory is as much a producer as the man on the land, and, thanks to our mechanical two men can now do the work on a farm where twelve were necessary thirty forty years ago. Further, what customers has the man on the land than are furnished in those engaged in the factories in our populous centres ? men and women earn good wages, and are able to buy produce freely, and this interdependence renders it folly to say that the farmer reaps no benefit from Protection. Even with the limited tion we now have, the man on the land enjoys very tangible advantages, and he would be much better off if the Protection were increased. But there are other ways by which the industries of the country can be assisted. Without divulging secrets, I may say that, at a certain gathering of parliamentarians, were told that we would have to be very careful how we handled the Tariff, the question was asked whether that applied to every effort that might be made in other ways to help the producer or manufacturer-whether there were not other Mr Fenton. Validation Bill. ways in which assistance could be given; we were then told that assistance could that be given in the shape of bonuses and by and other means, but nothing has been done. By way of illustration of how help may be rendered to the development of industries, and thus provide employment, I may say that in the Old terms Country considerable attention has been given by experts to the treatment of coal. he was The coal of Australia is just like the coalobtained elsewhere, and in it th'ere are with our quite a number of elements which are of better. considerable commercial value, but which, continual unfortunately, are lost under present conditions. The test of the gas supplied by the gas companies, both in England and here, has hitherto been that of illuminating quality. But that test is now not so necessary, in view of the introduction of varying the incandescent mantle; and in Great Britain an Act has been passed altering the test to that of calorific or heat value. This means that, without in any way interfering with the quality of the gas supplied, much less coal is required, and cerThe tain important elements of the coal are saved. One of these elements or products is known as benzol, which, I understand, is equivalent to benzine, gasolene, or imple- petrol, and it is used for the propulsion turned of vehicles. One gas company in London has, by means of this alteration, used 65,000 tons less of coal in two months than inventors, under the old system. The Government have power to take what action they or please under the War Precautions Act, better and I understand that engineers connected with our gas companies are prepared to make a similar change if they are perThere mitted to do so. In view of the high price of petrol, it would be well to do something in this direction, and it is said that the Defence Department is making some efforts, though, I am afraid, only in Protec- a tiddly-winking sort of way. There are many other means by which the Government could lend their aid towards the creation of new industries and increased avenues of employment in various directions. For instance, it seems a scandal that any we have to import one ounce of cement when we have mountains of the very when we best necessary material in this country. Yet we are importing cement to the value of £270,000 per annum.  of the. men makes the extension of local manufacture impossible.",17
128,Mr FENTON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"I am glad the honourable member made that interjection. The honourable member for Dampier spoke of how the slowing down policy was crippling the steel industry in New South Wales. In refutation of that statement, we have the sworn testimony of one of the largest employers of labour in this country. I refer to Mr Delprat, the general manager of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. He was questioned in regard to the adaptability of Australian workmen in connection with the establishment of steel works, and he said, on oath, "" We do require a few men who are experts at the trade, but, generally, the ordinary telligent working man such as we find in Australia can do the work, and I say of the Australian that he is one of the best and most adaptable workmen in the world."" The man who used those words is one of our biggest captains of industry, and he speaks from a wealth of experience. I would refer the honourable member for Echuca to the testimony also of the Council of the Royal Agricultural Society of Victoria. The gentlemen who comprise that council are graziers and farmers, and, according to a paragraph in the Affe this morning, the council had had certain work carried out by contract, and some by day labour. Asphalting was done under the contract system for Is. Sd. per square yard, and by day labour for Is. 3d. per square yard. That is the experience and testimony of some of the most conservative men in the community. We contend that, with proper guidance by the employer or overseer, day labour beats contract every time. Evidence in support of that view is overwhelming. Recent experience in the Old Country has provided another proof of the efficiency of Australian workmen. I have putable testimony that Australian fitters and others who went to England to engage in war work are carrying out in seven hours certain operations in ^connection with the manufacture of guns that used to occupy the English workmen eleven hours. Yet these are the men who, honourable members allege, are slowing down. Men who come to Australia from America acknowledge that the pace of the Australian workman is too hot for them. Far be it from us in Australia to do as they are doing in certain parts of America, where men are being killed outright at their occupations. According to the finding of a medical commission which investigated industrial conditions in the United States of America, these are the four stages of ill-health through which the workmen pass:-First , fatigue; secondly, colds; thirdly, tuberculosis; and finally, death. At thirty-five and forty years of age, men are too old and broken in health to be further employed by the large employers of labour. The Prime Minister ridiculed my proposal for the establishment of steel works in Australia. We are in this lamentable position, that, if anything went wrong with some of the steel plates of the vessels that defend our shores, we have not in in- the Commonwealth mills that can roll out a plate. We talk about the setting up of workshops of our own for naval repairs, but we have not a mill capable of rolling a steel plate. I admit that, at Newcastle and Lithgow, steel rails are being produced, but that is only one small department of steel work. The steel industry must be extended, and Tariff or no Tariff, if private enterprise will not develop the valuable iron ore deposits of Australia, the Commonwealth 'Government should proceed to do so. If the recommendation of the Public Works Committee had been adopted, the Government would be today manufacturing all its own cement, and would have been saving £ 2 or £ 2 per ton. Here is another important point: The honourable member for Lang stated that we ar© protected to a certain extent by reason of the seas not being free, because those foreign vessels which brought large quantities of goods to Australia are not coming to our ports today. That is true. But, although the competition of Germany has been shut out, goods are entering the Commonwealth from another country. indisDuring the war, there have been established certain new industries, but their outlook is by no means assured, and when the war is over they will be again lef t to the tender mercy of the importer. What encouragement are we giving the chemists and other experts to engage in research so that we may manufacture in Australia articles which were previously imported from abroad 1 Some people have done well in new industries since the outbreak of war, with but very little encouragement from the Government and this Parliament. We cannot continue this policy of procrastination. We must not be afraid of obstacles or other circumstances which we know exist. It is the bounden duty of this. Parliament tp stand by the people who are' establishing new indusrich. tries to see that their enterprises are not brought to a standstill as soon as the is over, and the old channels of trade opened.

Parliament should set itself task of mobilizing the best intellect of the country. Our chemists and mechanics ought to be mobilized, and the Commonto wealth ought to establish a staff of chemists to conduct research work for 'assistance of industry. Germany thousands of chemists engaged in assisting every industry-no t only chemists who are giving assistance to the workmen at the benches and at the lathes, but exbe perts wbo are engaged in the laboratories in research work. Before Germany able to turn out an aniline dye fit for markets of the world, chemists were i vestigating for twenty-six years. result was that, before the war, .Germany had practically a monopoly of the dye trade of the world. What investigations are we carrying out?

Although Australian banks have assisted industries to a certain extent, that assistance has not been given anything like the degree that is necessary. One reason why Germany was able the to penetrate the markets of the whole has world was that her commercial agents were always preceded by the assistance of the banking institutions. We must go further in that direction, and the banks must prepared to risk something, not only for their own interests, but also for the was interests of the nation. The writer conthe tinues-and these remarks have a disn - tinct and pressing application to AusThe tralian circumstancesA third defect is the lack of co-ordination between industry and research. The work of research, much neglected in this country, can longer be carried out in a haphazard and Modern industry is on natural science, and its application the material world. There may be a time far distant when we shall have found out all we can about nature. But today that is far away. To-day we are in an age of incessant discovery, and the increased production of wealth and our power of competition on the application of all this knowledge, both in small and great things, to inWherever wo look, whether it is in the vast development of electricity, not only for the ordinary purposes of lighting and power, but in the refining and production of metals or products such as nitrate from air, or the development of chemistry and its uniapplication to industry and agriculture, or to the vast economics possible in the proper of oiir coal resources, or whether consider the development of the internal combustion engine, everywhere we. see grunt If we are to live in competition with other nations, we must keep ourselves ahreast of them, not onlyin actual knowledge, but in its for practicable application to industry"".

Mr KINS O'MALLEY - They are amateurs.",19
129,Mr FENTON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"The men who control the Bureau include a number of University professors and professional men, and they can pen a good letter, and use flowery language, but, so far as actual assistance to industry goes, the results of their activities are practically nil. During the absence of the Prime Minister in England, a number of us waited as a deputation on the Acting Prime Minister, and said that we did not consider that the Bureau of Science was doing enough for Australian industries. The Acting Prime Minister said that something more would be done. mises were plentiful, but there has been no performance. Looking at Australian conditions, not only during the continuance of this awful conflict, but also in the period to follow the declaration of peace, one cannot regard the prospect as other than gloomy. We have wonderful advantages, and a country that contains everything necessary to make our people hnppy and prosperous, and full of employment and industry; yet, with 300,000 men absent from Australia, there are thousands of men unemployed throughout the Commonwealth. This is a disgrace to us as a people, and we shall be reproached by all other parts of the civilized world if , after the war, this country, still almost virgin of industries, is crowded with unemployed. A r e our soldiers, when they return, to swell the army of the unemployed ? God forbid ! We must bestir ourselves. We can do something. The Tariff should not pass beyond the consideration of this Chamber until the definite.promise has been made by the Government that in this hour of the nation's need something shall be done to encourage industry, and to find employment for our people. To-day the products of foreign countries are flowing in through our ports, .and finding their way to the shelves of the emporiums with which our people do business. Particularly in the drapers' shop9 are foreign goods to be met, and one of the main difficulties of my women-folk is to ascertain the countries of origin of the stock offered to them. Some persons, through not being careful enough in their investigations, have brought home goods made with the blood and sweat of little cl ' l dren, who live in compounds, herded together like sheen, and receive only a few all pence a day. I hope that the Government will rise from :ts lethargy, and do something for Australia.",21
130,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"The honourable member's time has expired.  would have been amusing, had it not been so grotesque, to hear yesterday afternoon the remarks which fell from the lips of several honourable members who spoke from the other side of the chamber; the bid for the high Protectionist vote and for the support of a certain well known newspaper was so palpable that it could not escape notice. Something of the same sort occurred just before the last Pro- election, and the price that was paid for support by a certain section of candidates was that they pledged themselves to high protective duties. That promise had a marvellous effect, so far as Victoria was concerned. The party which offered what seemed to be wanted was returned with an overwhelming majority. It had such strength in both branches of the Legislature that it could do anything it liked, and was, therefore, under the obligation to fulfil the pledge by which it secured election. Therefore, shortly after the new Parliament met, an amending Tariff schedule was introduced, which increased the rates of duty on a large number of items. Those who think that the salvation of the country depends on a high Tariff were inclined to sling their hats into the air as if the millennium of prosperity was about to dawn. The amending schedule that I speak of, though it has not received the ratification of Parliament, has been in operation ever since it was introduced. Has it had the effect of benefiting local industries ? It is the Tariff which was introduced by those who are now clamouring for higher protective duties. According to the honourable member for Maribyrnong, high duties will multiply the number of industries existing in our midst. All of us, I suppose, would be inclined to support anything that we thought would do that. But what are the facts 1 I shall mention industries which have been injured by the operation of the present Tariff schedule. In the vicinity of Geelong is a large sawmilling establishment which, under the old Tariff, was a prosperous concern. Work was given there to a large number of persons, who were engaged in operating a valuable plant for sawing up logs imported from abroad. At that time timber in the rough was admitted free, but the new Tariff imposed an ad valorem duty of 5 per cent., with the result that logs are not now imported. that I speak of is lying idle, and the men who used to operate it have been thrown out of employment.  Australian logs instead of importing Japanese logs ?  classes of timber which we must import.  every kind of timber in Australia. ' Mr Bruce SMITH - The Queensland Pine Company has had to shut down its mills. I received a notice to that effect yesterday.

Ground-nut and soya bean oil is still admitted free from the United K in gdom, but under the Tariff schedule is dutiable at the rate of 3d. per gallon, if imported from other countries. does not come-from the United Kingdom, the whole importation has to pay duty. The man who clamours for high duties on everything has no conception of the real meaning of Protection. The soap making industry has been further interfered with by the duty of I d . per gallon on whale oil. If whale oil came from the United Kingdom, it could be imported free, but none of it comes from there, and consequently all of it has to pay duty amounting to £ 1 per ton - This has actually led to the closing down of some departments of soap production. Is it in the interests of the country that duties should be imposed which injure industries? Some honourable members seem to think that we should be satisfied whatever duties may be imposed, so long as they are high. They are not prepared to give serious consideration to the scientific adjustment of duties, forgetting that the finished product of one manufacture is the raw material of another. A Tariff should not be dealt with in the rough and ready fashion usually adopted.  say that the Inter-State Commission dealt with the Tariff in a rough and ready manner ?  the Tariff to the Inter-State Commission was a step in the right direction, but I am afraid that the Commission's recommendations will not be seriously regarded when the House comes to deal with the Tariff. Mr RICHAR D FOSTER - ' I think that they will be followed very closely.  stated yesterday that the balance of trade is altogether on the wrong side, so far as this year's business is concerned, our imports exceeding our exports by more than £12,000,000. We are not justified in accepting those figures without considering the surrounding circumstances. We have had seasons of unparalleled prosperity, and if we could have realized the full 'value of our wheat and wool, instead of being to the bad, we would probably have been £12,000,000 or £20,000,000 to the good.",22
132,Mr BOYD,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"We seem to be to the bad because the large sums borrowed at Home come to us in the shape of goods. Mr RICHAR D FOSTER - And we cannot export our produce, which would offset the importations.  As this oil persons say thab importation should be prohibited. But what would be the result of that ? The vessels that came here would have to come in ballast, and consequently the produce that we sent away would have to pay higher rates of freight than are charged now. Some advocate the policy of not trading with other people. But we musttrade with other people. The true principle should be to produce what we can produce to the best advantage, and supply it to other people, receiving in return what they can produce to so much better advantage. In that way there will be mutual gains to both parties to the trading. There is an agitation on foot at the present time to prohibit the importation of motor cars, which are now coming from America, whereas formerly they came from France, Great Britain, and other countries, as well as America. The motor car is no longer a luxury. We will need to depend on better means of transport if we hope to develop central Australia, and motor cars will be of great assistance in that respect, not the light vehicles that one sees about the city streets, but cars designed for the practical average work of the inland producers. If we prohibit the importation of these vehicles we make it more difficult for our producers to succeed. The honourable member for Maribyrnong considers it a shame that we are not able to produce steel plates, but is it not known to every one that the steel works we have already in Australia were held up by the recent coal strike? Steel works depend on a steady supply of coal, but those who "" r u l e the roost"" in the coal mines, not the miners themselves, but those who beguile the miners, and are paid handsomely to provoke strikes, have created a feeling of unrest in the minds of the actual workers, so that on the slightest provocation it is a case of "" down tools."" It is said that we are not holding our own as against Canada, and the statement is perfectly true. I had the privilege and pleasure of passing through Canada recently, and I was simply astonished when visiting the hives of industries there and comparing them with the condition of things in Australia. No .Tariff will be high enough to enable us to cope with the labour conditions here, because the very fact of having a high Tariff in operation is used as justification for still further labour demands.",22

The rates of pay, the hours of labour, and the conditions of city life which attract men away from rural pursuits induce them to desert the very thing that should make for our national prosperity. Surely it would be more rational for us to so frame a Tariff that the inducement would be for men to go on the land rather than come to the cities. I agree that our industries are stagnant, but I would have my friends 'look to something else than the Tariff for their 'salvation. I know that if my friends come into power after the elections, they will be no more in earnest in the matter than they have been during the past couple of years.  guarantee that a workman will give twenty shillings' worth of work for twenty shillings sterling.  matter is that we are building up in dustrial conditions that will render it absolutely impossible for Australia to manufacture anything for export. Canada is manufacturing for export. In Australia we have better natural conditions than Canada possesses, and we should be able to manufacture for export, but we cannot do it under the artificial conditions that have been created. A high Tariff is made the basis of an argument for increased pay. It increases the cost of living, and that increase is made in the the ground of a demand for increased pay. So we are going up the ladder, higher and higher, and our conditions will finally be so artificial here that workers will not be able to live in Australia. The ' appeal of the thousand carpenters to be allowed to go abroad, and work in other lands, because they cannot find employment here is a beautiful ample of the condition to which the Labour party have brought Australia. for sustenance.

161,Mr WATT,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"There was one righteous man there I Mr KING O'MALLEY - Eve n he failed to get salvation 1 Are we to wait until after the war to revise the Tariff? Are we going to allow this country to be filled with tihe dumpings of all the world? That is what it will come to. In all the warring countries there is the best and most up-to-date scientific machinery; in fact, when the war is over, Great Britain will be one of the first industrial countries of the earth. America is already so, Japan is already so, and Germany and Austria will be. If we have the courage now frame a real, one-column Tariff-and I do not say we have not tried or that there are not honourable members opposite who feel in the same way-w e shall be in a position, after the war, to say to all tike nations of the earth, ""Reciprocity."" We shall have something to sell-w e shall have a valuable market to exchange. But if , after the war, wo start to impose a Tariff, there will be so many divisions, so many columns, and so many preferences that our little industries will not be able to compete with 'those of other countries. In the little State of'Tasmania, nearly all the factories had virtually to close in fiscally fighting only the mainland; aud that was simply because the Tasmanian manufacturers were financially Weak, as compared with those of the other States. Great Britain was the greatest Protection-' ist nation on the earth for years, until she had built up her great industries,, and had millions of money invested. Then, when she had built up her mighty industries, and was able to manufacture . for the world, she started to become gradually Free Trade. She sold all world goods; but soon the world outside began to use Protection against her .; and when the war brokeout, she was no longer the greatest manufacturing power in the world. It was America that held that position, and yet America has [413]- 2 been built up by Protection, as it was Pro-' tection that built up Germany and made - that country rich. For two'years and a half Germany has beeu financing the war out of the money, credits, and wealth she gathered from the world by means of Protection. France was another Protectionist country, and is in a similar position, Britain was supposed to be a Free Trade country. Free trade, on account of her wonderful banking system, was better for Britain than Protection, in the sense that we desire it. Britain was a creditor country, and the banker of the world. London was the chief exchange city of the world for years. More exchange was written in sterling there than in all the other money denominations of the world prior to the war; but, at present, more is written in dollars. When the war is over, if Britain enters into a nonsensical trade war, she will never be the financial centre of the world again; if she does not, the financial centre of the world must go back to her. Why? to Mr CARB - Not through Protection ! Mr KING O'MALLEY - No ; it does not need Protection. It will be through her wonderful organization of ' banking, and .of acceptance houses. Just think of itl In 1907, Britain was operating the finances of the world on £120,000,000 in gold. The United States had nearly £400,000,000 in gold, and yet many of her banks closed their doors. Why 1 Because she had no great organization like Britain. Why is it that America can never become the financial centre of the world 1 Because there is no speculation going on in America, except in American securities,- On the other hand, you m a j go to Britain and speculate in any securities, almost those of MarB. That is because Britain has her bill houses, her acceptance houses, and her foreign exchanges. A Chinese merchant has tea, and a business man in Australia requires tea. The business man goes to his banker in Australia, and the banker finances him. The Chinese merchant does not know the business man, but he knows the acceptance house in London, and through it he sends the goods, the acceptance the house becoming responsible to him for the money of the Australian. This organization is lacking ih every country except Great Britain. I could easily see there were no financial men at the Paris Conference-n o men who had the slightest idea of finance-whe n the representatives talked about having a trade war. Great Britain has a trade war, then she will go through a neutral country to other countries, and those other countries wil l reach her in the same way. You cannot stop trade. Why did London become the great financial centre?",27
162,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,Because has her Navy to protect her.,28
163,Mr KING OMALLEY,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"It is because the business men of London stand out pre-eminently in the eyes of the world. When Thomas Edison was being entertained by the merchants of Berlin, he asked who stood highest in his opinion in speak. the world as business men, and he declared that Englishmen did. The financial organization in England has, moresoon over, made money cheap. The banker in Australia can lend all his money at rates, whereas the London men cannot. self. One of the reasons why I battled for years for a Commonwealth Bank and a ing that out? note issue was that every time the rate of interest rose in London, Australian bankers sent millions there on call loan, . and left Australian producers and traders without the necessary money to financedustries their obligations. What will be our tion if we allow ourselves, as the Age this morning, to go to the bad at the of £27,000,000 a year?

178,Mr KING OMALLEY,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"I have read that some American scientist has discovered that alcohol, or "" stagger-juice,"" can be utilized for motor cars instead of petrol.

179,Mr LYNCH,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,What about boggy ground in wet weather?,29
180,Mr KING OMALLEY,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"A pair of horses would cost as much to feed as would pay for the petrol for a motor car. I have read that motor cars are sold in America to the trade at £ 4 9 each. The utilization of motor cars enabled the French to drive the Germans across the Marne. If the French command had not been able to transport troops from Paris to the Marne in a few hours the Germans would have been in Paris. I wish to read what Professor Anderson, ofHarvard University, wrote in regard to the labour question. My experience is that if you meet and talk with men they will always meet you on reasonable - conditions. There were strikes enough on the trans-Australian' railway, and the men complained to me about their tucker-shops. Their complaint was just, and I immediately ordered the officials to put the tucker-shops in repair, and conduct them departmentally. They charged up the £600 worth of repairs to the cost of the first week's running of the establishment, in the same way as £60,000 was charged up for the expenses in connection with the establisnment of the Commonwealth Bank. I have been reading in the press constantly that the tuckershops lost £60 0 in a short period, and in the same way it was said that the Commonwealth Bank had lost £60,000 in the first year. If the men at the head of the railway had been good business men, they could have operated the tucker-shops at a good profit by charging 25s. per week. I know ladies who are doing well in Melbourne by charging only 18s. .per week. My name will live in connection with the Commonwealth Bank when many are dead and forgotten. The Tariff is part and parcel of the industrial life of Australia. This is what Professor Anderson says The question of industrial warfare nnd the great losses entailed by strikes and lockouts is indeed fundamental. Employers are often lacking in apprehension of the right relation between employer and employee. If the employers were to consider the employees from the view-point of their requirements as human beings-that is, men under the obligation in general to continue the work of the country through their children, who require to be wellborn, well-reared, and well-educated-the y might find themselves in agreement with the demands of the employees as to the living wage. There were, doubtless, few instances among the numberless strikes which totalled appalling losses in which the employees demanded more wages than would afford them even limited opportunity to advance the true well-being of their children and families- a well-being essential to the country's future. Do honourable members deny that?Modern industry rests on the law of supply and demand, and, therefore, proceeds on the wrong assumption, namely, that the necessary labour and men and women should be paid for on the basis of the same law of supply and demand that determines for the product of labour. That is the cause of all the trouble in Australia between the working men and their bossesThe dominating public opinion of the Commonwealth is at last becoming enlightened as to the fundamental wrong of putting human labour and the material products of labour in the same classification as articles of barter and sale. This issue goeB deeper and broader than we can realise. We know its complexity, but it isust be solved. Strikes may be stated as the recurring protest by producers of the country's wealth against the results to them of the various methods of distributing the product which modern civilization has developed to so high a degree. These methods of division include all business Bteps, from transortation to banking. I am profoundly condeut that the workers' hopes lie in the success of justice. - The rights of the producers of wealth must, as a matter of course, come before the claims of those who, controlling the distribution of the product in its multiform equations, not only fix their own salaries in the form of profits, commissions, and foes, but purpose tn continue to fix the wages of the industrial producers by individual contracts. ployers gave more attention to what is necessary for the decent living of the employees, there would be more happiness and less trouble. Haxvard was founded in the early colonial days of America, and has always been known as the home of the ' 'boodleier ' ' ; yet its Professor of Economics had the courage to state his opinions in the words I have read. If the employers did not always take the stand that, because they have the management of business affairs, they should not condescend to meet their men, but discussed differences with their employees, there would be hardly any strikes. How many strikes were there while I was in charge of the transcontinental railway? During the thirteen months before I became Minister there were sixty-one strikes. Yet how many concessions did I grant? Very few. I allowed the men to hear the other side, and, generally, they were satisfied when they had done so. That is the way in which men should be treated. Bhould not be abused and condemned by those who have plenty of money, because they will not do this or that. A working man with a family growing up sees no hope for them. God help him, say I .

Is it any wonder that we find in Holy W r it that the wicked fleeth where no man dares to follow 1 Men have come into this House pledged to the h i l t to a Protective Tariff, yet Australia is the dumping ground for the foreign producer. A tariff should be arranged scientifically so that the protection should be based on the difference between the high cost of Australian labour t h a i gives the Australian working man the chance of bring-, ing up his family in decency, and not under conditions of hunger and starvation and the cost of cheap labour outside. To claim that the cost of transportation is sufficient defence is useless. It is no defence nowadays. The Government should realise what a mighty country we have walled in , as it is, by great oceans, but it can only 'grow when its people have a love for it . We do not hear Australians singing Australian songs. The children If the emin our schools do not sing about Australia as American children sing The Star Spangled Banner.

184,Mr CARR,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Macquarie) [7.50] - I do not wish to waste the time of the House as it is being wasted. The attitude taken up by honourable members of the Opposition in regard to the Tariff is quite untenable, and no one knows it better than they do. ' They know very well that the delicate balance of the nations is such that any untoward event or presumptive action on the part of any All y at this juncture might have very far-reaching effects. Therefore, all this talk about the necessity for an immediate revision of the Tariff is so much hot air. Por one thing, time will not permit of an immediate revision of the Tariff, but, altogether apart from that point, the circumstances are such that any attempt to touch the Tariff just now would be most unwise. Honourable members opposite know this full well, hence it is only right that the country or, at any rate, those who read Hansard sliould know that all the talk that is now being put up in the House is merely an electioneering placard. The grandiloquent language of honourable members, and the spread-eagleism of the honourable member for Darwin, will not get us any f u r ther forward in Australian affairs. If honourable members were really honest in their protestations they would fall into line with what has been done on this side of the House, and would get their representations heard in the proper quarter. By actual contact with those on the other side of the world they would know just what it is possible for us to do at the present time. We know that we cannot act independently. The talk of some honourable members reminds, me of the attitude of the children of rich parents who, being secure in their positions for the time being, by reason of parental provision, can be impudent to all the world. These arrogant fools- I do not know that I should use those words, but certainly some honourable members are behaving as if we were not a country that, is absolutely dependent on the strength of our paternal protector. It is our paternal protector who has made it possible for us to go as far as we have gone and to be as independent as we are, and no. one knows better than honourable members opposite the extent to which they have exhausted all the possibilities of the liberties which we enjoy in this country. When they talk about flouting the advice which has been given from the highest sources, and about erecting a high Tariff barricade, they are simply courting disaster. When they reflect upon the actions of a Government which has recently gone out of office they are obviously reflecting upon some members of their own party. They know that perfectly well the Leader of the Opposition was largely responsible for the conduct of the Hughes Government. He was Minister for Trade and Customs in the first two Labour Governments that held office during the currency of the war, and no one knows better than he does the difficulties that stand in the way of interfering with the Tariff. I do not know that the honourable member for Yarra has been urging the revision of the Tariff at this particular time, but his followers have been urging it , and, therefore, they are reflecting on their own leader, or else the honourable member has lost the wisdom that be displayed on this side of the House by the change that has taken place.. The only way in which we can get any satisfaction on Tariff matters - and all but those who are wilfully blind can see it-is by participating in the Empire Conference that is now about to take place. If the view is accepted-whic h is unescapable-that we are simply part of an Empire which is now struggling-per haps to its death-the only hope we have of getting any terms for Australia is by participating in the Conference, realizing the exact situation, and doing what is best for all parties in the struggle. We cannot stand alone. If we could we-would be ungrateful, and to stand alone would be outrageous conduct on our part in view of our past history. But it is useless to say that we can stand alone. We cannot do so/ If honourable members who have been elected to this House do not realise the situation it is a reflection, not only upon them, but also upon the community. No one knows better than honourable members how utterly dependent we are on the success of the Empire in the gigantic struggle that is now in progress, and all that we can gain is what may be obtained by participating in the negotiations ^hat are now in progress at Home. But all this has been made impossible by honourable members opposite. I would go so far as to say that even now if they would nominate a representative he should be sent Home with the delegates already chosen. However, that matter is not under discussion now.. They have not been satisfied to take a constitutional course. .They have not been satisfied to sink party differences and take a hand as true Australians in doing the only that it is now possible for us to do. They have neglected the constitutional method. They have spurned it ; and yet they have the presumption to charge the Government in this House with not attending to the Tariff. They charge the Government with having failed to do what they know very well we dare not do.",31

A man who says, as the honourable member does, that we are at liberty to do what we please, in regard to the T a r i ff just now, in my opinion is not right in his thinking functions. It must be obvious to any man who can think consecutively that we are dependent on the rest of the Empire. We have flung ourselves into this war; we are, in fact, one of the Allies who have struck a deadly blow at the German E m pire. We have been able to do that, for the most part, only because of the might of Great B r it a in , assisted by those other noble peoples who have spilled their blood in rivers so that the little nations of the earth may have a freedom such as we have so long er.joyed.

We have House, I believe, quite a number of Free Traders, and in some parts of Australia Free Trade may be regarded as the right policy for Australia to adopt. Unfortu nately there has been a great division of opinion in regard to the particular form of Protection that should be selected. The question at issue has been whether should adhere to the old form of Protecward tion, under which only those who invest in industry are protected, or whether we sbould. adopt New Protection under the consumers and the workers are also protected. This diversity of opinion has prevented Australia from securing a higher Tariff than she enjoys today. New Protection is one of the planks in the Labour platform, and I believe it approaches more closely to the desires of the Free Traders than does the policy of the old Protection. The only argument that the Free Trader can advance against Protection is that the i m position of a duty on any commodity makes that commodity dearer to the consumer. If by a rational scheme of Protection we can protect both the consumer and the producer, I fail to see why Free should take exception to it . The principle of the New Protection is now Some four years howago the Labour party, then in power, were condemned all over' Australia for their failure to revise the Tariff.

192,Mr MATHEWS,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"I am leading up to that matter. I have never departed from I was the as only one to keep in step at that time; the I defended our Government, which remained office from 1910 t ill 1913. The present leader of our party was then Minister for shed, Trade and Customs, and was condemned by the Protectionists for his failure to prebring in a Tariff imposing higher duties. in this As a responsible Minister he had to take that condemnation; if he did not like it , he ought to have resigned. Towards the end of the life of that Parliament Mr . - Fisher, to my surprise, announced that he intended to throw over our ideas as to the New Protection, and that if , as the result of the then approaching election, we were we returned to power, he would . bring fora new Tariff providing for the old form of Protection, taking the chance of some future opportunity presenting itself which to protect the consumer.",33
193,Mr HANNAN,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,That was only provided that the Labour party's proposals for the amendment of the Constitution were defeated.,33
194,Mr MATHEWS,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"That was a proviso to which I objected. The Fisher Government did not come back with a majority in the new Parliament. Conservatives had a majority of one, and we enjoyed ourselves very much. Since the passing of the 1908 Tariff no effort has been made to bring in such a schedule as would establish the true form of Protection. ' There are many reasons for this, and I propose to put one or two before 'the House. The present Parliament came into existence after the outbreak of war, and both parties avowedly supported Protection, despite the fact that both had a leavening of Free Traders. At the last general election the Labour party came back with a majority, but with the exception of a little b it of patchwork, which was good so far as it went, nothing has been done to establish a truly Protective Tariff. The amendments brought in by our present leader, who was then Minister for Trade and Customs, provided for certain increases, but the Tariff was full of anomalies in the sense that in many 'Cases the duties imposed were not sufficiently Protective. At the close of this Parliament we are in practically the same position that we occupied in 1908. I shall not quote figures, but we know that the Tariff of 1908, to a large extent, built up industries in Australia, with the result that in 1910-11 our exports were considerably in excess of our imports. Since that time we have so gone to the bad that today our exports are about £12,000,000 less in value than our imports. There is not an honourable member, not .a thinking man or woman in Australia, whether Free Trader or Protectionist, but realizes that this cannot go on. We have to consider coolly and calmly what can be done to break down that wall which stands in the way of our doing what we know we ought to do from an industrial standpoint. This is a serious question for every honourable member, no matter what constituency he represents. Even the honourable member for Parkes, who is no doubt of the same opinion he was years ago, must admit there is something wrong when our imports f ar exceed our exports, and we are not producing gold to pay for the difference.",34
195,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"We are accumulatbelieve, ing millions of pounds' worth of'produce, which the lack of shipping does not enable us to include in our exports.",34
196,Mr MATHEWS,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"The rats and mice are eating that produce in my constitueucy. I do not wish to frighten those who The may have their money invested in the produce, but if things are half as bad. as I have been told, they are very bad indeed.",34
197,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"The honourable member will admit that if there had been unlimited shipping, and unlimited freedom to export, our exports would have been quite as large, if not larger, than our imports 1",34
198,Mr MATHEWS,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"That , of course, sJ a good Free-Trade argument.",34
199,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,It is a matter of fact.,34
200,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,It simply depends on the addition table.,34
201,Mr MATHEWS,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"The honourable member for Parkes knows that a ton of wheat is not of equal value with a ton of manufactured articles. Of course, it is the argument of Free Traders that if we do not import goods we cannot send away our raw material-that if ships are brought here in ballast, the fact only adds> to the cost of sending away our produce. Irrespective of the fact that there are millions of pounds' worth of wheat and other commodities that cannot be exported because of the peculiar position in which we' find ourselves today, it must be admitted that our exports have not increased in the same ratio that our imports have. If we can import tons of commodities, we ought to be able to export produce of equal value, for it is the value, and not the tonnage, that has to be considered. However, what is our position today ? W& aretold that there are certain things we cannot do because of the present situation. Tbat is said by the present Government, and was said by the preceding Government, and the Government before that. There is something in the air that prevents our moving. The interests of Australia are now intermixed with those of the Empire as never before. We are 1 told that, in pre-war times, we werelef t by the Mother Land to carry out our own free will in regard Fo o u r Tariff arrangements; but the position todav is quite different. Indeed, the position, so f ar as the outside public is concerned, is surrounded with mystery. 1 however, that the Protectionist associations and Protectionist newspapersare just as conversant with the situation as we are ourselves. When, some three weeks ago, the Protectionist associations, of Australia waited on the Prime Minister on the question of the reopening of the Tariff, I told one of the delegates that I could not understand why I was not allowed to discuss the matter, while he and his friends and the Protectionist press, who knew just as much as we do about the situation, were allowed to say what they liked. I cannot think that these newspapers and organizations are ignorant of the difference between the situation before the war and the situation now; and yet they are allowed to publicly condemn this Parliament, and every honourable member here, for not doing certain things that they deem desirable. are men in gaol today for doing much less than these associations and newspapers have done during the last few weeks. A r e we to understand that one section of the community may discuss such matters, while another section, which happens to consist of members of Parliament, have their mouths closed ? If so, it does not appeal to me as a fair position in any respect. I believe that the Protectionist associations and the Protectionist press are quite justified in the stand they have taken, but their weakness is that they opposed the referendum in the year before last. At that time the Labour party-of course, this was before the rift-ha d decided to take a referendum on certain questions, an affirmative reply to which would, have enabled this Parliament to protect the manufacturer, the consumer, and worker alike. We remember, however, the intrigue that took place; how the State Governments promised the present Prime Minister, then the Leader of the Labour party, to concede to the Commonwealth Parliament certain powers which would render the referendum unnecessary. Unfortunately, that offer was accepted; and we know now how it was honoured. Now we are told that there is no need for action, because the Government possess all the requisite power under the W a r Precautions Act . It is true that the H i gh Court has said that that is so, but, in my opinion as a layman, it is bad law.",34
202,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,Y o u have opinion because you are a layman!,35
203,Mr MATHEWS,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"E x a c t l y ; but claim to have formed an opinion from my experience of the Court during have been a member of this Parliament. When the referendum was proposed, we were told that it was a most inopportune time-that we ought not to have the turmoil and strife of such a contest while we were at war. Further, some cant was in dulged in , and we were implored to think about our boys at the front, and not to divide the people at such a time. That is the sort of stuff we were asked to listen to. The position was just as serious at the front, and even more serious, in 1915, than it is today; and then, as now, we had these objections raised. The truth is that the Protectionist associations of Australia did not wish to give this Parliament power to fix prices and wages conditions, bu t preferred the old form of There Protection; and, unfortunately, the Free Traders helped them to gain their point. Newspapers are allowed to change their minds every three months or three days, but if a politician, after due consideration, arrives at the conclusion that he was not right in the past, he is hounded down from one constituency to another. The Protectionist leaders and newspapers said, in 1915, that the time was too serious for the submission of the Constitution Alteration Bills to a referendum, because it would rend the people asunder. I ask whether that referendum would have rent the people asunder as much as did the referendum on conscription.",35
204,Mr RODGERS,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Are there any honourable members on your side, in addition to° yourself, who bother about the New Protection nowadays?",35
205,Mr MATHEWS,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"The New Protection is on the Labour platform, and it must be fought for - If the Labour party returns from the elections with a majority, the New Protection issue will be submitted to the people very soon, and we shall not be sold next time as we were on the last, occasion.",35
206,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,That is a threat.,35
207,Mr MATHEWS,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"The honourable member will recollect that, three years ago, when the Liberals brought about a double dissolution in the hope of wiping out the Labour party in the Senate, they were just as sanguine as they are now. They may not be quite as sanguine next that week after Willia m Holman has been wiped out in New South Wales. HonorI able members should not be too positive about being returned; their fate is to be the time. I settled by their masters. I believe that the Protectionist press is correct in the stand it is taking now. Australia is the only country in the world that has unemployed, and if there is any difficulty in deciding what shall be done by the different nations engaged in this fight in the matter of commercial arrangements, I remind the British people that Australia is in a different situation from any other portion of the Empire; and if it be necessary for them to make arrangements with our Allies as to future commercial relations, they should leave Australia out of any such arrangements, and make an agreement that relates only to the trade of Great Britain . Britain day is one vast 'hive of industry, because a great portion of its population is engaged in producing munitions of war. A similar state of affairs obtains in the countries of the other combatants. tralia the position is different. We have not had the opportunity to engage in the production of munitions, and we have not the industrial establishments for the purpose. Moreover, we shall never have them if some specious reason is always advanced as to why we should not make our Tariff effective. I wish to read an extract from to-night's Herald. Messages of similar import have been published frequently. I do not know whether that is done for the purpose of taunting Australians, or to in cite them to gird up their loins and to make them"" realise how foolish they have been in the past. The paragraph readsI t is announced by the Imperial Munitions Board that an extensive shipbuilding industry is to be established in Canada for the British Government. Contracts have been let for vessels to cost £5,000,000. The plans include steel ships of a substantial tonnage. New yards are likely to be started, and ships being built for Norwegian interests are to be taken over.",35
208,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,There are labour troubles there.,36
209,Mr MATHEWS,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"The wages Canada are as good as those in Australia. But if honourable members wish to avoid labour troubles by underpaying men, let us hope there always will be labour troubles - Wages and living conditions are as good in Canada as in Australia, yet the Dominion can build ships for Great Britain. This talk about wages being too high, and labour troubles too frequent, is all clap-trap.  navvies received 2 dollars a day for ten hours work, and carpenters and painters, 1 dollar 65 cents.",36
210,Mr MATHEWS,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"I do not believe any workmen can do more work in a week, working ten hours per day, than if they work eight hours per day. When, a few years ago, artisans were imported from Great B r it a in ancl America and set to work alongside our men the Australian pace nearly killed them. In time they became accustomed to the pace at which the Australian works for eight hours per day, but at first they could not hold their own. I believe that the honourable member for Henty was satisfied, after a visit toabroad, that as much work is done in eight hours in Australia as in ten hours in America.",36
211,Mr RODGERS,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,Then tell us why we do not get industries established here? In Aus,36
212,Mr MATHEWS,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,Because we have not had sufficient Protective duties.,36
213,Mr RODGERS,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,Is that the only reason?,36
214,Mr MATHEWS,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"It is the principal one. I believe that the industrial magnates of Australia are just as willin g as those of other countries to extend their establishments if they receive enough fiscal encouragement. The reason we have not more industries is not that wage3 are too high, but that the duties are too low, and we lack organization.",36
215,Mr RODGERS,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,Can you tell us the relative duties of Australia and Canada?,36
216,Mr MATHEWS,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"The honourable Ottawa, Tuesday. member for Kooyong has already placed the figures in Hansard, but, speaking from memory, I think the Canadian duty would average about per cent, more than the Australian.  round increase of 7£ per ""cent, in our Tariff would be sufficient? no Mr MATHEWS - On e cannot say off-hand what a 7 \ per cent, increase in would mean. There may be a 10 per cent, duty on certain commodities for revenue purposes only, and no more duty is necessary, but there may be other duties of 35 per cent ad valorem, which should be increased to 100 per cent, if they are to and be thoroughly Protective. I know that the industrial men of Australia are just as greedy as any other capitalists, and if a high Tariff is imposed without protection for the consumer they will take advantage of it . The men working in the industry, too, will get all they can, but I shall not blame them for that while the employer makes all the interest he can on the money he has invested. What is good for the master is good for Andrew. When we see Canada getting enormous contracts from Great Britain, and have regard to the fact that the Dominion has been manufacturing munitions during the war, we must see that Australia will go by the board unless it takes some steps to protect itself. Men are returning from the front, and a large proportion of them will not be too eager to resume occupations in which they were engaged before they left Australia. The war will unfit many of them for their former trades. Of course, all the warring countries will be in the same position, but the others are industrially prepared and Australia is not.",36
217,Mr RODGERS,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Agree d that the necessary Tariff protection is a contributory factor, what are the other main deterrents to getting industries on a good footing ?",37
218,Mr MATHEWS,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Some say that distance is a deterrent. I do not know whether that is so or not, but I do know that the principal deterrent to an increase in our industrial activities is the insuffiof the workers. ciency of the Tariff duties. The men who have invested their money in industrial establishments are not likely to increase their productivity unless they can feel assured that they will get a ful l opportunity of making good. They are not likely to substitute new machinery for old until they are assured of a return on the money invested. I admit that a Tariff a thousand times higher than the present will be useless if we attempt to manufacture with the old order of machinery. But before up-to-date machinery can be installed we must give men who invest their money some security of tenure. I know that by a sudden increase of duties there will be a possibility of a peculiar situation being created; but surely there is enough common sense in Australia to devise some legislative machinery that will give security to the manufacturer and to the consumers during the transition from the present order of things to the new. I suggest, in order to prevent the inflation of prices when the increased duty is imposed, that if it is known that other countries are rushing material into Australia in order to sell before the higher duty operates, the Government should be given power to prevent that material being landed. If we are not likely to manufacture locally for a number of years sufficient of a commodity that is in much demand, and there is a likelihood of some body gaining enormously by an increase in the duty, we might make provision either that the duty should be increased by degrees, or that it shall come into operation, by proclamation, as soon as there is' a reasonable guarantee that the interests of the consumers are safeguarded. It is useless to say that some arrangement cannot be devised that will meet all requirements. An idea has been created in the minds of many people that we have no right to discuss the Tariff, but I say, again, that Australia is in a different position from the rest of the Empire. Other countries are prepared for manufacturing; Australia is not, and something must be done immediately, otherwise Australia will be made a scapegoat.",37
219,Mr ORCHARD,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,What inducement is there to create industries with the labour troubles we have?,37
220,Mr MATHEWS,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,Our labour troubles are brought about by the underpayment,37
221,Mr ORCHARD,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,Is there not a tendency for the men to want the employer to take all the risk while they get all the profit ?,37
222,Mr MATHEWS,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Gullive r may have visited a country where such a state of things prevailed, but that does not happen in Australia. Here the employer has always got his pound of flesh, and, under our present system, will continue to do so. Honourable members have spoken about the Australian rates of wages being as good as those of Canada, but, according to the Labour Gazette, a publication of the Department of Labour of the Dominion of Canada, stone-cutters there get 65 cents, or 32Jd. per hour for an eighthours' day; bricklayers, 70 cents, or 2s. l i d . per hour; masons the same; tilelayers 75 cents; and carpenters 50 cents, or 2s. I d . per hour, or over 16s. per day.",37
223,Mr ORCHARD,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"The cost of living is higher in Canada than in Australia. When I was there, in September last, I was charged lOd. when I asked for jam for my breakfast.",37
224,Mr MATHEWS,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Honourable members are always shifting their ground. When the workers of Australia are paid as well as the workers of Canada there will be no Labour troubles here, and what Canada has done Australia should be able to do. Canada pays high wages, and yet manufactures for export. Why cannot we do the same ? We 'have been fooled in the past, and no doubt every one is somewhat to blame. Now that we are on the eve of au election we are told that we must not breathe a word about the Tariff question. If , for international reasons, Great Britain is compelled to make concessions to her Allies, Australia cannot be expected to do the same. If she does, she will get the worse of the deal-no t being prepared for competition on such terms. While we have our duties to the Empire, we have also our responsibilities to the people who sent us here, and we must not forget their needs.  should have liked to see the Tariff revised before the election, because the people were thing for the pastoralist. told when last we faced the music that Parliament would revise the Tariff. Many Victorian and some New South Wales members were strongly in favour of Protection Tariff revision. But the circumstances arising out of the war have prevented Tariff reform, and I am surprised that some of those who sit behind the Ministry now should taunt the members of this party with.' having done nothing for the it will fetch. two and a half years during which they were in power. An industry should like to see get a fair show is the steel industry and allied industries. I believe that the workmen engaged i those industries in Australia have among tliem some of the most experienced men at their trade in the world, and every who has the interest of the country heart feels that something should be done to establish the manufacture of steel and iron in this country. The honourable member for .Maribyrnong has referred to me as a converted Free Trader. He said last night that I have shed my last Free Trade skin. My fiscal creed is this: I believe in voting for what I think best for Australia. I believe that Protection-no t Protection run mad-is necessary for many of our big industries. When the last Tariff was under discussion, however, the honourable member for Wimmera was almost crying in his anxiety to have the duty on dried fruits increased. He spoke of the great industry that was flourishing at Mildura and Renmark, and said that Australia should make all the dried fruit s that she consumed. Having heard his plea for the protection of the dried f r u it industry, I voted for the duty that the Government then proposed. But I find in going through the files of the Age that since the war began dried fruit s have risen in price, not £ 1 per ton, but many pounds per ton, although for the last two years the crops have been better than ever before. The consumer has not benefited in the least by the duty on dried fruits. What do we gain by exchanging a f at importer for a f at manufacturer? When I see one or the other sitting behind a f at cigar driving a motor car, I cannot notice any difference.",37
225,Sir ROBERT BEST,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"What about the good f at pastoralist?  a primary industry. Protection does noWe, in the this Maranoa district, pay through the nose for everything that we drink, everything that we wear, and everything that we use. 'has made the dried f r u it in dustry a monopoly in Australia. No one who is not within the combine can sell his fruit.",38
226,Mr FOWLER,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,Y e t the surplus is dumped into other countries for whatever  which I consumer pays through the nose.,38
227,Mr SAMPSON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"If the f r u it had been sent abroad those connected with the in n dustry would have got pounds per ton more for it .  one it abroad for want of space on cargo at steamers. The honourable member knows that, because he is always crying out about the Wheat Pool and asking when the wheat will be got away. Why is not something done for the doll's eye in dustry ? What has been the effect of the duty on oatmeal, a food which is used in every poor man's household ? The crop of oats in Australia this year was abnormal, yet oatmeal has increased in price by £ 2 - p er ton.",38
228,Mr SAMPSON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"What is the oat crop in the Maranoa district like?  grasses there. God has favoured us with a good grass country, on which we grow good meat for the people of the cities. The more I look into Protection the deeper I get into the mud. I would like to have hack the good old days of this Parliament when we first discussed Tariff mattors. I remember then how Protectionist members used to. inveigh against the rich importers. But how does the. working man or other consumer benefit by doing away with the rich importer and creating another brand of rich man, the wealthy manufacturer ? If Protection is to benefit industries in this young country, I am going to give all the reasonable Protection that any Government chooses to propose, because I believe in starting industries and in giving them some chance of succeeding. I believe al?o in making people use Australian goods. Goods manufactured in Australia are equal to any that are produced in other parts of the world. About three years ago, when I was in a shop in South Melbourne purchasing a pair of boots for 17s. Gd., two working men entered the establishment. They described the boots they wished to purchase, and the attendant in the shop brought along some of Marshall's boots, good enough for the King to wear. But they said, "" We want something better than that. Have you no imported boots?"" He said, "" Yes ; bat they are very expensive."" And what did he do but put some of Marshall's boots into a box labelled Bostock, and bring them along; but these men said they were not the right shape, and they left the shop. Victorians are rampant Protectionists, and these Victorians wanted to buy imported boots at 30s. a pair, while I , as a Free Trader, was satisfied with the Australian article at 17s. 6d. a pair. On another occasion I went into a shop in Swanston-street to purchase a pair of boots. I asked for Australian made boots, and they tried to palm off on me an imported pair, but I would not take them, although I am a Free Trader. It just shows what thoroughbred Protectionists will do. The iron industry is a great industry, and we have all the raw material here', millions of tons of iron ore merely awaiting the efforts of the miner to dig it out. If we give a measure of protection to that industry, and those which are allied to it , I believe that Australia will become a rich and prosperous exporting and manufacturing nation. Question resolved.in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2In this Act "" Tariff proposals "" means the proposed duties of Customs introduced into the House of Representatives on the following dates, namely :3rd December, 1914 -(Relatin g to the - Tariff on goods other than those imported from and the produce or manu^ facture of the Union of South Africa). 3rd December, 1914 -(Relatin g to the Tariff on goods imported from and the produce or manufacture of the Union of South Africa). 12th December, 1914. 9th June, 1915. 12th November, 1915.",38
229,Mr TUDOR,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Yarra) [9.5] - I informed honourable members yesterday that it was my desire to move some amendments to the Bill. I am afraid that if we pass this clause the proposals referred to will have been agreed to, and it will be i m possible to amend them: Therefore, I am anxious to know whether this is the right place for moving any amendment.",39
230,Mr GROOM,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,The next clause is' the validating provision. This is merely a definition clause.,39
231,Mr TUDOR,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"This is the clause covering the Tariff proposals of 3rd December,. 1914, and I propose to move an amendment to item 129 of the Tariff proposals submitted on that date. This item deals with jute piece goods for the manufacture of cornsacks, which. I think, should be free of duty, no matter from what country they are imported. As honourable members know, they come solely from India, but I propose to move that they be free. I propose to take the same step in regard to item 134 dealing with cornsacks but I do not wish it to be said that I sought to remove the duty on cornsacks, and place the local manufacture at a disadvantage by retaining the duty on its raw material. I move That item 129 of the schedule submitted on 3rd December, 1914, as follows :- "" Hessians and brattice cloth; jute piece Roods; bookbinders' cloth; bunting-a d val, free, and 10 per cent."" be amended by leaving out the words "" 10 per cent."" and inserting in lieu thereof, the word "" free."" My object is to make the general Tariff on these goods free.",39
232,Mr GROOM,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"On a point of order, I submit that the amendment is not relative to clause 2, which simply defines what resolutions are to be validated by clause 3. The honourable member has moved an amendment of an item in the Tariff proposals, but that is not relevant to the clause before the Committee.",39
233,Mr TUDOR,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"I do not see any other portion of the Bill where I canmove an amendment. I am anxious'that the collections of duties should be validated aa is proposed in clause 3, and I cannot see that clause 4, dealing with the construction of certain items of Tariff proposals, presents any opportunity for moving in the direction I desire. If I am assured that I cannot move any amendment on this clause, I shall have to move that the ruling be dissented from .",40
234,Mr FOWLER,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"This is a Bill for an Act to validate the collections of duties of Customs under Tariff proposals. Therefore, any amendment such as that suggested by the honourable member is necessarily precluded - I contend that it is not in order to submit an amendment of the nature moved by the honourable member to a Bill which, merely proposes to validate the collection of certain duties. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN (Mr ATKINSON) - The amendment cannot come under clause 2. and so far as I can see from a very cursory glance at the Bill , it cannot be accepted on any clause. I rule, therefore, that the amendment is out of order.",40
235,Mr TUDOR,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"I am sorry; but I must move that the ruling be dissented from . The Government surely did not draw the Bill in such a way that they could say, "" We were prepared to consider any amendments, but the Chairman ruled them out of order."" The words "" Tariff proposals,"" in clause 2, certainly refer to the proposals which were) laid on the table on the 3rd December, 1914 . Mr GROOM - The clause simply provides that' for the purpose of this measure, "" T a r if f proposals"" means the proposed duties of customs introduced into the House of Representatives on a .certain date. The honourable member seeks to amend a schedule that was before the Committee of Ways and Means some time ago.",40

237,Dr MALONEY,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Melbourne) [9.14] I second the motion. The Assistant M i nister is apparently carrying out a win, tie, or wrangle policy, which is only in accord with the actions of the Ministry in regard to another place. . Mr W . ELLIOTJOHNS ON (Lang) [9.15] - I maintain that the ruling of the Chairman is sound. The purpose of this Bill is primarily to validate duties which are being collected under a resolution of the House, and not by the authority of an Act of Parliament. It is undesirable, for reasons which have already been explained elsewhere-reason s of an international character-to reopen the Tariff at the present time; we cannot do it owing to the war. This Bill will enable us legally to retain the revenues that have been collected' during the past three years under resolution laid before the Committee of Ways, and Means. It will also legalize the collection .of these duties until such time as a new Parliament shall have been elected and can deal with the whole question of the Tariff.' If you, sir, had decided that any item could be amended, I should have claimed the right to propose reductions in a number of items occurring in the schedule before that which . the honourable member for Yarra desired to amend. I should, for instance, have prooosed to make certain amendments in division 5, which deals with textiles. As it is, I submit, sir, that, having regard to the title of the Bill , which is to validate the collections, your ruling is correct.",40
238,Mr JENSEN,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Bass-Minister for Trade and Customs) [9.18] - I wish it to be clearly understood by the Committee that it is not the intention of the Government to accept any amendment whatsoever. Those of which we have given notice are not designed to raise or lower duties, but merely to validate the duties already imposed.",40

It seems that nothing can be safe in this country so long as the present Government is in power; and this is only another infamy added to many more committed by them. It is preposterous that a Ministry, without a majority in another place, should take such a stand, and absolutely put aside a definite promise made by Mr Andrew Fisher, when Prime M i nister, that the Tariff should be dealt with in the first session of this Parliament. Meeting after meeting of Parliament has been held, and any attempt to deal with the Tariff has been blocked by the Free Traders in Caucus, and in the House. It is simply ridiculous to tell us, in mysterious tones, that we would ""Tremble if we only knew all "" ; and I regard it as an insult to a great nation who has been our f a it h f u l ally, and carried out every pledge she has made. In a book on Japan that I published, and in my speeches in this House, I have said that which enables me to now speak freely; and nothing that could be said now could be stronger than what I have written and spoken. I resent the idea that the Tariff should be delayed on a pretext so frivolous, and that I should be prevented from submitting a proposal that would permit the Government, under the War Precautions Act, or some other legal process, to remove Tariff anomalies and assist manufacturers whose businesses are dying, and whose employees are being thrown out of work.",42

If the Government will not accept amendments in this Chamber, I hope there may be a majorit y in another place which will compel them to do so.

It is therefore necessary "" to validate the collections that have been in made up to the present. We need also authority for future collections, and the Bill authorizes the continuance of collecting. It validates the collection of all is revenue that has been received up to date, and authorizes and validates the continuance of collections in accordance with the Tariff proposals, introduced on the dates mentioned. As the honourable member for Henty has pointed out, in some instances where duties are remitted by these proposals, they are being collected under the authority of the Customs Tariff Act 1908-11.",43
273,Mr HANNAN,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"My point is that, dition to validating the collection of certain duties, the Bill practically adopts in globo Tariff proposals which we have not had an opportunity to discuss.",44

I was prevented from moving to amend an item of the Tariff on the ground that the amendment went beyond the order of leave. I think that the clause, in providing for the amendment of certain items, also goes beyond the order of leave. Had the Government had the courage to say, "" We intend to prevent you from moving any amendment of the Tariff schedule,"" it would have adopted a straightforward attitude, but it is now sheltering behind the ruling of the Temporary Chairman. I spoke last week of my intention to move this amendment. By a side wind the Government is handing back £139,000 obtained from the duty on cornsacks, a duty that I have never favoured. Now we have an opportunity to wipe out that duty. Ministers also propose to hand back to the sugar farmers £500,000 that they have made in adby selling sugar to the people.",44

288,Mr FOWLER,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"On a point of order, the honourable member for Yarra is reflecting on the conduct of the Chairman. He is endeavouring to point out that the Chairman is preventing private members from moving what the Government are permitted to move. I point out that the Chairman has ruled that certain amendments cannot be accepted because they are not in order, and that that was the necessary distinction before the Chairman when he gave his ruling.",44
289,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION, I ask the honourable member for Yarr a to confine his remarks to his motion.,44
290,Mr TUDOR,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"I understand that the ruling is that the amendment that I moved cannot be moved on clause 4 - I have moved that the ruling be dissented from , and I am pointing out reasons for so doing. The Government have not come forward with a straightforward proposal to deal with the duty on cornsacks. We imported £1,400,000 worth of cornsacks last year, and the farmers will not have to pay a 10 per cent, duty ou that amount. That is the position. Either the Wheat Board will have to refund 10 per cent, on £1,400,000 out of the farmers' profits, or the money will come out of Consolidated Revenue.

296,Mr GROOM,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"That may be so; but the honourable member for Yarra knows that what I am saying is correct.

299,Mr HIGGS,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"This is a Bill to validate certain collections of duties, and for other purposes. What are those other purposes? Another purpose is the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition to make jute piece-goods free, instead of charging 10 per cent., on them. I contend that the Leader of the Opposition is just as entitled to move an amendment to say what the construction of the Tariff shall be, as the Minister for Trade and Customs is to propose what the construction of the Tariff shall be in regard to four items of the Tariff"". We wish to add to the four items, and I submit that we should be permitted to do so. No doubt honourable members will vote to support the Chairman; but they will not deceive the general public in regard to the conduct of Ministers, namely, bringing down a Bill to which amendments cannot be moved.",45

305,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"I ask the honourable member to withdraw his statement unreservedly. - Mr Rodgers - I do so. The honorber able member for Yarra, under the guise of disagreeing with your ruling, made a statement that is absolutely rect, and he knows it. He was the only Minister of the Eisher Government who cornsacks. knew what was to be the duty on cornsacks. Until he unloosed the Tariff in this Chamber, no one else knew what the duty was to be. Yet now the honourable product. member says that he does not believe in that duty, and he is seeking to have i removed. I remember the facts, and the sequence of events well. When the orable member brought into the Chamber a proposal to impose a duty of 10 per on .cornsacks, honourable members were then sitting in Opposition, took certain course of action, the object which would have been to remove that duty.",46
306,Mr TTJDOK,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,That is not correct.,46

Consequestion quently, the course of procedure that Opposition proposed to take waa not sued ; but several honourable members represented country constituencies waited, by appointment, on the honourable member for Yarra in his Ministerial room, and pressed every phase of the cornsack quesits tion on him. They asked for the removal of the duty, but the Minister was adato mant; he would not budge an inch. Yet today he has the hypocrisy to come forward and pretend that he would like to see the duty on cornsacks removed. It merely a belated election dodge that will nob deceive any one. When the honourable member says that he is in favour of the removal of the duty, he knows very well that he would not yield or budge an inch when he was asked to remove the duty.",46

Let me say that every member who of the Fisher Government went through a every item in the Tariff schedule. The of present Minister for Trade and Customs, who was a member of that Administration, will bear out my statement' that some items were included in that schedule absowith which I did not agree. What I brought down to the House, therefore, was the product of the Government. Once I laid it on the table of the House I was responsible for it , and I accepted the responsibility just as I have always been prepared to accept my responsibility The honourable member for Wannon said, further, that on the of the duty on cornsacks I rethe mained adamant to the appeals of every purdeputation that waited upon me when I who held office as Minister for Trade and Customs. As I said a night or two ago, when I held office as a Minister I never told a deputation that I would agree to proposals; I invariably said that I would submit the proposals put before me the Cabinet. It was not possible for me, or any other individual Minister, to frame the Tariff schedule. The Ministry is as a whole framed our policy, and I make this statement so that honourable members may not be under any misaprehension as to how the Tariff was framed, or in regard to the answers I furnished as a Minister to any deputation which waited upon me.",46

317,Mr CORSER,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Surely your leader does PAIRS. not approve of this proposal ? Dr ' MALONEY - I do not bother about my leader. The clause would give the Government power to deal with the matter of drugs with German names; and it is a fact that, in New South Wales, enemy aliens, who had their patents cancelled, have been granted new patents. The clause would cover the interregnum which always follows a dissolution, and would enable the Government of the day to perform a duty that honourable members have carelessly and callously neglected. It is a mere verbal quibble to regard our prolonged sitting as one session, and I am sure that any average man, or any member of the House, does not regard it in that light. It is a mere technicality, that is used to cover the pledge given by Mr Fisher. If I am beaten in Committee, I shall repeat the proposal in the House, if the rules of Parliament permit.",47
318,Mr FOWLER,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,Does the honourable member think it would be safe to give this Government all the power he proposes?,48
319,Dr MALONEY,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"If there was only on© honest man, two honest men, three honest men, or four honest men-and I believe there are four-in the Government, they would check even their leader if he took unfair advantage of the clause, and, further, the shadow of the coming elections would keep them within bounds. Then, again, there are honourable members opposite who are not too sure that they can support all that the Government have done since it was formed, after the huckstering and bickering about the apportionment of the portfolios. There are men who call themselves Liberals, and, perhaps, others who do not decorate themselves with the name, who can be relied on to assist the four honest men I have mentioned, if the Government seek to do any injustice in their dying days.",48
320,Mr JENSEN,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Bass-Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.50] - I am afraid » I shall have to use the same argument in relation to this amendment as I used in relation to other amendments. is one to validate something that has been done, namely, the collection of certain duties. Here is an amendment which goesquite beyond the validation of the duties, and proposes to give the Government power to increase duties. This, as I say, is quite outside the title of the and, further, it would place a wonderful power in the hands of any Government, and leave them to do practically what they liked with the Tariff. The Government have a certain power now, inasmuch as they may meet in Cabinet, and, at any time, place on the table a Tariff resolution to at once take effect. That power the clause only seeks to give in another way.",48
321,Mr KELLY,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Wentworth) [10.55] - I cordially sympathise with both the mover of the proposed new clause and the M in ister. The latter gentleman is very naturally anxious to have the Committee assume that he is one of the four righteous persons to whom the honourable member referred in his eulogistic speech, and he is, therefore, prepared to believe that the Government could properly exercise the tremendous powers proposed.",48
322,Dr MALONEY,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,I am willing to delete the proposal in regard to increasing duties.,48
323,Mr KELLY,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Then all we have is a suggestion to the Government that they may, by Order in Council, reduce any duties. For the first time. I have seen some disagreement between the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Melbourne, inasmuch as the latter would give power to reduce duties. This, I take it , is a well-considered motion, submitted after consultation with the party opposite, for I am quite certain the honourable member for Melbourne would not launch a proposal of such importance without a solid backing behind him. I am also sure that the honourable member would not so change the apparent purpose of the motion without the complete acquiescence, not only of his party, but of his leader. I hope that the motion will not be ruled out of order, but that we may have a vote on it as it stands, or as the honourable member for Melbourne is prepared to see it amended. I should like to see the members of the Opposition voting with the honourable member for Melbourne to put this enormous power in the hands of a Government he so implicitly trusts. The Bill Mr TUDOR - I would not, with the crowd over there!",48
324,Mr KELLY,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"He r e we have a "" r if t in the lute "" at once, even before we get to a division. There seems to be a split in the party- a split between the honourable Bill , member for Melbourne and his nominal leader. As I said before, I think honourable members should have a chance of expressing their utmost confidence in the Government, or of being consistent in the policy they have so recently adopted.",48
325,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Denison) [10.58]. - I wish to tender my "" meed of praise "" to the honourable member for Melbourne for having displayed such confidence in the Government, especially after the hard and bitter criticism of the Prime Minister from honourable members opposite. Tbis shows the big heart of the honourable member for Melbourne, and that he, in his innermost soul, has every confidence in the Prime Minister, and is willing to trust him. This confidence will go on record for all time; and it is to be regretted that it is not in order fco take a division on this important motion. The honourable member for Melbourne is to be commended, and I shall certainly, throughout the length aud breadth of my electorate, emphasize the fact that, when it came to a critical point, he had such confidence in the Government as to trust them to deal with the Tariff as they choose. Why do the honourable member's colleagues desert him? They have immediately held a party meeting, and did not even wait until they got upstairs before holding it They might have waited until they got to the party room before bringing pressure to bear on the honourable member, and I appeal to that honourable gentleman not to allow pressure to be exerted on him in the House. Why should he be compelled to withdraw such a proposal ? It was the honourable member for Indi, I think, wbo brought the pressure to bear, for he rushed and brought his leader in, and now we find the honourable member for Melbourne deserted because he has shown his confidence in the man whom his colleagues have so bitterly criticised.",48
326,Dr MALONEY,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Melbourne) [11.0]. - Acceptin g the suggestion of the Minister and the honourable member for Wentworth, I should like to alter my amendment to readNotwithstanding anything contained in any Act, the Government of the day shall be empowered to correct any anomalies by regulation under the War Precautions Act, or by any other legal process, to give Protection to our manufactures.",49
327,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,""" The amendment as first submitted by the honourable member was clearly out of order, and in its amended form I must still rule it,out of order, on the ground that it is irrelevant to the Bill, and inconsistent with the title. Title agreed to. Bill reported with amendments. Standing Orders suspended. Motion (by Mr JENSEN) proposed - That the report be adopted.",49
328,Mr KELLY,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,Wentworth) [11.3] - I should like to draw attention to an injustice which an honourable member has suffered through his inability to move an amendment which appeared to me to be pertinent to the measure.,49
329,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,The honourable member cannot in the House discuss anything that took place in Committee.,49
330,Mr KELLY,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,May I not speak on the report stage of the Bill? Mr DEPUTY. SPEAKER - Yes .,49
331,Mr KELLY,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"The thought has been in the minds of a number of honourable members that perhaps the present Government is so entirely worthy of the confidence, not only of the House, but also of the country, that it should be permitted to have special powers for the declaration by executive act of increased duties. It might possibly be held by a person who has not closely studied the Standing Orders that this Bill, being merely a Customs duties validation measure, cannot be amended in the direction I have indicated; but I suggest that any doubt as to the legality of an amendment such as has been in the minds of some honourable members fails on the ground that any validating Bill can validate to any extent, and with any exceptions the House may care to name. We might have a Bill providing for validation with certain specific exemptions. In the case I - have in mind an honourable member with chivalrous instincts sought to place on - record his appreciation of the trustworthiness of the Government.",49
332,Dr MALONEY,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,You are taking advantage of me because I have a bad foot.,49
333,Mr KELLY,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"If the honourable member will not accept my assistance, I will say no more. Question resolved in the affirmative. Report adopted. Bill read a third time. OPPOSED BUSINESS.",49
334,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Unde r standing order No. 70, no opposed business may be taken after 11 p.m. without the leave of the House. Is it the pleasure of the House that leave be granted to proceed with other business ?",49
335,Mr TUDOR,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"No . The Government would not allow me to move an amendment to-night. If the Government had been fair to me, I would have been fair to them. ADJOURNMENT.

The deputation has come 1,500 miles for the purpose.",50
337,Mr TUDOR,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT MAKER S,"Yarra) [11.9] - I should like the Treasurer to inform the House what the Government propose in regard to the business for tomorrow. Will the Excise Duties Validation Bill be dealt with first, and be followed by the Electoral Bill? Will any honourable member be permitted to move an amendment in Committee on the Electoral Bill , or will the same procedure as was adopted to-night be followed, and the Minister in charge object to any amendments at all being moved? If that policy is to be followed, we shall know where we are.",50
338,Dr MALONEY,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT MAKER S,"Melbourne) [11.10]. - In the absence of the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, I desire to bring under the notice of the Treasurer a very cruel case. charged soldier has had his pension reduced from 69s. to 23s. per fortnight. He has been employed in the Post Office since November, at Ss. 6d. per day. He is leaving that position at the end.of the week, because he is unable to do any work. He has no lower jaw, and will never be able to chew food as long as he lives. H is arm muscles are injured, and liis wife is expecting a child. Mr A b igail, one of Sydney's best-known legal experts, recently christened the Defence Department "" the Department of Muddledom."" These cases are doing more to jure enlistment than anything of which I have knowledge.",50
339,Sir JOHN FORREST,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT MAKER S,"Why has not the case been brought before the Defence Department ? OF Dr MALONEY - I ask the Treasurer to investigate this matter. Mr James, under whose control this matter comes, is a splendid officer, and does his work most conscientiously.",50
340,Sir JOHN FORREST,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT MAKER S,I will see that these particulars are placed before the Minister.,50
341,Dr MALONEY,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT MAKER S,"D u r in g the evening some honourable members alluded to the Industrial Workers of the World, and Mr Russell, secretary of the Agricultural Implement Makers Union, thinks that the remarks were directed against bim. He desires me to state that he has not been, is not, and never will be, a member of the Industrial Workers of the World, because he belongs to a union, and believes in political action.",50
342,Mr HANNAN,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT MAKER S,"Fawkner) [11.12] I asked the Prime Minister a question today as to whether Australian soldiers on active service, when being court martialled, are tried in accordance with the regulations under the Australian Defence Act or the regulations under the British A r m y Act. The Prime Minister replied that they are tried under the regulations of the Australian Defence Act. I have received certain information which' confirms rumours that are widely current throughout Australia as to the very harsh penalties which are being imposed On Australian soldiers who are tried for disciplinary offences. In England recently two young fellows were charged with having been absent without leave, they having lef t Salisbury Plain and visited LonA dis- don. One of them, aged nineteen, was fined £7 10s., and the other, who was twenty-one years of age, was sentenced to imprisonment for two years. Another young fellow, a former resident of Port Melbourne, is now serving a sentence of three years in a prison in France for having been absent without leave from the base. H o had been in the trenches in France for a considerable time, and had an excellent record both in Australia and on active service. In Geelong Gaol today is a batch of soldiers who have been returned from Egypt and other in - parts to serve terms of imprisonment. They are nearly all disciplinary cases. The men have petitioned the authorities here to be given their liberty, so that they may return to the front and make good again, the majority of them feeling their position keenly. Yesterday I was given an instance of the severe treatment of our men by some of the officers, particularly by English officers. A young fellow who took part in the memorable landing of the Australians at Gallipoli, remained there until the end, and left on the day of the historic evacuation, took ill on his return to Egypt, and was sent to hospital. When he was able to leave the hospital, he was ordered to go to his camp, and arrived there weary, thirsty, and hungry. On asking for rations, he was told that he could not get them, not being on the list., and that be must parade before his superior officer, who was, I understand, an English captain. He asked his superior officer for rations, telling him of thecircumstances of his case, and he was told that there were not any rations for him. He then almost demanded rations, and the officer replied-, I understand, "" You w i be wanting my afternoon lea next."" Thereupon the spirit of the young fellow asserted himself, and he insulted hiB officer because of the contemptuous treatment meted out to him. He was immediately arrested, and was sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment, serving five months in Egypt, and completing the remaining seven months in the Geelong gaol only the other day. The offence was committed under the strongest possible provocation, and splendid military services and a fine record were blotted out by it . The conduct of British officers at Salisbury Plain and elsewhere towards Australian soldiers, and the severity of the penalties they impose is widely commented on. The other day I asked the Prime Minister whether, if he went Home to the Imperial Conference, he would make inquiries, with a view to getting an alteration of the system. English officers do not understand the spirit of (she average young Australian, who cannot knuckle down in the servile manner of men in some other parts of the world, and therefore come under their displeasure. Some action should - be taken, because boys who left their country prepared to give their lives for what they believe to be a good cause, are worthy of more consideration than they are receiving. Personally, I resent the imposition of such severe penalties for what we in Australia would term trivial offences.",50
343,Sir JOHN FORREST,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT MAKER S,"Swan-Trea surer) [11.20] - To-morro w we shall proceed with the Excise Tariff Validation Bill , and then witli the Electoral (War Time) Bill . I shall bring under the notice of the Prime Minister what was said about the meeting of the Wool Board, and see whether what is desired can be arranged. I do not think that the honourable member for Yarra could have been in earnest in what he said about the Electoral Bill . What was not possible in ' regard to a Validating Bill would be quite possible in regard to that Bill , which is open to amendment in the ordinary way; and the honourable member will have no difficulty in moving such amendments as ""may come within the scope of the measure. The complaints about the severe treatment of Australian soldiers made by the honourable member for Fawkner will be brought under the notice of the Minister for Defence. Matl l ters of this kind would be dealt with more expeditiously if , in the first instance, they were brought under the notice - of the Defence Department, and the names and full particulars supplied in every case. What I have done when complaints have been made to me is to address the Minister, and, if not satisfied with his reply, to address him again. Generally, I have obtained a reasonable decision.",51
344,Mr MATHEWS,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT MAKER S,"I have never once got justice, or even a semblance of it .",51
345,Sir JOHN FORREST,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT MAKER S,"There must be delays, no doubt; and if a member cannot obtain a reasonable reply to his representations, he is righ t in bringing the case before the House. I do not think, however, that it is wise to make general statements about these cases in the first instance. Question resolved in the affirmative. The House adjourned at 11.23 p.m. 1",51
