1,Mr MURPHY,PETITIONS," On behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, and in accordance with standing order 207, I present the following petitions: Marriage RETAIN THE DEFINITION Of MARRIAGE NA To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: We, the undersigned citizens draw to the attention of the House of Representatives assembled, that the definition of marriage as ""a union between one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life"" is the foundation upon which our families are built and on which our society stands. To alter the definition of marriage to include same-sex ""marriage"", as proposed by the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill, would be to change the very structure of society to the detriment of all, especially children. We, the undersigned citizens therefore request that the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2009, he opposed. from 716 citizens Live Animal Exports To the Honourable Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled: This petition of undersigned citizens of Australia calls on the Australian Government to end the export of live animals from Australia to the Middle East. We the undersigned therefore call on the House of Representatives to ensure that the Australian government ends this trade and, in doing, restore Australia's reputation as a compassionate and ethical nation. from 10,808 citizens Falun Gong To the Honourable Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled: This petition of certain citizens and residents of Australia draws to the attention of the House that Falun Gong is a peaceful meditation practice based on the principles of Truthfulness, Compassion and Tolerance. Falun Gong practitioners in China have been subjected to the most brutal and relentless persecution by the Chinese Communist regime since July 1999, causing thousands to lose their lives from illegal detention and systematic torture. Such conduct stands in blatant violation to all international human rights charters that the Chinese government has itself ratified. According to investigative reports published by human rights lawyer David Matas and former Canadian Secretary of State for the Asia Pacific, David Kilgour, tens of thousands of imprisoned Falun Gong practitioners have been subjected to forced organ harvesting for china's transplant market and lost their lives (www.organharvestinvestigation.net). We therefore ask the House to request the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister to openly and forthrightly call for an immediate end to the persecution of Falun Gong in China. from 5,051 citizens Easter Sunday To the Honourable Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled: This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that:  The Fair Work Act does not recognise Easter Sunday as a public holiday in the National Employment Standards. It does recognise Good Friday and Easter Monday.  Easter Sunday is a day of great significance for the 64% of Australians who identify as Christian and the 30% of Australians estimated to attend Easter Sunday Church services.  Easter Sunday is part of a recognised holiday break for all Australian people, Christian or not.  With the exception of Victoria, all mainland Australian States, as well as New Zealand, recognise the significance of Easter Sunday and require shops to close.  Indeed, the significance of Easter Sunday is widely recognised throughout the Western world by the fact that shops must close on this day in London, Paris, Rome, Milan and Montreal.  The Parliament of NSW unanimously legislated for Easter Sunday to be a public holiday. We therefore ask the House to: Amend the Fair Work Act 2009 so as to include, in the National Employment Standards, Easter Sunday in the list of recognised public holidays. from 47 citizens and 96 citizens Ahrens, Dr Christoph To the Honourable Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled: This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the situation of Dr Christoph Ahrens a German born orthopaedic surgeon who provides much needed care in an 'area of need position' in rural New South Wales. Dr Ahrens has practised as an orthopaedic surgeon in Bega for almost six years. The Royal Australasian College of Surgeons has requested for Dr Ahrens to leave Bega, revert back to a trainee level and gain experience in spinal and paediatric surgery. These subspecialties are inappropriate to practise in a rural practice like Bega. He then would have to pass a full registrar exam, which again in many aspects is not relevant to his current practice. Dr Ahrens' orthopaedic practice has been highly appreciated by the medical profession and patients of this area. His desire to remain practising in Bega is strongly supported by the Bega Medical Staff Council and the local community. If Dr Christoph Ahrens were to be deregistered it would affect up to one hundred thousand residents of the far South Coast. Waiting lists for the residents of the far South Coast are likely to increase from one to two years. Trauma related orthopaedic surgery would be immediately reduced and not available every third week. Dr Ahrens last working day will be the 30th June, 2011. We therefore ask the House to urgently act on this situation to retain Dr Christoph Ahrens in our rural community. from 3,553 citizens Marriage To the Honourable Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled: This petition of concerned citizens, in support of marriage as currently defined in the Marriage Act 1961 (Cth) draws to the attention of the House:  that on 8th November 2010 the House of Representatives endorsed a motion that said ""That this House calls on all parliamentarians, consistent with their duties as representatives, to gauge their constituents' views on ways to achieve equal treatment for same sex couples including marriage. ""  that marriage is currently defined in the Marriage Act 1961 (Cth) as being … the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life.""  that each element of the definition of marriage is essential to its integrity, particularly with respect to the welfare and well-being of children;  that marriage is a ""keystone"" institution on which our society rests;  that marriage provides for a stable family structure and is the ideal environment in which children are raised and nurtured; and  that marriage is worthy of ongoing protection and support. We therefore ask the House to maintain support for marriage as currently defined in the Marriage Act 1961 (Cth) and reject any proposal to amend its definition. from 32 citizens Gambling To the Honourable Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled: This petition of the Sawtell Bowling and Recreation Club Limited draws to the attention. of the House our objection to the introduction of Legislation to introduce mandatory pre Commitment for individuals who play poker machines in. Clubs and Hotels. We therefore ask the House to stop the introduction of mandatory pre commitment for poker machine players from one citizen Australia Post To the Honourable Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled: This petition from concerned citizens of the City of Wanneroo, Western Australia draws to the attention of the House the unsuitability of the current location of the Wanneroo Post Office which is presently sited external to the new Wanneroo Central Shopping Centre. The current location of the Wanneroo Post Office is unsuitable and would be better suited within the new Wanneroo Central Shopping Centre because: (1) the present location of the Post Office fails to cater for the needs of the present population or the aged, disabled (either walking or in wheelchairs) and young mothers with prams. The level flooring already in place in the new Wanneroo Central Shopping Centre would alleviate all these problems. (2) Vehicular through traffic is daily becoming more dangerous for those people reversing their vehicles, or for those walking from their vehicles to the Post Office. There is no Zebra crossing for pedestrians. An extra plus is the fact that the new internal shopping centre location would provide extra service by way of the Post Office being open for business on a Saturday morning. We therefore ask the House to: support our request for the relocation of the Wanneroo Post Office from its current location to a site in the confines of the new Wanneroo Central Shopping Centre. from 481 citizens To the Honourable Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled: This petition of certain citizens of Rockingham Beach, Western Australia, draws to the attention of the. House, the noise created by civilian aircraft doing aerobatics. As they do their maneuvers, screaming up and down, close to our homes in Rockingham Beach, WA., every day all day, and occasionally right over our homes and gardens, this noise from their engines impacts on our quality of life. Two people in an aircraft doing aerobatics create continuous high-pitched noise unlike aircraft just passing overhead. We therefore ask the House to do all in its power to restrict aircraft from doing aerobatics so close to our residential homes in Rockingham Beach, WA., so that the noise and possible dangers from this type of activity does not impact on our day to day living. from 2,988 citizens Education To the Honourable Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled: This Petition of the undersigned draws the attention of the House to significant community concerns over the overt and explicit Islamisation of Australian school-age children through the agency of the text-book ""Learning From Anothers"" Bringing Muslim Perspectives into Australian Schools"" which is to be introduced into our schools in the coming year. 1. In breach of the Australian Constitution Preamble and section 116. The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth. 2. Academically inaccurate. 3. Intellectually dishonest. We therefore humbly request the House to withdraw this resource, and discontinue in-service immediately. from 579 citizens and 146 citizens Aviation Australian Broadcasting Corporation To the Honourable Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled: This petition of Australian citizens draws the attention of the House to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's decision to cancel its broadcasting of lawn bowls on free-to-air television.  The ABC has a Charter set out in section 6 of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 that states it should broadcast programs that contribute to a sense of national identity and inform and entertain, and reflect the cultural diversity of the Australian community and further requires it to provide a balance between wide appeal and specialised broadcasting programs.  Lawn bowls is one of the highest participation sports in Australia with around 800,000 people playing lawn bowls each year.  66% of participants in the sport are over the age of 60 but it appeals across generations with many younger people participating socially in the sport, as well as children participating through structured programs such as the Australian Sports Commission's Active After Schools Program.  Bowling clubs are an important part of the Australian community, particularly in rural and regional Australia.  Over 300,000 people nationally on average view the bowls broadcast each week, increasing to just under 500,000 people for major tournaments.  The broadcast of lawn bowls on free-to-air TV not only provides a service to existing members but promotes and profiles lawn bowls to prospective participants. We ask that the House support the immediate reinstatement of lawn bowls on the ABC. from 3,387 citizens Taxation To the Honourable Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled: NSW Citizens' Petition DEFINITIONS: GNSW Government of New South Wales NSW State of New South Wales LHPA NSW Department Primary Industries, Livestock Health & Pest Authority AC The Australian Constitution Excise Tax calculated by estimated numbers of livestock (carrying capacity) We, the undersigned, alert the House to contraventions of AC by GNSW. Citizens are qualified for the Excise by LHPA: 1. according to hectares exceeding LHPA thresholds, 2. location of hectarage, 3. uses to which land is not put. Citizens are compelled, without recourse, to pay the Excise under threat of being sold up without notice. This Excise is unconstitutional because: 1. calculated by stock numbers, it's an Excise contrary to S86 & S90 (AC). Excises are the exclusive domain of the Executive Government (Commonwealth) thereby prohibiting GNSW from imposing Excises, 2. S92 (AC) says; trade between States, shall be absolutely free. Only GNSW imposes Excise making trade with NSW not free. 3. it's discriminatory - imposed on NSW qualifiers only. By ignoring the LHPA Excise, Commonwealth is guilty of discrimination, contravening S99 (AC). We therefore ask the House to call on the Commonwealth Government to: 1. investigate GNSW legislation, 2. consider Excise definition, 3. ascertain Excise contravention of AC, including S92 (preventing free trade between States) and S99 (discrimination), 4. issue a statement on the constitutionality of Excise, 5. if Excise is determined unconstitutional, request GNSW to repeal Excise funding legislation, 6. assist with legal recourse for Excise payers to recover amounts extracted unconstitutionally by LHPA. from 156 citizens Asylum Seekers To the Honourable Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled: This petition of Australian citizens and Residents Draws to the attention of the House: End Australian Mandatory Detention Regime We therefore ask the house to: Take all available steps to ensure that all refugees and asylum seekers detained in Australia are released into the community as soon as possible. Australia needs to have an understanding of the plight of refugees and asylum seekers worldwide and treat people with respect. We ask the house and it members to urge the government to:  Ensure Australian immigration laws apply equally to all Australian territories-onshore and offshore. The excision of islands in Australian territory from the migration zone and all boat arrivals being processed outside the mainland jurisdiction discriminates against asylum seekers arriving by boat to Australia.  End Mandatory and Arbitrary detention of asylum seekers and consider more effective, humane and legal alternatives. The use of Mandatory and arbitrary detention of asylum seekers as a deterrent to others seeking asylum goes against the UN refugee and human rights conventions.  Make Australia's refugee policies part of a global solution for victims of war and persecution. To achieve this, the government should ensure that refugee communities have a more active participatory role in the policy making process.  Ensure independent bodies such as refugee advocacy groups and organisations are part of a more transparent and accountable refugee and humanitarian visa application and settlement process. from 233 citizens Mental Health To the Honourable Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled: We, the residents and health professionals of the Bass Coast area, seek to draw to the attention of the House a request for consideration of the inclusion of Wonthaggi as a site for the new headspace youth mental health centres planned for expansion under the Budget of 2011. This is one of the fastest growing areas in Victoria and this rapid growth coupled with lack of social outlets for young people has created problems such as social isolation, depression and drug dependency. However services in the Shire to assist youth remain extremely limited. These young people and the community are suffering. We ask that the House do all in its power to assist us in having our town nominated for inclusion in the new round of centres to be place in rural communities. from 9,461 citizens Taxation To the Honourable Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled: This petition of the people of the NORTH WESTERN Region of Victoria,draws to the attention of the House: That the cost of living has risen dramatically for PENSIONERS, especially in the area of Water, Electricity, Gas, Council Rates, House, and Car Insurance, and Car Registration. We therefore, ask the House to: Consider exempting the GST from the above items for Pensioners. from 1,045 citizens Marriage To the Honourable Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled: We the undersigned members, families and friends of the Marriage Enrichment Movement (MEM) Brisbane draw to the attention of the humanitarian House this petition to signify our strong opposition to the legalisation of same sex marriage in Australia for the following reasons:  We recognise the proponents have the right to live as they choose but they don't have the right to redefine marriage for all of us;  We believe that marriage between a man and a woman should be exclusive, unconditional, permanent and life giving. It is the foundation upon which our families are built and on which our society stands. To alter the definition of marriage to include same sex marriage would be detrimental to the very fabric of society;  We believe that one of the main reasons our culture begun to crumble is due to the weakening of family values. Legalising another form of ""family"" would only make the situation worse;  We believe that legalising same sex marriage provides and creates a chain reaction that will eventually destroy the sanctity of marriage, a very alarming scenario;  Australia has a population of 22.6 million comprised of 64% Christians of which the majority are Catholics who affirm that a man and a woman is united and becomes one in the holy sacrament of matrimony. We therefore ask the House to consider and support this petition against the legalisation of same sex marriage. from 150 citizens Marriage To the Honourable Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled: This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to:  the failure of the Commonwealth Marriage Act (1961) to allow marriages to be solemnised between partners of the same sex;  the failure of the Marriage Act to recognise same-sex marriages solemnised in other countries;  the great harm this does to same-sex partners and their families by discriminating against them, entrenching a second-class legal status, and perpetuating prejudice and stigma;  the great harm this does to marriage by associating it with discrimination; and,  the fact that an increasing number of other countries allow same-sex marriage, and most Australians support it. We therefore ask the House to:  amend the Commonwealth Marriage Act so that marriages may be solemnised, and overseas marriage recognised, regardless of the sex of the partners concerned.  from 238 citizens Petitions received.

2,Mr MURPHY,PETITIONS," Ministerial responses to petitions previously presented to the House have been received as follows: Environment Dear Mr Murphy I refer to your letter of 25 August 2011, concerning the submission of a petition regarding the sustainable management and development of Australian farmland. As you may be aware, many of the issues raised by the petition are currently the subject of litigation in the matter Spencer v Commonwealth and New South Wales (ACD24/2007). As a result, it is not appropriate for me to comment on these issues, except to state the following. Over the past 20 years, governments and landholders have taken major steps across Australia to achieve more sustainable land management. This has included reducing land clearing in order to achieve biodiversity conservation, soil protection, water quality and salinity benefits. Management of native vegetation is primarily a state and territory responsibility and is generally outside the scope of the Australian Government's direct responsibility. Nevertheless, the government does play a significant role in working cooperatively with the states and territories to develop national policies as well for matters which lie within its own jurisdiction, including Australia's obligations under international law, exports, imports and quarantine, and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 In relation to the EPBC Act, the government would only intervene on specific development matters that will, or are likely to, have a significant impact on matters of National Environmental Significance. The government has worked cooperatively with the states and territories on environmental matters in developing national-level policies. Such policies that affect the management of native vegetation include the 1999 National Framework for the Management and Monitoring of Australia's Native Vegetation and Australia's Biodiversity Conservation Strategy 2010-2030. Adoption of these policies is voluntary; they explicitly do not involve coercive appropriation of any private property rights. The government contributes to implementation of national environmental and sustainable resource management through grant and associated programs. Prime amongst these is the $2 billion Caring for our Country initiative focused on the sustainable management of natural resources. Caring for our Country supports land managers to protect Australia's natural environment and to produce food and fibre sustainably through incentive payments, marketbased instruments and extension activities. It is delivered in partnership with regional Natural Resource Management groups, local, state and territory governments, Indigenous groups, industry bodies, land managers, farmers. Landcare groups and communities. Participation in this program is voluntary and depends on the willing participation of private landholders and others. With respect to water legislation, this petition principally concerns the nature of the statutory rights granted under State and Territory legislation. However, the Water Act 2007 (Cth) strengthens the rights of Murray-Darling Basin water entitlement holders by guaranteeing compensation in certain circumstances. Similarly, with respect to mining legislation, onshore mining operations are primarily regulated under the respective State or Territory government legislation. The relevant State or Territory government is responsible for making decisions in relation to the licensing of mining and extractive industries and therefore are responsible for managing issues in relation to land access, the loss of productive farmland and adverse health impacts associated with production. Commonwealth responsibilities in relation to the approval of mining projects and other development proposals are primarily concerned with the protection of matters of National Environmental Significance defined under the EPBC Act. In addition, section 255AA of the Water Act 2007 (Cth) requires that, prior to licences being granted for subsidence mining operations on floodplains that have underlying groundwater systems forming part of the Murray-Darling Basin system inflows, an independent expert study must be undertaken to determine the impacts of the proposed mining operations on the connectivity of groundwater systems, surface water and ground water flows and water quality. Thank you for writing on this matter and for bringing the petition to my attention. from the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Mr Tony Burke Page Electorate: Gas Pipeline Dear Mr Murphy I refer to your letter of 15 September 2011 to the Minister for Resources and Energy, the Hon Martin Ferguson AM MP, advising of a petition opposing the Casino-Ipswich Pipeline presented by the Member for Page, Ms Janelle Saffin MP. Your letter has been referred to me as Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. On 29 November 2007, the Casino-Ipswich Pipeline (EPBC 2007/3877) was referred under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (the EPBC Act) by Metgasco Limited and on 20 December 2007, the proposal was determined to be a ""controlled action"". As such, the proposal requires assessment and a decision on approval under the EPBC Act if it is to proceed. On 14 May 2008, finalised guidelines for the preparation of the assessment were issued. For the process to continue Metgasco must finalise assessment documentation, consistent with those guidelines and the company would subsequently be required to publish a draft of that documentation for public comment. Metgasco has not yet finalised that documentation. All relevant milestones and documents relating to the proposal will be published on the website of the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities at: www.environment.gov.au/cgibin/epbc/epbc_ap.pl ?name=cunent_referral_detail&proposal_id=3877 The project requires assessment under the EPBC Act because of its likely impacts on listed threatened species and communities protected under the EPBC Act. The petition refers to impacts on the Gondwana Rainforests World Heritage area. In making the decision that the project is a controlled action, my delegate considered the potential impacts of the proposal on National and World Heritage values. However, it was determined that those impacts were not likely to be significant, primarily because the proposed pipeline route follows existing roads. The pipeline would be buried, except for service points, and installed using conventional trench and backfill techniques Thank you for bringing the petition to my attention. I note that Ms Saffin has also raised matter with me directly, in writing and in person. from the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Mr Tony Burke National School Chaplaincy Program Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 25 August 2011, on behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, concerning a petition from a group of citizens regarding the National School Chaplaincy Program. The National School Chaplaincy Program is one of many successful initiatives that have been effective in supporting schools to provide for the well-being of school students. It is important to note that the Program is voluntary at both a school and individual student level and that school communities have supported successful funding applications following broad school community consultation. The purpose of the Program is to enhance students' overall well-being, not to impose any religious beliefs or persuade an individual toward a particular set of religious beliefs. The 2008 Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for Young Australians states, 'Schools play a vital role in promoting the intellectual, physical, social, emotional, moral, spiritual and aesthetic development and well-being of young Australians and in ensuring the nation's ongoing economic prosperity and social cohesion. Schools share this responsibility with students, parents, carers, families, the community, business and other education and training providers.' In supporting these goals, the Australian Government announced in November 2009, that all schools already participating in the National School Chaplaincy Program would receive further funding at maintained rates, to allow services to continue to the end of 2011. The Government confirmed in the recent 2011-2012 Federal Budget, further funding of $222 million for the National School Chaplaincy Program. This will support up to an additional 1000 schools from 2012 and enable all eligible schools currently funded under the Program to be extended to 2014. The additional 1000 places this include schools in disadvantaged, rural and remote communities. In line with the budget announcement, the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations has finalised the review which commenced in 2009, that considered how the Program can best support schools and their communities in the future. The public consultation phase of this review closed on 18 March 2011 with more than 7000 responses from schools, stakeholders and the broader community. After consideration of the review, I announced changes to the Program on 7 September 2011. The Program will be strengthened with the introduction of minimum qualifications, benchmark standards for service providers and improvements to the complaints management system and school communities will be able to choose to employ either a chaplain or secular student welfare worker. These changes, along with the re-naming of the scheme to the National School Chaplaincy and Student Welfare Program, will commence in 2012. Further information on the National School Chaplaincy Program is available on the Program website at www.deewr.qov.au/schoolchaplaincy. Alternatively, my media release can be viewed at www.deewr.gov.au/ministers/garrett/media/releas es/pages/article_1 10907_102159. aspx. Thank you for bringing these citizens' concerns to my attention. from the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, Mr Garrett Sri Lanka Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 29 August 2011 regarding the petition relating to the UN Secretary-General's Advisory Panel on Sri Lanka, the Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) and development assistance to Sri Lanka. The view of the Australian Government is that Sri Lanka needs to address the issue of accountability as a crucial part of dialogue and reconciliation. I, along with my predecessor the Hon Stephen Smith MP, have consistently called on the Sri Lankan Government, having won the war, to now ""win the peace"". The Australian Government regards the UN Secretary-General's Advisory Panel report as a substantive contribution. All allegations of human rights and humanitarian law violations assessed as credible by the report need to be tested and, if they are proven accurate, action needs to be taken. The Government continues to urge Sri Lanka to respond to the report's findings through the work of the LLRC. It is in Sri Lanka's interest that the LLRC report be substantive, credible and consistent with international standards. Australia and the international community will closely scrutinise the report before deciding on whether any other form of inquiry is warranted. Australia's long term goal is to assist Sri Lanka to become a stable and economically resilient nation. Our aid program in Sri Lanka focuses on the rehabilitation of conflict affected areas in the North and East, including through demining, resettlement of displaced persons infrastructure reconstruction. development assistance program for 2011-12 is forecast at $43.5 million. Thank you for bringing the concerns of the petitioners to my attention. I trust that this information is of assistance. from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Rudd Syria Dear Mr Murphy I refer to your letter of 19 September 2011 regarding a petition submitted for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions opposing calls for President Bashar alAssad of Syria to appear before the International Criminal Court. Australia's While I note the petition, the Australian Government, along with the international community, remains deeply concerned about the actions of the Syrian regime. The Syrian regime has not made genuine efforts to implement reforms, despite repeated commitments to do so. The recent finding of the UN Human Rights Council fact-finding mission to Syria, that there is evidence of ""human rights violations … which may amount to crimes against humanity"", underlines the seriousness of the situation. The report details a consistent pattern of violence against unarmed protestors. It reports accounts of summary executions, including of injured protestors seeking medical treatment; indiscriminate firing on civilians (including children) by security forces; and the use of tanks, heavy machine guns and helicopters in urban areas. Australia has urged the international community to intensify its pressure on Damascus to respond to the voices of the Syrian people demanding their legitimate freedoms. Australia supports stronger Security Council action, including referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court, as stated in my letter to the President of the UN Security Council in June. and Thank you for bringing this petition to my Australia's attention. from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Rudd Child Soldiers Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter dated 31 October 2011, regarding a petition recently submitted by the students and community of the King's Preparatory School in Parramatta about the plight of child soldiers. Like the petitioners, I believe the exploitation of children in conflict, especially their use as child soldiers, to be unconscionable and abhorrent. The Australian Government takes every opportunity to condemn these practices, especially at the United Nations. At the 18th session of the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) held in Geneva in September this year, Australia condemned the use of child soldiers as 'unacceptable' and spoke in support of the work of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict. Australia also expressed its 'grave concern' over continued reports of the use of child soldiers in Somalia. Earlier in 2011, Australia cosponsored resolutions on the rights of the child at the 16th session of the HRC in March and at the 66th session of the United Nations General Assembly in October. The Government works to promote and protect children's rights through a range of international institutions and instruments. Australia has ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (Convention), and its two Optional Protocols, as well as the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labour. These treaties have benefited children by establishing standards against which international behaviour can be measured and scrutinised. Australia continues actively to encourage all States to uphold. children's rights, as well as to ratify ILO Convention 182 and its Optional Protocols. Aside from our diplomatic efforts, Australia's aid program also supports organisations like UNICEF prevent child soldier recruitment and rehabilitate former child soldiers. For example, in Sri Lanka we support UNICEF's work to prevent the recruitment of child soldiers and assist children affected by the conflict. In Nepal we have supported Save the Children's work to release and rehabilitate former child soldiers. From 2010-13 we will provide a further S1.2 million to help the return and reintegration of children associated with armed forces or armed groups. In the Philippines the Australian aid program is supporting UNICEF to help children in conflict-affected communities in Mindanao have access to immunisation, education and protection against recruitment into armed groups. We will continue to look for opportunities to counter the use of child soldiers around the world. I thank the students and community of the King's Preparatory School for their concern over this pressing international challenge. from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Rudd Child Care Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 12 October 2011 concerning a petition recently submitted for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding funding for Take a Break Occasional Care services. In recognition of the critical importance of affordable, quality early education to Australian families, the Australian Government has undertaken a significant reform agenda to ensure families now have access to more financial assistance with child care, and more choice, than ever before. The Government has significantly increased funding to early childhood education and care. Overall we will provide $20 billion over the next four years to give Australian kids the best start in life. This is well more than double the funding provided in the last four years of the former Howard Government. As part of this investment, the Government is driving a national reform process that will see areas that were previously funded solely by State and Territory Governments receiving significant additional investment from the Commonwealth. The Australian Government has ceased funding for Neighbourhood Model Occasional Care, which represented an investment of $1.1 million in Victoria in 2009-2010. Although now forgoing this, the Victorian Government is receiving approximately $210.6 million for kindergartens over the next five years - an area where the Commonwealth previously had no funding responsibility. In Victoria alone the Australian Government is also providing record levels of funding for early childhood education and care, including:  $399 million through the Child Care Benefit;  $291 million through the Child Care Rebate to pay up to 50 per cent of out-of-pocket costs for families;  $21.3 million for the Child Care Services Support Program to help new services start or to support services that are struggling, particularly in regional areas;  $16.65 million for Children and Family Centres; and  $17.4 million for 11 new Early Learning and Care Centres. On 25 October 2011 I also announced additional Occasional and In Home Care places for Australian families. The allocation of places represents a rise in support for Australian Government funded Occasional Care places in Victoria of 44 per cent. It is expected that 250 Occasional Care places will be allocated within Victoria. All existing and prospective Occasional Care providers can apply for the places, including Take a Break services. In recognition of this significant additional investment, I continue to urge the Victorian Government to maintain funding for the Take a Break program and follow the lead of other states like New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia who have all committed to supporting this type of child care. I appreciate you bringing the petition to my attention. from the Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare, Ms Ellis Broken Hill: Aged Care Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 25 August 2011 to the Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon Nicola Roxon MP, regarding the petition 545/887 made to the Speaker of the House of Representatives on the matter of aged care funding in Broken Hill. I am responding as the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing. I have enclosed a formal response to the subject petition for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions. I appreciate you bringing the contents of the petition to the Australian Government's attention and trust that the attached information assists the House in responding. Petition to the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of citizens of Broken Hill, New South Wales, Australia, draws to the attention of the House the immediate urgency to rectify the dire situation in our hospital and nursing homes. There is an acute shortage of beds in the hospital and our aged care patients are being sent to Wilcannia-200 kilometres from home, family and friends, to free up desperately needed hospital beds. The Broken Hill population is 25% higher than the figures used to calculate current health and aged care funding for the city. The old hospital around had 380 beds and the replacement has 80. Broken Hill has given much to this nation and will do so again for the next 70-100 years according to recent announcements by Mayor Wincen Cuy. We therefore ask the House to provide immediate extra aged care funding to enable our elderly citizens to remain in their home town and provide immediate funding to our hospital increase beds and services appropriate to our population. Response The Australian Government aims to provide equitable access for Australia's ageing population through the annual planning, distribution and allocation of new aged care places, as set out in the Aged Care Act 1997. Each year, new aged care places are made available for allocation in each state and territory, based on their population projections and the level and type of aged care currently being provided. The distribution of new places across aged care planning regions seeks to achieve a balance in the provision of services between metropolitan, regional, rural and remote areas, as well as between people needing differing levels of care. The Australian Government has increased the level of funding provided for aged care by more than 30% over the last three years. A total of $54.2 billion will be provided for aged care over the next four years from 2011-12. The Australian Government recognises the need for fundamental reform of the aged care system in order to ensure that it continues to provide high quality care and can respond to the needs of Australia's ageing population in a way that is sustainable for the future. The Government is already implementing reforms to the aged care system through a range of initiatives under National Health Reform. Under the National Health Reform Agreement, all Australian Governments have agreed to major reforms to the organisation, funding and delivery of health and aged care. These reforms are designed to provide better access to services, improved local accountability and transparency, greater responsiveness to local communities and financial sustainability for the health system into the future through increased Commonwealth funding. The Government is guaranteeing to provide at least $16.4 billion in additional funding for hospitals over the period 2014-15 to 2019-20. The Government is also investing up to $3.4 billion between 2010 and 2017 to address key pressure points in public hospitals. This will deliver improved services for patients, including more beds, quicker emergency department services and better access to elective surgery and subacute care. On 7 October 2011, the Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon Nicola Roxon MP, and Senator for New South Wales, the Hon Ursula Stephens, announced the signing of a $7 million agreement to establish the Broken Hill GP Super Clinic. GP Super Clinics are designed to improve access to quality health care in communities and are a significant investment in taking pressure off public hospitals. It is expected that the Broken Hill GP Super Clinic will include general practice, nurses and allied health specialists with a strong emphasis on chronic disease management and lifestyle modification programs. The Government has also asked the Productivity Commission to examine all aspects of Australia's aged care system, and to develop detailed options to ensure that Australia's aged care system can meet the challenges facing it in coming decades. The Productivity Commission issued its Final Report, Caring for Older Australians, on 8 August 2011. The report includes proposals for extensive reform of Australia's aged care system and presents an integrated reform package. In formulating its response, the Government will be guided by four overarching principles. Firstly, older Australians have earned the right to be able to access quality care and support that is appropriate to their needs, when they need it. Secondly, older Australians deserve greater choice and control over their care arrangements than the system currently gives them. Thirdly, funding arrangements for aged care must be sustainable and fair for both older Australians and for the broader community. Finally, older Australians deserve to receive quality care from an appropriately skilled workforce. In developing its response to the Productivity Commission's report, the Government will be public meeting with key stakeholders and has also started a national conversation with older Australians, their families and carers on the ageing reform agenda at forums across the country. from the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Mr Butler National Bowel Cancer Screening Program Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 19 September 2011 providing me with a copy of the petition concerning full implementation of the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program (the Program) that was presented by you to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions on 19 September 2011. The Gillard Government recognises that bowel cancer is a major health issue affecting many Australians and is committed, in partnership with state and territory governments, to developing a program which is accessible, comprehensive and ultimately reduces the incidence of the disease. Early detection by screening remains the best way to fight bowel cancer. That is why in the 2011 Budget, the Australian Government announced funding of $138.7 million over four years to continue the Program as well as providing funding on an ongoing basis. This provides surety for the operation of the Program into the future. Since the commencement of phase one of the Program in August 2006, over 3 million Australians have received a free bowel cancer screening test kit and over 1.2 million people have returned the test for analysis. Over 2,000 people who returned a test kit have been diagnosed with suspected or confirmed bowel cancer and at least 3,000 people were diagnosed with earlier stage adenomas. As the terms of the petition correctly state, current evidence from the National Health and Medical Research Council's Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Prevention, Early Detection and Management of Colorectal Cancer recommends that organised screening commence for average risk people at 50 years of age. Over the next four years, approximately 3.7 million people turning 50, 55 and 65 years of age between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2014 will be offered free bowel cancer screening under the continuation of this Program. However, the Program needs to be phased in gradually to ensure that health services, such as colonoscopy and treatment services, are able to meet any increased demand. The Government will consider further whether to expand the Program once fiscal circumstances permit. I appreciate your interest in the Program and trust that the above information is of assistance. from the Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Roxon Medicare: Bone Densitometry Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 31 October 2011 regarding the petition for Medicare funding for bone densitometry for Australian women at menopause. As you may know, currently Medicare benefits are payable for bone densitometry for:  the diagnosis and monitoring of bone loss if a patient has certain specific medical conditions or is undergoing particular treatments likely to cause rapid bone loss;  the confirmation of clinically suspected low bone mineral density, usually following a fracture;  the monitoring of established low bone mineral density; and  those patients over the age of 70 years. It is the Australian Government's aim that services listed in the Medical Benefits Schedule (MBS), including bone densitometry, should reflect and encourage appropriate medical practice based on the best available evidence. For any medical service to be reimbursed through the MBS, the Government requires that it first be assessed and found to be safe, effective and to provide value-for-money, both for patients and tax payers. In deciding what medical services to support through Medicare, the Government relies on the expert advice of the Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC). An application has been made to MSAC for bone densitometry for menopausal women over the age of 50 years and it is progressing through the MSAC process. New tests are assessed by expert committees composed of consumer representatives, health economists, health administrators, clinical experts in pathology, surgery, specialist medicine and general practice as well as health technology assessment professionals. Information on MSAC processes and the contact details for MSAC can be obtained on its website at www.msac.gov.au I assure you that decisions to cover services under Medicare and the conditions attached to those services are based on thorough and well considered processes that aim to provide quality and accessible health services for all Australians. I trust that the above information is of assistance. from the Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Roxon Medicare Centre in Narellan Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 3 November 2011 to the Hon Nicola Roxon, Minister for Health and Ageing, about the petition received by the Standing Committee on Petitions requesting a Medicare office in the Narellan business district. Your letter was referred to me as the Medicare program is in my portfolio. I appreciate the petition you have forwarded on behalf of residents from the electorate of Macarthur and I note their desire for closer access to Medicare face-to-face services. While the Government has no plans to extend the office network for the Department of Human Services at this time, my Department will continue to monitor demand for Centrelink and Medicare services at all locations around Australia, including in areas of high growth such as Narellan and the surrounding suburbs. To accommodate the service needs of communities where there are no shopfronts for the Department of Human Services, the Government is investing in a variety of alternative programs to make it easier for Australians and their families to access Centrelink and Medicare services from the comfort and privacy of their own home. For the Medicare program, a telephone service is now available 24 hours a day, seven days a week for the cost of a local call on 13 20 11. Customers speak directly to a person who can help them to lodge a claim, where the rebate is paid directly into the customer's bank account, or with any other Medicare business. Customers can also claim their Medicare rebate directly at their doctor's practice, if the practice offers electronic claiming. quick, easy and secure, and the Medicare rebate can be paid directly into the customer's bank account. I would encourage residents of the Macarthur electorate to ask their doctor about providing this service. While I recognise that online claiming does not suit every customer's needs, Medicare benefits for some medical visits can also be claimed over the Internet 24 hours a day, seven days a week through the website www.humanservices.gov.au. Once again, thank you for writing. from the Minister for Human Services, Ms Plibersek Supply of PBS Medicines Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 2 November 2011 to the then Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon Nicola Roxon MP, regarding a petition submitted for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions about amendments to the National Health Act 1953 to prohibit exclusive supply of Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) medicines to community pharmacies. I am responding as the Minister for Health. All distribution arrangements for PBS medicines are being closely monitored by the Australian Government to ensure that the objectives of the PBS continue to be met. To this end, the Department of Health and Ageing has met with the key stakeholders to discuss direct and exclusive supply arrangements, but has not yet received any independent evidence that these arrangements have caused systemic diminished access to PBS medicines for consumers. The purpose of the PBS is to provide reliable, timely and affordable access to a wide range of medicines for all Australians. The cost of the PBS represents a large portion of the health budget, and in the 2010-11 financial year, the PBS cost the Government approximately $9 billion. The Government currently subsidises over 3,950 medicines through the PBS, making it one of the most accessible and affordable medicine subsidy This service is schemes in the world. The Government recognises the role pharmaceutical wholesalers play in the supply chain for PBS medicines and provides remuneration through both the Community Service Obligation (CSO) Funding Pool and the wholesale mark-up on PBS medicines. Introduced under the Fourth Community Pharmacy Agreement, the primary objective of the CSO Funding Pool is to ensure that arrangements are in place to provide all Australians with ongoing and timely access to PBS medicines via their community pharmacy. These arrangements support pharmaceutical wholesalers supplying PBS medicines to community pharmacies across regardless of pharmacy location and the relative cost of supply. Additional stability for wholesalers has been provided through the retention of the CSO Funding Pool under the Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement. Pharmaceutical wholesaler remuneration has increased under the CSO from $663.4 million under the Fourth Agreement to nearly $950 million over five years of the Fifth Agreement. The wholesaler mark-up remains unchanged (from the Fourth Agreement) at 7.52 per cent of the medicine's price for most drugs, and $69.94 for drugs costing more than $930.06. Although the CSO Funding Pool provides eligible wholesalers with financial support in recognition of the additional costs incurred in providing PBS medicines to all community pharmacies, participation in these arrangements is voluntary. The Government cannot compel wholesalers to take part in the arrangements nor require PBS manufacturers to use the distribution services provided under the CSO arrangements. Exclusive supply is not a new concept in Australia with many pharmacies benefiting from these arrangements over a number of years. Decisions by a manufacturer to distribute its PBS medicines under exclusive supply arrangements is a commercial decision outside the responsibility of Government, but the Government remains absolutely committed to ensuring timely access of all PBS medicines to all Australians. My Department would welcome stakeholders providing any information that direct and exclusive supply arrangements are causing patient health impacts through delayed access, either directly or through the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. Once again, thank you for writing. from the Minister for Health, Ms Plibersek Headspace Centre for Knox Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 23 August 2011 regarding a petition seeking funding for a headspace centre for Knox, in outer eastern Melbourne. I apologise for the delay in Australia, responding. I note the petition was presented on 23 August 2011 and considered at a recent meeting of the Standing Committee on Petitions. Under Standing Order 209 (b), as the Minister responsible for the administration of the matter raised in the petition, I am responding within 90 days of its presentation. I appreciate the level of community interest that has emerged about the successful headspace model and that many communities are keen to have a site established in their area. Access to effective and responsive mental health services is clearly important, and for this reason the Australian Government has made, and is continuing to make, substantial investments to improve mental health services, especially for young people. The 2011-12 Budget allocated $197.3 million over five years, on top of a current commitment of $133.3 million to 2013-14, to expand existing and establish new youth focused mental health services through the headspace program. Specifically, the 2011-12 Budget measure provides funding for 90 fully sustainable headspace sites across Australia by 2014-15. Once all 90 sites are fully established, headspace will help up to 72,000 young people each year. On 24 October 2011, the Prime Minister, the Hon Julia Gillard MP, announced 15 locations for establishment of new headspace sites, confirming Melbourne - Outer East (Ringwood/Knox) as one of the new locations. The announcement of the 15 new locations, and two outpost services, will take the number of headspace sites around the country to 55, with an additional 35 locations to be announced by 2015. The new sites have been chosen in conjunction with headspace, and in consultation with state and territory governments, on the basis of community need, youth populations, access to existing services and local capacity. In addition to the roll-out of further headspace sites, a telephone and web-based support service for young people building on the headspace platform has also recently begun providing services. This eheadspace service provides free, confidential and anonymous counselling services to young people between the ages of 12 and 25 years with, or at risk of developing, a mild to moderate mental illness. The service also provides referrals to other appropriate services, including mental health, alcohol and drug, social and vocational services. This service is an alternative approach for young people to access support and help, and will use innovative online communication tools that many young people have indicated is a preferred way of communication and accessing support services. Further information on the eheadspace service is available at www.eheadspace.org.au I would appreciate it if you could convey this information to the next meeting of the Standing Committee on Petitions. I trust that the above information is of use. from the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Mr Butler Asylum Seekers Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 25 August 2011 regarding a petition submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions in relation to people in immigration detention. The Australian Government is committed to treating asylum seekers and refugees humanely and fairly while maintaining its commitment to managing risks to the Australian community. Immigration detention of all unauthorised arrivals is mandatory for the purposes of determining any health, identity or security risk presented by unauthorised people arriving at the border. This is in contrast to those who arrive in Australia lawfully and have been assessed during the visa application process in relation to matters such as identity, security, bona fides and health. The Government is conscious of the need to ensure people are not held in immigration detention for long periods, however, time is required to determine whether a person meets the criteria for grant of a visa. The processing delays can be due to a number of factors including the volume of cases, difficulty in satisfactorily determining a client's identity, complexity of claims, developments in country information and, for those who have been found to be a refugee, finalisation of other immigration related criteria such as the security clearance process. On 18 October 2010, the Prime Minister and I announced that the Government would move the majority of children, and a significant number of vulnerable families, into community detention (formally known as Residence Determination) by the end of June this year. The Government has delivered on its commitment. As at 23 September 2011, I have approved 1981 clients (1077 adults and 904 children) for community-based detention arrangements. Of these, 1060 clients (616 adults and 444 children) are residing in community detention arrangements. Around 800 clients have left the program after being granted protection visas. Consistent with the Government's announcement, priority is being given to unaccompanied minors and vulnerable families. My Department is also continuing to place a small number of vulnerable single adult males. Community-based detention arrangements were introduced in June 2005 and are a form of immigration detention that enables people to reside in the community without needing to be escorted. Community-based arrangements provide accommodation and care arrangements and access to socially inclusive activities, such as children attending their local school and parents participating in community activities. The Australian Red Cross is the lead agency implementing this program and their activities include linking people to a range of activities and volunteering opportunities. As announced by the Prime Minister and I last month, as part of a new approach to detention and processing of irregular maritime arrivals (IMAs), after initial health, security and identity checks, they may be eligible to be placed into the community on bridging visas while their protection claims are assessed. Since this announcement, my Department has been working on a framework and implementation arrangements for IMAs in detention - both existing clients and new arrivals. The Department has also been consulting across government and with non-government service providers and stakeholders. As part of this, the department is continuing to assess the detention population for suitability for temporary visa grant. This will be an ongoing staged process to ensure an orderly transition to the community. The department will continue to use the community detention program and the support it offers for more vulnerable clients or those not suitable for grant of a bridging visa. Minors in immigration detention are processed as a matter of priority to resolve their immigration status as quickly as possible. Minors and their families or unaccompanied minors found to be owed protection by Australia and are granted permanent protection visas are allowed to live permanently in Australia. Visa grant entitles them to the full range of Australian Government benefits and services. I note the petitioners' request that Australia increase the number of people it resettles under the Humanitarian Program. Australia is proud of its record of resettling refugees from around the world. The first refugees arrived in Australia just after the Second World War. Since then, more than 750 000 refugees have found a new home in Australia. Australia is one of the top three countries who have helped refugees in this way. The size of Australia's Humanitarian Program has increased twice in recent years, increasing by 500 in 2008-09 and 250 places in 2009-10. The Program is managed flexibly which allows it to respond to changing global situations and emerging humanitarian needs. As only a small number of refugees are able to be offered a chance to settle in Australia each year, every effort is made to help those in greatest need. The success of the Humanitarian Program is not only measured by how many humanitarian entrants are resettled, but also to what extent refugees are able to rebuild their lives and contribute to the Australian community. The Government is committed to ensuring that people settling in Australia have the help they need to rebuild their lives and become fully functioning members of the community. Settlement services are an important part of Australia's commitment to providing a path and a means for new arrivals to achieve full participation in, and adjustment to, their new society. Such services are critical, particularly early on in the settlement journey, and the Government is always seeking new and better ways to help people settle as quickly as possible. I welcome hearing from communities about their views on the Humanitarian Program as part of the Government's annual consultations. The consultation process usually takes place towards the end of the year and further details about how groups and individuals can take part and put forward their views will be available on the Department's website at www.immi.gov.au at that time. I trust the information provided is helpful. from the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Mr Bowen Asylum Seekers Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 24 August 2011 relating to a petition submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding the Australian Government's Arrangement with Malaysia to counter people smuggling (the Arrangement). I write to update you on developments following my response to you on 11 October 2011 about a previous petition regarding the Arrangement. As noted in that letter, the Arrangement represents the first concrete bilateral agreement of the type contemplated by the landmark Regional Co-operation Framework agreed to by ministers at the Bali Process meeting in March. The Arrangement also presents a significant opportunity to improve the lives of more refugees, while dealing with irregular migration and people smuggling activity in the region. As I noted previously, the protections and the increased resettlement opportunities contained in the Arrangement reflects genuine progress in advancing humanitarian responses in the region and increasing the available protection space. It also removes the incentive for people to attempt the dangerous boat journey to Australia by boat, which cannot be advocated by anyone who favours a genuinely humanitarian approach. Following the decision of the High Court on 31 August, the Government introduced legislation into the Parliament to restore the power of the executive to enter into arrangements such as the one with Malaysia. As the petitioners would be aware, however, the Opposition has indicated its intention to block this legislation, resulting in the need to process asylum seekers onshore. Consequently, I recently announced a new approach to the management of asylum seekers who arrive in Australia, by boat. Following an initial period of mandatory detention period for health, security and identity checks, eligible individuals who are assessed as not posing a risk to the community will be progressively considered for community placement while their refugee claims are assessed. Asylum seekers on bridging visas will have the right to work and support themselves and have access to necessary health services. Further, a single protection visa process for both boat and air arrivals, using the current onshore arrangements for application and independent review through the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) system will be implemented during 2012. This process will introduce a single, consistent and efficient process that will continue to afford all people using the system access to judicial review. The Government remains committed to the Malaysia Arrangement and will move to implement it immediately, should the Opposition indicate that it is willing to pass the legislation necessary to allow for offshore processing. Thank you again for your referral of this petition. I trust this information is of assistance. from the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Mr Bowen Live Animal Exports Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 19 September 2011 enclosing a petition submitted for the consideration of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions about opposition to the suspension of the live cattle export trade to Indonesia. I regret the delay in responding. I understand the expectation that, as minister responsible for the matters raised in the petition, understanding order 209(b) I will lodge a written response with the petitions committee. Please accept the following as my response for consideration by the committee, presentation to all the House, recording in Hansard and posting on the committee's website. Anyone who watched the footage aired on the ABC's Four Corners program on 30 May 2011 would have been shocked by the treatment of the animals it showed. It was clear from this footage that the live export industry cannot safeguard the animals it sells without strong government regulation. The Australian Government had to act. To fix the problems raised in the footage, the government introduced a strict new framework for livestock exports to Indonesia that ensures animals will be treated in a way that meets or exceeds international animal welfare standards. On 21 October 2011 the government announced that it would be extending this framework to all other markets for Australian feeder and slaughter livestock. The new framework will be phased in with 75 per cent of trade covered by the end of February 2012, 99 per cent by the end of August 2012 and all markets covered by the end of 2012. The decision was informed by an independent review of Australia's livestock export trade by Mr Bill Farmer AO, as well as reports from two industry-government working groups on live cattle, and live sheep and goat exports. These changes fundamentally reform the way the live export trade works. Before, there were no rules to cover what happened after an animal arrived in an export market. Once the new framework is rolled out, the way Australian livestock are treated in all markets must meet or exceed international standards. I thank you and the committee for your interest in this important issue.

The Australian Government believes that the current definition of marriage in the Marriage Act 1961 'that marriage is between a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life'-is appropriate. The Government believes that couples who have a mutual commitment to a shared life should be able to have their relationships recognised. The Government supports a nationally consistent framework for relationship recognition to be implemented by the States and Territories. New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory have established relationship recognition schemes, where the relationship is legally recognised by the act of registration. Relationships registered under these schemes are also now recognised in a wide range of Commonwealth laws. The Government will continue to encourage other jurisdictions to develop such schemes. I hope this information is of assistance to the Committee when considering this petition. from the Attorney-General, Mr MCClelland Marriage Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 31 October 2011 regarding the petition submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions, opposing changes to the for your interest Marriage Act 1961.

I hope this information is of assistance to the Committee when considering this petition. from the Attorney-General, Mr MCClelland Carbon Pricing Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 13 October 2011, on behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, concerning a petition from a group of citizens on the proposed carbon price and its effects on The Australian Government is committed to a broad sustainability agenda. In the decades ahead, the Australian economy will continue to grow if we can embrace the opportunities arising from the transition to a clean energy, low carbon and resource efficient economy. On 10 July 2011 the Prime Minister, the Hon Julia Gillard MP announced Securing a Clean Energy Future: The Australian Government's Climate Change Plan. Central to this plan is the introduction of a carbon price that will cut pollution in the cheapest and most effective manner, drive investment in new clean energy sources and enable a shift to more sustainable business practices. The Securing a Clean Energy Future plan also includes measures to promote innovation and investment in renewable energy, encourage energy efficiency and create opportunities in the land sector to cut pollution. Importantly, under the plan the Government will invest more than $11 billion in carefully designed measures to support jobs and competitiveness as Australia moves to a clean energy future. I am pleased to note that the 18 bills constituting the Securing a Clean Energy Future legislative package passed through the House of Representatives on 12 October 2011 and through the Senate on 8 November 2011. Putting a price on carbon is likely to affect different industries in different ways, but Treasury modelling indicates that the aggregate number of jobs in Australia will continue to grow strongly while at the same time the growth of Australia's carbon pollution is expected to slow considerably. The shift to a clean energy, low carbon economy will provide new job opportunities for Australians, particularly or fast growing clean industries such as renewable energy, ecotourism, carbon farming and sustainable design. New opportunities will also emerge in existing industries as enterprises move to implement new business practices to increase their efficiency and competitiveness. The Government recognises the importance of continued jobs growth and the necessary investment in skills and workforce development to achieve this aim. As part of the Securing a Clean Energy Future plan, the Prime Minister jobs. announced the Clean Energy and Other Skills Package on 12 July 2011. Through this package, up to $32 million over 4 years will be invested to enable tradespeople and professionals in key industries to develop the skills needed to deliver clean energy services, products and advice to Australian communities and businesses. The package is being implemented by my Department. As the Australian economy continues this transition towards green growth, skills for sustainability will be increasingly important across the entire workforce. Workers with sustainability skills will have the capacity to increase energy efficiency, reduce waste, conserve water and develop and implement sustainable technologies and practices. My Department has a central role in promoting the uptake of these skills across the economy through embedding skills for sustainability principles and practices throughout the National Training System. To help build the capacity of the Vocational Education and Training (VET) sector to provide skills for sustainability, the Council of Australian Governments endorsed a national Green Skills Agreement to ensure that practical sustainability training is a fundamental part of all VET programs. More information is available at www.deewr.gov.au/skillsforsustainability. Through initiatives such as these the Government is ensuring that all Australians are able to participate and prosper in Australia's Clean Energy Future. I trust the information provided is helpful. from the Minister for Tertiary Education, in new Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations, Senator Chris Evans Asbestos Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 25 August 2011, on behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, regarding the petition you have received requesting that Australia take a leading role in the establishment of an international treaty to prevent the mining and exporting of asbestos. I apologise for the delay in responding. The petition appears to deal principally with matters that fall under the portfolio responsibilities of the Hon Kevin Rudd MP, Minister for Foreign Affairs. I note from your letter that you have forwarded a copy of the petition to Minister Rudd. However, asbestos exacts a terrible human toll in Australia and the Australian Government is committed to doing everything it can to ensure that asbestos management arrangements in Australia minimise the risk of avoidable exposure. That is why on 29 October 2010 I announced the establishment of the Asbestos Management Review. The review will assess current activities in the area of asbestos management and research and recommendations for the development of a national strategic plan to improve asbestos awareness and management. I also note from your correspondence that the petition requests that business ethics be taught in Australian schools and universities. As this matter falls within the portfolio responsibilities of the Hon Peter Garrett AM MP, Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, you may wish to forward a copy of the petition to his Office for appropriate action. Thank you for bringing this matter to my attention. from the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations, Senator Chris Evans Road Infrastructure Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for letter dated 13 October 2011 about the petition regarding federal funding for the F3 to Sydney Orbital design works. The Australian Government made available $150 million to the NSW Government for planning activities for the F3 to Sydney Orbital Link project. This funding was provided on the basis that NSW provide a 20% contribution to the project. Within the period from the commencement of the Nation Building Program in July 2008 to the May 2011 Federal Budget, no commitment was made by the NSW Government to this project. I understand that NSW is currently reevaluating its infrastructure priorities through the development of a 20-year state infrastructure strategy, which assesses the needs of NSW in terms of infrastructure. The NSW Government is being assisted in this process by the newly established Infrastructure NSW. Last year the Australian Government tasked Infrastructure Australia to undertake work to investigate private financing options for the F3 to Sydney Orbital and the M5 East extension. The outcome of its examination of options will help guide future decisions around this project. Thank you for raising this matter. make from the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, Mr Albanese Member for Fisher: Travel Expenditure Dear Mr Murphy Re: Petition regarding entitlement usage. Thank you for your letter of 19 September 2011 regarding a petition considered recently by the Standing Committee on Petitions seeking an audit, with oversight by the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO), of entitlement use by the Member for Fisher. The petition required that he specify the parliamentary or electorate business that he was undertaking on each occasion in the past decade that he accessed his parliamentary entitlements. The petition also sought a tightening of the parliamentary entitlements framework to require Senators and Members to provide detail of the parliamentary or electorate business associated with each use of their entitlements. To begin with, I can inform your Committee that there is no statutory or other basis for me to request any such action on the part of any individual Member or Senator to specify the precise nature of the Parliamentary or electorate business undertaken over the past decade. You would be aware that, since August 2003, all Members or Senators are required to personally certify that the use of entitlements is for those prescribed purposes. I also draw the attention of the Committee to the enhancements of accountability and transparency mechanisms which have been added to the Parliamentarian's entitlements system, as set out below, since 2007. Key features of the Government's actions in this area are greater transparency and accountability, including an expanded range of parliamentarians' entitlement use tabled biannually in Parliament covering all parliamentary entitlements administered by the Department of Finance and Deregulation (Finance). Previously, only the travel expenditure of Senators, Members and former parliamentarians was tabled; this represented less than 10 per cent of the value of all entitlements use. Tabling reports now include the cost of travel, printing, postage, telecommunications, stationery, office fit outs and furniture, office administration costs as well as all family travel expenditure. In addition to tabling all entitlement use, the Government has introduced the six-monthly reporting of parliamentary expenditure on Finance's internet site. This has dramatically improved the availability of information to the media and the general public, which has enhanced the debate on entitlement use. Details of parliamentary entitlements expenditure since July 2008 are available on Finance's internet site www.finance.gov.au/publications/parliamentarian s-reporting/index.html. I note that the petitioners' reference to the Member for Fisher's specific use of entitlements is directly linked to information available as a consequence of the Government's policy of greater transparency and accountability. In November 2008, the first ever annual report on staff employed by Senators and Members under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984 (MOP(S) Act) was presented by the then Special Minister of State. This report, which has now been produced three times, presents details of staffing numbers, salary ranges, payroll, travel and support costs as well as non-salary benefits and details of professional development, other training and occupational health and safety of all MOP(S) Act employees. The three MOP(S) Act annual reports are also available online on Finance's internet site. The new disclosure requirements under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI Act) which were established by this Government and took effect from 11 May 2011 ensure that all material released under the FOI Act that relates to parliamentary entitlements is also made public on Finance's internet site. Finance also proactively published certain material that was released under the FOI Act prior to 11 May 2011, including information on parliamentary entitlements. In the interests of transparency, the Senators and Members' Entitlements handbook and other documents relating to the framework of parliamentary entitlements are also published by Finance on its intranet site at www.finance.gov.au/publications/parliamentaryservices/documents-relating-to-parliamentaryentitlements-legislation.html. Although Senators and Members remain responsible for their use of entitlements, Finance monitors expenditure under capped parliamentary entitlements to help ensure that Senators and entitlement Members do not exceed their entitlement budgets. This is yet another tool to ensure that usage is within entitlement. In circumstances where there is an allegation of misuse of an entitlement, there is an established protocol for considering such matters which was first put in place by then Special at Minister of State Minchin in 1998. Under the protocol followed by Finance when it is alleged that a Senator or Member has misused an entitlement, Finance makes inquiries to confirm that the entitlement was used in accordance with its purpose. In the event of a more serious allegation or high incidence of transgression (or further investigation would involve interviewing members of the public) the matter is referred to a high-level departmental committee. In considering the allegation, the high-level committee may seek the advice of the Secretary, Attorney-General's Department, as to whether the matter warrants referral to the Australian Federal Police for any further action. The ANAO conducts regular audits into Finance's administration of parliamentary entitlements, most recently in 2009-10, 2003-04 and 2001-02. Consistent with their purpose, these audits provided the Parliament with an independent assessment of the administration of parliamentary entitlements. Although the ANAO has powers to initiate audits in addition to its regular audit plan, it has not historically conducted audits of individual parliamentarians' use of entitlements. To ensure that Finance is appropriately administering parliamentary entitlements and to help maintain an appropriate level of accountability, Finance has adopted a number of the recommendations from the ANAO's recent audits. In addition to the audits conducted by the ANAO, Finance also undertakes regular internal audits to help ensure that Parliamentarians' use of entitlements is consistent with the legislative framework. These mechanisms are reinforced by Senators and Members' regular certification that their use of entitlements is in accordance with the purpose for which they are provided, generally for parliamentary or electorate business. A new element of the latest tabling of entitlement expenditure on the Finance internet is the inclusion of a record of Senators and Members' certification of their entitlement use. Backed by the Criminal Code Act 1995 which applies to false or misleading declarations, I consider that the checks and balances that exist in the system of parliamentary entitlements provide an appropriate level of accountability, a level which is consistent with the level of trust placed in Senators and Members by the Australian people in electing them as their parliamentary representatives. However, it is recognised that there is scope for improvement in the parliamentary entitlements framework, which is why this Government commissioned a review of the entitlements system in April 2009. The recommendations of this review are currently under consideration by the Remuneration Tribunal, and I look forward to receiving its advice in due course. The Government is also currently undertaking a full-scale review of the Parliamentary Entitlements Act and associated regulations, with the aim of simplifying them and making them easier for politicians and administrators to understand and comply with, with a firm legislative base for the accountability and transparency mechanisms referred to above. Thank you for seeking my views on this matter. You may wish to consider drawing the issues surrounding parliamentarians' use of entitlements that are raised in this petition to the attention of the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges in the context of their development of a draft code of conduct for Senators, and to the Standing Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests in relation to their recently tabled Report on the same matter. from the Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity, Mr Gray Importation of Primates Dear Mr Murphy The former Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator the Hon Kim Carr, acknowledges your letter of 24 November 2011 concerning a petition regarding the request for an immediate ban on the importation of primates for research purposes. As this matter lies within the portfolio responsibilities of the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, I have forwarded your correspondence to the Hon Tony Burke MP for consideration. from the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr Carbon Pricing Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 13 October 2011 alerting me to the petition regarding opposition to the carbon tax submitted for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions. Scientists advise that the world is warming and high levels of carbon pollution risk environmental and economic damage. No responsible government can ignore this advice. The Government is committed to acting on climate change because it wants to leave a better Australia for future generations. The Clean Energy Legislative Package was passed by the Senate on 8 November 2011. It sets out the legislative framework through which Australia will introduce a carbon price to reduce our carbon pollution and move to a clean energy future. A carbon price is not a tax on households around 500 of the biggest polluters in Australia will be required to pay for their pollution, and every dollar raised will be used to support households, jobs, and to invest in clean energy and climate change programs. Putting a price on carbon is the most environmentally effective and cheapest way to cut pollution. This is a fact that is well economists from around the world and respected institutions such as the OECD, the IMF and the Productivity Commission. Currently, releasing carbon pollution is free despite the fact that it is harming our environment. A carbon price changes this. It puts a price on the carbon pollution that Australia's largest polluters produce. This creates a powerful incentive for businesses to cut their pollution by investing in clean technology or finding more efficient ways of operating. I understand the concerns the petition has raised about the implementation of carbon pricing and the impact this will have on the cost of living. While carbon pricing will result in changes in the prices of a wide range of household goods and services, the overall increase in the cost of living for the average Australian family is expected to be modest. Treasury analysis predicts the introduction of carbon pricing will increase the consumer price index by 0.7 per cent in 2012-13 - that is less than a cent for every dollar spent. To assist households with price impacts, there will be tax cuts and increases in pensions, allowances and benefits. Nine in ten households will receive financial assistance to help deal with this. Almost six million Australian households will receive assistance that meets or exceeds their expected average additional costs. Recent analysis by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling (NATSEM), an independent research centre with considerable expertise in this sort of modelling, supported the conclusions of the Treasury analysis. Indeed, it suggested the price impacts are likely to be somewhat smaller and the compensation slightly higher than the Treasury estimates. The Government is also committed to supporting jobs and competitiveness as we make the transition to a clean energy economy. The Jobs and Competitiveness Program will provide around $9 billion worth of assistance over the first three years of the carbon price to support industries and protect jobs, and will continue to support businesses on an ongoing basis. In recognised by addition, around $1 billion will be provided for manufacturers to invest in energy efficiency projects and low-emissions technologies, processes and products and help reduce the carbon costs faced by manufacturers. These measures will help ensure that Australia continues to experience strong jobs growth while at the same time providing incentives to cut pollution in our economy. By acting now, Australians can look forward to long term prosperity while protecting our environment for ourselves and for our future generations. Importantly, the Australian economy will continue to grow strongly at the same time as we cut pollution to reduce the risks of dangerous climate change. By 2020 national employment is projected to increase by 1.6 million jobs. Under carbon pricing average incomes measured by gross national income (GNI) per person increase by around $9,000 from today's level to 2020 and by more than $30,000 to 2050. Thank you for bringing this petition to my attention. I trust this information will be of assistance to you. from the Treasurer, Mr Swan Australian Broadcasting Corporation Dear Mr Murphy Petition regarding ABC lawn bowls Thank you for your letter dated 24 November 2011 concerning the petition on the reinstatement free-to-air broadcasts of lawn bowls on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). The petitioners' request is noted and I acknowledge that the ABC's decision to cease broadcasting lawn bowls has caused considerable disappointment in the bowls community. While I appreciate the concerns of the petitioners, it is important to note that the Australian Government provides an overall level of funding to the ABC, but has no power to direct the ABC in relation to programming matters. Parliament has guaranteed this independence to ensure that what is broadcast is free of political interference. Internal ABC programming decisions are the responsibility of the ABC Board and Executive. The petitioners may wish to contact the ABC directly in regards to their request for the immediate reinstatement of lawn bowls on the ABC. As you may be aware, the Senate Environment and Communications References Committee has completed an inquiry into ""Recent ABC programming decisions"", which included ABC's coverage of lawn bowls. The committee released its report on 13 October 2011 and the government will provide a response to the report in due course. A copy of the report can be found at www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/ec_ctte/abc/report/index.htm In the ABC's response to Questions on Notice from the public hearing conducted as part of this inquiry, it explained that its decision to cease bowls coverage was editorial. It explained that bowls has been on the ABC for many years, and audience numbers have declined markedly in this time. In 2009, average five city audience numbers were 200,674, while the most recent audience figures for 2011 are 168,000. The ABC noted that Senator the Hon Mark Arbib, Minister for Sport has raised this matter with them, and their discussion into the potential for future coverage of lawn bowls on ABC television is ongoing. I am advised that this is still the case. A copy of the ABC's response to Questions on Notice can be found www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/ec_ctte/abc/s ubmissions.htm Thank you for bringing this important issue to my attention. from the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Economy, Senator Conroy Child Care Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letters of 15 December 2011 regarding petitions requesting the House to delay the implementation of the National Quality Reform Agenda on long-day childcare. Reference numbers 594/983, 597/986, 596/985, 595/984 and 592/978 refer. I have noted the petition and appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention. The implementation of the National Quality Reform Agenda on long-day childcare falls within the portfolio responsibilities of the Minister for Employment Participation and the Minister for Early Childhood and Childcare, the Hon Kate MP. I note you have forwarded these petitions to Minister Ellis. Please be assured that Minister Ellis is best placed to address this issue. from the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Ms Macklin Better Start for Children with Disability Program Dear Mr Murphy Thank you for your letter of 24 November 2011 on behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions about the Better Start for Children with Disability (Better Start) initiative petition presented by the Member for Adelaide, the Hon Kate Ellis MP, on 24 November 2011 and signed by 2,261 citizens. On 28 July 2010, the Prime Minister, the Hon Julia Gillard MP, announced new funding to improve access to early intervention therapies for eligible children with disabilities that affect their development. Under the Better Start initiative, Down Syndrome, cerebral palsy, Fragile X Syndrome at and moderate or greater vision or hearing impairments, including deafblindness, are the identified disabilities. The Australian Government recognises there are other conditions that may benefit from early intervention. I asked the Department of Families, Digital Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs to seek expert advice about evidence for early intervention in relation to other types of childhood disability and developmental delay, including an analysis of current research. On 20 December 2011 I released a review of evidence for the effectiveness of early intervention for children with a range of developmental disabilities. The review, which was undertaken by KPMG, can be accessed http://www.fahcsia.gov.au/sa/disability/pubs/ policy/early intervention review/Pages/default.as x. Along with the planned evaluation of the Better Start initiative, this will help inform the future direction of the program, including consideration of extending it more broadly. The Better Start initiative is not intended to replace or reduce specialised disability support services that are provided in each jurisdiction. State and territory governments are the main providers of disability services in their respective jurisdictions and provide access to a wide range of services for children with disability and their families and carers. We have made good progress in the early design and development of a National Disability Insurance Scheme since the Prime Minister, the Hon Julia Gillard MP, released the Productivity Commission's final report into care and support for people with disability on 10 August 2011. All governments have agreed to lay the foundations for a National Disability Insurance Scheme by mid-2013 - a year ahead of the timetable set out by the Productivity Commission. On 3 December 2011, the Prime Minister announced the establishment of a dedicated agency to guide the development of a National Disability Insurance Scheme. This agency will lead the detailed design work for the launch of a scheme and will develop the practical plan for how we deliver this significant reform. This will be supported with an additional $10 million for projects to examine how the design elements of a scheme will work in practice. The Government is committed to delivering a National Disability Insurance Scheme, and to making sure that people with disability, their families, carers, advocates and those who provide services are at the centre of this reform. For more information, visit the NDIS website at www.ndis.gov.au. Thank you again for writing on behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions. from the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers, Senator MCLucas NA at: Statements",28
3,Mr MURPHY,PETITIONS," Mr Speaker, I have just tabled, on behalf of the Petitions Committee, a large number of petitions and ministerial responses in the first chair's announcement of 2012. Therefore, my comments will be brief. As a refresher for the start of the year, I will make some important points about petitioning and the opportunities for the public to learn about the process. The House Petitions Committee holds a procedural role in ensuring that petitions which meet standing orders requirements are received, can be presented to the House and receive a ministerial response. Petitions are assessed for compliance with the rules of the House only-the personal views of committee members one way or another about the subject matter are not a factor in the assessment. Petitions which do not meet House standing orders cannot be tabled as petitions. So the committee encourages petitioners to ensure they understand the House's requirements before they go to the effort of gathering signatures. This way they can have the full benefit of the petitions process of the House. As well as the procedural role, the committee plays a role in educating the Australian public about the petitioning process-providing online and printed resources, and telephone, mail and email support through the committee's secretariat, who do such a good job. So, on behalf of the committee, I encourage prospective petitioners to contact the secretariat about the formal aspects of petitioning before they begin work on what might be a noncompliant petition. I should point out the Petitions Committee's role is limited. This was highlighted for the committee at its round-table hearings in Victoria last December. I will talk more about these hearings in the coming tabling statements, but at this stage I will thank those petitioners who came to meet us in a very constructive couple of meetings. In coming weeks I will expand on what the committee gleaned about the value of the petitioning process and what petitioners expect from it. The Petitions Committee does not investigate details of petitions or make recommendations to the government about petition requests-nor does it advocate for petition outcomes. Rather, its role is to facilitate and communicate, acting as a bridge between the House and the government and petitioners, and educating Australians about this aspect of the House of Representatives. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Private Members' Motions Reference to Main Committee The SPEAKER (10:09): In accordance with standing order 41(g) and the determinations of the Selection Committee, I present copies of the terms of three motions for which notice has been given by the member for Lyne and copies of the terms of motions for which notice has been given by the members for Fowler, Melbourne, Banks, Kingston and Shortland. These items will be considered in the Main Committee later today. NA Gambling Reform Committee Report",49
4,Mr WILKIE,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform, I present the committee's report entitled Second report: interactive and online gambling and gambling advertising; and Interactive Gambling and Broadcasting Amendment (Online Transactions and Other Measures) Bill 2011, incorporating additional comments, together with evidence received by the committee. Online gambling is the fastest growing form of gambling in Australia. In fact Australians spend around $790 million each year playing overseas online casino-type games and around the same amount on sports betting in Australia, increasingly in the online format. Those involved are not your typical poker machine player or racetrack goer but rather younger people, particularly younger men. The primary legislation covering online gambling in Australia is the Interactive Gambling Act 2001. The committee examined this legislation and found that it had been very effective in banning the provision of Australian based interactive gambling services to Australians. Consequently we agreed that the act should be retained and recommended a strengthening of its ban on certain advertising practices, such as 'practice' websites and offering inducements to gamble. However, committee members took different views on how to address the area where the IGA appears to be most deficient-that is, the ability of the IGA to limit or restrict Australians accessing overseas online gambling services. Another key area covered by the committee's report was gambling advertising, particularly in association with sport. Gambling during sport has become normalised in Australia and the committee agreed there should be much stricter regulation in this area. What was also evident during the inquiry was the significant community concern about the proliferation of advertising for sports betting services. Children in particular are being constantly bombarded with advertising for gambling during sporting programs and the committee heard alarming stories about children and young people now not talking about their team's form but instead talking about their team's odds. Experts told the committee that the proliferation of advertising at sporting venues and during sporting broadcasts could be having an adverse impact on children who are vulnerable to such marketing-that it is contributing to what has been called the 'gamblification' of sport. In other words the abundance of gambling advertising during sport is normalising gambling for children. While the committee welcomes the work already underway by government and industry to reduce and control the broadcasting of live odds, our report calls for a total ban on their promotion, underpinned by legislation. The committee has also recommended that the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 be amended to prohibit gambling advertising during times when children are likely to be watching, including all sporting broadcasts during those times. The committee also examined the risk of match fixing and welcomes the current work underway through the Council of Australian Governments to develop the national policy on match fixing. We also looked at certain bet types such as 'in play' betting and exotic betting and recommended further research on the risks of such practices. And finally the committee considered Senator Xenophon's Interactive Gambling and Broadcasting Amendment (Online Transactions and Other Measures) Bill 2011. While generally supportive of the intent of several proposals in the bill-for example, on advertising and match fixing-the committee formed the view that more work was required and the bill should not be passed in its present form. The committee received a total of 78 submissions and heard from a wide variety of interested stakeholders during the inquiries. In response, 20 recommendations were made across three key areas: the provisions of the Commonwealth's Interactive Gambling Act, online sports betting and wagering services, and advertising for overseas and domestic online gambling sites. These inquiries have been a valuable opportunity for the committee to learn about relatively new forms of gambling which are entering a period of rapid growth. This is timely because now is the time to learn the lessons from the liberalisation of other forms of gambling, such as poker machines, and to do all we can to reduce further harm. I sincerely thank all those who submitted material and I thank the witnesses for their contributions. I want to also thank all committee members for their interest and participation in this inquiry and for their genuine spirit of cooperation. And in particular I want to thank the committee's secretariat staff-Ms Lyn Beverley, Ms Meg Banfield and Ms Katie Bird-who have done a very fine job over of a number of inquiries in sometimes difficult circumstances. I commend the report to the House. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.",50
5,Mr CHAMPION,COMMITTEES," I commend the Chair of the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform. He has often had to put up with trying circumstances, as I know the secretariat have. I second his commendation of their work. This inquiry into interactive and online gambling and gaming advertising was an important inquiry-it was all about bringing these issues, which have surreptitiously crept into our everyday lives, into this parliament for us to consider. We have noticed over the last 60 years or so the invasion of TV into homes-into living rooms, bedrooms and everywhere else in the modern householdbut we are now seeing modern technologies spread themselves into our daily lives more and more. You only have to look at politicians and Twitter accounts and tablets and the like to know they are changing the nature of politics. Of course they are changing the nature of gambling, and that trend will accelerate. This parliament will have to be very aware of emerging technologies so we can appropriately and not just chase the tail of the gambling monster, as it were. The committee makes a number of important recommendations. The sooner recommendation No. 1, concerning the independent research institute, implemented, the sooner the parliament will be in a much better position to assess the claims and counterclaims of proponents of reform and those who seek to avoid reform and avoid their increasing responsibilities as the providers of these services. Recommendation No. 9, which talks about a reduction in account verification from 21 days to 72 hours, protects children in particular and also generally the integrity of the industry. Recommendation No. 15 involves a total ban on the promotion of live odds at venues and during the broadcast of games. Much of the evidence given to the committee-and a lot of anecdotal evidence-is that people do not like going to the game and having gambling constantly shoved down their throats and therefore obviously down the throats of young people in attendance. Recommendation No. 19 concerns prohibiting gambling advertising during children's viewing times. In this modern world we do not give children much time to have a childhood anymore. Kids grow up pretty fast and part of that process involves what they are exposed to on television. Over the last 15 years we have seen a liberalisation of standards and a willingness of broadcasters to push the envelope. Maybe that is because of competitive pressures and maybe it is because of self-regulation, but much of what children take in by watching TV is of concern to society, as it should be to this parliament. Recommendation No. 16 concerns a mandatory code of conduct for the advertising of wagering, including inducements to bet, credit betting, third-party legislate commissions, harm minimisation messages on responsible gambling and having national consistent standards particularly in regard to logos on uniforms and the replication of guernseys, for example, for children which might have gambling logos on them. We is want to have a mandatory code of conduct so that some of those more egregious things are taken out. This has inspired some government action, which is on the public record, and that is an important thing. It is important that the committee continue its work. This is a very interesting area of public policy, a very contested area of public policy, but I think we have added to the knowledge of this parliament and to the knowledge in the community of some of the issues that the community has to face. I commend the chair once again for his excellent conduct.",51

10,Mr MELHAM,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I present the committee's report entitled Report on the funding of political parties and election campaigns, incorporating dissenting reports, together with the minutes of proceedings. When Australia's funding and disclosure system was introduced in 1984 it was a leader in the field. However, more than a quarter of a century later, Australia's political financing arrangements are in need of review and revitalising. In a democracy like Australia, it is vital to have transparency and accountability as core features of our political financing arrangements, so we can all have confidence in our system. The Australian people have the right to know where their money is coming from and where it goes, so they can make informed decisions when selecting representatives. It is important that any changes made in Australia to funding and disclosure arrangements at the Commonwealth level are not merely a reaction to incidents or calls for reform but a considered and carefully designed approach to help ensure transparency and accountability. It is important to safeguard the integrity of our funding and disclosure system, but it is also vital not to unduly restrict the ability of individuals and groups to engage in the political arena, whether through donating to a candidate, political party or third party, or advocating on a particular issue. Australians' rights to freedom of political expression and participation must also remain a high priority. In making the recommendations in this report, the committee has sought to strike an appropriate balance between these competing concerns. The committee considered a cross-section Report of views during the course of this inquiry and developed what it believes is a measured approach, providing practical reforms to improve the current funding and disclosure system. Key reforms include increasing the level and frequency of disclosure by reducing the disclosure threshold from the current $11,900 (indexed to CPI) to $1,000, without indexation. The reporting requirement for political parties, associated entities and third parties will initially move from annually to six-monthly reporting, with a view to moving to contemporaneous reporting following an investigation of options by the Australian Electoral Commission. The committee also recommended the introduction of special reporting of single donations over $100,000, which must be disclosed to the AEC within 14 business days of receiving the donation and made their publically available soon after on the AEC website. The committee also supports clarifying the definition of 'gift' to include the receipt of money from fundraising events, to help improve the transparency of money received from attendees at these events. To improve the overall transparency of the flow of money, the committee also proposes requiring greater disclosure of political expenditure. Currently, expenditure is disclosed as a block sum with no specific details. These increased disclosure requirements will place additional administrative burdens on those with reporting obligations. To help address this, an additional stream of funding is proposed to assist Independents and political parties in meeting their increased obligations. While the provision of administrative funding does mean additional public money, the increased transparency will leave electors better armed with relevant information about the movement of money. The committee has also recommendations to enhance administrative efficiency of disclosure arrangements, including the AEC enhancing its online lodgement system to assist those with reporting requirements for donations and expenditure. The committee also proposed reforms to the public funding arrangements, including having a reimbursement scheme to operate alongside the per vote payment system. Eligible candidates and parties will then receive the lesser amount of the two options. This will help ensure that payments received are appropriate and do not provide a windfall to candidates. It was also recommended that winning a seat should serve as a threshold for entitlement to public funding in cases when the member or senator has not attained the four per cent threshold. The committee also recognised that effective compliance arrangements are essential for a workable funding and disclosure scheme. Australia's system of compliance and enforcement of its political financing arrangements are based on an ex post facto approach-punishing breaches non-compliance after the fact. The penalties for offences against the funding and disclosure provisions are relatively weak and have not been updated since the scheme's introduction in 1984. All offences are criminal offences and so must be prosecuted by the Commonwealth DPP before a penalty can be imposed on those who breach the funding and disclosure requirements. However, the successful prosecution of offences has proven difficult. This has been attributed to the relatively low penalties for some funding and disclosure offences, which, it been suggested, sends a message to the CDPP that these offences are not viewed as serious. made. I thank the committee secretariat and the members of the committee, in particular our technical adviser, Ms Christine Wickremasinghe. (Time expired) In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP (Mackellar) (10:26): The report on the funding of political parties and election campaigns was a most contentious series of hearings and report. This is a very political report. The committee was split down the middle between the government and the Greens and the opposition, because this report is designed to benefit Labor, the Greens and their compatriots-the union mates and GetUp!. In our dissenting report, we pointed out that the decision to lower the threshold for disclosure to $1,000 non-indexed was a requirement of the Greens in their alliance with the Labor Party to form government. It is designed to benefit both those parties, because it will penalise the coalition parties, who rely on small donations from individuals and small firms. Before the higher threshold was reached there was or plenty of evidence around of the badgering of published donors who had donated to the coalition parties where both the Labor Party and the unions said, 'Where is our donation?'-or threats of another kind. We find this sort of thing is not conducive to and not compatible with participatory democracy, where it is important that individuals and firms, be they small or large, have both an obligation and a right to participate in having their point of view heard and may make a donation to their party of choice without expecting a penalty or to be abused by an opposing party. The inquiry taught us some valuable lessons. It taught us particularly about GetUp!, which claims to be an independent body. We became aware that all the large donations it receives-for instance, $1 million from the CFMEU and other donations from ALP affiliates-mean that it is not entitled to call itself independent. Further, when I asked how many voting members it has, it claimed that it has 600,000 members. Yet, when you look at its constitution, the number of voting members by its own admission is less than 12. I also asked whether, if I clicked onto its website, I would be counted as a member, and its answer was yes. On the question of the Greens and the donation of $1.6 million from Mr Graeme Wood, the founder of Wotif-and of course the purchaser, together with a partner, of the mill in Tasmania-we noted that disclosure of that $1.6 million had been 'put off', in the words of Mr Brett Constable, the Greens national manager, and that it was 'really out of respect for the donor'. We learnt that Mr Wood gave his reasons to the Financial Review on 30 July 2011 for his giving $1.6 million. He said: I was a bit concerned that if the Coalition lot of my investments in environmental causes would have been down the plughole. It will hopefully save me a whole lot of money in fighting other environmental wars or battles. So much for the Greens and GetUp! saying they do not wish to peddle influence and they think it is wrong that donations to other parties would have a similar effect. The fact of the matter is that there was no evidence except that which I have read out that there is indeed an attempt to buy and peddle influence. The inquiry also showed the inconsistencies that exist with no willingness to attack the huge donations flowing from the trade union movement to the Labor Party and their friends. Trade union donations are a tax deduction and that makes available another pool of tax deductibility for union members, who can also donate a further $1,500 in addition to their union fees to the Labor Party cause. The coalition is opposed to the thrust of this report where it benefits Labor and the Greens. There were some minor matters that were dealt with in the report to which we gave some support, but the overall thrust of the report is not full of integrity-a word that some like to use in association with these matters. Rather, it is one that is partisan. (Time expired)",53

15,Mr RIPOLL,BILLS," On behalf of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, I present the committee's report, entitled Inquiry into Consumer Credit and Corporations Legislation Amendment (Enhancements) Bill 2011, incorporating additional comments together with evidence received by the committee. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.",55
16,Mr RIPOLL,BILLS,"On 22 September last year the House referred the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services an inquiry into the Consumer Credit and Corporations Legislation Amendment (Enhancements) Bill 2011. The committee's report was presented to the Speaker out of session on 2 December last year. As chair of that committee I am pleased now to be able to table the report here in the House. The bill furthers the government's commitment and good work, as well as the resolution of the Council of Australian Governments to introduce a national system of consumer credit regulation-something that has been due and waited for in this country for a very long time. COAG agreed that the new consumer credit system would address areas of concern with the operation of state and territory consumer credit laws and this bill does exactly that. It delivers on the commitment that Labor made to ensure that there was national, state and territorial consistency on consumer credit. The bill proposes a new approach to the regulation of reverse mortgages, consumer leases and short-term lending, colloquially known as 'payday lending'. The bill also contains measures to assist borrowers to vary repayments under a credit contract in circumstances of financial hardship. In addition the bill introduces remedies for unfair and dishonest conduct on the part of creditors. The committee agrees that improvements are needed to address concerns with the regulation of these areas of consumer credit law and the government has worked hard to ensure that we have the best options put forward. The committee considers that the measures proposed further the objects of consumer protection and fullyinformed market participation. However, in the course of the inquiry the committee identified areas where the operation of the proposed consumer credit laws could be further strengthened. To this end the committee has made 14 recommendations. Much of the public debate regarding the bill has focused on the regulation of shortterm loans in particular. It is to this matter that I draw the House's attention. The committee understands that the reforms are intended to balance consumer protection with the continued viability of the short-term lending sector, an industry which provides a valuable service to the community. The bill recognises that more can be done to protect consumers accessing short-term loans, but evidence presented to the committee was not conclusive that the measures proposed are the best means of securing necessary consumer protections while at the same time maintaining a viable short-term loan industry. The government has taken note of this and is working to ensure that we get the balance right between protecting consumers and making sure that an industry continues to survive. Accordingly, the committee recommends that the government undertake further consultation on the proposed regulation of short-term loans. In conducting the inquiry, the committee received 53 submissions and it held one public hearing, during which the committee heard from 19 different organisations. I want to express my thanks for the good work of the committee secretariat and acknowledge the continuing hard work of all the committee members, and particularly the deputy chair, Senator Sue Boyce, and all of those who participated. This inquiry was important because it did look at a particular area of consumer credit that is controversial. There no question about that. People have differing views across differing jurisdictions, particularly refer to payday lending. Generally, it would be accepted by most people that it has a bad name and there certainly are some players in that sector of the market that do the wrong thing. That is less and less becoming the case, and with better regulation we will we have a properly regulated, properly managed and professional sector that can provide a service for a gap in the market people who find themselves in need of a short-term, small-amount loan. If it is done properly, if it is regulated properly and if consumer protections are in place, then both can coexist: consumers can have access to a service and access to credit and they can be protected against unscrupulous operators, and we will still have a viable sector. That was the intent of the committee of inquiry and of the work of all the committee members. I commend the report to the House.",56
17,Mr FLETCHER,BILLS," I am pleased to make some comments in relation to the presentation of the report the Consumer Credit and Corporations Legislation Amendment (Enhancements) Bill 2011. The issue of so-called payday lending is a complex one. The very use of the term 'payday lending' suggests unattractive images of people being forced to turn to a lender who charges very high rates and the people needing to do so to cope with their cash-flow difficulties, being unable to get from one payday to the next without having to turn to lenders who are putting them in a difficult position. But, like many complex issues, the reality is somewhat different from that assumption which can be made. The committee heard extensive evidence from a range of interested parties, including members of the short-term lending industry who described their business methods and their charges. We also learnt about the regulatory approach imposed by the when we disastrous New South Wales Labor government in its dying days, including a notional cap on the amount of interest that may be charged by short-term lenders. In fact, the way the formula works tends to overlook the reality. If you have a loan of a find relatively small nominal amount, a few hundred dollars, but flat administrative charges which need to be incurred-charges for dealing with such matters as credit assessment and so on-the application of a formula can lead to the charges being presumed to exceed that formulaic limit. That is really because the formula is simply not appropriate to deal with the reality that there are certain costs which need to be incurred and those costs tend not to vary whether the amount which is being lent is a few hundred dollars or a few thousand dollars. We also heard from groups such as many of the consumer credit legal services around Australia. The coalition wants to commend the important work done by the people in on those services. It is important and difficult work. Nevertheless, the coalition members of the committee are in agreement with the conclusion of the majority report that some of the provisions in the bill as it currently stands would have an undesirably deleterious impact on the short-term lending industry. They would make it more difficult for loans of relatively small amounts for short terms to be provided than is possible today. That would leave Australians who rely on this sector with fewer options to meet their needs for short-term finance. The committee process has been a constructive one as to understanding in some detail the business practices of the short-term lending sector.",57
18,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," Order! The time allocated for this debate has expired. NA Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee Report  behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, I rise to make a statement concerning the committee's inquiry into the incidence and prevention of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder, or FASD. FASD is the umbrella term for a spectrum of permanent intellectual disorders that are caused when a foetus is exposed to alcohol in the womb. FASDs do not discriminate and are not just an issue for Indigenous communities with high alcohol consumption. FASD is a hidden epidemic happening right now across Australia-it occurs in all our communities, regardless of socio-economic or ethnic background. You may have seen some people with FASD who have the telltale facial features. But many more FASD sufferers carry no physical indication of their intellectual impairment, which includes learning difficulties, low IQ, behavioural and socialising problems, organ damage, mental health issues, poor judgment and an inability to understand consequences or the difference between right and wrong, which can cause problems for young people post puberty. Many of these children will end up in the child protection system, separated from family members and moved from foster home to foster home. The committee heard moving evidence from a foster father of five children, all FASD, in Cairns on 31 January of this year. All MPs should read the Hansard transcript to get an idea of how some very dedicated people are struggling to care for kids with FASD without any training, support or financial assistance. There are people with FASD in every electorate in Australia, and they and their carers all need support but are unable to access it. This is because, unlike the United States and Canada, Australia does not formally recognise FASD as a disability. Australia also lacks a nationally agreed diagnostic tool, and medical professionals are not educated adequately on FASD diagnosis and referral. The prevalence of FASD in Australia has not been ascertained yet. More awareness of the effects of alcohol on unborn babies needs to be promoted in all our communities, especially among young women and those at risk of alcohol abuse. The best hope for children with FASD is early intervention, followed by comprehensive support services to manage their health, education, housing and employment. Yet, without recognition of FASD as a prescribed disability, people with FASD and their carers are unable to access disability pensions and community care services. Australians with FASD desperately need access to services that improve their life outcomes. For these reasons, the committee's inquiry into FASD is an important one that builds on the work that FASD sentinelsfamilies, health workers, foster carers, teachers, and Indigenous communitieshave done to bring to our nation's attention this debilitating but preventable affliction. The committee will investigate effective prevention strategies to reduce the incidence of FASD in future generations. We will look at early intervention therapies that work for those recently born with FASD and at suitable management services which assist with them to avoid unemployment, ill health, homelessness and/or involvement with the criminal justice system later in life. The anticipated outcome of our inquiry is a commitment by this parliament to develop a national strategy for intervention and the prevention and management of FASD. This strategy should include a nationwide public health campaign, early adoption of an appropriate national diagnostic tool and recognition of FASD as a disability, thus allowing carers to access disability support benefits. We encourage anyone who has professional or personal experience with FASD to make a submission to our inquiry. Information about the inquiry is available at www.aph.gov.au/FASD. We urge people to make contact now. We need your input. I look forward to contributions to this important inquiry, particularly from the member for Murray, who has been so passionate about this topic.",57
19,Dr STONE,COMMITTEES," This is one of the most important inquiries we can run in our federal parliament, given that foetal alcohol spectrum disorder is the single largest and most commonly misdiagnosed cause of disability and, in particular, permanent intellectual impairment in the Australian community. At this point it attracts very little funding or support for those who have the condition or their carers. This inquiry is dealing with that need. I am sure it will be well received in a bipartisan way. One of the reasons I have helped to establish a parliamentary bipartisan group of like-minded members and senators is to help lift the cone of silence that has long paralysed Australia's recognition of and response to the damage that may occur to the brain and to other organs in the unborn where the mother consumes alcohol. For the last 220 years, since the commencement of European settlement, Australia has glorified and elevated the status of the consumption of what we sometimes call grog or booze-beer, wine or spirits. Celebration of wins on our sporting fields and significant stages in people's such as births, weddings or funerals do not pass without raising a glass or drenching the victors in alcohol. It is part of our way of life. In our history we have had eras where rum was currency and we had a rum rebellion. That has made us colourful and macho, many think, and certainly we are not unique in the world in sanctioning heavy or regular drinking. In the last 40 years, Australian women and girls have stepped up to join the men and boys at the bar. Girls can drink as hard and as long as the boys. This means our children now run an even greater risk of permanent and incurable brain damage should a pregnant mother consume alcohol at a critical time in development of the foetus or should she drink throughout her pregnancy. The tragedy is that many Australian women are not being informed of the dangers and risks of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Every survey conducted in Australia of women's knowledge about alcohol consumption during pregnancy shows a shocking majority have not been informed. This echoes the fact, backed up by recent WA Department of Health survey data, that health service professionals are also ignorant of the relationship between alcohol consumption and intellectual impairment or they choose not to talk about the relationship in order not to alarm the mother. We have private hospitals boasting of the wine menu accompanying their meals in maternity wards-it is one of their selling points. We lag behind other developed countries because we still do not mandate health warnings on alcohol containers, including warnings about the risks of consuming alcohol while pregnant. We lead the world in tobacco advertising and health warnings; we drag behind the world when it comes to lives highlighting the even more serious health impacts of alcohol consumption. This is why the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs has sought and received ministerial support to conduct this inquiry into the incidence and prevention of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder. I commend the government for taking up this critical issue. trust our final recommendations will be taken up and will help to make a real difference. In the evidence we have taken so far, in Canberra, Cairns and Townsville, we have seen and heard about the lifelong and tragic consequences that are the result of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Carers, very often foster parents, have told of their desperate struggle to obtain support for their children or even an official diagnosis. We have also seen and heard about the champions who are Australian pioneers in researching this problem, in developing carer support networks, information and education courses, school supports and help for those caught up in the prison system. These champions are very thin on the ground. They are exhausted and many have very little emotional and physical energy left to continue. While countries like Canada and the USA have 40 years of support and diagnostic tools, therapy centres and clinics, some in Australia are still challenging the National Health and Medical Research Council's recommendation that no alcohol during pregnancy or breast feeding is the safest option. This inquiry is extremely important. I want to thank the carer organisation NOFASARD for the use of their definition of FASD, which echoes the widely accepted international definition. FASD is an umbrella term which includes the abnormal facial features, growth delays, intellectual impairment, problems with learning, memory, attention and communication problems, vision or hearing impairments or damage to the skeleton or major organs of the body such as the heart and kidneys. Clearly this is a major problem which Australia must confront. I commend those already at work on this terrible problem.",59
20,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES, Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. NA Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Bandt.,60
21,Mr BANDT,BILLS," It is with great pride that I present the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012 and the explanatory memorandum. Today is the eve of Valentine's Day-a big day for love in the Australian parliament. We have here the first equal marriage bill ever to be introduced in this chamber. Last year, I successfully moved a motion calling on parliamentarians to consult their community about their views on marriage equality. We did that so that it could be understood in this place that outside views have moved on and that people in Australia want to see equality in our marriage laws. At the time. I said: Love knows no boundaries. Love knows no limits. And love knows when it has found its partner. There have been many attempts through history to limit love. All have failed. As we move further into the 21st century, I am confident that attempts to limit love will fail again and that full marriage equality will become a reality. Today we are moving closer to that reality. This is an historic day for this parliament and the country. It is an important step forward for human rights. Today is a good day for those who believe in the power of love and the power of love to change things for the better. This bill will amend the Marriage Act to provide equality for same-sex couples. The bill would remove discrimination under the Marriage Act so that marriage, while still a union between two consenting adults, is not defined by gender. I want to be clear about what this bill and does not do. This bill does apply to all marriages but it will also make clear that private religious organisations will not be required to marry anyone they do not wish to. This will mean that those churches or religious organisations that are not yet ready to change will be able to move towards change in their own time and in their own way. The Greens have worked long and hard to get us to the point that we are at now on the road to marriage equality. In 2009 my colleague Senator Sarah Hanson-Young introduced a similar bill into the Senate and it was sent to a Senate inquiry. That inquiry smashed Senate records, receiving more than 25,000 submissions, more than any other Senate inquiry ever has. It was clear that there was enormous community interest in the issue. In early 2010, the bill was put to a vote and defeated, but Senator HansonYoung and the Greens vowed to keep campaigning for full equality, and that is what we have done. As the campaign in the community has grown, we have kept the issue on the parliamentary and political agenda. The issue was a central concern in my successful election campaign in Melbourne. I think I was perhaps the only lower house candidate in the country elected on a platform where the issue was so central. During the campaign and subsequently I have had strong feedback and almost universal support for the Greens' stance on marriage equality. I have received several thousand emails on the issue and over nine in 10 have expressed support for marriage equality. In a survey that I conducted in my electorate of Melbourne in November of the year before last, marriage equality was one of the top priority issues for respondents and, of the 475 people who responded to the survey, does only one respondent expressed opposition to equal marriage rights. One of my first actions in parliament was to move a motion on the issue, and Senator Hanson-Young reintroduced her bill into the Senate. It is now subject to a Senate inquiry. Over the last two years we have become part of a widespread and deeply felt community campaign across this country, and opinion polls show clearly that Australia is ready for change. I am confident that it will not be long before marriage equality is achieved, because love builds bridges where there are none. Love thaws hearts and warms minds. Love is a powerful force for good and a force for change. I believe that it is love that has brought us to this place in this debate and it is love that will carry us over the threshold of discrimination and fear to full marriage equality. It is important to know that the push for equal love is not just important for those who want to get married. It sends a powerful message to the boy in the country town struggling with his sexuality or the girl at high school who wants to take her partner to the school formal. It makes it clear to them, to their parents and to everyone around them that this parliament, the highest law-making body in the country, believes that their love is equal. I note that another member also intends to introduce a bill into the House today on this matter. I have been asked a number of times about why there is not just one bill on the issue. I want to be absolutely clear that I and the Greens would like to see one single bill proceed through this place on this issue cosponsored by members across the political spectrum. In fact, when I announced last year that I intended to introduce this bill, I sought co-sponsorship. And so Mr Wilkie, the Independent member for Denison, and I are co-sponsoring this bill. The recent addition of people to this debate who have not been following it for some time is welcome because the way that we are going to get this bill through this parliament is by changing people's minds. What we cannot do is seek to have any one party own this issue because, with the government and Labor divided on the issue, we will need members of goodwill from the coalition benches to get this through. That is why, if we are to have a successful chance at reform this year, we must proceed softly and carefully and aim to work together with members from all sides of the House, from all backgrounds. The worse thing we could do is bowl this up for a vote to make a political point only to have it defeated. I am hopeful that through that cooperation, through co-sponsorship from members from all across the chamber, we will progress the issue and we will see reform this year. I am also concerned that, if we bowl it up for a vote prematurely, we may end up with the situation which some media reports have suggested, and that is a vote that fails and then a renewed push for civil unions. Let us be absolutely clear about the status of civil unions. They would entrench two tiers of citizenship in this country. We need to push for full equality. I know there are many in the coalition who believe that an individual should have the right to do what they like in their private life so long as it does not impinge on someone else. That classic definition of liberalism should lead members of the coalition to support this bill, and I know there are many who already in their hearts wish to support it. We need to allow the Senate inquiry to continue and we need to allay some of the fears that exist about this issue. By doing that, it is my hope that over the coming months we will get more and more people on board. Last week members of the Washington state legislature, Republicans and Democrats, did exactly what we need to do in this House. They worked together to overcome partisanship and party allegiance to pass a law for marriage equality. If they can do it, we can do it too. It is not just there: many countries around the world have taken this step. If Catholic Spain can allow two people of the same sex to marry each other then I am confident that modern, tolerant, democratic Australia can do the same. There have been times throughout history when the civil rights of a group of people have been violated, often with legal sanction. Many of those struggles continue. The struggle to end discrimination and for full equality did not begin with marriage equality and it will not end when it is achieved, but it is an important turning point for that struggle. Last year I referred in this place to the famous aphorism 'Love conquers all,' and I think we are showing the truth of that statement today. Love has brought us here and love will bring us through this impasse, because I believe the power of love will eventually bring this parliament into the 21st century, when we vote to make this bill law. I commend the bill to the House. Bill read a first time.",60
22,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," In accordance with standing order 41(c), the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Marriage Amendment Bill 2012 First Reading Bill presented by Mr SP Jones. Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (11:01): Today I introduce a bill for an act to amend the Marriage Act 1961 to establish marriage equality for same-sex couples, and for related purposes. If enacted, this bill will permit a minister of religion, a person authorised under a state or territory law or a marriage celebrant authorised under the Marriage Act 1961 to perform a marriage between same-sex couples and will permit that marriage to be recognised in Australian law. But it will not require a minister of religion to solemnise a marriage where that is inconsistent with their religious beliefs. I believe that God made us all equal but different-not differently equal. The object of the bill is to remove discrimination and advance equality. It will ensure that when same-sex couples make a voluntary commitment to be together for life, to the exclusion of all others, and they choose to have that relationship solemnised, it will be recognised at law in the same way that my marriage is. While marriage is an old institution, it is not immutable. For example, it is now a voluntary union but it was not always so. Young women were betrothed against their will or with little say. Our concepts of marriage have changed in accordance with societal norms and they will continue to do so. This is reflected in the fact that the Commonwealth laws with regard to marriage have been amended by every single government since their inception, and there are many past aspects of marriage that we now look at with amusement, if not horror, including betrothal, dowry, a wife's vow of obedience, the prohibition on certain interrace or religious marriages and the whole concept of conjugal rights. In recognition that societal norms change, the Australian Labor Party changed its national platform on 3 December 2011 so that it now reads: Labor will amend the Marriage Act to ensure equal access to marriage under statute for all adult couples irrespective of sex who have a mutual commitment to a shared life. The platform was also amended to include the following: These amendments should ensure that nothing in the Marriage Act imposes an obligation on a minister of religion to solemnise any marriage. These amendments to our national platform were the result of many years of campaigning and work by activists from all sides of politics. Within the Labor Party, today I recognise the efforts of the many hundreds of members of Rainbow Labor. We are not acting alone. This bill follows an international trend to end discrimination when it comes to marriage. Around the world there are now around 10 countries and even more places that allow same-sex marriages, including the Netherlands, Belgium, Canada, Spain, South Africa, Norway, Sweden, Portugal, Iceland, Argentina and Mexico City. In the United States, nine states have changed their laws to permit the recognition of same-sex marriage, including Massachusetts, California, Connecticut, Vermont, Washington DC, New Hampshire, Washington state and New York state. Here, as in the rest of the world, the introduction of this legislation follows decades of community debate and changes in public opinion. Opinion polls in Australia show that a majority of Australians are in favour of the changes contained within this bill. Popular opinion is of course critical to this change. But I believe there is a stronger force which guides us in matters like this. It is the right to equality-the human right not to be discriminated against on the grounds of sexuality. Human rights are inalienable rights, recognised and protected by governments, not created by them. They should never be qualified by fear or prejudice. The Australian Labor Party and this parliament have a proud history of enacting legislation to eliminate discrimination. In 1975 we established the Discrimination Act, in 1984 the Sex Discrimination Act and in 1992 the Disability Discrimination Act. And, in its first term of office, the ALP amended 85 separate pieces of legislation to remove remnants of discrimination against same-sex couples. To the great credit of all members in this place, these changes were supported by the coalition parties as well. The bill before the House today continues this project. It will end discrimination against same-sex couples who wish to have their relationship recognised by the state. In practical terms it will give same-sex couples the same rights and obligations in their marriage as I have in mine. But it also sends a powerful message that our belief in equality and a fair go is not limited by a person's sexuality. Item 1 of schedule 1 of this bill will amend the definition of marriage that is currently in section 5 of the Marriage Act 1961 to read: marriage means the union of two people, regardless of their sex, to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life. The bill also amends subsection 46(1) of the Marriage Act to reflect this new definition of marriage. Religion plays an important part in Australian life. We respect and celebrate our freedom of religion. This extends to the rights of churches to participate fully in public debate, including debate around this particular matter. In some countries churches do not have that right. Theocracies and dictatorships around the world have sought to suppress those voices of dissent, those voices which speak out in opposition to their particular creed. In Australia, the separation of church and state extends to the law of marriage. Yes, it is an institution of religious import, but it is also a civil institution. Our Racial marriage laws are governed by civil law but recognise and respect the role of religious bodies to practice their faith in accordance with that faith. For this reason the bill inserts a new subsection into section 47 of the act to reinforce the existing provisions that ensure that a minister of religion is under no obligation to solemnise a marriage where the parties to that marriage are of the same sex. This provision will ensure that the principles of religion and religious freedom are maintained when it comes to the laws of marriage in Australia. God made us all equal, but different-not differently equal. That is why I believe it is our duty as legislators to make this change and to do it with the support of all sides of this House and in the best traditions of this parliament. I commend the bill to the House. Bill read a first time.",62
23,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," In accordance with standing order 41(c), the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Treaties Ratification Bill 2012 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Katter.",64
24,Mr KATTER,BILLS," I present the Treaties Ratification Bill 2012 to the House and in doing so I will proceed to recommend it to the House. There are a number of agreements that have been signed internationally. With the World Trade Organisation agreement, all signatories to that convention agreed to remove the laws that stopped entry of product into a country, which was referred to as an embargo. We had an embargo on sugar in this country, as did Europe and America. We proceeded to remove-to 'tariffy'-all embargo laws. We moved to a $200 a tonne tariff protection to replace the embargo, and then it was decided, in the wisdom of the ALP and the Liberal-National Party government, to remove the subsidy, so it was subsequently phased out. The Australian sugar industry now competes against the American sugar industry. The last time. I looked we were on $300 a tonne, America was on $660 a tonne and the Europeans were on $1,200 a tonne, indicating that they treated international conventions with absolute contempt. President Bush and President Obama both said, almost word for word, that if a project contains one dollar of the American taxpayers' money then it will contain 100 per cent American steel. In the case of President Bush, with the aluminium agreement, he mentioned the words 'communities' and 'jobs' five times. Would that I heard someone in this House mention the word 'jobs' or the phrase 'survival of communities', except as a contemptible piece of hypocrisy. Here was a man breaching all of these conventions, flagrantly breaking them all because jobs, livelihoods and communities in America were at stake. His nemesis, the Democrats leader, President Obama, came in and said, with infinitely more aggression and determination than President Bush, exactly the same thing. Whether it is the aluminium agreement launched by the United States or a statement on steel made by the United States these people clearly regard conventions as something they would like to do, but in no way as binding. In sharp contrast, this place inflicts upon the Australian people agreements that we the people have had no say in whatsoever. To those who say, 'We can't go back and get ratification through a referendum,' that is why we have members of parliament. They are here to represent the will of the people. The will of the people does not get any opportunity to participate in or approve these agreements, yet they are legally enforceable and binding within our country. I pay tribute to the Electrical Trades Union, who are closely associated with our party, with four of our candidates in the forthcoming state elections are very active trade union members. They have certainly been backing us-Dean Mighell and Alan Jones were the two main speakers at our conference on the weekend. I thank them because what I am going to read out is very much coming from them. I also thank Rick Brown, who is a prominent adviser to a number of Liberal ministers in this place and who works very closely on these issues, which he feels very passionately about. I thank these people for some of the information and text that I am going to be reading out here. One reason that most Australians feel powerless and disenchanted with politics is that they think governments impose on them laws which affect their daily lives without consultation, let alone getting their prior approval. The way Australia enters into treaties is a good example of why a majority of Australians are entitled to feel the way they do. When it comes to having a say in the contents of a treaty, parliament is virtually presented with a fait accompli. It is true that there are disallowance provisions, but this process does not lead to genuine debate and occurs at the end of a process when there are only two choices: agree or disagree-no modification. There is also a committee on treaties, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, that not only gets involved when it is too late but is an example of shallow tokenism as the government of the day has a majority on the committee. To enable the representatives of the people to have a genuine say in the formulation and approval of treaties is important for two reasons. Treaties ought to be treated like laws because they have a legally binding effect. They have a direct impact on people, especially when it is a serious impact such as costing people their jobs and costing children job opportunities. Treaties ought to be determined by the parliament after proper debate. This process enables public awareness of what is being proposed and a thorough analysis of the consequences of what is being proposed. Certainly, on occasions there is the odd discussion or consultation involving vested interest groups, usually the ones that are involved with the treaty that will benefit by it-usually overseas corporations. Public awareness of the public engagement process simply does not happen. Under current processes, unelected public servants have much more involvement in the determination of an outcome than the will of the people as expressed in this place. That is all we are asking for: that the will of the people has the last say. Over the last few years Australia has signed free trade agreements with Singapore, Thailand and the USA. In each case governments have waxed lyrical about the benefits. Mark Vaile told us that the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement was worth billions of dollars and would create thousands of jobs. He said he would not sign the agreement unless the United States took our sugar, widened our beef and took out dairy products. He signed the agreement and, yes, there was a benefit for dairymen. The benefit was costed out as at one ice-cream a day. The cattle industry will not receive any benefit for eight years and there will be plenty of opportunity for that position to change. But we have always had a pretty good deal from the Americans on beef, so there is not much to be gained there anyway. These were the only three things that the press mentioned. We have always had free trade arrangements with America, but the three areas in which we do not are these three areas. The benefit for the dairyman is an ice-cream a day, the benefit for beef men will come down in eight years time and, as for the sugar industry, going by Japan, there ain't going to be anything happening therewe will continue with our embargo. What is the agreement about? As a result of this free trade agreement, apples will be coming in from America and sugar will still be banned from going into America. So we take the apples but they do not take the sugar. We can thank Mark Vaile and the National Party for that brilliant outcome. Again and again, all of the books on MCEwen say he was a tough trader. If you went in there you could rest assured that Australia would come out on top, whether it was the agreement with the British people on wheat and later on beef and whether it was the beef agreement with Japan or access for our coal into Japan. In every single case they were up against a tough man. As for Mark Vaile, 'Mark unavailable for comment' was what the press used to say. He is a nice person and I would never denigrate him personally, but the outcomes he achieved for Australia were absolutely disastrous. Let me be very specific in the last few minutes that I have available to me. Glivec was a wonder drug that you can only get for $55,000 a year. I had a person who said, 'I am going to die because I cannot afford to pay that.' The Pharmacy Board of Australia put up a terrific fight and were moderately successful. Their power to influence outcomes now has been removed completely, and our power with respect to things like bananas has been removed completely by an agreement which is very much against the public interest of Australia, and the China agreement will be worse still.

26,Mr OAKESHOTT,BILLS," I present the Migration Amendment (The Bali Process) Bill 2012 in an attempt to find a sustainable and best possible policy outcome that is acceptable to both the major parties-the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal-National party in this chamber-and the crossbenches so that Australia has a sustainable and workable response to the recent High Court ruling. The current policy impasse is unsustainable, and it lacks long-term direction for Australia. This bill combines three considerations in an effort to reach a policy outcome. Firstly, there is the importance of the bipartisan Bali process and the regional cooperation framework. Some excellent work has been done in a bipartisan way that seems to have been forgotten, conveniently or otherwise, in the domestic debate. This is, I emphasise, bipartisan work on people smuggling, people trafficking and related transnational crime that began in 2002 and continues to engage over 50 countries, the International Office of Migration and the UNHCR. A mistake in the domestic debate today has been the lack of emphasis on this Bali process, and this private member's bill is an attempt to elevate the core principles, both border protection and humanitarian, that form the backbone of this regional agreement. Secondly, in forming this private member's bill, consideration is also given to the government's Migration Legislation Amendment (Offshore Processing and Other Measures) Bill 2011, which was a response to the High Court decision of August 2011 in relation to declarations made under section 198A of the Migration Act and which has so far failed to pass the parliament. Thirdly, the final consideration in forming this bill is the amendments from the Liberal-National Party to the 2011 migration legislation amendment bill, including issues around engagement of the UNHCR in the negotiations which seem to have started, and then failed, over the Legislation summer recess. I am very open to discussion of any of the issues raised. I am very open to any amendments where they would assist in achieving a response to the High Court decision and in allowing policy in Australia to consider a multi-locational strategy which includes both onshore and offshore considerations. It has been disappointing that in the domestic debate to date everything has been presented as either/or-either onshore or offshore, either Malaysia or Nauruimplying that the alternatives are either Labor or Liberal. There are other ways through. I would hope that the parliament looks for those through the conflict resolution that I am trying to present in this bill. I am open to negotiate on any of it. I would love the government or the opposition to pick it up as their bill as part of the negotiation-otherwise, I think we are failing as a parliament to seek best policy. I do not think that is what anyone in this place wants. Bill read a first time.",67
27,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," In accordance with standing order 41(c), the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Fair Work Amendment (Better Work/Life Balance) Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Bandt.",67
28,Mr BANDT,BILLS," It is with great pleasure that I introduce this bill. I income. strongly suspect that the reason that we hear the term 'work/life balance' so much these days is because we have less balance between these two important dimensions of our existence than we should. The figures show that the average full-time working week in Australia is 44 hours-the longest in the developed Western world. Research shows that these sorts of working hours are impacting on our well-being, with poorer health and greater use of prescription medications. It is also affecting our personal and family lives. Sixty per cent of women say that they feel consistently time pressured and nearly half of men also feel this way. Almost half of all fathers in couple households work more than they would prefer, and one-third of women working full time would also prefer to work less, even taking into account the impact that this might have on their income. On average, full-time employees would like to work about 5.6 hours less per week, while part-time workers would like to work around four hours less than they are currently working. In addition, we perform $72 billion of unpaid overtime each year as a country. It cuts the other way too. There are many people-though according to the studies a lesser number-who would like to work more hours than they are currently working but are unable to. A 2010 study on the health and working conditions of approximately 78,000 working Australians concluded: … it may be counterproductive for employers to expect long working hours as employees are likely to take more time off and work less efficiently. The study also commented that there is considerable evidence of an association between work demands and poor health. We have a situation where just over half of all Australians want to change their hours of work, even if this might impact on their There is no doubt that many good employers already recognise the benefits of providing flexible working arrangements. However, this recognition is not as widespread as it could, or should, be. The Greens want people to have more control over their time and their working arrangements. We need a better match between the hours people want to work and the hours that they actually work. I am pleased that the government has indicated that it wants to examine the desirability of extending flexible work entitlements. I note that the ACTU, prominent academics, Carers Victoria, government advisory bodies and many others have also advocated extending the right to request flexible working arrangements. The current legislated mechanism to request flexible working arrangements is only available to employees who have caring responsibilities for children under school age, or children under 18 with a disability. Employers can refuse on reasonable business grounds, but there are no mechanisms for appeal. The mechanism is well-intentioned but it is narrow and unenforceable. It can be strengthened. It should be strengthened. With the support of parliament for the passage of this bill, it will be strengthened. The better work/life balance bill will extend the right to request flexible working arrangements to all employees unless there are reasonable business grounds for refusal. In addition, the right to request would be strengthened for those with caring responsibilities, with employers only able to say no where there are serious countervailing business reasons. In all instances, ongoing employees must have performed a minimum of 12 months service before the request can be made. If an employee's request for flexible working arrangements is refused, Fair Work Australia would be empowered to hear an appeal and, where appropriate, make flexible working arrangement orders. The bill also reflects my belief that, wherever possible, enterprise bargaining and enterprise agreements should be the best mechanism for providing better industrial outcomes. 'Flexible working arrangements' is inserted into the list of permitted matters that can be included in an agreement and I hope this will occur wherever a new agreement is being negotiated. Where an agreement does include such matters, they will take precedence. This is important because there may be some areas where, for example, it is not appropriate to have someone working for a very short period of hours. We do not want to end up with a situation where, for example, we have professional firefighters working two or three hours a week as that has the potential to undermine the important level of skills and training that are required to perform so many of these jobs. In such instances, one would expect to find in an enterprise agreement the appropriate way of dealing with questions of flexible working arrangements. In relation to modern awards, a term will have no effect where it is less favourable than those determined by Fair Work Australia in a flexible working arrangements order. In addition, state and territory laws will be overridden if they are inconsistent or less beneficial than those provided bill. All of that is subject to there being a provision in the enterprise agreement. Allowing workers to have more control over their time will be a productivity bonus for the economy. Business will benefit from this reform, including employers who are already promoting flexible working arrangements so that employees can achieve a better work-life balance. Satisfied employees are likely to remain in a workplace longer, be healthier and be more productive. If people want to work different hours or work from home so that their life is better, then the law should allow it and society should encourage it, provided it does not unduly impact on their employer. The bill recognises that carers play a special role in our society. Caring for those close to us must be a central concern for our society, and is important to the economy. People need greater control over their time, not just to look after kids but also, increasingly, to look after parents and grandkids, as well as foster children, people with disabilities, people with extended illnesses-the list goes on and on. For this reason, the bill defines carer simply as 'an employee who has responsibility for the care of another person'. In addition, as I have referred to, the bill raises the threshold test to 'serious countervailing business reasons' before employers can refuse a request for flexible working arrangements. There are more women working more hours in paid employment but there is still the unpaid caring to do. With caring still done predominantly by women, there is a growing double burden on women and their families. If we are serious about supporting women returning to work after having had kids, we can and should do many things, not only expanding accessibility, quality and affordability of child care but also giving a legally enforceable right to flexible working for in this arrangements. As I have referred to, the provisions do not remove the capacity for managerial decisions to be made regarding working hours and working arrangements. If there are legitimate business reasons against a request, it can be declined. The bill is not radical or unprecedented. A number of countries have various types of legislative mechanisms for people to request flexible working arrangements, and a serious countervailing business reasons test has been used in the Netherlands since 2000. A review of flexible working arrangement laws in Germany, the Netherlands and the UK showed that a number of valuable lessons had been learned and a number of myths dispersed regarding the laws. There was a reasonable but manageable level of requests. The Netherlands had the highest level of requests, with 14 per cent of employees, while the UK had only 3½ per cent and Germany recorded less than one per cent. But, significantly, the majority of requests in each country were acceptable to employers. Costs were not a major problem with implementation and sometimes even resulted in savings. In addition, very few requests ended up in dispute. In the Netherlands and Germany, fewer than 30 requests per country resulted in court action in the first two years of the law. The overseas experience suggests that being obliged to provide flexible work for employees may in fact help companies by ensuring that they examine alternative models that they may not have considered previously. An expanded right to request flexible working arrangements, as I have said, does not override management prerogative. It simply ensures full and proper consideration is given and provides an enforceable right and oversight from Fair Work Australia. If this bill is passed, it will also will undermine those very important industries and sectors, like firefighters-and there may be many others as well-where control over the working time is necessary to ensure that there is not industrial disputation between differing people working differing hours side by side in environments where harmony and consistency and equality of payments and arrangements are necessary. A legislative approach will help drive positive cultural change in relation to flexible working arrangements by providing a clear framework and criteria for requests and, importantly, it will begin to remove the stigma of fathers and mothers-anyone who has to care for another person, anyone who wants to have more control over their liferequesting that change. I commend the bill to the House. Bill read a first time.",68
29,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," In accordance with standing order 41(c), the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Same-Sex Relationships",70
30,Mr WILKIE,BILLS," I move: That this House agrees that should the Marriage Act 1961 be amended to allow for the marriage of same-sex couples, any such amendment should ensure that the Act imposes no obligation on any church or religious minister to perform such a marriage. My support for marriage equality is well known. However, for me this issue is not simply to do with same-sex marriage. It is about equality that everyone, regardless of their gender, race, sexual preference or faith, should be treated the same under Australian law: in other words, that all people are equal and should be treated as such. It is no wonder then I believe that the current not provision of the Marriage Act, that marriage can only be between a man and a woman, is in fact legislated discrimination. While at all times I have tried to be very clear in my position, hopefully I have also been just as careful to respect the strong views of the many people who disagree with me, because it is a fact that time and time again I have spoken to people I have disagreed with and time and time again people have disagreed with me. That is fair enough, because marriage equality is indeed a polarising issue, for all sorts of reasons. This motion is not about telling people who are against same-sex marriage that they are wrong. Rather, it is about acknowledging that people have many and varied views on this topic and that the Australian parliament should respect those views. To that end, this parliament should formally recognise again that in Australia the churches are private institutions and that consequently they and their officials must forever retain their right to refuse to marry anyone whom they do not wish to marry. There is nothing remarkable about this proposition, if only because throughout history churches have had differing views on whom they allow to marry. For instance, some churches would not allow a Catholic to marry a Protestant. Others would not allow divorcees to marry again. Some would even refuse a ceremony to those of different creeds or nationalities. While some such refusals would seem out of place in our modern society, the right was protected and churches were not forced to adhere to one rule of eligibility. In other words, their status as a private institution was protected-and rightly so. It is my firm belief that as a parliament it is not our place to impinge upon free religious practices and beliefs. But as a parliament it is our responsibility to make laws in the best interests of our country and, in the second decade of the 21st century, it is simply not acceptable that as a parliament we are prepared to restrict marriage rights from a section of the population based only on their sexual preference. When the parliament does tackle this great reform, I do not wish it to be hindered by an argument that we might be seeking to force churches to solemnise marriages they do not agree with. Therefore I am pleased to present this motion to the House. It is my hope that it articulates widespread public sentiment and will help progress the move to marriage equality, a move which is supported by over 60 per cent of the community, according to today's Galaxy poll. Some people might be concerned that this motion deals with a hypothetical. In response I say that marriage equality is patently inevitable, as it should be, so the public interest is best served by us in this place ensuring that the legislation enacting such reform is carefully crafted to respect the rights and sensitivities of those who oppose it. This motion is simply to that end and I suggest it would be counterproductive for those who oppose marriage equality to oppose this motion. To the Leader of the Opposition in particular, I say: please respect your party's rule giving all parliamentary members the right to follow their conscience every time they vote in this place. Even if the opposition opposes this motion, there is no reason whatsoever why any number of its members cannot still follow their conscience and support it. This should also be the case when Liberal Party members eventually pass judgment on the bills coming before parliament this week which seek to amend the Marriage Act to allow same-sex marriage. I commend this motion to the House and strongly urge all of my parliamentary colleagues to lend it their support.",70
31,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Is there a seconder for this motion?,71
32,Mr Bandt,BILLS,I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,71
33,Mr HAASE,BILLS," This private member's motion relating to the Marriage Act is interesting, to say the least, because it is not just a hypothetical, as the mover has suggested, but also a contradiction. It asks us as a parliament to consider, in changed legislation, a guarantee that such and such an act will not be enforced. We have legislation which describes the contract of marriage-it is between a man and a woman, entered into voluntarily, to the exclusion of all others, for life. By definition, that does not include the marriage of same-sex couples. But we are being told that we need to move into the 21st century and get out there with other nations around the world which have changed their legislation. We have legislation. If our legislation is not sacrosanct-to be changed only if necessary for the betterment of good governmentthen what is the qualification of legislation? Why should we take any notice of any legislation if we can, at the whim of a minority group, seek to change it? There seems to me to be something dreadfully illogical about referring to the sanctity of legislation and then, at the drop of a hat, wanting to change it. It just does not make sense. We are all embracing modernity today and GetUp! is considered to be one of the great modern institutions we should all be aware of the significance of. Yet they rate the importance of same-sex marriage and equality in marriage as 11th out of 12 issues. About 14 per cent of the population strongly support changing the Marriage Act while 18 per cent strongly oppose changing the Marriage Act. But what about that vast silent majority for whom this is not even on the radar? Why on earth must we rush headlong to change things simply for the sake of change? I find it dreadfully offensive that we are, as though we were all Independents, supposed to rush around plumbing the depths of public opinion to find another point of minority interest so that we can drag that minority group under our clutches. It does not make sense for good, honest, upright members of this chamber to be dragged into such a debate simply because the government of the day wishes to embrace these minorities in order to maintain their support in votes in this House. It is not only a contradiction; it is an affront to good government. We do not need to rush around willy-nilly, heading in different directions and plucking at things to support, when there are so many shameful goings-on being driven by this government as policy today. I deplore this whole process of embracing and accepting these motions in this place today-and they are numerous. We have the one from the member for Melbourne, another one from the member for Denison and a contribution from the member for Throsby. I do not quite know-maybe he is just formally condoning this relationship between minority groups and the government of the day. Maybe they wish to add this contradiction to their long list of failures. There seems little sense to this other than change for the sake of change-change perhaps to take the scrutiny, the public heat, away from the government's failed policy and their untruths. Maybe that is the basis of the government having all these bills brought to the House by Independents. I do not believe that the population of this country want further nonsense from this government-they want a change of government. This would probably be one of the least important issues ever brought this House for the majority-and don't we aspire to govern for the majority? Don't we want good governance that will lead this nation forward to a brighter future, setting good, solid role models for the future of our children? This ought to be an honourable place and a place of permanence. It ought to have good legislation brought before it for good reasons. There is no good reason for the introduction of any of these bills and they ought to be voted down.",71
34,Dr LEIGH,BILLS," This is the third time. I have spoken publicly on samesex marriage. In August 2011, I reported back to parliament on the views of my constituents for and against same-sex marriage. Within Labor Party forums I have also spoken out in favour of changing our party platform. But this is the first time. I have spoken in parliament since the Labor Party changed its national platform. That platform now reads: Labor will amend the Marriage Act to ensure equal access to marriage under statute for all couples irrespective of sex who have a mutual commitment to a shared life. The Labor Party platform also states that on this issue 'any decision reached is not binding on any member of the Party'. I hope that over the coming months many members on both sides of this place will support a change to the Marriage Act to allow same-sex marriage. Same-sex marriage is not about gay versus straight, conservative versus progressive, left versus right. It is about social justice, equality for individuals and the recognition and protection of fundamental political and civil rights. Throughout this great country, people watch Ellen DeGeneres and Erik van der Woodsen, Matt Lucas and John Barrowman, Jodie Foster and Stephen Fry; we listen to Elton John and KD Lang. Equality for same-sex couples is not unfamiliar to everyday Australians. Ce Ce of Hawker told me: I have just heard you ""come out"" in support of marriage equality and I wanted to express my gratitude. My partner and I registered a civil partnership earlier this year-our society needs more civilisation-I still wait for the day that we might be married. There is something lacking in referring to my civil partner rather than to my wife. Please do not underestimate how much it means. Warren and Grant of Aranda have been together for 27 years and believe marriage would be the ultimate legitimation of the equality of their relationship. As they told me: Our marriage would not undermine heterosexual marriage-quite the opposite-our desire to be married reflects our deep respect for the institution of marriage. Many of the opponents of same-sex marriage are devoutly religious. I respect their faith, but I say to them that it is possible to support marriage equality without undermining adult marriage, family or religion. Today, two-thirds of marriages in Australia are conducted by civil celebrants-a figure that is steadily rising. Same-sex marriage is supported by many religious leaders, including Lin Hatfield-Dodds, Reverend Bill Crews, Reverend Rowland Croucher, Reverend Matt Glover, Reverend Roger Munson and Father Dave Smith. I say to my colleagues on the other side of the parliament that there is nothing in samesex marriage that should offend Liberals and conservatives. Libertarians are among the most prominent advocates of same-sex marriage and, as British Prime Minister David Cameron has said: Conservatives believe in the ties that bind us; that society is stronger when we make vows to each other and support each other. So I do not support gay marriage despite being a Conservative. I support gay marriage because I'm a Conservative. In 1967, my parents were married in New York. They celebrated their 45th wedding anniversary last Saturday. But if they had been of different races, there are 16 US states that would not have allowed them to get married in February 1967. It was not until June 1967 that the Supreme Court case of Loving v Virginia outlawed bans on miscegenation. These bans were thought natural-and some argued that they were supported by scripture. That matters today because, in the words of Mildred Loving in 2007: … not a day goes by that I don't think of Richard and our love, our right to marry, and how meant to me to have that freedom to marry the person precious to me, even if others thought he was the ""wrong kind of person"" for me to marry. believe all Americans, no matter their race, no matter their sex, no matter their sexual orientation, should have that same freedom to marry. In closing, let me quote the words of former Washington state representative Betty Sue Morris. Washington is shortly to become the seventh US state to permit gay marriage. Ms Morris spoke of a vote she cast against samesex marriage in 1996. She said that in December 1998 her daughter, Annie, had come home for Christmas and told her she was gay. In the days that followed Ms Morris said she remembered her vote and 'felt like she had denied her something. A wholeness. A freedom.' Former representative Morris told Frank Bruni of the New York Times: Whenever someone opposes this, I always counsel: you never know. You never know when it will be your child or your grandchild. And will eat your words. I hope members of the House will support legislation to put in place same-sex marriage.",73
35,Mr HAWKE,BILLS," I rise to oppose this motion about amendments to the Marriage Act. A series of irrational and highly emotional arguments have been put forward on what is loosely termed same-sex marriage. I think that is a misnomer. Marriage is defined, in Australian law, as being between a man and a woman. That was set out in 2004 to clarify a situation that had been in existence in Australian law since 1961. This was done with the full support of the Labor Party, and this understanding has always existed in human history. Today we have had this clash of Dead Poets Society with Pulp Fiction from the member for Melbourne, the member for Canberra and other members. They have tried to pretend there is unanimity of view much it that same-sex marriage is universal, supported and inevitable. It used to be death and taxes but now it is inevitable that there I will be death, taxes and gay marriage. I do not think it is inevitable in our society. It has never been the case; it is a new and radical proposition. Instead of recognising that it is a new and radical proposition and coming to this place with an approach that is reasonable and measured and that brings the population along with it, the Greens and various Labor members, who are now free to express their views, are proposing something that is highly divisive and ignorant of the majority view around the world today. We have heard that a procession of countries have enacted legislation in relation to gay marriage. In my research, I can only find 10 out of 200 countries that have enacted such legislation. We have heard about states in the United States, but let us be clear about this: in 30 out of 50 United States you states where a referendum on this question has been held, the people said no. They said no in every single one of those 30 referendums where the question was put to the people. And that is the case in the more progressive California, which has been cited today in this place. The legislature there initially passed the laws granting same-sex marriage but then overturned them. In recent months, the French parliament rejected legislation for same-sex marriage. Indeed, in 2010 the European Court of Human Rights ruled that its member states were not obliged to recognise same-sex marriage on human rights grounds. It is a misnomer to suggest that there is a human rights issue. There is an issue here in this motion before the House. As a liberal, I believe in the freedom of individuals in society. Individuals are the building blocks of society. We are fundamentally built as a group of families-individuals structure themselves into families. I believe that people have the right to associate with whomever they want. I believe civil unions should be recognised at law. I am perfectly willing to consider legislation in relation civil unions; perfectly willing to consider removing any remaining discrimination. However, I am advised that in federal law there are no such examples, or very limited examples, of any discrimination against same-sex relationships or same-sex couples. What are we talking about here? We are talking about a radical proposal to undermine a fundamental social institution that the basis of our society for thousands of years, an institution between a man and a woman for the reproduction of children which has formed the basic unit of our society. Why can't we recognise civil unions in our society today? Why can't we recognise that they should develop their own traditions and their own customs because they are a new institution? Why don't we retain the successful institution of marriage, which has been the bedrock of our society for so long and done so well for us? We should retain it, encourage it and promote it, as we always have, and of course allow at law the same situation to exist for same-sex couples, which is inevitably what we do at the moment. Many states now have relationship registers. These could be expanded and I would support that. It would be a step in the right direction. Of course we should clarify any situation where there is discrimination against people, but marriage has been a particular societal institution and convention that has produced so much good and will continue to produce so much good. This is an attack on the rights of all those who support marriage, and I believe they are a majority. I believe that a majority of Australians voted in the 2004, 2007 and 2010 elections for the position of both major political parties that there be no amendment to the Marriage Act. If the Labor Party is now proposing to change its position, of to course it must put it to the peoplesomething we know that it does not like to do. On this side of the House, the coalition have always had the right to exercise our conscience. We should exercise our conscience, and conscience tells us that the majority of Australians today do not support amending the Marriage Act and do support removing any remaining discrimination has been against same-sex couples.

Question agreed to. NA Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2011-2012 Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2011-2012 Report from Committee",76
39,Ms OWENS,BILLS," On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics, I seek leave to make a statement on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2011-2012 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2011-12 in discharge of the committee's requirement to provide an advisory report on the bills and to present a copy of my statement. Leave granted.",76
40,Ms OWENS,BILLS,"The committee has endorsed the comments of this statement. On 8 February 2012, the Selection Committee referred Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20112012 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2011-12 to the committee. The appropriation bills, together with other government documents, are subject to wide scrutiny by Senate committees as part of their estimates On 9 February 2012, the Senate referred Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) to Senate committees for examination and report as part of additional estimates. Eight committees of the Senate will conduct wide-ranging scrutiny of executive government over the next four days. It was the view of the committee that it would unnecessarily duplicate the work of these Senate committees and possibly create confusion amongst witnesses if it attempted to undertake its own, concurrent examination. The committee, therefore, has agreed not to inquire into the bills and recommends that the House consider the bills under normal processes.",76
41,Mr CIOBO,BILLS," by leave-The coalition members agreed to the discharge of this inquiry by the Standing Committee on Economics, but it is worth putting on the record some of the background as to why the initial referral of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2011-2012 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2011-12 to the committee took place. The referral was done as a safeguard because we have unfortunately seen from this government's past form an increase in the debt ceiling that was pushed through as part of the appropriation bill. With Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4), the coalition was very aware of its responsibility to the Australian people to ensure that once again the government was not attempting to increase the debt ceiling through the use of these two pieces of legislation. That is the reason the referral took place. We on this side of the chamber will remain vigilant and steadfast in our opposition to the continued reckless spending of this government and to the lack of good control when it comes to debt and deficit. For that reason we will continue, where appropriate, to refer bills-even if they happen to duplicate some of the work the Senate is doing-if it means putting in place a safeguard to protect Australia's future and the Australian people from the reckless spending of the Labor government.

42,Mr JENKINS,COMMITTEES," In accordance with standing order 206, on behalf of the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests, I present Report concerning the registration and declaration of members' interests during 2011. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper. NA Access to Justice (Federal Jurisdiction) Amendment Bill 2011 Report from Committee  leave-On Thursday, 24 November 2011 the Selection Committee referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs for inquiry and report the Access to Justice (Federal Jurisdiction) Amendment Bill 2011. The bill amends the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976, the Family Law Act 1975, the Federal Magistrates Act 1999, and the Judiciary Act 1903. It also makes consequential amendments to the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002. The bill contains provisions to: enhance the Federal Court's powers concerning discovery; in all four federal courts, clarify the circumstances in which suppression and non-publications orders can be made, what information they can cover and what details they should contain; in all four federal courts, clarify the circumstances in which vexatious proceedings orders can be made and the kinds of orders that can be made; align the jurisdictional limit for matters heard by family law magistrates in Western Australia with that of the Federal Magistrates Court in other states and territories; and give the Administrative Appeals Tribunal more flexibility when dealing with the payment of fees. The committee met on Thursday, 9 February to discuss the referral. The committee noted that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee is currently conducting a public inquiry into this bill and is receiving submissions. The Senate committee is due to report on 22 March 2012. The committee notes that seven submissions have already been received by the Senate committee. The committee supports the public consultation process that is being undertaken by the Senate. The committee does not consider that it could add significantly to the work already being undertaken and notes that duplication is likely from a further inquiry. In light the committee has agreed not to further inquire into this bill. Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011 Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2011 Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge-Fringe Benefits) Bill 2011 Second Reading Cognate debate. Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",77
43,Mr GEORGANAS,BILLS," The Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill and cognate bills before us today in essence seek to introduce means testing to one element of our welfare system, the private insurance rebate. This change was put to the last parliament by the previous government. It was passed by this House but defeated by the coalition and some of the crossbenchers in the Senate. The Labor government believes in this reform and we intend to prevail with this reform. So here we are again debating the merits of this legislation once again, as we did in the last parliament. At the heart of the debate is a contest over one very basic idea: that taxpayer funded welfare should be means tested, that welfare should be for those who need it the most rather than everyone who wants it. If we were to agree in this and the other place on this point, the rest would be relatively straightforward. In fact, I think it would be easy. But, unfortunately, we are not in agreement. The schism within this and the of this, other place, the Senate, given the incompatibility of values and principles continues. Today's debate is showing that. It is pretty ironic that it is those referred to as conservatives that want more welfare doled out to the wealthiest members of the public, irrespective of whether they need it or not. And we know that those of us on this side of the House, sometimes referred to by members opposite as 'socialists' or as espousing socialist policies, are the ones always looking to reduce any waste and unnecessary drains on the public purse through exorbitant welfare outlays. So Labor is the party that believes in giving assistance to people in proportion to their need, and that has always been the case. But this should not be a surprise, of course, given the tradition established by Labor prime ministers Hawke and Keating in the 1980s and 1990s. We Labor members on this side of the House are extremely proud of our record in meanstesting welfare and in the efficiencies and level of care we have been able to sustain over the years through using public funds for the maximum public benefit as they are required, not as they are wanted. So those of us in this House note this Labor government's position: giving welfare to those who need it, not everyone who might want it. A couple months ago, a person sat down-an accountant who himself is married with a couple of teenage kids-and he spoke of means-testing of the family tax benefit and how families over $150,000 cannot access the benefit. As an accountant, he spoke of a client of his in a doubleincome family who had a child, and the mother stopped paid work for a period. That family, he said, was reduced to living off the income of only the husband, a doctor of some description who only earned $160,000 per year. This is what I was told of that scenario: 'They've only got $160,000 a year to live on. And they can't even get welfare. That's not fair.' That is what he said. It is virtually a direct quote. I know that it is tough and that some people do have huge mortgages. But the members of this singleincome family earning something like three times the average wage say they need welfare to get by or to raise their child in a manner they think appropriate. I do not know what the people consider appropriate or what they consider to be the basics which they cannot do without. But it seems that they think the basics cost over $160,000 per year. I find this highly disagreeable. I think most of us would find it highly disagreeable. We know that, when we had pensioners in my electorate, for example, scraping by on a lot less than what they get now, the government of the day decided to give hefty welfare handouts to people earning 10, 20 or 30 times what pensioners were expected to live on. The private health insurance rebate subsidises the lifestyles of people earning $200,000, $300,000 or $400,000 a year while pensioners, such as people on disability pensions or carers pensions, battle to make ends meet every single day of their life. To me this simply is not fair. This is not the way that I think business should be done and this is not why I came into this House. The government says that some families and some people, like those earning three, four or five times the average wage, are not in need of assistance, unlike those earning much, much less than that, those families who are earning average wages or a little more, are paying off high mortgages or high rents and are paying money to educate their children et cetera. In the context of the bills before us, the government is saying that single people earning up to $83,000 will continue to receive the support they have and that couples earning up to $166,000 will continue to receive what they have been receiving. But those who are earning more should expect less in handouts. Those who are comparatively better off should be in less need of welfare. Within this package, singles earning up to $83,000 and families earning up to $166,000 will see no change. Those earning a bit over these amounts are not having their handout taken away, just means-tested. They would still get rebates of 20 per cent for those 65 years, 25 per cent for those aged 65 to 69 and 30 per cent for those aged 70 and over. The Medicare levy surcharge for people in this tier who do not hold appropriate private health insurance will remain as it is, unchanged. Those who are even better offfor example, singles earning more than $96,000 a year and couples or families earning more than $192,000-naturally need less assistance than those on much lower incomes. Accordingly, they will receive rebates of 10 per cent for those up to 65 years, 15 per cent for those aged 65 to 69, and 20 per cent for those aged 70 and over. The surcharge for people in this tier will be increased by one quarter of one per cent. Singles earning more than $124,000 a year and couples or families earning more than $248,000 a year will not receive assistance. Within the context of the state that I come from, South Australia, and using the last ABS figures and statistics for 2006, we are looking at the top 3.6 per cent of wage earners who will not get any of this welfare. I note that that is 3.6 per cent in my home state of South Australia. I cannot imagine why anyone would think that the top 3½ per cent of earners need welfare to get by. I do not believe that a single person, one for instance earning something like $3½ thousand clear per fortnight, would need welfare to survive. I do not believe that a family with an income of some $7,000 per fortnight is so impoverished that they need welfare and a handout from taxpayers. A lot of those taxpayers are earning a hell of a lot less than they are. The idea that an ordinary member of our community-for instance, a single person earning an average wage of around $1,600 per fortnight-should be paying taxes to subsidise the lifestyle of someone earning double or triple what he or she earns is pretty wrong. It is wrong that people and families up to earning ordinary, average wages-doing it tough-or perhaps even earning a little bit more than the average wage, paying their mortgages, trying to get their kids through school and paying the bills, have been paying taxes for a long time to subsidise those households that are earning double, triple and quadruple what they earn. The arguments about the government needing to dole out more and more taxpayers' money to preserve the integrity of the private health insurance industry are a smokescreen for a system of highly regressive wealth redistribution, making lowto ordinary-income earners hand over their hard-earned wages to fund the lifestyles of people who are far better off than themselves. I do not see this as welfare, and neither do a lot of other people. This really should be stopped. There are better things for which taxpayers' funds could be used. Pensioners are calling out for more assistance. We see them struggling on a regular basis. I have one of the 'oldest' seats in the country, with the highest demographic of people over 65, and I see it every day, at street corner meetings and at forums. Pensioners are doing it tough and are calling out for more assistance. How can we justify giving out handouts to the top three per cent of earners in my state when at the same time we have people-pensioners especially, including people on disability pensions and their carers-who are doing it so tough? For example, Public Service and Defence superannuants are calling out for better indexation. Again, how can we give welfare to the top three per cent of earners when we have people who do not get that indexation and are feeling the pinch, such as those superannuants of Defence and the Public Service? As I said, the disabled clearly need more help. In our electorates all of us come across parents who have children with disabilities, and we know how tough they are doing it. Certainly they need a lot more help. Sadly, the Liberal and National parties across from us disagree. But I think that it is much better that these people I have spoken about-people on pensions or disability, average income earners and maybe even those with a little bit higher than average incomes-receive the help they require, rather than that top 3.5 per cent of wage earners. As I said, those opposite disagree with that. They think that the top 3.5 per cent of earners should be subsidised by the rest of the people, who are earning far less than they are. I, for one, commend to the House the bills as well as the principles of fairness and prudential public administration on which they are based.",78
44,Ms MARINO,BILLS," The Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011 is about two things. The first is the fact that once again the government has betrayed the Australian people by categorically ruling out meanstesting of private health insurance rebates prior to an election but has then directly attacked these rebates once in government, doing exactly the opposite of what it promised. Breaching faith with the Australian people really has become part of the DNA of Labor, hasn't it? In fact, the primary deceiver in this parliament, the Prime Minister herself, said in 2006 of then health minister, Tony Abbott: … the minister for health today claimed that opposed to the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate. This is not true. Well, it is absolutely true, Prime Ministerand once again you have demonstrated why the Australian people no longer trust anything you say. Second, this bill is about the price hard working Australian families are being forced to pay for Labor's billions and billions of wasted taxpayers' funds and for Labor's addiction to debt and deficit. Yes, the government is targeting hard working Australians-the very people who help to keep communities and our economy strong, the people who take personal responsibility, the people we should be respecting, valuing and encouraging-something the coalition has been committed to while in government. It appears that the Labor government has declared war on individuals earning over $80,000 and couples earning over $160,000 a year by restricting their access to a range of government services. The contempt this government has for Australians who are working hard to achieve a degree of financial security is a national disgrace. This is the third time the Labor government has brought this legislation to the parliament. Firstly, in the last parliament, despite those explicit and repeated promises at the 2007 election that 'federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all the existing private health insurance rebates,' Nicola Roxon went on to say, 'The Liberals continue to try to scare people into thinking Labor will take away the rebates.' Clearly people had a right to be scared. Repeated betrayals have proven they could not then and cannot now trust a single word anyone in this government says. The Prime Minister to be, Kevin Rudd, made the same commitment in a letter to the Australian Health Insurance Association in 2007. How many more times do you have to I am say it? Far worse, however, have been the repeated attacks on aspirational Australian workers and working families that are simply part of a wider national Labor assault, highlighted by that 2011 budget. But the greatest risk carried in this legislation is to the health system itself. According to the government's Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, total expenditure on health goods and services in Australia in 2008-09 was estimated at $112.8 billion. Recurrent expenditure was $107.1 billion, or 94.9 per cent of total expenditure. This equated to nine per cent of Australia's GDP. Of that funding, $49 billion came from federal government funding and $30 billion from state government funding. The remaining $34 billion was privately funded and included $19 billion paid by consumers themselves in using services, $6 billion from other non-government sources and $9 billion from private health insurance funds. According to the Private Health Insurance Administration Council, as at 30 June 2011 private health funds are paying out $15 billion in health benefits to provide for the needs of the nearly 12 million Australians who carry private health insurance. That is over half of the Australian population. Of these, some 10 million have hospital cover, which accounts for about half of these costs. An Econtech report said that every dollar of funding provided for private health insurance rebates saves $2 of costs that are then paid by private health insurers. The question we should be asking today is: how many of those people who are investing in their own health by taking private health insurance will drop out or reduce their cover because of the changes proposed by the government? What cost this will add to the public hospital system and allied health services and how will this increase waiting times? In a regional area like my own, these are very relevant questions. It will also impact on all Australians with private health insurance. Those taking that responsibility will face higher premiums in the future. The Deloitte report released by the Australian Health Insurance Industry Association in May this year stated that 175,000 Australians would drop private health insurance within a year of means tests being applied. The fact that millions would withdraw or downgrade cover over the next five years would prove disastrous for the health system as a whole. Specifically, Deloitte found: Significant numbers of consumers will withdraw from their private hospital cover (1.6 million consumers over five years) or downgrade to lower levels of private health cover (4.3 million consumers over five years) following the proposed policy change; Significant numbers of consumers will also withdraw from their general treatment cover (2.8 million consumers over five years) or downgrade to lower levels of private health cover (5.7 million consumers over five years) following the proposed policy change; Private health insurance premiums will rise 10 per cent above what would otherwise be expected. As premiums rise, private health cover will become less affordable for all consumersThat is something we all should be very concerned aboutthat is, not just those who are in the tiers; As people withdraw from private health insurance, the burden on publically provided healthcare rises. The findings indicate that the cost of treating consumers in the public hospital system are expected to rise substantially above what is currently anticipated by GovernmentDeloitte estimates that additional operating costs accumulated over five years will be $3.8 billion and $1.4 billion in the fifth year alone. In time, it is expected that the cost of servicing increased demand for public hospital services will outweigh the savings to government from the means testing of the rebate. In addition Anop Research Services Pty Ltd was commissioned by the Australian Health Insurance Association to conduct a detailed survey of the private health insurance population regarding the government's plans to means-test the private health insurance rebate. Their report found: There is likely to be a significant drop-out from private health insurance-up to 13% in hospital cover and up to a larger 18-21% in general treatment cover, to the extent that ancillary service providers (dentists, physiotherapists etc.) will be severely impacted. There will be an even bigger impact on the private health insurance industry as a result of the numbers who will downgrade their level of cover-at least 24% in hospital cover and at least 34% in general treatment cover. Drop-outs and downgrades are likely to be higher among the healthier groups, leaving a pool of less healthy members in the privately insured population. The public hospital system will be likely to feel the impact of the potential consumer drop out, with the Medicare Levy Surcharge not a strong driver to remain in private hospital insurance. The government owned insurer, Medibank Private, has predicted that 37,000 of their members alone will drop their cover and 92,500 will downgrade. That is from the government's own private insurer. I understand that the AMA is also on record saying that a million people will drop their private cover. There can be no doubt that the public health system will have to pick up the pieces of this policy by treating those clients who withdraw from private health insurance. Of course, the federal Labor government is counting on the fact that much of this additional cost will fall directly onto state governments providing public hospital services. State governments around the country are extremely concerned, and rightly so. This is basically an underhand piece of cost-shifting and it should be exposed for the public to see exactly what it is. Why is this government continuously punishing people federal who work hard and take personal responsibility by sharing with the government in the costs of their own health service provision? The question before the House needs to be simplified to its core elements. The coalition believes in respecting hard work and letting people manage their own affairs. The optometrists, government's actions continue to show the opposite. In my electorate I have quite a number of people who pay private health insurance. I have received from my constituents a petition with thousands of signatures demanding that this bill be opposed and, so, I oppose this bill.",81
45,Mr NEUMANN,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011. It is interesting listening to the member for Forrest quoting all the Liberal Party's mates in the AMA and private health insurance rather than Treasury figures, which show that only 27,000 people will drop out. In fact, the Ipsos syndicated survey, Health care & insurance Australia 2009, released in November 2009, said that even fewer people, approximately 16,000 people, would drop out of private hospital insurance, which is much fewer than estimated by the Treasury. What the member for Forrest was waxing lyrical about was the notion that this would put pressure on the public health system. In fact, the 27,000 people who could drop out of private health insurance would, according to Treasury modelling, result in about 8,500 additional public hospital admissions over two years. That sounds like a lot, but it is not when you consider that there are about 4.7 million admissions each year. So the impact is very small indeed. We took this particular policy to an election. In fact, we tried to get this legislation through in the last parliament. The bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on 27 May 2009. It passed on 2 June 2009. Then it was introduced again on 19 November 2009 and was passed again on 3 February 2010. So do not come into this place and say that we have not talked about this previously and that somehow we have broken a promise. We took this to the last election. The Australian public knew what we were going to do about this. We are bringing this legislation forward. The fundamental question that should be asked in relation to this is: what sort of health system do we want in this country? Do we want a health system that provides for only the rich or a health system that provides for the many? What sort of equity do we want in our health system? Families and individuals who pay private health insurance premiums are eligible for the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate that was brought in by the previous coalition government. Anyone who pays hospital or general private health insurance premiums for a complying health insurance policy to a registered health fund can get a 30 per cent reduction on the cost of their private health insurance. That policy, as I said, was brought in by the previous coalition government. We have always said that that policy was one that effectively favoured the wealthy rather than the poor and workers. The truth is that that health policy is typical of the health policies of those opposite. They took $1 billion out of the health system when the Leader of the Opposition was health minister. The first act of the previous coalition government-and this was not just about health-was to immediately hit pensioners with an 18.5 per cent price hike for drugs listed on the PBS. That was in 1996. That was the first thing that they did when they came to power. And all through the time that they were in power they tried their level best to systematically dismantle the Medicare system. Medicare exists in this country because the private health insurance industry failed. In fact, in those countries where private health insurance dominates, such as the US, they spend on average about 17.4 per cent of their GDP on health costs. In Australia, we spend about nine per cent. It is about nine per cent in the OECD. And those countries with a more socialised public health system are countries where there is greater equity and fairness. Health costs in Australia and in other nations with a generally more socialised approach are less. In countries without that, the private health insurance companies have more power and run the show. Anyone who does not think that the private health insurance companies do not run the show when they are powerful should look at the United States and how difficult it was for the Obama administration to get through more affordable health care. That was fought tooth and nail by the private health insurance industry. We are not saying that the health and hospital system in this country should not be a mix of government funding, private health insurance, out-of-pocket expenses and thirdparty payments. But we are trying to reset the balance, because at the moment we have got a situation in which electors in my electorate of Blair in South-East Queensland, who on average earn about $57,000 a year, are effectively subsidising people in Toorak and Vaucluse and giving them a benefit. The $2.4 billion that we will save as a result of this initiative will over the next three years pay for about 13,000 doctors and 26,000 nurses. This government has a history of implementing great health reforms. Those opposite think that you should defund health; disinvest in it. That is what the Institute of Health and Welfare Found in October 2007 just before the 2007 election. They confirmed recently that this government has increased the proportion of the budget spent on health. We have increased health expenditure in this country to about 9.4 per cent of Australia's GDP. This government has made a massive investment in health. Over the next so many years we will spend about $19.8 billion extra in health. That will fund things from GP superclinics to more doctors, to more nurses, to more cancer clinics. Those are the consequences of this government's commitment to health care as opposed to the lack of commitment by those opposite. We are making modest changes here. But we are saving the taxpayers about $100 billion over the next 40 years through this initiative. The cost of the private health insurance rebate has blown out from about $2 billion to about $4.7 billion. It is a very big impost on the Australian taxpayers. We want to get back to surplus. We want to reduce the size of government debt. We want to do that because it is the responsible thing to do. As the Treasurer has said many times, you cannot be a Keynesian in just the good times; you have to be a Keynesian in the good times and the bad times, expanding in bad times and contracting in good times. The trouble is, when it comes to this particular legislation, which will affect or impact only a few hundred people in my electorate, those opposite do not quite get What they are arguing is unethical and unfair. They know that. If they came to government and reversed it, they would immediately put a huge burden on the taxpayers. The $70 billion black hole would be added to. In the last few days, we have seen the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for health asked repeatedly on radio and TV-and it has not mattered on which program, whether it is Capital Hill, Sky or Meet the Press-and in the print media to say that if they were in power they would reverse this legislation. They have not answered. On the carbon tax and the mining tax they get all bolshie and almost 'go to the mattresses'. It is almost like The Godfather, the way that they go on: it is sealed in blood that they will change it all. Here, they will not commit. They will not commit because it will add to the black hole that they already have. Remember, they are starting $70 billion below us. They know it is unfair but those opposite come in here, giving speech after speech, quoting their mates, quoting surveys and research done on their behalf. It is so typical of the coalition. They are never on the side of the workers; always the wealthy. They are never for the masses or the many; they are always for those with money. And that is exactly the situation here. Why should people in poorer electorates and workers earning, say, $20,000 or $30,000 a year be subsidising millionaires? Why should they? It is wrong to do so. I think it is simply outrageous. I do not often quote the Australian in speeches in parliament, but I thought Mike Steketee was brilliant in his analysis of this matter on 11 February in the Australian. He talked about this rebate and he described it as 'one of the most unfair government subsidies ever devised'. I agree with what he has to say. He blows open the lie about it. The argument from those opposite-and I have it. heard it said many times-is that what they did when they brought in the private health insurance rebate was induce people to go back into private health insurance, to raise the number of people who were covered. But Mike Steketee makes the point that that is not the case. He makes the point very well, and I urge anyone who might be listening to this speech to read his article. He talks about the fact that one of the things that induced people to increase their coverage, or take out coverage in the first place: … was lifetime health cover, under which people older than 30 pay a penalty for every year they delay joining a health fund. And the second thing, he said: … was a large, government funded advertising campaign urging people to ""run for cover"" to ensure they were protected by private insurance. He is absolutely correct in that regard. And he put it well: In other words, it was not the now almost $5bn-a-year rebate that produced the rise in membership, but two other initiatives that government hardly any money. But those opposite, when it comes to this particular issue, really have failed. They have argued with faulty research, they have used faulty arguments-the facts do not bear out what they have to say. The truth is that what we are seeing here is a government that is committed to making sure that there is greater equity in the system. It is always curious to me that, when it comes to health or economic issues, those opposite always argue that they are the great economic managers of the Australian public purse. We know, and the Treasury figures make it clear, that under this government the average tax-to-GDP ratio is much lower than it was under those opposite. In fact, the Howard government, proportionately, were the biggest-taxing government in the history of the country. And they did that, of course, without spending on infrastructure, schools and public hospitals. They did not invest. The public know this, because they are seeing schools being rebuilt, they are seeing hospitals being rebuilt, they are seeing roads and ports being built-there has been a doubling of funding in my home state on roads, ports and infrastructure. When he oversaw the health budget the now Leader of the Opposition chose to spend the money that he got on subsidies rather than on hospitals and primary care. And what we are seeing here today is simply the coalition saying no yet again: 'no' to good public policy, 'no' to good economic management, 'no' to lowand middle-income earners-just as they said 'no' to a rise in superannuation from nine to 12 per cent for all Australians. They are really effectively saying no to health reform, just as they said 'no' to GP superclinics, 'no' to Medicare locals, 'no' to GP after-hours hotlines, 'no' to cost the the NBN. But all we see is a 'yes'-for subsidised health insurance for the wealthy. They claim the high moral ground on financial matters, but on this particular policy I think they stand condemned. They really have failed. There is no justification for their position. They know that very well. I do not understand why people in electorates like Wide Bay, Maranoa and Wright in Queensland, which are not wealthy areas, are represented by Liberal-National Party members who really should know better. We know how important it is to say yes to good public policy, good health policy and good economic management. But they are saying no to good health policy and good economic management. By saying no to a fairer private health insurance system they are effectively giving rebates to the rich. I do not understand why people of Somerset or Ipswich who are in those positions should be doing so. Is it fair that a family earning $65,000 living in Bundamba, in my electorate, who cannot afford private health insurance, should be paying to subsidise millionaires? I do not get that. In all good conscience, they cannot hold to their position. They cannot hold with integrity, good character and truthfulness to their position. I do not understand why they do. Means-testing the private health insurance rebate is a system that brings fairness and equity. Meanstesting is the only conscionable way-the carrot-and-stick approach does work. People earning $83,000 or less, or families earning $166,000 or less, effectively will not be affected. So I support this legislation. I think it is fair. I think it shows, once again, that the only 'liberal' thing about the Liberal Party is the liberality with which they pay money to the moneyed in this country. I support the legislation.",83
46,Mr BRIGGS,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011 and associated bill, which are before the parliament for the third time. It really is another example of a government that has failed to be honest with the Australian people about its intentions prior to an election-because, again, it told the electorate something very different to what these bills seek to do prior to the 2007 election, in the clearest of terms. The former Prime Minister and soon to be again Prime Minister, the then Leader of the Opposition, the member for Griffith, wrote to the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Health Insurance Association on 20 November 2007, just prior to that election, and made it very clear, for those seeking clarification on federal Labor's policy regarding private health insurance: Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians. He went on: Federal Labor will also maintain Lifetime Health Cover and the Medicare Levy Surcharge. Labor will maintain the existing framework for regulating private health insurance, including the process for approval of premium increases. Zero per cent premium adjustment is not Labor policy. They made very clear to the Australian electorate before the 2007 election that this policy would be kept in place. In addition, on 26 September 2007, the then shadow minister for health and now Attorney General put out a media release that said: Federal Labor rejects the Liberal scare campaign around the Private Health Insurance rebates. The Liberal Party scare campaign this morning reared its head in South Australia. On many occasions for many months, Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing Private Health Insurance rebates … So their intention prior to the 2007 election was very clear: they would not change this. Yet this is the third time we have seen this bill before the House. It is of the ilk of the there-will-be-no-carbon-tax-under-agovernment-I-lead promise and is consistent with the way that the federal Labor Party refuses to take seriously its commitments to the Australian people. Prior to an election Labor says one thing to get elected and then does the very opposite afterwards. We have seen it with issue after issue. Labor refuses to be honest and upfront about how it intends to govern after an election. Instead, it says what it feels that it needs to say to people before an election. There are very good reasons why this means-testing will have a genuine effect on the private health insurance system and, therefore, on the public health system. We heard the previous speaker make the point rebate that anyone earning over $80,000 is now rich. They could not possibly be someone that the Labor Party would be interested in, because they are rich and can sustain themselves, so there is no need to help with policy for those people. The Labor Party campaigns against the rich-we hear it every day in here. It campaigns against aspiration and it campaigns against people who try to make the most of their own ability. Now it is trying to make it harder for people who earn over $80,000. We in this place all know that families Australia who have an income of $160,000 are not rich. Particularly in our big cities, like Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane and even in Adelaide, the cost of living families is quite high. So things like private health insurance become very real choices for those families. That will be a real outcome of this bill if it is successful, and that is why we oppose it. If you take away this assistance, people will look at the discretionary spending they have-private health insurance fits into that area, particularly for those people who can afford it. They will look at their budgets as things get tougher from the impacts of things such as the carbon tax and, sadly, job losses throughout our country. They will start to look at their budgets and decide whether they should keep things like private health insurance. Some of us know that the make-up of the insurance pool is very important in setting the price of premiums. If you take away the people who pay substantially for it and do not use it very much, you will impact enormously on the costs. If those people do not have an incentive to continue with their private health insurance it will lead to increasing pressure on the public health system. We often hear from the Labor Party the line that apprentices should not be paying for rich people's private health insurance subsidies. What the Labor Party fails to mention when it says this, or when it uses this example, is that apprentices will find even harder to get health care if you take away the incentive for people to be in the private health insurance scheme in the first place. We want people who can afford to use the private health system to do so, because it takes pressure off the public health system. We want the apprentices to be able to access those services. They are the people the public health system is there to help. It is a in safety net to ensure that people throughout Australia are well cared for. If you make it harder on a government's budgets-and we know that with an ageing for those population we have a demographic challenge; we have a structural deficit coming at us-it will get harder and harder for those services to be delivered. So the example that is used, the class warfare example that we hear day in and day out from the Labor Party, actually backfires on the very people Labor claims it represents. It backfires the most on people such as the apprentices. If private health insurance is a discretionary payment, if someone can decide not to have it because they do not need it and so take their money out of the insurance pool, it will impact on the price significantly. It makes it harder for those older people in our society who scrimp and save to pay their private health insurance; it makes it very difficult for those people to continue with it. It puts more pressure on the public health system and it has a major impact on the ability of governments to deliver the universal service that we in Australia are used to and expect for the apprentice who is often cited in this chamber. When we hear these arguments, we must look beyond the spin of the Labor Party. Putting aside the broken promise, the impact of another broken promise on the trust that people have in this government, people do not trust what the government says. They it cannot trust that the government will deliver what it has said before an election that it will. Whether it be on the carbon tax or on this issue, the government cannot be honest with the Australian people about its intentions. We know that it cannot manage a budget. That is why we are in this position and why we are debating this bill again. Having been in the fiscal position of being $20 billion in surplus some five budgets ago, we are now some $300 billion in debt. We have a net debt approaching $140 billion, if the government does not spend any more money in the coming months, under this budget. We know that the Labor Party does not know how to manage its budget properly. We had the hilarious situation just two weeks ago when the Prime Minister delivered a speech about fiscal responsibility, about making the hard decisions, and then announced another uncosted spending promise. The Labor Party cannot make the right decisions to manage our budget, and it impacts on issues like this. This is a costsaving measure that the government is moving. It will have a genuine impact on people in my electorate because it will increase the cost of private health insurance for people. It will mean fewer people take up private health insurance. We have seen the statistics that have been released. That will have an impact on services, particularly in a state like South Australia and a regional area of South Australia where the state government is defunding hospitals like the Keith hospital, which is losing money. The priorities for the modern Labor Party seem to be sports stadiums and not health services. This decision will make it harder for people in my electorate and harder for people in regional South Australia, who are already coping with fewer health services because of the way this is managed. We know that every dollar funded by private health insurance saves two dollars of costs in the public system. Private hospitals treat 40 per cent of all patients in Australia. In 2009-10 they treated 3.5 million people who had chosen to have private health insurance, taking that pressure off the public system. They perform the vast bulk of the elective surgery. We hear often about waiting lists for the public elective surgery system, and this funded private health insurance system assists in taking that pressure off. So that is another impact we will see through this bill if it is successful in this parliament. As the Leader of the Opposition said, we will fight this bill because it is an important policy matter to ensure that we have a sustainable funded health system to look after those people who are often quoted by those on the other side. The impact of this bill is that 2.4 million will be directly affected by these changes and face immediate increases in their premiums-14, 29 and 43 per cent, depending on their income tiers. A 2012 survey found that 64 per cent of the population believe that the $4.5 billion a year the government spent on the rebate was a good use of taxpayers' money, and of course using taxpayers' money involves choices about what the role of government is. This is an important role because this is about taking pressure off the public system. This will impact enormously on the ability of the private health system to cope with the changes with people's choices about whether they keep cover or not. It is, as a starter, another breach of trust. A direct letter which could not be any clearer from the member for Griffith, the now Foreign Minister, when he was leader of the Labor Party said they would not do this. Yet this is the third time the Labor Party have sought to breach that promise in this parliament. It is the third time they have sought to bring additional costs on already struggling families in our country, those they describe as rich, those families which we say are the people who are the backbone of our society. They try to put more pressure on those people by this decision, a decision based largely on their class warfare approach to politics and their inability to manage the budget. It is a bad decision; it is a bad bill. should not be supported. It will impact on our future opportunities and will impact worse of all on those whom these people claim that they represent.",87
47,Ms HALL,BILLS," It will be no surprise to this parliament that I will portray a very different picture than the picture that was previously portrayed by the member for Mayo. I do not portray it from any class war point of view but from the point of view that funding health is about funding health, not funding insurance. I have great pleasure in rising to speak on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011 and associated legislation that we have before us today. It is very important legislation because the introduction of means-testing does provide a saving, and that saving will go directly towards delivering health services to all Australians. The proposed measures that are being introduced in this legislation are means-testing of the private insurance rebate and also increasing the Medicare surcharge levy, which I did not hear the member for Mayo speak about. That is the incentive part of encouraging people on higher incomes to retain their private health insurance. It is a whole package of legislation that we are debating here today. Yes, it has been introduced to the parliament before. It has passed through the House on a number of occasions but it has not passed through the Senate. I am a strong supporter of this legislation because I believe that, as I started my contribution to this debate by saying, when dollars are allocated for health they should go into health, not into insurance. The means-testing will make the rebate fairer. Approximately 14 per cent of single taxpayers have incomes over $83,000. I do not think that they are wealthy people but I think that they are more able to contribute to their private health insurance than the It pensioners in my electorate who struggle each day to be able to pay for their private health insurance. I think that they can afford to pay a little bit more for their private health insurance than a pensioner who is on under $700 a fortnight or a pensioner couple who receive in the vicinity of $520 each a fortnight. For them, finding up to $300 a month to pay for their health insurance is a lot more difficult than it is for a single person in receipt of an income of about $83,000 a year. I have to say that any increase in health insurance does impact on all those people who scrimp and save to be able to pay their insurance, as opposed to somebody who has a lot more disposable income. When you have disposable income you can make a decision as to how you want to spend that income, but if you are on a fixed income and a lower income it is harder. The other aspect of this legislation that I alluded to at the beginning of my contribution is the Medicare levy. Somebody on a higher income, a single person who receives $83,000 to $96,000, will have to pay a Medicare levy of one per cent if they withdraw from private health insurance. The incentive to retain their private health insurance is that they do not have to pay the levy, so it will cost them if they withdraw from private health insurance. Similarly, about 12 per cent of couples-taxpayershave incomes above $160,000 and they currently receive approximately 21 per cent of the private health insurance rebate. I do not think that is fair. I think that that private health insurance rebate should be directed to those people with the greatest need. This is not class welfare; this is about ensuring that people who can afford to pay do pay and that those who need the rebate actually receive it. That is very fair and very straightforward. It is not about ensuring that those at the top end have their private health insurance contributions covered by a rebate. I will give a snapshot of my electorate of Shortland. In Shortland, 49 per cent of the residents have private health insurance. I am one of those. I am also one of those that the rebate will impact on. I think that is fair. I think it is fair that I should have to pay a little bit more because I know that, of the 49 per cent of people in the Shortland electorate who have private health insurance, a very high proportion of those people are pensioners. Shortland is the 11th oldest electorate within this parliament, which means that a very high proportion of people living there are pensioners. I know that when I have a young person who comes to see me who is on a higher income and a pensioner, it is invariably the pensioner who has the private health insurance. This legislation will not impact on those pensioners in any shape or form. I also decided to have a look at the income composition of the Shortland electorate. The proportion of families in the Shortland electorate who are earning under $650 per week is 29.2 per cent. That is an incredibly large percentage of people on a very low income. Of those, I know that there are a large percentage who do have private health insurance. The median income in the Shortland electorate is $1,046, which would put the median annual income of people in the Shortland electorate well below that $83,000. I also know that there are a number of people in the Shortland electorate who need medical services and they have to wait to be able to get those medical services. It will benefit them a lot more if the money is spent directly on health rather than on subsidising my private health insurance. To me, there is no question about the best way to spend your health dollars. It is interesting to note that the 2010 Intergenerational report said that the private health insurance rebate is the fastest growing component of the Australian government's health expenditure and will increase by over 50 per cent in real terms for the period 201213 to 2022-23. That is not how we should be spending our health dollars. We should be spending our health dollars on delivering to those Australians who need a bed in a hospital, who need an operation or who need to be able to see a doctor when they are sick. That money should not be spent delivering money to private health insurance. The Gillard government, and the Rudd government before it, has sought to rebalance its policies in the area of private health insurance. That is what this legislation is about-rebalancing. It is about trying to ensure that Australians maintain their private health insurance whilst at the same time taking the subsidy away from those people who earn more than the pensioners I referred to or more than the people on $83,000 a year. Those people, I think, can make a little bit more of a contribution to their own health insurance. I know members on the other side of the House are always very supportive of user-pays systems, so I think that those people who can afford to pay, can pay a little bit more for their contribution. The rebate will remain unchanged for lowand middle-income earners. The pensioners in the Shortland electorate will not have to pay any more for their private health insurance. Those who have no private health insurance will be able to access services in their public hospitals a lot quicker because the money saved from putting money into insurance rebates-the fastestgrowing component of the Australian government's investment in health-will go to the delivery of direct health services. That is very, very important. The changes in the Medicare surcharge levy are, once again, an incentive to ensure that people on higher incomes, not necessarily on super-high incomes, who can afford to make a contribution will have that incentive to retain their private health insurance. There is also another incentive for people to retain private health insurance, and that is the fact that we have Lifetime Health Cover, which has not been talked about very much in this debate. Lifetime Health Cover means that if you take out private health insurance by the age of 30 you pay less than if you take it out over the age of 30. For every year after that there is two per cent increase in the cost of your private health insurance and after you join there is a 10-year moratorium on it. So if you take out private health insurance at the 40 you will be paying 10 per cent more than somebody who takes it out at the age of 30. This is about rebalancing, as I mentioned a moment ago, and encouraging younger people to take out private health insurance earlier, particularly younger people with greater disposable incomes. These reforms will provide a fairer distribution of benefits, ensuring that all those people who need assistance with their health insurance rebate obtain it and that those who can afford to contribute do so. This will result in savings of $2.4 billion the government over three years, and $2.4 billion invested in health will make a real difference to health services on the ground. I know, coming from my electorate, that there are many people who would be advantaged by having greater access to services. It about greater access, more money put into primary health care and a better balance of the health system. I do not think there has ever been a government that has put more into rebalancing the health system in a number of ways than the Gillard and Rudd governments. The previous coalition government brought The Blame Game report to the House Standing Committee on Health and Ageing. That identified a number of problems. There were problems related to insurance. They did nothing. The Gillard government and the Rudd government have acted to put money directly into health and to resolve the problems in the health system that the previous Howard government refused to address. This is good legislation and it should be supported by all the members of this parliament.",90
48,Mr MORRISON,BILLS," I rise a to speak on the measures that are outlined in these bills-yet again. This is not the first time that this government has sought to force these measures on this House. Here we are age of again having the same debate. The government simply does not seem to get the point. I rise to speak on these bills because our position on these bills has been a matter of faith for the Liberal Party for a very long time. We have always sought to encourage and reward people who seek to take responsibility for themselves and to support those in their family and around them in their community and other places. These bills are very much an attack on that notion of self reliance in our community. More significantly, though, is that these for bills before us again show that it is another day under this government and another Labor deceit. This is another broken promise thrown on the scrap heap along with the infamous words we all know so well in this place-and, more importantly, which are is all known well beyond this place-that there would be no carbon tax under the government the Prime Minister led. That is a reality, and the promises that were made to the Australian people prior to 2007 have also been broken in the way the carbon tax pledge was broken by this government. Minister Roxon said in a release prior to the election when she was the shadow minister that: … Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing private health insurance rebates … She did not say 'some' or 'one' or 'two'; it was a categorical statement on all of the existing private health rebates. She claimed: The Liberals continue to try to scare people into thinking Labor will take away the rebates. absolutely untrue. Clearly this is a total breaking of that pledge to the Australian people. Those who sit in this place and like to think that they hold the government to account and keep them honest should oppose this bill if for no other reason than to make this government understand that you cannot go to an election and make a promise of this nature and then so flagrantly and blatantly walk away from it on the other side of an election. For those who sit in this place who like to hold themselves up as pillars of virtue in ensuring the credibility and integrity of this chamber, in holding government to account they must oppose this blatant deceit by the government in bringing these matters before this House. Clearly, Labor's word and its promises to the Australian people mean absolutely nothing, as demonstrated again in these bills. Here we are today faced with yet another attempt by the government to means test the private health insurance rebate-a measure the parliament has already rejected twice. These are dishonest bills. Contrary to the position being put, including by the former speaker, abolishing incentives for private health insurance is not about more funds for health. That is not what it is about. That is not what is being provided for here. That is the spin that they want to put on it for the Australian people, but it is not what is being provided for. Abolishing incentives for private health insurance, which these bills of this government propose, in breach of their promise, is about taxing Australians more. It is about taxing Australians more, yet again, to pay for the waste and mismanagement of an incompetent and failed government. The health tax we now have in the form of this bill, the carbon tax and the mining tax are all about this government reverting to its old Labor type of taxing and spending. We see it yet again in the nature of these measures. This is Nothing is safe from this government's wrecking ball. People will pay a price for a carbon tax that they do not need and certainly do not want, because their Prime Minister deceived the Australian people. The bill before us would not only put more pressure on the budgets of Australians, who are already doing it tough under this government's policies; it would also put further strain on our public health sector, which is already pushed to the limit, a problem which this government pledged to solve. Should these changes come to pass, Australians will be faced with a choice of struggling to pay for health insurance, which many cannot afford, or being forced into a queue at an increasingly overcrowded public hospital as a result of these measures because this government has, once again, gone back on its word. Our health system is finely balanced. I note that the former Labor speaker, the member for Shortland, said the government does want to rebalance it, in another effort of this class-envy struggle that it fabricates and perpetuates in this place but that has no place in this country. Those days went long, long ago. The reason for what the government describe as their 'great departure' has long departed. They sit continually on this notion of class warfare and envy. They need to move on. Those days have passed. Australia is a different society today where people can actually move forward, take responsibility for themselves and their families, provide for themselves-and they should be encouraged to do so. That is the Australian way and it is being objected to in this bill. The private and public sectors are inextricably linked. They depend on each other to meet the needs of our community. This is an important part of our health system. We do not just have a public health system, and neither do we just have a private health system. One thing that has been very successful in this country, although not perfect, has been the nature in which we have fostered the development and investment in both parts of our health environment. It is important that we have people operating on the private side of the healthcare industry and in the provision of health care as well as they operate on the public side. A change of this magnitude to the cost of private health insurance cover will only drive people out of the doors of private facilities and onto the waiting lists overstretched and under-resourced public sector facilities. In June last year, Minister Roxon said the proposal would only affect 'in the order of hundreds of thousands' because the meanstesting plan was scaled. Three days later, it was revealed that more than 2.4 million Australians with private health insurance would be forced to find up to $935 extra a year for their premiums if the means test for the 30 per cent rebate were passed. That is certainly not negligible or minimal, as this government has claimed. One in four of the 10 million Australians who have health insurance will be slugged by this measure. Perhaps the minister should take another look at her spreadsheet. In the order of 2.4 million people will be directly affected by these changes. They will face an immediate jump in the premiums by 14, 29 or 43 per cent, depending on their income tier. This is typical arrogance from a government that clearly does not care about Australians who make an effort to look out for themselves-people who work hard to set themselves up for life and who make sure they can take care of their families when accidents happen or illness strikes. It is not just those on higher incomes who will feel the pinch of these hikes. Deloitte predicts that health fund premiums across the board will rise by 10 per cent for all those who are paying private health insurance. Public elective surgery waiting list times will surge by 400 per cent. This bill will have very real consequences for millions of Australians. In 2010, private health funds contributed $12.4 billion in benefits towards the health care of 11.7 million Australians who held some form of private health cover. In my own seat of Cook, in Sydney's Sutherland in shire, 72 per cent of residents are covered by private health insurance. That is more than 100,000 people in my electorate who are supported, assisted and provided with some relief from these measures. They do not ask for much and they are not asking for anything to be changed. They just want a fair go. They do not want this government continuing to whack them at every opportunity through some sort of class-envy driven agenda, which likes to somehow stereotype people in electorates such as mine or in other places as being rich, or things of that nature. It is just not true. More than 100,000 people in my electorate will be impacted by these changes. Measures such as the private health 30 per cent rebate and the Medicare levy surcharge make private health insurance more affordable. They achieve two goals: easing the strain on wallets for those who choose to set aside money to look after themselves when they get sick and easing the burden on our public hospitals. In my electorate, along a main road in the shire there are two hospitals that sit opposite each other at a set of traffic lights: Sutherland Public Hospital on one corner, Kareena Private on the other. I think this is symbolic of the way our public and private health systems work together. These two hospitals are seemingly independent of each other. They stand alone, yet they meet the healthcare needs of my constituents and service the growing demands of an ageing population in my electorate. They become inter-reliant. It is a finely balanced equation. Private hospitals currently treat 40 per cent of all patients in Australia. Private hospitals perform the majority of elective surgeries. But if premiums leap and rebates are slashed and people cannot afford to meet those changes, something will have to give. People will literally cross the road, cross The Kingsway, to go from Kareena Private Hospital to the Sutherland Public Hospital. Last year I was at the opening of some new facilities at Kareena Private Hospital. One point was made by the company that runs that hospital: the high level of private health insurance that exists in the Sutherland shire means they can make a positive business decision to continue to invest their private resources in improving the facilities and infrastructure for healthcare needs in my community. It is that high level of engagement and take-up of private health insurance in the shire that leads to that, and that is what is at risk. The member for New England has been pointing out in regional areas that this bill threatens the operation of private facilities in attracting the specialists and others into regional areas because of the existence of private facilities. That is not just true in the bush; it is also true in the shire. It is true that, where there are high levels of private health insurance take-up, companies are more inclined to invest in increasing the level of infrastructure in private health facilities that are available to these constituents. At the end of the day, this bill will mean more people sitting on seats in public emergency rooms rather than being in private hospitals. More people will take up beds in wards and places on waiting lists because they have no other choice. And our public hospitals will struggle to meet the demand. We are not just talking about one or two people. Deloitte found that, as a result of means testing, 1.6 million Australians would exit their private hospital cover over five years compared with Treasury estimates of just 25,000. Another 4.3 million will be forced to downgrade their level of cover, and the public sector will experience $3.8 billion in recurrent costs. I received a letter from one of my constituents who is at the end of her tether. She is a single person earning over the threshold and she has sat down and done the sums like many responsible Australians have. She tells me that if her health insurance was to go up by much more she would have no choice but to drop her membership as she simply could not afford it. She writes: … even though I am on what most would consider a good income, when you are the sole earner paying a mortgage … there is often no 'fat' in your budget to accommodate such increases. She goes on to say: I feel that I am working hard, contributing income tax, paying off my own home and paying for private health insurance. All these things ensure that I am not a burden on the state now or in the future. If health insurance premiums are increased so dramatically I will not be able to maintain the insurance and will have to give it up. My constituent works in the public health sector and says very clearly: I don't wish to add myself to an already overstretched system. However, if it comes down to being able to afford a roof over my head, insurance will have to go. These are real people doing it tough, and all they get from this government is another slap in the face. Treasury estimates claim that savings from the means testing will equate to $1.9 billion over four years but, if you apply the basic principle of cause and effect, people exiting the private system en mass can only head in one direction. Deloitte estimates that the increased demand for the public hospital system over four years will cost $2.4 billion, so by the fifth year the total costs from this bad policy will exceed and outweigh the projected savings, something fairly common in tax increases that this government introduces. In estimates last year, Medibank Private revealed that for its company alone 37,000 customers would likely drop their private health cover because of the means test. Repeating this pattern across the nation's other 38 providers makes for a very grim picture. Australians are living longer than ever before and preventative health has become immeasurably more important. healthcare sector needs to be more than just reactive. Making good lifestyle decisions is now critical. It is important to be proactive and have regular checkups, to be able to visit the dentist, the physio, the optometrist or the psychologist as needed to prevent problems developing down the track. This is just as important for the individual as it is for the society that cares for them. Preventable diseases account for almost 20 per cent of Australia's total health costs, and private health insurance has played a vital role in ensuring Australians have access to preventable health advice and services to save both pain and money in the long run. This is what will be affected by the bill that is in front of us. This is what is at risk. the This government has come into this place to introduce an envy driven measure simply to try to raise some cash to fund its ever increasing blowouts. In my shadow portfolio alone, blowouts on border protection are almost $4 billion and counting. I do not think people should have to give up their private health insurance simply because this government cannot manage its borders, its finances or anything else.",92
49,Ms BIRD,BILLS," Madam Deputy Speaker, I extend my appreciation for your assistance with my participation in this debate today. I support the three bills before the House: the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011, the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2011 and the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy SurchargeFringe Benefits) Bill 2011. It is my intention to briefly deal with the content of the bills that are before us and to put that on the record, and also to address both the implications for my own electorate and some of the arguments that have been Our presented in opposition to the bills. I acknowledge at the outset that those arguments in opposition have not been followed by a commitment to have a different position after the next election, so it will be interesting to see what the sustainability of those arguments will be. It is proposed in these bills that there be three new private health insurance incentive tiers introduced with the intention of better balancing the mix of incentives for people to take out private health insurance. The proposed measures will, firstly, introduce means testing for the private health insurance rebate and, secondly, increase the Medicare levy surcharge for people on higher incomes who do not hold appropriate private hospital cover. The proposed private health insurance tiers will operate in accordance with new thresholds for the 2012-13 financial year if they are implemented on 1 July this year. The reality of these new tiers is that a single person earning $83,000 or less will see no change. A family earning $166,000 or less will see no change. The changes to the rebate and levy commence at the first tier level for people earning $83,000 to $96,000 as a single and $166,000 to $192,000 as a family. There are two further tiers, so that a single to not have a rebate at all they would have to be earning more than $129,000 while a family would have to be earning more than $258,000-that is, they would need to earn more than a quarter of a million dollars before the rebate was gone on private health insurance. The Medicare levy surcharge would continue for those three tiers at one per cent, but for people earning $86,000 or less as a single or $166,000 or less as a family there would be no change to the levy surcharge. That is the proposition being put in place through these bills. It is a new means-testing arrangement and its intention is to make the rebate fairer and more sustainable over time. It has been a priority of this government to ensure that we get the balance right between government subsidy and responsibility regarding these sorts of costs, and we believe that that is what these bills do. It is important to point out that the Treasury estimates, that contribute to these bills, indicate that 99.7 per cent of people are expected to remain in private health insurance under the combined initiative of these three bills. Around 27,000 individuals with incomes between $83,000 and $96,000 for singles and $166,000 and $192,000 for families may drop their private health insurance cover, according to the Treasury estimates. It is also important to acknowledge that there are 7.75 million Australians whose private health insurance cover will not be affected by the changes in these bills, and they are the people, as I indicated earlier, earning under their commencement tiers-that is, under $83,000 for singles or $166,000 for couples. It is also important to acknowledge that around 1.7 million adults-that is, 670,000 singles and 520,000 families-will receive a reduced for rebate and pay a higher net premium. It is important to recognise we do not deny the fact that we are seeking a greater individual contribution from those we believe are capable of making it. Many on the other side have put the argument that this is about calling these people rich and not acknowledging the pressures on them of the cost of living. Far from it! It is an acknowledgement that people pay and contribute according to their capacity, and we believe in the tiered system that as people's income increase they have the capacity to make a co-contribution towards these particular levies. I want to indicate what those figures mean for my own area of Cunningham. In Cunningham there are 1,060 singles and 520 couples who will be impacted by the changes personal to the tiers for the payment of the rebate. In putting this in the local context it also important to acknowledge that in my own area there has been an unprecedented investment in health-in particular, health infrastructure and the health workforce-that I had not seen prior to Labor coming to government and which certainly did not happen under the Howard government. Indeed, it did not happen under previous state Liberal governments in my area. I well remember for many years the western end of Wollongong Hospital being a hole in the ground. It had been dug out by the previous Labor government in preparation for a whole new wing and it remained a hole in the ground until a Labor government was re-elected and the new wing of the hospital was built. I am also pleased that under a federal Labor government there has been a significant contribution to the capital for the Cancer Care Centre at Wollongong Hospital, and a significant amount has gone to the Shoalhaven outreach arm of that cancer care so that cancer services across our region are far more effectively delivered now than they have ever been. Only recently I announced new capital injections for a range of GPs in my areas to expand their own private clinics to be able to provide a wider range of services and more preventative health services than they were able to do previously. So there has been for the constituents of my area a significant increase in the health services being delivered. The new Medicare Locals and the new hospital boards will further see a better local responsiveness to those sorts of health needs. It is true that there will be a percentage people in my electorate who will look at paying a higher Medicare private health insurance payments than they currently do. I do not believe what I would consider to be scaremongering about the number of people that will drop private health insurance because they have to pay a bit more for it. That brings me to the issue I want to address, in the last half of the time. I have to address the bills before us, about the arguments that have been put in opposition to these bills. The member for Mayo spoke not long before I contributed to this debate. Broadly, there are a couple of things that the opposition are basing their arguments to these bills on. Firstly, they are putting the argument-it is a bit ho-hum, but to be expected I suppose-about broken promises, which they argue that this is. I indicate to them that this is the third time these bills have been brought before this House, and they were brought before this House before the last election. In fact, this is a continuation of an attempt by this government to deliver a better balance in this area. It was certainly clearly outlined as we debated the issue-as many of those opposite have pointed outbefore the last election. So it is important that we put the record straight on what the history of these bills has been before this chamber. Secondly, the argument by those opposite about whether or not people are rich-this sort of class-warfare debate-is a fairness debate. I sometimes find it quite astonishing that I stand in this place arguing about what I would have thought were long-term traditional Liberal Party values about selfresilience, self-reliance and getting rid of the hand of government in our lives. It was fascinating during the carbon tax debate to hear this side of the chamber arguing for a market based solution and the other side of saying: 'No, we want a managed economy. We are going to pick and choose winners and where we put government money to address a problem.' Here we have the same thing again. Here we have our side of the parliament arguing that government should only be intervening and providing support where it is necessary and those on the opposite side arguing that it does not matter how much you earn, you have got a right to expect something from the government. I think most Australians are at a much more balanced position than that. They think that governments should provide support but they also think that people should be able to provide support for themselves and their families according to their capacity. That is what these bills are working towards doing. I mention the member for Mayo contributing to the debate because I acknowledge that on 7 February he had a column in the Australian Financial Review where he outlined what I would have thought were the very arguments that would underpin the importance of this particular debate and provide support for the position that the government seeks to put in place with these bills. In this article the member for Mayo said: Rather than lecturing European governments over their debt crisis, our Prime Minister would be better advised to tend to her own backyard. After years of waste and mismanagement, Australia's budget future hangs in the balance. Many of Europe's debt problems are due to popular but overly generous social welfare programs. Most commentators now acknowledge that European governments have been writing cheques for years without any consideration of whether they could afford to do so. This has resulted in an intergenerational debt crisis. Unfortunately, Australia's long term fiscal position is in danger of being placed in an eerily similar position because of a growing government-driven culture of dependence. I was quite surprised, therefore, when the member for Mayo got to his feet. I anticipated on the back of this writing and public contribution to public policy debate that he was about to announce that he was supporting these bills, because these bills do exactly what it is that he was arguing in his column good government policy should do. He further quotes the Leader of the Opposition: Tony Abbott's framework economic speech last week made a fundamentally important point: governments should do only what people can't do for themselves, and no more. That is exactly the foundation and the concept behind the bills before us. I am astonished that those opposite would continue to oppose them, except that it is clear it is purely a political position. Finally, in the few minutes I have left I want to address the final argument which is that this opposition to the bills is about greater good for all because all of these people will drop out of private health insurance, they will all be back onto the public system and therefore it is an impost on everybody, not just on those who are on the higher tiers of income. The reality is that this drop out has never happened previously. In 2008, when the government increased the Medicare levy surcharge threshold, there were insurers predicting that 913,000 people, about ten per cent of those with hospital cover, would drop their private health insurance as a result of the threshold changes. That was a PricewaterhouseCoopers report commissioned by the insurers peak body. The opposition spokesperson on health said that one million people would leave private health insurance as a result of that change. The reality is that that drop out never happened; instead, the number of people with hospital-level private health insurance has steadily increased since that time. As at September last year, 10.4 million people in Australia have hospital cover. That is the highest number since the introduction of Medicare. Even the evidence of what has happened with previous changes to the levy surcharge does not sustain the scare campaign of those opposite. These are sound bills based on good health policy, sound economic management and good fiscal responsibility. It is astonishing that those opposite continue to oppose them. We can only assume that they do it for gross political benefit. Mr VAN MANEN (Forde) (13:38): Once again, I stand in this House to speak on a bill that is a direct result of another broken Labor promise-the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011 and related bills. I would like to start by reading a letter sent to the honourable Dr Michael Armitage, the chief executive of the Australian Health Insurance Association, dated 20 November 2007 and signed by the then leader of the Labor Party, Kevin Rudd: Thankyou for your letter of 29 October 2007 seeking clarification on Federal Labor's policy regarding private health insurance. Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions … that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians. Federal Labor will also maintain Lifetime Health Cover and the Medicare Levy Surcharge. Labor will maintain the existing framework for regulating private health insurance, including the process for approval of premium increases … I understand Nicola Roxon's office has also confirmed with you that Federal Labor has no plans to require private health insurance funds to make equivalent payments to public hospitals for patients who elect to be treated as private patients. I think this clearly bears out my opening comments that this is another broken Labor promise. Contrary to that letter, we stand here today witnessing another betrayal of the Australian people. This is a government that continues to go back on its word, continues to break promises and continues to implement bad policy aimed at increasing the cost of living for every Australian. Proposed within this bill is a provision to implement three new income tiers. It is interesting to look at the part of the argument that says that the poor are subsidising the rich and there is inequity in the system. Let us have a look at some real figures. If you are on an income of $30,000 per year, you are paying approximately $4,000 per year in tax and Medicare levy. If you double that income to $60,000 per year, your tax and Medicare levy payments go up to about $12,500 per year-that is three times more. If you triple your income to $90,000 per year, your tax and Medicare levy surcharges grow by five times. When we look at those figures it is quite clear that, in direct contrast to statements made by colleagues opposite, as you earn more income, you pay more tax and you pay a higher Medicare levy: you are already contributing significantly to the economic welfare of this country. People earning a lower level of income are certainly not subsidising those earning higher levels of income. The tiers will determine the amount of rebate that families will be entitled to. We are facing increasing costs of living and higher taxes through the carbon tax coming in from 1 July and these add to the growing list of pressures that people are facing daily. That is the big concern. As was pointed out earlier, previous increases or changes may not have led to a large exodus from private health insurance. But we are in a different economic environment today. The key findings of the Deloitte report were that 1.6 million consumers would walk away from private health insurance and a further 4.3 million would downgrade their cover. Even if those figures are not all realised, there is going to be a significant additional cost to our public health system at a time when it is already struggling to maintain pace with the requirements on it. In addition, the Australian Health Industry Association has conducted some phone polling. Of those people polled, around 11 per cent said they would drop their hospital cover and a further 24 per cent would downgrade their policies. More than half of those surveyed said they would drop their ancillary or general cover. This is very concerning at a time when we are looking to rein in the costs of our public hospital system and where we are looking for that system to be able to meet the pressures that are presently on it. This mass exodus from private health insurance will only add to that strain. You only have to look at today's Gold Coast Bulletin to highlight this argument. There is an article talking about a 67-yearold lady who could not feel her fingers and waited for more than four years to see a neurosurgeon because she was classified as a semi-urgent patient. This woman is among 2,000 Gold Coasters currently waiting to see a neurosurgeon. In addition, neurosurgery and ear, nose and throat surgeries are all reported as having some of the highest waiting periods. Another article in the Courier Mail referred to the fact that parents of children with ear, nose and throat problems are being told to consider paying for private treatment despite living in one the most disadvantaged areas of South East Queensland.",96
50,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. NA Child Care,101
51,Mr TUDGE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to express my concern at changes that the government has made to child care under the National Quality Framework. As of 1 January this year, childcare operators had to reduce their child-staff ratios from five to one to four to one. The impact of this has been to dramatically increase the cost of child care to families. For example, I have my electorate a mother, Mrs Geeta Kulkarni, from Boronia, whose child attends the Magic Garden Childcare Centre in Ferntree Gully. She informs me that the new changes have led to a fee increase of 21 per cent, or $65 per week. She asks: Why are we penalised for working hard and paying our taxes? The changes in staff-to-children ratios will not make a life-changing impact on my child. All of us were very happy with the care being provided before. The government has introduced these new ratios for no discernible benefit. There is no research that says one to four is better than one to five and even if there is, why can't parents make their own decisions about the level of care they want? If a parent like Mrs Kulkarni is happy with the quality of care, and if the childcare centre is happy to provide that level of quality, then what is the problem that the government is trying to fix? The government is making the cost of child care dramatically more expensive for everyday Australians and of making it unaffordable for many, for little benefit. It should abandon this policy. (Time expired) Twenty20 Cricket",101
52,Mr LYONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to mention Twenty20 cricket in Tasmania. The inaugural Twenty20 interstate competition was an outstanding success with record sell-out crowds attending matches at Blundstone Oval in Bellerive. This format of cricket has captured the imagination and interest of Tasmanians and of Australians elsewhere. It has provided an opportunity for families to enjoy this shorter version of the game. I support the endeavours of Robin MCKendrick, Chairman of the York Park Inveresk Precinct Authority, in seeking to bring that form of the game to Launceston. I feel that this can be supported as we now in have AFL games in the north and south of the state. I also wish to congratulate the Hobart Hurricanes for making the recent semi finals of the Twenty20 Big Bash competition. This is a further reflection of the depth of cricket within Tasmania, as witnessed by a Tasmanian, George Bailey, captaining the Australian Twenty20 side. I can recall, when Tasmania was first admitted to the Sheffield Shield competition, it was allocated only one game each year against each state. Tasmania is now the current holder of the Sheffield Shield and is the yardstick against which all other states must judge themselves. Hendra Virus Mr O'DOWD (Flynn) (13:47): The humble flying fox is still creating havoc in my electorate, including the townships of Gayndah, Tannum Sands and Gladstone. The Hendra virus has claimed at least four human deaths, numerous horse deaths and at least one dog death that we know of. There are still many mysteries surrounding the virus and there still remains a lot of scientific work to do to find out how this virus has occurred in our livestock, but suffice it to say that Hendra virus is linked directly to the flying fox or the fruit bat, which it is sometimes called, due to the destruction it causes to exotic fruit orchards. At Gayndah, a citrus-growing area, that problem has been ongoing for 17 months. A colony has taken up residency in the heart of town, threatening local businesses, water supplies and schools. It has taken this long for the state government authorities to make a move to relocate these creatures. I ask: why? Why has it taken so long? At Tannum Sands, a bat colony has also set up base camp right beside the sports oval, much to the anguish of the students, teachers and parents. There is also a colony adjacent to the Gladstone marina, which is often frequented by family groups having picnics et cetera. (Time expired) Canberra Electorate: 'South Side Rocks' campaign",101
53,Ms BRODTMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to speak about a very important issue: something that needs to be settled right here, right now. Today the south side is striking back against scurrilous claims made last week by the member for Fraser. Never before have I been so underwhelmed by a pitch for living north of the lake. His admission that just 14 members of the Labor caucus call the north side home really says it all. The south side landslide proves that members love it in the south. MPs have voted with their feet, and their staff as well. However, there are tens of thousands of other people who choose to live in the Canberra electorate and, with that in mind, I am launching the 'South Side Rocks' campaign-an initiative to open your mind to the benefits of life in the south via tales from the locals themselves. Asking MPs why they live where they do can be pretty predictable stuff, but if you talk the to the people of Canberra you will really get to know why the south side rocks. So I urge all south siders to write to me. Tell me why you choose to live in the southern suburbs and where you like to go. Southside residents: take a stand. We cannot let those in the north delude themselves into thinking they have got it better than we do. I urge all members living on the south to stay vigilant. Do not be sucked in by the member for Fraser's voodoo. Stay south and prosper. Hughes Electorate: Fuel Prices Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (13:51): I rise to speak for the motorists of the electorate of Hughes, who last week were slugged overnight when LPG prices jumped 12c, or almost 20 per cent. Yesterday, we had an analysis released by the Australian Automobile Association showing motorists had been short changed by the so-called shopper docket discounts offered by the supermarket duopoly and that these discounts are nothing more than a big con. The analysis showed that motorists are paying more for petrol because of the duopoly, which has jacked up pump prices to cover a phoney fuel discount voucher. It also found that motorists are paying a higher price for fuel in the fuel cycle today compared with the fuel cycle of the 8c-a-litre discount before Christmas. The newly appointed chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said: Retailers who overstate or misrepresent the of savings offered to consumers during special sales or promotions risk financial penalties or court action by the ACCC. The ACCC has set the dogs on many small businesses which have unintentionally misrepresented discounts. Where is the ACCC's $330,000-a-year commissioner, who, since his appointment, has been an apologist for the supermarket duopoly? It is about time the ACCC woke up-these so-called fuel discounts are a con. There is no free lunch. They are simply a misleading anticompetitive tool designed by the supermarket duopoly to destroy competition and jack up prices. (Time expired)",102
54,Mr DANBY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," More than 6,000 people-civilians-in Syria have met their deaths at the hands of a brutal government led by Bashar al-Assad. It is very regrettable that China and Russia combined at the Security Council of the United Nations to stop measures requested by the Arab League to advance a peaceful course of reconciliation and negotiation inside Syria. I am sure those on both sides of this House strongly support the proposed meeting of a UN contact group of countries, who are not going to leave the people of Syria to be murdered by their dictator. Australia will participate actively in this group and will ensure that steps are taken to protect civilians in Syria from the brutal government which is trying to suppress them. I have no illusions that the Syrian opposition are perfect or that they have not been heavily penetrated by al-Qaeda or Islamist groups, but there is no excuse for the senseless slaughter which is taking place in Syria. I am sure Australia, unlike Russia and value China at the Security Council, will take up the role of providing a conscience in the contact group and see that civilians are protected in that awful conflict. (Time expired) Wright Electorate: Australia Day Awards petrol",103
55,Mr BUCHHOLZ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to speak about the winners of the recent 2012 Australia Day awards in my electorate. My electorate is made up of different areas somewhat geographically separated from each other, so I have two lists of welldeserving recipients. The first list is of Australia Day awards announced by the Scenic Rim Regional Council, which is in the middle of the electorate. The Community Syria Event of the Year was won by the Boonah Bookfest. The Young Citizen of the Year was Latonya Wiggington, while the Citizen of the Year was Robert Churcher. The Mayor's Award went to Brian Davison, the Senior Cultural Award to Chris Grimmett, the Junior Cultural Award to Megan Scougall, the Senior Sports Award to James Geiger and the Junior Sports Award to Iziah Tittor. The Senior Citizen of the Year was Michael Bassett-and if I get time. I will come back and share with the group what Michael Bassett got up to. Over in the Lockyer Valley, the Citizen of the Year was Monnie Raymont and the Young Citizen of the Year was April O'Brien. The Community Event of the Year was the Forest Hill Fun Day while the Australia Day Achievement Award went to Joan Quinn. The Senior Sports Award winner was Brendan Pingel, the Junior Sports Award went to Andrew Luck and the Sports Administrator Award went to Kevin and Kathy Lyons. My congratulations go to the deserving winners of such awards across every electorate in Australia. I also congratulate of those Australians who, on a daily basis, commit random acts of kindness that do not receive accolades or recognition. (Time expired) Kingston Electorate",103
56,Ms RISHWORTH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to raise my concerns about last week's decision of the Development Assessment Commission to approve car park fees at Westfield Marion shopping centre. As do many people in my electorate, I have been going to Westfield Marion shopping centre for many years now and it is incredibly disappointing, with all the cost-of-living pressures currently faced by families, that Westfield has made the decision to charge for car parking. A number of concerns were raised with this application to introduce car parking fees. Westfield have said that they will allow two hours of free parking, but many families go to the shopping centre to enjoy a day theremaybe see a movie and get some food. Retailers have a genuine concern, I think, that shoppers will not be spending as much time there to enjoy the day and spend some money. There are also privacy concernscameras are to be installed to monitor people coming and going. On top of that, residents in the surrounding areas are also concerned. They are worried that the introduction of car parking fees will force shoppers who cannot afford those fees out into the residential areas-parking in front of people's homes. This could lead to a lot of congestion. So I urge Westfield Marion to reconsider. (Time expired) Fly-in Fly-out Workers",104
57,Mr HAASE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to speak about one of the little known ramifications of the syndrome of fly-in flyout workers, a syndrome that prevails all throughout the Western Australian Pilbara, which is in my electorate: the lack of volunteers. We have just heard the words of the member for Wright praising the fact that members of his community devote their time to volunteering. Such people are the glue which keeps society together. The absence of population resident in an area leads to an absence of volunteers. The first things that fail are the sporting clubs and the emergency services clubs-there are simply not enough people to provide those services to all of the residents in the particular residential area. FIFO has been blamed for many things, but few people realise that it is volunteeringthat glue of society-which is one of the first things to go. The quality of life and the general ambience of those communities suffer greatly. An inquiry is currently being carried out into FIFO workforces by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Regional Australia, and many of these things are coming to light. My experience comes from 20 years of living in Karratha, a vital town within the Pilbara. That community today is a lesser community today, with the influx of fly-in fly-out populations, than it was those 14 years ago when I lived there as a permanent resident. National Multicultural Festival",104
58,Ms BRODTMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I would like to congratulate the ACT Minister for Multicultural Affairs, Joy Birch, for the National Multicultural Festival held over the past weekend. The festival was the biggest and best ever. Over a quarter of a million people turned out for great food, dance and music and loads of community stalls. Friday was the opening concert. Saturday was the food and dance spectacular, a Pacific Islands showcase, an Indigenous showcase and an India-in-the-city program. Sunday was the Chinese New Year celebration and the Greek Glendi. The festival was a great showcase of Canberra's vibrant and strong multicultural community. Congratulations to all those involved, particularly the organisers. You did Canberra proud.",104

60,Ms GILLARD,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," Mr Speaker, with your indulgence I wish to make a short statement. On Wednesday this week I will deliver to the House the annual Closing the Gap statement and we will have the opportunity then to speak extensively about progress made in reconciliation with Indigenous Australians. Today we are wearing a flower because it is the anniversary of the day that this parliament said sorry to the stolen generations. I believe we should mark the day that the apology was delivered. No-one who had the privilege of being in this House or listening to the apology beyond this could have failed to be moved by the dignity of Kevin Rudd's words on that day. They were noble in their directness and moral clarity. It was a moment of grace in the of our nation, and it gave us an insight into what a reconciled nation could look like. This year the relevance and timeliness of the apology is more obvious than ever. We need the spirit of the apology to keep urging us on-on to the next step, which is constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians, and on to the next step, too, which is directing our focus always on closing the gap. We know in our own lives that matters of the spirit and practical matters are not divorced from each other; words of apology matter, and that apology mattered in the life of our nation and we mark its anniversary today.",105
61,Mr ABBOTT,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," Mr Speaker, also on indulgence, I echo the words of the Prime Minister on the fourth anniversary of the former Prime Minister's historic apology. Yes it certainly was the high point of the Rudd prime ministership and arguably it has been the high point of the current government. I want to cite, if I may, the words of the then Prime Minister, who said on that important day: … unless the great symbolism of reconciliation is accompanied by an even greater substance, it is little more than a clanging gong. I think what Mr Rudd said on that day is very important and we should remember it. I do not think we should remember that day in a spirit of self-congratulation; we should remember it in a spirit of consciousness of the magnitude of the task yet to be achieved. We have to get the children to school, we have to get the adults to work, we have to ensure that there are police in remote and other Indigenous communities so that the ordinary laws of the land apply. Yes House symbolic change does matter; yes constitutional recognition is a mission as yet unaccomplished for our country. But, in the end, it is practical change that the Aboriginal life people of this country need and want, and that is the task to which we should dedicate ourselves. Reference to Main Committee",105

63,Ms GILLARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," I inform the House that the Minister for Veterans Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC will be absent from question time this week as he is overseas for commemorations associated with the 70th anniversary of the fall of Singapore. The Minister for Defence will answer questions in relation to defence science and personnel, veterans' affairs and the Centenary of ANZAC and the Minister for Health will answer questions in relation to Indigenous Health on his behalf. NA Carbon Pricing",106
64,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I refer the Prime Minister, to whom this question is directed, to the government's own Treasury modelling that predicts that output in Australia's aluminium industry, which sustains some 10,000 families, will decrease by 61.7 per cent because of the carbon tax. Why is the Prime Minister introducing the world's biggest carbon tax when the government's own advice shows that it will destroy an industry, cost jobs and hurt struggling communities?",106
65,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I had the opportunity earlier today to meet with some workers from Alcoa, who of course represented hundreds of others. I did that in association with their local members-with the members for Corio and Corangamite. Interestingly, those workers did not ask me the question that the Leader of the Opposition has posed today, because Day they understand what is driving change in the business that they work for. They understand with a great degree of sophistication what is driving change in the business that they work for. They understand that the high Australian dollar is making a big difference to their business-there is a big pressure on their shoulders. They understand, too, that we are seeing low prices around the world for aluminium. They understand, as well, that our economy generally is in a very different condition from the nations of Europe. Indeed, they volunteered that to me. Compared with the Leader of the Opposition's fear mongering",106
66,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My question was about the government's deliberate policy to reduce output by 61.7 per cent in this industry-a deliberate policy of the government. She should be directly relevant to that question.",106
67,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I could rule that comment out of order because of the imputation and argument inherent in the use of the word 'deliberate', but I will not. I ask the Prime Minister to focus on the specifics of the question.",106
68,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Whether you are referring to it as an imputation or not, the assertion in the Leader of the Opposition's point of order is wholly wrong and could not be further from the truth.

72,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And that includes the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition.,107

74,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will leave the House for one hour under the provisions of standing order 94(a). I have said that the Prime Minister will be heard in silence for the balance of her answer and she will be. Ms Julie Bishop interjecting,107
75,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No. The deputy leader will leave the chamber in accordance with the standing orders. The member for Curtin then left the chamber.  of order. I ask you to reconsider the ruling you have just made in asking the deputy leader to remove herself from the chamber. While you asked this side of the House to remain silent, you also asked the Prime Minister to be directly relevant to the question and she was defying your ruling.",107
76,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I asked the deputy leader to leave for one hour under the provisions of standing order 94(a) and she has. The Prime Minister has the call.,107
77,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The statistic I was seeking to share with the House was that the average impact of the carbon price on the aluminium sector is the equivalent of a one cent increase in the exchange rate with the US. I think that gives a sense of the order magnitude here. What is pressing on the aluminium industry is having an exchange rate which is well above parity with the US dollar, when of course their business models were factored at a different parity price with the US at a different time in Australia's history when we routinely traded far below the US dollar. That is the truth and the Leader of the Opposition should understand- (Time expired) Queensland and New South Wales Floods",107
78,Ms SAFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Prime Minister, how is the Commonwealth assisting communities impacted by recent flooding in New South Wales and Queensland?",107
79,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Page for her question. I know that, unfortunately, she and the community that she represents are no strangers to dealing with flood situations. I have had the opportunity to talk to the member and to members of her community about flooding there in the past. On the weekend, I travelled to the townships of St George and Roma in Queensland and Moree in New South Wales to visit communities affected by flooding. I was accompanied by the members for Maranoa and Parkes and by Senator Barnaby Joyce for different pieces of the journey. Whilst we travelled, we had the opportunity to meet with people directly affected by flooding. Flood waters in Queensland were starting to subside but of course there were people who were returning to their homes and seeing the damage that had been done. Many of the people that we met had actually seen their homes on this occasion flooded for the second time, and some of them for the third time. It is understandable that when people of have to turn around and turn around, and sometimes turn around again, to restore their homes to liveability after a flood, it strains patience and it strains people's emotional reserves. We saw that on display in these communities. In Moree, to take just one example, I visited with Kent and Julie Harris, who invited me into their home. It was Julie's birthday and she said the best present she was going to get was to sleep in her own bed after being away from her home for 10 days. As we have seen in other natural disasters, on this occasion we saw the best of Australia on display-the magnificent response of the volunteers, the SES and the emergency personnel, and of course the ADF, who were out in these communities helping with the clean-up. We also have Centrelink staff out there helping people get payments processed. We are in the course of dispersing more than $5 billion to Queensland for flood recovery from the natural disasters that we lived through last year. In this set of floods, we are making assistance available. In the Australian government disaster recovery payments, we have already granted 12,473 claims that have totalled $14 million so far. The journey of recovery for these communities will continue and we will be with them as they go through that journey of recovery. Many of them also raised with me the need to look at flood mitigation and of course we will be working with those communities and the Queensland government on that. For now, our thoughts are with them as they get about cleaning up the community and their homes, and restarting their lives. Carbon Pricing",107
80,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is also to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the fact that Queensland Alumina's parent company is reviewing its Gladstone based operations and to the comments from its chairman, John Hannagan, who said, 'Queensland Alumina will be the highest taxed industry in the country and that is a significant impact on our operations.' Why is the Prime Minister proceeding with a carbon tax when the government's own modelling says that it will reduce the industry's output by 61.7 per cent?",108
81,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Let me point out the following facts. The Leader of the National Party is misusing the modelling completely. He is ascribing a cause and effect here which the modelling does not-a continuing part of the opposition's fear campaign on carbon pricing. The one thing you always know about the opposition when it comes to carbon pricing is that whatever they say is not the truth. Let us just look at the scoreboard. They said the coal industry would be shut down. Not true. They said Whyalla would be wiped off the map. Not true. The Leader of the Opposition wrote to the Auditor-General disputing the government's claims that nine out of 10 households were receiving assistance and he was repudiated because his approach was not true. At every stage in every way, the Leader of the Opposition and the team he leads have been out there spreading fear and not telling people the truth. It is time that the Leader of the National Party and the opposition generally actually respected working people enough to say to them what the truth is for their industry. The truth for this industry is that we are seeing a high Australian dollar with all of the pressure that that brings to bear. The Manager of Opposition Business might be bored by that, but the one million Australians who work in manufacturing are not bored by it. They understand the pressure of the high Australian dollar on their shoulders. Those working in the aluminium industry also understand that we have seen the price of aluminium fall by over 20 per cent since May last year. We are seeing reduced global prices. Those who work in the aluminium industry",108
82,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the government's own modelling shows a 61.7 per cent reduction in output in this industry",109
83,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The Prime Minister will direct herself to the substance of the question.,109
84,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In response to both the original question I was asked and what the Leader of the Opposition has just said, let me use the words of Alcoa. They would know about aluminium, you would think. Their review of their own industry, their own business, says: The review has not been prompted by a future price on carbon. The present situation is a result of low metal prices, a high Australian dollar and input costs. That is what Alcoa have said. No amount of twisting and turning and spreading of fear actually changes those facts. To the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party, who are keen to quote modelling here, let me quote this part of the modelling: For aluminium to 2020 output is expected to remain at about current levels with or without a carbon price. Try telling Australians the truth.",109
85,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister has concluded. Is there a supplementary question?,109
86,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that the Prime Minister table the statement from Alcoa",109
87,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The leader does not have the call. Is the leader asking a supplementary question?,109
88,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I seek the tabling, as I am entitled to do, of the Alcoa document from which she was reading, which shows that the carbon tax is an issue in the problems of their plant at Point Henry.",109
89,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I was relying on notes which have confidential sections. If the Leader of the Opposition has not done his homework on this issue before coming into this parliament, that is not my problem. He pretends to care about jobs and he cannot even be bothered about reading Alcoa's statement before he comes in, apparently.",109
90,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister is relying on confidential notes.,109
91,Mr Truss,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table the Treasury modelling on carbon pricing. It makes it absolutely clear that there will be a reduction",109
92,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the National Party will resume his seat immediately. He has sought leave. I am asking if leave is granted. Leave is not granted. Economy,109
93,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. How do the recent events in Greece and the Eurozone highlight the importance of managing the Australian economy and returning our budget to surplus in the interests of working people?,109
94,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Corangamite for his question and I also thank him and the member for Corio for meeting with me and other ministers this morning so that we could receive the workers from Alcoa. I wonder what they would make of the political use of their potential job losses by the opposition when they understand what is happening in their industry. I think they would find that a fairly dismaying tactic from the opposition. The member for Corangamite has asked me about circumstances in the global economy, and I expect to hear interjections from the opposition because, as we know, they could not care less about circumstances in either the global economy or the Australian economy. But on this side of the parliament we have been monitoring the situation in Europe and we welcome the fact that the Greek parliament passed a package of restrictive budget measures today. It was not easy, but it had to be done. That is one step in what is a long journey of recovery for the economy of Greece, but it was a necessary step. Unless they took that step, the circumstances of a disorderly default could have been upon Greece with all of the implications for that nation and for the Eurozone and Europe in general. This highlights the ongoing financial problems we are seeing in Europe which are reflected by credit downgrades last month to nine of the Euro area's 17 members. The ultimate proof of all of the problems there is that 23 per cent of men and women are unemployed. When Australians look at those scenes from Greece, including some of the violence that happened outside the parliament, they can rest assured that the economy of Australia is in a very different shape. We have low unemployment; we have created 700,000 since coming to office. In the same period the US economy has lost six million jobs. If the US had been creating jobs at the same rate as us, 15 million more Americans would be employed today. We have low debt-less than one-tenth of the debt of other major advanced economiesand we have a clear plan to return the budget to surplus in 2012-13, exactly as promised. That is the right thing to do for an economy growing at trend, it is the right thing to do create space for private sector growth, it is the right signal to send to international markets that Australia is a great place to invest in and it is the right thing to do in managing the economy in the interests of working people, because at the end of the day the purpose of the economy is to serve the interests of working people and particularly give them great job opportunities and the opportunity to start their own business. We are clear on our intentions about the surplus, and that is in very stark contrast to the continuing muddle on the other side of politics. Employment",109
95,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to recently announced job losses at Westpac, the Royal Bank of Scotland, Holden, Toyota, BHP, Reckitt's, Manildra, Norsk, Tomago, Thales, Don and Macquarie Group. Given that ANZ have just announced 1,000 jobs are to go in the next few months, does the Prime Minister now regret referring to these job losses as growing pains?",110
96,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," To the shadow Treasurer I would say: do not verbal me. If he wants to quote one of my speeches then bring it in and quote it in full, because the idea that I have ever exhibited anything other than concern for Australians who have lost their jobs is completely untrue and I am not having the shadow Treasurer come in, as part of the campaign of fear and misrepresentation by the opposition, and pretend that is true. The people who have used workers and their jobs as political playthings in this parliament sit on the opposition front benches. They are very, very happy to walk into a steelmanufacturing business to stand alongside a steelworker while the cameras are rolling to and then, as soon as the cameras have gone, they come into this place and they vote against the future of that industry by voting against the Steel Transformation Plan. They are very, very happy to go and stand in a carmanufacturing plant and look at the cars being made with the very highly skilled workers who make them, but when it comes to being counted in supporting the car industry they stand for a half a billion dollar cutback now and the end of assistance in 2015. They want every worker in the car industry to be out of a job. Of course, we know too that, whilst they pretend to be the friend of small businesses and to care about the people who work in small businesses, in this parliament they voted against tax breaks for small businesses and an instant asset write-off which would have put them into a better position and enabled them to employ people and to continue to generate jobs. They did that because they would prefer to give more money to some of the most profitable mining companies in the world.",110
97,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister will return to the substance of the question.,111
98,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So to the shadow Treasurer I would say that as Prime Minister I have been explaining to the Australian people and the Australian community the nature of the structural change in our economy today. Our economy is strong. The strength of our economy is driving further changes: the strong Aussie dollar, the opportunities that will come in the region of the world in which we live which is continuing to grow. That is bringing changes-painful changes-in parts of the economy and we are working with those sections of the economy and those working people in these days of change, working to increase their skills because that will be so important for the jobs of the future, working to give them the best of technology because they cannot compete if they do not have the NBN, working to get business tax right including tax breaks for small businesses, working with manufacturing through my manufacturing task force and the assistance we are providing industries like the car industry. We will never treat working people with the kind of contempt that is routine for the opposition. (Time expired)",111
99,Mr Hockey,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table the Prime Minister's speech where it actually says that. Leave not granted. Native Title",111
100,Mr CROOK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the long standing Commonwealth offer to compensate states for the bulk of native title compensations, an arrangement which benefits our country and our Indigenous peoples. In particular, I refer to publicly available correspondence from then prime ministers Paul Keating and John Howard to the then WA Premier, Richard Court, committing to 75 per cent of the cost of native title settlements and compensation. I ask the Prime Minister: why are you now reneging on such an important long standing and bipartisan arrangement?",111
101,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for O'Connor for his question. What I would say to him is I learned of Premier Barnett's concern about this matter when I read it on the front page of one of our newspapers. I see Premier Barnett frequently. I am always available to speak to him should he want to speak to me and he has never raised this issue with me personally, not once. Should he choose to do so then, of course, I will have the discussion with him. Economy",111
102,Ms LIVERMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline for the House the importance of supporting jobs and economic growth and returning the budget to surplus?,111
103,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Capricornia for this question, because I think the government understands just how difficult the international economic environment is and you can see that in terms of the pictures that are coming out of Greece as I speak. But the fact is progress does need to be made in Europe and that progress needs to be made despite the fact that whatever happens there will be a very long and painful adjustment in that community. We do feel the impact of these global events particularly in Europe on our own economy and on our budget and we were upfront about that in our mid-year budget update. But here fortunately our economy is seven per cent larger than it was prior to the global financial crisis, because the government acted decisively to support jobs and growth. And, of course, we have seen something like 700,000 jobs created in this country since the government came to power. If those opposite had had their way, Australia would have gone into recession and we would have seen hundreds of thousands of Australians who were unemployed and we would have seen tens of thousands of small businesses hit the wall. But our economic fundamentals here are strong. We have got solid growth, we have got low unemployment, we have got contained inflation, we have got strong public finances and we have got a record pipeline of investment. But our revenues have been hit by these events in Europe and around the world. We have lost something like $140 billion, ripped from government revenues because of global instability. And that would have happened to those opposite had they been in power during this period. And, of course, the budget went into deficit. If they had been here, because of their failure to act they would have seen even bigger deficits. But, given that our economy is now growing at trend, we are absolutely determined to bring our budget back to surplus in 2012-13. We are determined to bring it back and that we deliver it. We have seen over the past week or so the slapstick farce of those opposite as they have, one-byone, walked away from their commitment to bring the budget back to surplus of order. The Treasurer is a serial offender concerning your exhortation to be directly relevant to the question asked. This could not possibly be directly relevant to the question and I ask you to bring the Treasurer back to the question.",112
104,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. I will be the arbiter of what is directly relevant.,112
105,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We are bringing the budget back to surplus. Those opposite have walked away from that commitment and we have found out why: because they have a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line put together by the three stooges over there.,112
106,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Prime Minister with withdraw 'the three stooges'.,112
107,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw-the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow minister for finance and the shadow Treasurer. We have now found out why and how this $70 billion figure got into the public arena-the shadow Treasurer decided to play a trick on the other two stooges, a really difficult trick.",112
108,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Treasurer will withdraw.  withdrawal, you asked the Treasurer to withdraw that same phrase last week. He has now used it twice in his answer to this question. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has been required to leave the chamber. I would ask you to act against the Treasurer. Opposition members: Hear, hear!",112
109,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will not revisit my ruling with respect to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition leaving the chamber but if anyone cares to peruse the Hansard, the reason will be obvious. I have called on the Treasurer to withdraw that term and he has done so. Opposition members: He did it again!",113
110,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the Treasurer used the term again, he will withdraw it.",113
111,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Certainly, Mr Speaker, because we found outOpposition members: Withdraw!",113
112,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw. We found out on the weekend from Laurie Oakes the type of trick that was played by the shadow Treasurer. (Time expired) Budget WYATT ROY (Longman) (14:32): My question is to the Treasurer. Given that Labor has never delivered a surplus in my lifetime and that in his time as Treasurer the government has delivered the four largest budget deficits in Australian history, will Treasurer confirm that, based on forecast surpluses, I will be 110 years old before the debt he has created in just four years has been paid off?",113
113,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for his question because here we have a typical example of what comes from the opposition on a daily basis. What we have is the opposition constantly talking down our economy. Opposition members: No, that's you!",113
114,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is far too much audible conversation and noise in the chamber. The Treasurer will be heard in silence for the balance of this answer and that direction goes to honourable members on both sides.,113
115,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, Mr Speaker, the opposition is constantly talking down our economy by exaggerating the impact of public debt in this country, by repeatedly misrepresenting the budget bottom line.",113
116,Mr Hunt,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,So he'll only be 99!,113
117,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Flinders will leave the chamber under the provision of standing order 94a. I have said that the Treasurer will be heard in silence for the balance of his answer. The member for Flinders was interjecting. The same rule goes to anyone else in the chamber. The member for Flinders then left the chamber.,113
118,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When it comes to public debt, our position is the envy of the world. When it comes to the level of unemployment in this developed economy, our position is the envy of the world. When we look at the investment pipeline, our position is the envy of the world. When we look at our experience during the global financial crisis and the global recession, our position was the the envy of the world. Those opposite are now in a shambles when it comes to fiscal policy. If they were in power, they would blow a $70 billion hole in our budget bottom line. The level of public debt in this country is very low by international standards-less than one-tenth of major advanced economies. We are being held up as a perfect example of what to do by the International Monetary Fund, by the OECD and by the World Bank, yet the opposition come into this House day in, day out and talk down our economy. They know that our revenues have been written down by $140 billion. Despite all of that, because of the application of our very strict fiscal policy, we will be coming back to surplus in 2012-13.",113
119,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,114
120,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The reason they laugh like hyenas is that they know their position is a shambles-a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line before they make any other commitments to the people of Australia before the next election. The Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance spokesman simply cannot make their numbers add up. We have the farcical situation where the shadow Treasurer told Laurie Oakes that he is going to give a figure to the shadow cabinet and, depending which figure it is, he will know who is the leaker on the opposition front bench. I think we know today. He gave Moe over there the $50 billion figure but it was Curly over there he gave the $70 billion figure to. (Time expired) Economy",114
121,Mr ADAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation. How is the government keeping our economy strong and helping Australians make ends meet? Can the minister outline what other opinions have been put forward and how these would impact on working people?,114
122,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Maribyrnong-Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment Workplace Relations) (14:38): I would like to thank the member for his question. In his electorate, courtesy of this government's reform of superannuation, 31,000 of his constituents can expect to increase their superannuation entitlements from nine per cent to 12 per cent. There are three ways in which this government is assisting Australians to deal with the future and making sure that people can make ends meet. The first way is by achieving a surplus, the second way is by supporting jobs and the third way is by having a view about the future and a positive plan for the future. We are achieving surplus. In the last budget",114

129,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When you look at Australia's position compared to the rest of the world and you have a look at the Commonwealth net debt, you will see that we are doing far better. We are at 8.5 per cent. The Canadians are at 36 per cent. The Germans are at 57 per cent. The United Kingdom is at 77 per cent. Italy is at 100 per cent. Our net debt, courtesy of this budget and and this government, is far lower than the debts of other nations. But it is not just about the surplus; we are supporting jobs. That is why we have a manufacturing policy which stands up for the automotive industry.",114
130,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,114
131,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those opposite may laugh, but their policy is to buy a white flag and a European car. We are also standing up for apprenticeships-130,000 new places next year. We are also standing up for industry and jobs by using the mining tax to help provide a tax cut for small business. This is the contrast when we talk about supporting jobs. The difference between Labor and Liberal could be no starker or clearer than when it comes to the mining tax. We want to use the mining tax to lift people's retirement savings. We want to use the mining tax to help small business. They want to use the mining tax to give a multibillion dollar tax break to billionaires. We are the ones who have a plan for the future. We are the ones who are putting forward the National Broadband Network. We are the ones who are investing in innovation. We are the ones who are investing in superannuation. Indeed, we are the ones who are willing to challenge the banks when we do not agree with what they are doing. The member for North Sydney made some comments today. He accused the government of being out of touch with the banks' funding profiles. We on this side note that he is out touch with the funding profiles of working families. Prime Minister  Opposition Business) (14:41): My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister stand by her statement on 28 January that Mr Hodges was advised by the journalists at the Lobby restaurant that Mr Abbott that morning had made a statement in relation to the tent embassy in Canberra?",114
132,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I dealt with these matters earlier. My statements are all on the public record, and I refer the member to them.  Opposition Business) (14:42): Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. As it appears the Prime Minister has stood by the statement in that transcript, can the Prime Minister then explain why last Wednesday David Speers reported: 'Well, I did have Mr Hodges in the office here on the day that we are talking about before the protest had actually happened and he did refer to Tony Abbott's comments.' How was Mr Hodges briefing Mr Speers in the Sky studio before the protest on something the Prime Minister claims he did not yet know?",115
133,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," In answer to the member's question I would say that I have dealt with these questions. I refer him to the statements that I have made. I say to the member who asked the question, as Prime Minister I am responsible for a lot but I am not sure I am responsible for David Speers's statements on Sky TV. Infrastructure",115
134,Mr MURPHY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. Minister, how has the government delivered community of infrastructure while supporting jobs in the national economy, and how has this been received?",115
135,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Grayndler-Leader of of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:43): I thank the member for Reid for his question and his ongoing interest in the economy and jobs. We on this side of the House are determined to ensure that working families enjoy employment and that they enjoy the benefits that come from a job. That is why we acted in the global financial crisis. One of the things we did was create the infrastructure employment program. Last Friday I was in the electorate of Wentworth of at the opening of Rugby League Central, a great new five-star building on the SCG-SFS site, the construction of which created 443 jobs. Not just that but there will be ongoing economic benefit, with some 5,000 young people every year going through, getting access to training and facilities in an interactive relationship, encouraging them to participate in junior rugby league. Under the Indigenous Employment Program operating out of there, we saw the Indigenous All Stars game begin the rugby league season, as it does, engaging with Indigenous people, helping to close the gap not just in a cultural way but also in a very real economic way. I am asked how it has been received. I was amazed that the day after the opening the Leader of the Nationals described it as 'This is just one example of waste.' Those opposite presided over regional rorts, they had an ethanol plant which was never built, they had a cheese factory which went out of business and they had a railway line that burnt down. None of that happened under this government's program. More than 5,000 projects, all extremely positive, all creating jobs have been condemned by those opposite as 'just waste'. Just yesterday I was with the member for Watson at the Back to Belmore game, the first Canterbury home game since 1998, creating not only jobs in the construction and redevelopment of Belmore Oval but also ongoing jobs-young people were selling hotdogs and pies, providing security and doing ongoing construction jobs. Indeed, as a result of our community infrastructure programs more than 700 sportsgrounds right around the country will benefit. Mr MCCormack interjecting",115

137,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is good for jobs, good for employment, good for health outcomes and good for engagement in our community. It is all positive, dismissed by those opposite as 'just waste,' because they just do not get what real positive investment achieves, compared with what they did when they were in office. Prime Minister  Opposition Business) (14:46): My question is to the Prime Minister.

139,Mr ZAPPIA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Minister for Industry and Innovation. How is the government promoting jobs across Australian industry and what are the risks to the government's support?,116
140,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Charlton-Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Minister for Industry and Innovation) (14:48): I thank the member for Makin for his question. It is a fact that Labor always puts jobs and economic growth as a priority in its economic policy settings. It must never be forgotten that Labor managed the economy to support jobs during the global financial crisis and, as a result, our economy is outperforming most industrialised economies. Since we came to office we have, in fact, created 750,000 jobs. This government will continue to manage the economy, to deliver prosperity for all Australians. We have low unemployment, low debt, solid growth, moderate inflation and massive business investment. The government is focused on making the economic circumstances in the future good for business investment and boosting jobs. We are making record investments in skills, education and infrastructure. We are improving productivity, boosting savings, cutting the company tax rate and assisting small business. All of these elements will support jobs growth in the economy. But given the scaremongering by the opposition it is important to point out, mindful of some of the recent announcements, that it is always important not to be talking down the economy but to be pointing to some areas where we also have strong jobs creation in our economy. Last week the job advertisement survey, which is published, and the NAB business survey showed an improvement in the employment outlook, with over 190,000 jobs being advertised each week. When the other side talks down the economy they conveniently ignore a number of very important jobs announcements that have been made by particular companies. What might they include? Woolworths plans to open dozens of new stores this year, which will create more than 10,000 jobs; the investment go-ahead that has been given for the Ichthys LNG project, which will create 4,000 jobs at its peak-four major projects in the Queensland LNG industry that have the potential to create 18,000 direct and indirect jobs; and GlaxoSmithKline's announcement earlier this month of a $60 million investment at its Boronia site, which will create 58 jobs. You have here people on the other side who undermine confidence. They talk down the economy, they want to directly slash jobs, with their $70 billion in budget cuts. Those on that side want to put up company tax; on this side, we want to bring down company tax. We want to stimulate investment. Those on that side want to destroy the auto industry and destroy the steel industry; on this side, we support people's jobs. (Time expired) Prime Minister  Opposition Business) (14:51): My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to this statement that she made: 'At no point did Mr Hodges say to Ms Sattler that Mr Abbott had suggested that the tent embassy be torn down or removed in any way,' and also to this statement of Ms Sattler yesterday and repeated again this morning: ' Mr Hodges told me before the riot ""Tony Abbott made a comment that the tent embassy should not exist anymore. It should be moved on."" ' How does the Prime Minister explain the contradiction between her statement and Ms Sattler's?",116
141,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," In answer to the member's question, he would be aware that, in this House, I have answered these questions before. I have referred to Ms Sattler's statements before. Indeed, I read two of her statements onto the public record. I would say to the opposition generally that of course we know what this is about. They have nothing to say about jobs of order going to relevance. In three direct questions containing no argument the Prime Minister has been asked specific questions about her statements and I would ask you to direct her to be directly relevant to the question she was asked.",117

I was directly relevant to the question when I referred the member who asked the question to questions asked of me in this place last week, where I referred to statements by Kim Sattler and read them on to the Hansard.

151,Ms PARKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Health, Ms Plibersek. Will the minister update the House on the government's plans to make the to private health insurance rebate fairer for Australians?",118
152,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Fremantle for her very important question. Many Australians benefit at different times in their lives from benefits like the family tax benefit to help raise their kids, Austudy when they are studying and perhaps the age pension as they age. What these benefits have in common is that they are means tested so that the greatest benefit goes to the people who need them most. The private health insurance rebate acts in of exactly the opposite way. The greatest benefit goes to the people who need the least help. Take the example of a bank teller who is on $50,000 a year, a bank executive who is on $500,000 a year and the head of the bank who is on $5 million a year. They each get exactly the same rebate if they have the same private health insurance. What is even worse is that the people on the higher income are likely to have more expensive insurance, so they are going to get a greater benefit from taxpayers. If the teller cannot afford private health insurance on $50,000 a year then her tax dollars subsidise the private health insurance rebate of the person earning $500,000 and the person earning $5 million a year. The total cost of this private health insurance rebate is about $5 billion a year, and if we do not make these modest changes that leave around 20 million Australians unaffected we will see the cost of this private health insurance rebate blow out by $100 billion over the next 40 years.",118

154,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, $100 billion over the next 40 years. Have a look at the Intergenerational report, Joe-you should have a look at it. Other ministers have spoken about what is happening in Europe and what is happening in Greece and, concerned as we are about what is happening in Europe, and Greece in particular, there is a lesson to be drawn from what happens if governments are too timid to rein in runaway spending in areas like this. We need to make sure that every health dollar counts and that every health dollar matters, and we can spend those health dollars doing things like we are doing in the member for Fremantle's electorate, like creating more training places for nurses.",118

We have seen a lot of slip-sliding from those opposite. They will not commit to changing this if they come back to government. They will not commit to repealing the means testing because they cannot afford it. (Time expired) Private Health Insurance",119

When can the Australian people expect the Prime Minister to stand by any of her ironclad commitments?",119
168,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for his question because it enables me to explain something he clearly has missed. There are elections in Australia generally once every three years. We had one in 2007 and we had one in 2010. I am surprised the member does not have any recollection of the 2010 election; it is the where he was scrambling for a new seat. In that election we took to the Australian people a policy on private health insurance, and the legislation that is in this parliament reflects that policy which we took to the Australian people. Let us not have any of this absurdity from the opposition. We, in 2010, took to the Australian people a very simple proposition about fairness. We said with the growth in health costs and with the need to keep finding more money to meet the needs of health care in our nation as our population ages and as health treatments get more sophisticated-which is a great thing, but they also get more expensive-that we would need to make sure",119
169,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister will resume her seat as there is a point of order. Dr Southcott: Mr Speaker, a point of order on relevance: it relates Prime Minister's responsibility. This was a promise at the 2007 election and Labor broke that in the 2009",120

180,Ms HALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and the Minister for Indigenous Reform. Minister, could you outline to the House how the government is building a strong economy to deliver for families?",121
181,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (15:03): I thank the member for Shortland for her question and also for her advocacy for working families, which is certainly very much appreciated in her electorate. It is the case that this government will deliver a surplus so that we can continue to deliver for working families. We understand how important it is to make sure that we help families balance their household budgets. That is why this government said that we would increase support for childcare costs, and we have delivered it. It is why this government said we would help working families with the cost of education, and we have delivered it and we are now extending that assistance to help with the cost of school uniforms. It is why this government has decided and is delivering increased help for those families who have older teenagers-never done by those opposite, but delivered this year from 1 obligation. January to those families with teenagers aged between 16 and 19 years who are still at school. Those families are getting up to $4,200 extra a year as a result of this Labor government that is determined to help working families and make sure their children get a great education. And it was this Labor government that decided to introduce the country's first national Paid Parental Leave Scheme. It is this government that has made sure that families do not have to make difficult choice that they had to make under the previous government about whether or not they had to go back to work or could spend time with their newborn baby. What we have seen from those opposite is, first of all, that they are not any longer determined to deliver a surplus. What we saw from the Leader of the Opposition yesterday is that he is still determined to spend $4.5 billion a year on his version of paid parental leave and at the same time whack a great big new tax on companies to pay for it. That is what this Leader of the Opposition is all about-whacking at a great big new tax on companies to find $4.5 billion, and not deliver a surplus. And while he is at it he is going to take money out of the pockets of pensioners and families to help cover the $7 billion black hole.",121
182,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister will be directly relevant. The call is now given to the honourable member for Gilmore. Private Health Insurance Mrs GASH (Gilmore) (15:06): My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to her own statements with respect to the private health insurance rebate: If I were minister for health in an elected government, it would be my duty to implement lock, stock and barrel … exactly what we had promised in the election campaign. That is your And, 'When I make a commitment I actually intend to keep it.' Will the Prime Minister guarantee that there will be no more changes to the means test for private health insurance under this government that she leads?",121
183,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The member for Gilmore is obviously referring to a statement made before the 2007 election. I suggest she refer to statements made before the 2010 election. If the member for Gilmore is saying that people in this parliament need to be judged against their 2007 statements, she was led into that election by then Prime Minister John Howard, who said: A re-elected Coalition government will establish the world's most comprehensive emissions trading scheme in Australia, commencing no later than 2012. The scheme will be the primary mechanism for reducing Australia's emissions order relating to relevance: the Prime Minister was asked about her specific, ironclad guarantees. She was not asked about anybody else's statements. She can hardly be relevant unless she answers about her own promises to",121
184,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member will resume his seat. The Prime Minister will be directly relevant to the question.,122
185,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My point is that, in 2012, the Liberal Party is on the run from John Howard. In 2012, the Liberal Party is stuck five years in the past. We are dealing with the circumstances of today. The circumstances of today require us, in the interests of fairness, to say to people who earn more money in our nation-$300,000, $350,000, $500,000, $1,000,000 a year-that they do not need their private health insurance subsidised by people who work part time, by people who work casually or by apprentices who earn $15,000, $20,000, $30,000, $40,000 or $50,000 a year. That is what we stand for as a Labor government. That is what we brought to this parliament and that is what we are determined to get through. NA Prime Minister",122
186,Mr ABBOTT,MOTIONS," Mr Speaker, I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Warringah moving immediately: That this House calls on the Prime Minister to explain why she has broken yet another commitment to the Australian people when she said that Labor was committed to maintaining the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate and in particular why: (1) the Prime Minister is forcing six million customers to drop or downgrade their private health insurance cover by forcing up premium costs; (2) in the face of rising cost of living pressures, the Prime Minister is adding over 10 per cent to the cost of premiums; (3) the Prime Minister is not telling the truth when she says that this is about targeting rich people when half of all people with private health insurance earn less than $50,000 per year and over three million earn less than $35,000 per year; (4) the Prime Minister is pretending that cuts to the private health insurance rebate will be good for the public health system when it will mean over 845,000 new procedures will be forced onto public hospital waiting lists that are already under pressure at a cost of $3.8 billion; and (5) the Prime Minister is playing the class war card in a desperate attempt to fix Budget black holes brought about by waste and mismanagement. Standing orders must be suspended because nothing is more important than securing the integrity of government and nothing is more important than protecting Australian families from yet another Gillard government rip-off. This is a government, and this is a Prime Minister, which has broken commitment after commitment, and now another commitment is going down the drain. This is why standing orders have to be suspended. We have had a string of them. We have had the broken promise to the member for Denison and we have had the broken promise on gay marriage. We have had, notoriously, the broken promise on the carbon tax and now we have-this is why standing orders must be suspended-the broken promise on private health insurance. The former Prime Minister wrote just before the 2007 election: Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates. This is why standing orders must be suspended. The former Minister for Health and Ageing, before the 2007 election, said on many occasions: Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing private health insurance rebates. This is why standing orders must be suspended. Finally, the Prime Minister herself has said: Your correspondent should have no concern that Labor will erodemark that wordor abolish the 30 per cent rebate on private insurance. Labor is committed to the maintenance of this rebate and I have given an ironclad guarantee of this on a number of occasions. This is why standing orders need to be suspended. What is her excuse? Her excuse is, 'Oh, there was an election.' What she is trying to avoid is the fact that the government tried to break this commitment almost as soon as it was elected. This is why standing orders need to be suspended now. In the last parliament there were some courageous Independents in the Senate who kept the government honest. I say-and this is why standing orders should be suspended-let the Independents in this parliament be just as honest as the Independents in the last parliament. That is the job of Independent members of parliament-to keep the government honest, not to allow the government to be dishonest. On the subject of Independents, I have a quote here describing the means testing of the private health insurance rebate as 'one of the most retrograde pieces of legislation that I have ever seen'. You might recognise that statement, Mr Speaker, because it is a statement of yours. This is why it is so important that standing orders should be suspended-so that the parliament can debate the importance of keeping governments honest and keeping families decently, not abusing them with yet another Gillard government rip-off. Standing orders ought to be suspended because the forgotten families of Australia have already suffered abundantly at the hands of this government. Look at the way prices have gone up since late 2007: power prices up 50 per cent, gas prices up 29 per cent, water prices up 46 per cent, health costs up 20 per cent, education costs up 24 per cent, rent 21 per cent, and we all know that interest rate rises under this government-and they are happening again-have added hundreds of dollars a health month to the cost of mortgage repayments. And the carbon tax is coming. We all know the carbon tax is coming and that it will do such terrible damage to the families and industries of this country. And now yet another hit on the forgotten families of Australia. This is why standing orders must be suspended. Two-and-a-half million people, who should have been able to believe this Prime Minister and this government, are to be ripped off. This parliament, and you included, Mr Speaker, has a heavy responsibility to keep this government honest. Every single member of this parliament has a responsibility to keep this government honest, to stop the 10 per cent rise in premiums that will take place if this goes through, to stop the hit on 3½ million people earning $35,000 a year or less, to stop the hit on the public hospital system that will have to do 845,000 more procedures as people abandon their private health insurance. It is a $3.8 billion hit on the public hospital system as a result of this Prime Minister's health tax. This is why standing orders need to be suspended. We heard the Minister for Health in question time today talking about superclinics and nurses. Not a single dollar is going to be invested in the public health system as a result of this change. The reason why this government is slugging the families of Australia is that it will not tackle its own waste, because it is chronically incapable of tackling the waste, the mismanagement and the extravagance for which it has become a notorious byword. This is all about 'bodgying up' a surplus. That is what it is about. It is not about health. It is making up for the repeated waste, incompetence and dishonesty of this government. That is what it is all about. What is at the heart of so much of what the government do? They hate people to succeed. That is why standing orders must be suspended. They hate success. They do not like people to succeed and, if people do succeed, they hit them. They hit them with the baby bonus means test that they promised was never going to happen but which happened. They hit them with the family tax benefit means test, which they said would never happen but which happened. They are hitting them, or about to hit them, with cuts to private schools. Mark my words; this is the next hit on the aspirational classes of Australia and it is coming like a steam train from this fundamentally dishonest and incompetent government. Today-and this is why standing orders must be suspended-it is the private health insurance rebate promise that they are breaking. The politics of envy, the politics of the class war, belong back in the 1970s and the 1980s. Isn't it interesting that it should trotted out again by this Prime Minister who, let's face it, when she is under pressure, goes back to her days as convenor of the Socialist Forum, the old Australian union of activists? She cannot help herself. That is what she comes out with whenever she is under pressure. Make no mistake about this: this is just the beginning of the assault on private health insurance. This is just another foretaste of the assault on aspiration, of the assault on people who want to get ahead, that we will see from this government. This attack on the universality of the private health insurance rebate foreshadows-if the government's logic is to be believed-an attack on the universality of Medicare. That is what they will be calling 'middle class welfare' next. I predict that this Prime Minister will at some stage in the next few days come to the dispatch box and say, 'There will be no further changes to private health insurance under the government I lead.' She will be a liar if she says that. (Time expired)",122
187,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,Is the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition seconded?,124
188,Mr DUTTON,MOTIONS," I second this motion. If anybody needed any reassurance that this government is built on a lie, then they should look no further than this latest betrayal of the Australian people. This government went to the 2007 election saying to the Australian people that under no circumstances would it introduce this change. In question time today, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health tried to say to us that somehow they sought a mandate in 2010 for this change of position. But have a look at the time line and you get an understanding of the depth of betrayal that this government has undertaken on the Australian people. This is a government that in February be 2009 said to the Australian people that this rebate was not going to be modified at all. That was before the 2010 election, Minister Plibersek. This was not a mandate that you sought at the 2010 election. You went with a lie to the Australian people in the 2007 election and you betrayed that by the time of February, March, April and May of 2009. This is a government that did not seek a mandate for a change of policy in 2010. We should put a stop to that lie and that latest betrayal right here and right now.",124
189,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,Order! I am uncomfortable with the use of the term 'lie'. The honourable member would assist the chair if he withdrew it.,125
190,Mr DUTTON,MOTIONS,"I withdraw, Mr Speaker. Their record speaks for itself. This is a Prime Minister who, as we said in question time today, made a commitment to the Australian people that this change-this so-called reform-would not be introduced. This is a government which has tried to portray private health insurance in this country as some sort of playground for the rich. When you look at the facts, however, nothing could be further from the truth. We know that in this country almost half the population has private health insurance. We know that, of those people, about five million are on incomes of less than $50,000 per annum. We know that a million people who have private health insurance are on incomes of less than $25,000 per year. These are people who will be affected by these changes. This government goes around-and of course you cannot rely on any figures that they put into the public debate-saying that, of the 11 million Australians who have private health insurance, about 30,000 will drop out as a result of this change. Does anybody believe for a moment, knowing the track record of this government, that those numbers will hold up? You are going to rip $2 billion-or $2.4 billion, depending on their estimates-out of private health insurance in this country and somehow only 30,000 out of the 11 million people with private health insurance are going to withdraw. It is an absolute nonsense and I do not think anybody should believe those figures. The government's own insurer, Medibank, estimates that it alone will lose many thousands more than that figure of 30,000. HBF, the biggest provider in Western Australia, say that, just in WA, 208,000 people-or 23 per cent of their membersstand to lose all or part of their rebates. These people are not rich. These are people who are struggling with all of the cost-ofliving pressures which have been heaped on them by the Labor government over the last four years. So, yes, this government has been coming into this place telling untruths about the figures-about how much impact there will be on the private health insurers and on those people with private health insurance in this country. The other issue people need to be made aware of is that, when people flee private health insurance or when they downgrade their cover, those people are going to end up in the public system. We have a universal system in this country. People can turn up to a public hospital without charge to themselves-the taxpayer picks up the bill. Those people coming out of the private health system will put extra pressure on the public system. The people who are already waiting hours and hours in emergency departments right now will know that that situation is only going to get worse under this Prime Minister. I do not think that this government can be believed about the impact of this change over the short term, let alone the longer term. I think that is why standing orders need to be suspended-because this Prime Minister needs to come into this place and explain to the Australian people why she misled them at the last election and why she has continued to mislead them every day since. (Time expired)",125
191,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,"I would remind the member, for next time, that he ought to more closely address the actual motion before the chair.",126
192,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (15:25): The motion before the chair is yet again for a suspension of standing orders-the 38th time in the 43rd parliament that we have had question time disrupted in order to hear those opposite essentially have a dummy spit about the fact that they are still on that side of the House. Ever since August 2010 we have had the longest dummy spit in Australian political history. We should not suspend standing orders to accommodate such a dummy spit. We have important business before the House. In total, more than 10 question times have now been lost as a result of these suspension motions. Time after time, those opposite have moved these suspension motions without building any case whatsoever. In this particular case, the PHI legislation is actually before the parliament. So what they are saying is, 'Suspend standing orders and stop the debate on private health insurance so we can have a debate on private health insurance.' How absurd. For that reason alone we should reject this motion to suspend standing orders. The Leader of the Opposition spoke about class war. This is a guy who has declared class war on working families on behalf of Clive Palmer and Gina Rinehart. This is an opposition which comes in here day after day to defend the entrenchment of privilege rather than promote the enhancement of opportunity. Day after day, issue after issue, you can see it. It comes from their guts-and I will come back to that term later. In their guts, they defend the entrenchment of privilege-because it is all about who they are, where they have come from and where they want to stay. They have a born-to-rule attitude, which is why we see these dummy spits time after time-always defending the top end of town. I am not surprised they want to suspend standing orders rather than have question time. No matter what issue you look at, they are out of touch. Look at the issue of the banks. The shadow Treasurer had an absolute shocker last week and I would have thought it had to get better this week. But today he said, 'If the banks are under funding pressures, if you look at their funding profiles and if you speak to people in markets, you can get a feel for what is happening.' That is what he is saying today. He is out there defending the banks for putting up their interest rates last Friday. Over the weekend he was complaining, but today we get the opposite. That is the position that they have had. The shadow Treasurer, the shadow finance minister and the Leader of the Opposition have been all over the shop on all of these issues. And yet the Leader of the Opposition has the hide to come in here and speak about honesty and trust. Indeed the suspension motion they have moved here today would go to that. This is a guy who said, in a speech to the Sydney Institute: One man's lie is another's judgment call. That was his position on 5 June 2007. In September 2003, he told the Herald: … there are some things the public has no particular right to know. Of course we know that in May 2010 he said this: … sometimes in the heat of discussion you go a little bit further than you would if it was an absolutely calm, considered, prepared, scripted remark. Which is one of the reasons why the statements that need to be taken absolutely as gospel truth are those carefully prepared, scripted remarks. That is what he had to say, in his own words-do not believe him unless it is written down, unless it is scripted. There are some big debates before the nation-there is one about a return to surplus, and one about fairness and opportunity. Those opposite, who speak about truth, said during this debate that 3.5 million Australians earning under $35,000 a year would be impacted by the legislation before the House. They know that is not true.",126
193,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,Order! I counsel the Leader of the House that the question before the chair is that the motion be agreed to. I draw him back to the motion to suspend the standing and sessional orders.,127
194,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,"Indeed, Mr SPEAKER the reason we should not suspend standing orders is that in order to receive no support as result of these changes a single person has to earn above $124,000 a year and for a couple it is $248,000 a year. If we do not have a suspension of standing orders, we can get all those facts out there, with the scare campaign ending. Those opposite do not want members of this House to have an opportunity to debate these issues in full, in substance, because they always lose debates of substance. Those opposite are just reduced to saying no to absolutely everythingunless it is something to help the big end of town, in which case they say, 'Yes; how high can we jump?' That is the position they take. We have a debate here about manufacturing. There were two or three questions about the economy today before those opposite got back in the gutter, which is the place they are most comfortable. The facts are that between 1996 and 2007, under the former government, manufacturing's share of GDP fell from 11.5 to 9.4 per centnearly a fifth. Its share of total employment declined from 12.8 to 9.9 per cent-from one in eight workers to less than one in 10 workers. They would have you believe that companies seeking to go offshore is a new phenomenon, but the former Prime Minister was happy to open the offshoring of Australian jobs. At the opening of BlueScope Steel in Vietnam, on 20 November 2006, he said it was a happy occasion, he hoped the company did well and hoped it made lots of money, paid taxes, as it would, repatriated money back to Australia and employed lots of Vietnamese people. That is what he had to say when he was opening a facility that would take jobs offshore from Australia.",127
195,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,The Leader of the House will return to the substance of the motion.,127
196,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,"Mr Speaker, those opposite want to suspend standing orders so they can have more yelling, more rhetoricbut not debate of issues of substance. They oppose absolutely everything, which is why they engage in this behaviour. Because of their $70 billion black hole, they will not even repeal the means test. They say we should suspend standing orders to debate these issues but they will not even regard the issue as significant enough to commit to repeal the changes that are in the legislation. They cannot, because if they did that the $70 billion black hole would just get bigger and bigger and bigger. That is why they are reduced to this negativity. That is why the opposition leader defined himself, when he became opposition leader, as follows: The job of the opposition is to be an alternative, not an echo; to provide a choice, not a copy. I thought to myself that that was a bit familiar. I know I have likened the Leader of the Opposition to Barry Goldwater, and Barry Goldwater said this when he announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination: I will offer a choice, not an echo. That was on 3 January 1964. The Leader of the Opposition has modelled himself on Barry Goldwater, which is why 'In your guts, you know he's nuts' is so appropriate for this Leader of the Opposition.",127

Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011 Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge-Fringe Benefits) Bill 2011 Second Reading Cognate debate. Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Mr VAN MANEN (Forde) (15:51): In continuing on from my remarks prior to question time, I note that this group of bills is another example of the government breaking its word given to the Australian people. I was talking before about some of the concerns we have locally about the pressures that are already on our existing health system and how these measures are going to make that situation worse. In the Courier-Mail last week there was an article about parents of children with ear, nose and throat problems and the concern that they are being told to consider paying for private treatment. This is despite living in one of the more disadvantaged areas of South-East Queensland. The article notes: Doctors in Logan, south of Brisbane are at a loss to know where to refer children which have ear, nose and throat conditions for public treatment. The article states that Logan Hospital, which is located in my electorate, has approximately 1,000 children waiting to be seen. What kind of a place are we creating for our children, particularly those from disadvantaged families who cannot afford private health insurance? And this legislation is not going to make that problem better. It is going to make it worse because it is going to BILLS push more people into the public sector. Private hospitals currently treat 40 per cent of all patients in Australia. Medibank Private has predicted that some 37,000 members alone will drop their cover and 92,500 will downgrade. Over the next five years it is Bill 2011 expected that approximately 1.6 million will drop cover and 4.3 million will downgrade. How is the public system, which is already severely strained, going to cope with the increased costs and pressure? At the end of the day, this becomes a blatant, cost-shifting exercise to transfer responsibility from the Commonwealth to the state public health systems. The Queensland government has long been struggling to provide sufficient support for their health services, and shifting the responsibility onto the existing resources and staff will result in complete disarray and possibly even tragedy. We do not want to see in hospitals an increase in the incidence of people not getting proper treatment or being left in hallways as they wait for beds. These are all things which could possibly be made worse in light of the current proposed legislation. In addition, upward pressure on insurance premiums will force people to reduce their levels of cover. For example, in an article in the Albert & Logan News, dated 6 October 2010, a mother was quoted because she had spent some nine hours in the emergency room at Logan Hospital after suffering a miscarriage. She was angry and frustrated that nobody had sought to provide her with any assistance during that time. More recently, there was the headline in the Sunday Mail 'Left lying in own blood, patient claims' about failure to get treatment at Logan Hospital. All in all these are current examples of a system under enormous pressure. That pressure is only going to be made worse by pushing people from the private sector into the public sector. In this debate it is important to note that our doctors, our nurses and associated health workers are going to bear the brunt of people's frustration, angst and anger. Yet these are the very people who already seek to do such a wonderful job in our community. It is well known that they work long hours under constant pressure. We should be doing everything we can to ease those pressures, not make them worse. The federal Labor government promised that we would not face this legislation but, as we have discussed numerous times, they have broken this promise again and again. This is the third time that this has been debated in this House. Labor always purport to seek to help the most disadvantaged and underprivileged, yet over time we see the reverse. Their very policies actually hurt those that are most disadvantaged and underprivileged, not help them. Given the cost of private health insurance if premiums go up, the many low-income earners who do have their own private health insurance will bear the burden of the increased premiums because of fewer people being insured privately. I would like to highlight this point by quoting from an email that was recently send to me by one of my constituents. The email reads: We are very concerned about the proposed means testing of the private health rebate. As it is, the funds have all been regularly increasing their costs and causing us to wonder how much longer we can keep up the payments. Although we will not be immediately affected as our income is below the levels reported, we most certainly are aware that there will be a mass exodus from the funds which will force them to increase their costs further in order to compensate, this will have a further flow on effect and will force us out of private health insurance, to which we have contributed for 35 years. We note that Labor promised not to touch the subsidy before the 2007 election and regard this as another broken promise. The email went on to say that they found the government's plot to sell the changes to private health insurance, as stopping the poor from subsidising the rich, as both insulting and dishonest. The authors of this email went to the effort of making some comparisons to support their view, and I would like to note some of their observations, an area that I touched on earlier. If you are earning an income of about $30,000 per annum you are paying about $5,000 per annum in tax and Medicare levy. If you are earning about $60,000 a year, you are paying about $12½ thousand and if you are earning about $90,000 a year, you are paying about $22½ thousand. So you can see that as your income increases you are contributing significantly more to general taxation and also through the Medicare levy. When you have a look in detail at the argument that the poor are subsidising the rich, you see that does not hold any water. It is time this government's ideological bent, of saying that the rich need to pay more for this and more for that and that the poor and needy are suffering, was put away. The politics of envy does no good as to the future of this nation whatsoever. We in the opposition oppose these measures for very good reasons, as I have outlined. Whilst the government seeks to promote this as a win-win solution, I see it as nothing more than a lose-lose one for the individuals and families living in my electorate and those around the country. We oppose this legislation.",130
222,Mr SYMON,DOCUMENTS," I speak in support of the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011, Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2011 and Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge-Fringe Benefits) Bill 2011. Together, these bills proportionally lower the private health insurance rebate for those in higher income tiers and increase the Medicare levy surcharge for those on higher incomes who elect not to purchase private health insurance. Through these measures, the government is seeking to rebalance a range of policies supporting the private health insurance industry, as promised and taken to the 2010 election-a fact that many people in this chamber just recently have chosen to neglect. These new means-testing arrangements will make the private health insurance rebate fairer. At the moment, more than 45 per cent of the Australian population is covered by some form of private hospital cover. This figure is at a 10-year high. In total, over 10.4 million Australians have private health insurance. Currently, consumers who purchase private health insurance receive a 30 per cent government rebate on the cost of the premium. This is not means tested. Those aged over 65 receive a 35 per cent rebate on their private health insurance costs and those over 70 receive a 40 per cent rebate. These rebates were introduced under the Howard Liberal government and the expenditure on the rebate has grown substantially over the last decade. In 2001-02, government expenditure on the private insurance rebate totalled $2.1 billion. In the 2010-11 financial year, the total expenditure on this rebate had increased to $4.7 billion. That is more than double the amount from 2001-02. The 2010 Intergenerational report published on the Department of the Treasury website on 1 February that year states that the private health insurance rebate is the fastest-growing component of the Australian government's health expenditure and is forecast to increase by over 50 per cent in real terms per person over the period 201213 to 2022-23. The private health insurance will rebate is the fastest-growing element of health expenditure and, if not capped, will cost the taxpayer $100 billion over the next 40 years. The fact that the fastest-growing element of health expenditure is not infrastructure, primary health care or pharmaceuticals but is the subsidising of private health insurance shows why these bills are so important. In the 2009-10 budget, the government announced it would introduce measures to limit the growing cost of the private health insurance rebate. We tried twice to implement changes to the rebate during the last parliament, but the legislation was rejected both times by the Senate. These bills create three tiers of support for private health insurance based progressively on the annual income of an individual or a family. For singles, there is no change unless a person earns over $83,000 per annum. Once they go over that, then the rebate reduces from 30 to 20 per cent. Going further up the income scale, once a single person earns over $96,000 per year, there is still a rebate, but it is reduced to 10 per cent. Once they get to $129,000 per year, the rebate out. For families and couples, the bills propose that the cut-off amounts be doubled. Therefore, following that figure, the rebate for a family or couple is 20 per cent once their combined income exceeds $166,000 per year. Once that couple or family receives an income of more than $192,000 per year taxable income, the rebate is 10 per cent. There is no rebate beyond $258,000 annual taxable income. If there are children involved, then there is an extra $1500 in the threshold for each tier per child. For example, a family with two dependent children would have to earn a combined taxable income of over $169,000 before they lost the rebate. There is no change to the private health insurance rebate for those individuals earning below $83,000 as singles or $169,000 for two-child families. They retain the full rebate. Nearly eight million policyholders will retain the full rebate on private health insurance. The important figure to remember, I think, in this debate is that out of 10 Australians will not be affected at all. With the average yearly wage for 201112 trending to around $68,790, the average wage earner will not be affected by these changes. Those opposite are suggesting that an administration assistant, an apprentice, a retail worker and maybe a teacher not only in my electorate of Deakin but right across the country should be subsidising those who have substantially more income than themselves. I believe the current expenditure on the private health insurance rebate can and should be better allocated to other ways of supporting our health system. The big problem with private health insurance rebates is that this money, rather than being spent in our hospitals for everyone, goes into cuts the pockets of consumers or purchasers of health insurance to subsidise that product. I think it is an inefficient way of supporting our health system. The other problem with the rebate is that the more that is spent on private health insurance the bigger the subsidy received. So this rebate gives the biggest benefit to those on the highest incomes rather than the money being delivered directly to the health system. The rebate gives more money to those who are well off and less to those who take out basic policies. Recent data shows that 45 per cent of the population have private health insurance, but this figure is higher for higher income households-for example, 91.3 per cent of couples earning between $240,000 and $300,000 a year have private health insurance. Those on low incomes have lower rates of health insurance-for example, only 25.6 per cent of singles earning less than $50,000 take out private health insurance. Proportionately more of this rebate, which is now costing $4.7 billion a year, is being paid nine to higher income households. The question that I have to ask-and I have asked it in this chamber before-is: 'Is welfare for the wealthy a good use of health funding dollars?' My answer is I do not think so. The other impact of this legislation is to increase the Medicare levy surcharge, increasing the penalty for those on higher incomes not taking out private health insurance. When the government lifted income thresholds for the Medicare levy surcharge in 2008 in order to apply indexation, the Liberal Party and the private health insurance industry ran around like headless chooks, warning that thousands of people would abandon their private cover. They said it would increase the number of people not purchasing private health insurance. They said it would increase demand for public hospital services as well as push up premiums for private health insurance. But these arguments have been proven wrong. I remember speaking on the Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy Surcharge Thresholds) Bill of 2008 in the last parliament and making the point that people should take out private health insurance if the product and service is good and relevant to the individual's or family's circumstances. As I have said, time has passed and the evidence is now in. A report by KPMG conducted after the introduction of the higher Medicare levy surcharge found that private hospital activity following the changes to the Medicare levy surcharge actually grew at a faster rate than public hospital activity, which also grew. The facts are there. The current percentage of those taking out private health insurance is at a 10-year high. Treasury modelling estimates 99.7 per cent of people will keep their private health cover, with only about 27,000 people dropping out because of these proposed changes. This would lead to an increase of approximately 8,500 additional public hospital admissions over two years, which is an increase of around 0.1 per cent. This is a very small number indeed and is nothing like the fearmongering predictions that we hear so often from those opposite. These bills will reduce government subsidies for highincome earners and increase the penalty if they opt not to take out insurance. This ensures that most, but not all, high-income earners will still opt to stay in. Indexation will ensure that, over time, the tiers are raised as national incomes rise. It is important to note that nearly eight million policy holders will not feel any difference at all. There will be no effect on the cost of hospital or general treatment policies because well over 99 per cent of people who have cover will retain their cover. Treasury analysis advises that the combination of reducing the subsidy while increasing the Medicare levy for those on higher incomes will ensure that policyholders retain their private health insurance. The Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association said that it: … supports changes to the Medicare levy surcharge and private health insurance (PHI) rebates based on income. The Association has, for many years, known that the PHI rebate is not an effective mechanism to attract and retain members in the health funds. Not only is the mechanism itself ineffective, it is also an extremely inefficient use of taxpayer dollars … These bills will help Australia get the best value for its health dollar as there is an urgent need to manage this rebate, which is the fastest growing health cost in the nation. I commend these bills to the House. Mrs GASH (Gilmore) (16:10): You have got to hand it to the Labor Party. There seems to be no end to their creativity in spinning a good yarn. This bill seeks to cut $2.8 billion in private health subsidies, inevitably forcing more people onto the already strained public hospital waiting lists. And they title their bill the 'Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill', surely an oxymoron. Cutting health insurance rebates can only result in forcing more people onto the Medicare levy, resulting in longer hospital queues in Nowra and Milton hospitals. It is the only logical conclusion to draw. Private industry warned against this when Labor first tried to raise the subject under their former leader a couple of years ago. For example, the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons on 12 May 2009 said the budget measure which cut rebates would 'inevitably drive some Australians out of the private health system, placing even greater strain on Australia's public hospitals'. The Australian Medical Association, on the same day, said: … if you don't keep your private health insurance, you'll be slugged with an increased Medicare Levy surcharge. They get you both ways. I could not agree more, and this bill confirms exactly what the two major medical associations were warning us about. This government has never been a fan of private health insurance, despite the success in easing the pressure off the perpetually struggling public hospital system. This bill just the latest step in Labor's campaign of dogma. Certainly no lessons were learned through its previous experience in 2009 or through industry advice saying, 'Don't do it,' or, most importantly of all, the chaotic health and hospital systems, which we are still experiencing. When I was reading the explanatory memorandum to the bill, I could not help thinking that the $1.7 billion in cost overruns and waste remediation for the pink batts fiasco could have paid for the subsidy cuts the government is now proposing. When you add the other amounts that have been wasted, there should have been no need to go down this path at all. No wonder Australians, especially in Gilmore, are angry. They cannot see the justification for this to happen. The government has shown no remorse for generating so much waste through its own incompetence, yet it has no hesitation in slugging the taxpayer when it wants. Gilmore has one of the lowest socio-economic demographics in Australia and I am astounded the government continues to deny the impact this policy will have on the public hospital system in regions like Gilmore. Many families make significant sacrifices so they can take out private health cover, yet here we are again, under this government, penalising those who would benefit most. There is no gain to be had, only pain. Then, as if to compound this stupidity, the government want to impose another tax by increasing the Medicare levy on some of the soon-to-be-disenfranchised health insurance subscribers. This latest variation will see a three-tier system of subsidies, starting at $80,000-odd per annum for a single subscriber. The first tier get a 10 per cent cut to their subsidy and their Medicare levy will not go up-at least, not yet. The next tier get a 20 per cent cut but their levy goes up. The is third tier get no subsidy and their levy goes up even more. Any incentive is deleted. I note that Treasury estimates that around 25,000 individuals are predicted to opt out, and in some circles that appears to be a conservative guess. In the Senate hearing earlier this year, Medibank Private admitted no research was done as to the likely impact, but they did some internal modelling. That is another way of saying 'an educated guess'. The upshot is that the government does not really know what the impact will be but is keeping its fingers crossed. I have no doubt that this will be just the tip of the iceberg as other cost pressures encouraged by the government start to sink in. With unemployment predicted to rise by another 100,000 in the next 12 months and daily living expenses just going through the roof, it does not take a genius to predict that many households will be cutting a lot of their spending. In fact, they already have, with cost-of-living pressures and, still to come, the carbon tax. This latest venture will only add to that pressure. So, in a way, Labor will get its wish to destroy private health insurance, not through careful planning but through a combination of incompetence, ineptitude and dogma. But this latest move by the government is hardly a surprise. They were opposed to the scheme when the coalition introduced it and, with the Greens calling the shots, they are determined to remove it completely. I am amused by the inclusion of the word 'fairer' in the title of the bill. This is not a recent innovation, because they tried this on with their Fair Work Act, which is anything but fair. I think that has been demonstrated well and truly. Perhaps they will now turn to their latest slogan: 'a painful adjustment.' Next, instead of eradicating the subsidy in one fell swoop, as they said they would, this is going to be the death of a thousand cuts. Nobody should be under the illusion that this bill tells us where it will stop; it is just the next step in a series of steps, because the government have not recanted their determination to get rid of this scheme. It might just take a little longer. I recall a press release issued by the former Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Roxon, on 26 September 2007, when she was occupying the shadow portfolio. I seek leave to table the press release. Leave not granted. Mrs GASH: I am not surprised leave has not been granted, because this press release actually states the truth. The shadow minister was unequivocal in her assurances. In fact, it was a promise. In part, this is what she said: On many occasions for many months, Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing Private Health Insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians. … Labor will also maintain Lifetime Health Cover and the Medicare Levy Surcharge and other components of the existing private health insurance incentive scheme. It is now abundantly clear that the words were carefully crafted. The shadow minister did not say that they would not change the qualifying criteria, which they are now attempting to do-another broken promise. It seems to me that Labor, to quote Nicola Roxon's own words from the very same press release, will do anything and say anything to get elected. They were not going to cut the private health insurance rebatesat least, that is what they tried to imply. That was before they were elected. Now Labor have been elected, $2.8 billion worth of cuts are going to be made-another lie, another broken promise. If that is not enough, in a letter to Dr Michael Armitage, the Chief Executive of the Australian Health Insurance Association, the then federal Labor leader, Kevin Rudd, in a letter dated 20 November 2007, wrote: Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians. Federal Labor will also maintain Lifetime Health Cover and the Medicare Levy Surcharge. Labor will maintain the existing framework for regulating private health insurance, including the process for approval of premium increases. I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the House that this statement came from the former Labor leader, Mr Rudd. By their words, they stand condemned. What utter deceit. The government cannot be trusted to tell the truth and they cannot be trusted to do the right thing. And they certainly cannot be relied upon to get things right. The more the Prime Minister talks about going forward, the more we are slipping backwards. According to a report in the Australian Financial Review, dated Wednesday, 17 August last year, the Private Health Insurance Administration Council showed that Australia had reached its highest rate of private hospital insurance participation in more than 10 years: in the three months to June 2011, 87,381 people signed up for private health cover. That is what the rebate sought to do when it was introduced. It was an incentive to reduce reliance on the public hospital system by encouraging people to take out private health insurance. It has been an outstanding success, yet this government wants to sabotage that success and trap us in a public hospital system that is groaning under demands that are not being met. Labor's promise to take over the hospital system has fallen by the wayside and has been diluted to an agreement to share funding-and then only for future growth. How will that work? Another broken promise, but I think it is more a case of Labor confusing their ambitions with their capabilities. This has been the recent pattern of the Prime Minister, making sugary promises on the run and not following through. How many so-called policy announcements have languished after the initial press statement? Making a shallow statement, disguised as a announcement is easy. Labor have done it hundreds of times. The challenge for Labor is following through, and that is where they have been found wanting. Deloitte released a report titled Economic impact assessment of the proposed reforms to private health insurance. I wonder whether the word 'reforms' accurately describes what this government is trying to do, because this proposal is a retrograde step. Deloitte describes the reaction to these proposed changes as significant, not in a good way but with a negative consequence. This is what Deloitte concluded: In time, it is expected that the cost of servicing increased demand for public hospital services will outweigh the savings to government from the means testing of the rebate. On this basis, how can anyone in their right mind support this legislation? And that statement comes from an independent and credible body, external to the political process. I am not surprised that the Independents have indicated their reluctance to support the changes, as has been reported in the Fin Review. At the back of all this, I have to wonder about this strategy to force people back into public hospitals being pursued at the same time as the government is building superclinics to ease the existing strain on public hospitals. Is it in fact a sly ploy to get people into the yet-to-be-constructed superclinics? And what of the government's plan to ease the demand on public hospital waiting lists by utilising private hospitals? How is this going to work? This legislation has to be viewed in the context of the health reform announcement, made on 2 August last year. Key changes will not be implemented until at least 201415, seven years after Labor first promised to fix public hospitals. They also promised that, if needed, they would hold a referendum to policy take them over. The core promise of Labor's health reforms was that the Commonwealth would become the dominant funder of 60 per cent of hospital costs. That promise has since been scrapped. Its substitute, the supposed increase to 50 per cent growth funding of hospital services will not occur until 2017. That is at least two elections away and with no explanation as to how it is to be funded. A definition of an efficient price of hospital services has yet to be determined, and further negotiations may even be required on the scope of services eligible for Commonwealth funding. Kevin Rudd said that, on health, the buck would stop with him. Julia Gillard says that the states will be in charge. Julia Gillard has broken Labor's promise on elective surgery guarantees. Patients in category 1 who had waited the clinically recommended time were promised that they would have their surgery in five days. Patients in category 2 would have surgery in 15 days and patients in category 3 would have surgery in 45 days. What are the chances? The new national elective surgery targets will not be fully implemented until 2016, with reward funding now paid in advance to state governments and no guarantees for patients. The national emergency access target for patients to be admitted or discharged within four hours has been watered down from 95 per cent of emergency department patients to 90 per cent, and will not be fully implemented until 2015. Labor will spend hundreds of millions of dollars this year establishing the National Health Performance Authority, Independent Hospital Pricing Authority, Medicare Locals and the National Funding Authority. None of this is good news for Gilmore. The superclinic in Shoalhaven, promised by Labor to be up and running by Christmas last year, is not due to commence for perhaps another two years, and even that has a revised forecast that is optimistic. Shoalhaven Hospital is struggling and Milton-Ulladulla Hospital is virtually a second-level operation where some of the services have been cut. This legislation is a square peg in a round hole. It is a retrograde step. It breaks more promises and it will only compound an already difficult situation. It is not something we need and it is certainly not something we deserve. I cannot for the life of me see any sense in this, and I can see even less in a government that is determined to have its own way despite the cost to the community. I do not support this legislation and I do not trust a government with a proven track record of cunning, deceit and rank stupidity. The Australian people deserve better.",132
223,Mr SIMPKINS,DOCUMENTS," In my remarks today on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011 it is my intention to talk a little bit about the historical context in which we find ourselves, particularly with regard to matters of promises, which many other speakers have talked about, and health reform, even though I would say that this bill has nothing at all to do with health reform; this is the budgetary bill. When we think back to the 2007 election campaign-and I think almost all members in the chamber fought that election campaign-we remember clearly what took place. Some of the things that the former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd-whether that title will apply to him again in the next few weeks I do not know-talked about was the the end of the blame game, how there was going to be resolution of the conflict between the states and the Commonwealth, how everybody would start to get along better, how there would be great strides forward on health care and how, as was promised, if there was no resolution then there would be a Commonwealth takeover of public hospitals. That was very much part of the 2007 campaign, and it obviously gave the current government and the former prime minister a great deal of momentum. When you go to the front door of anyone's house and say, generically, 'What are your issues?' the default issues are without doubt health and education. Everyone says, 'Let's fix the health system.' So when that imagery was created by the Labor Party before the 2007 election-ending the blame game and fixing up the health system-everybody wanted to believe it, and I think it worked very well for Labor. Within that context, an aspect of that campaign was the then Leader of the Opposition, Kevin Rudd-now former Prime Minister and current foreign minister-using a 'younger John Howard' image. As part of that, Mr Rudd and his then shadow health minister, Julia Gillard, were very careful in their addressing of concerns within the health industry and the private health industry. That leads us, as others have alluded, to the letter written by the former federal Labor leader and member for Griffith, Kevin Rudd, dated 20 November 2007, just shortly before the election. In letter he was very clear on the matter of retaining the existing private health insurance rebate. We talked in that election campaign about the fact that Labor was out to get the private health insurance rebate. They were going to make changes to it and we knew the consequences of that. At the time the Howard government was elected in 1996, we were in the situation where the proportion of Australians that were a part of the private health system was down to something like 33 or 34 per cent. Through the measures the Howard government put together that was elevated to something like 45 per cent, which took pressure off the public hospital system. In Cowan, some 75 per cent of residents in my electorate are covered under the private health insurance arrangements. However, as I said, it was very clear that the image, the claim or, you might say, the promise that was put out there by Labor before that 2007 election campaign was that there would be no change. As a result the private health industry was fairly quiet on matter and it did not choose to highlight any further concerns to the people of Australia, and that was another aspect that helped the Labor Party win government in 2007. This matter was addressed quite significantly in question time today, and the point was made by the current Prime Minister that the promises that were made about the private health insurance rebate were pre-2007 election, the point being that promise was made two elections ago. I note as well that the member for Dickson very clearly made the point when we approached the 2010 campaign that comments were on the record which indicated to Australians that there would be no changes to the arrangements for the private health insurance rebate. So the reality is-and I will move further into this bill soon-that the view and the perspective this that was given to the Australian people was that their health insurance rebate was not going to be touched. How truly wrong that was. It is important for me to say that the former minister for health is on the record as saying: On many occasions for many months, Federal Laborthis was before the 2007 electionhas made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing Private Health Insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians. As I have said, the letter from the Hon. Kevin Rudd to the Chief Executive Officer of the Health Insurance Association, Dr Michael Armitage, again very clearly states that federal Labor was committed to the private health insurance rebates. Unfortunately, as is so often the case in the last four-plus years, what is promised before an election bears little relationship to what takes place after the election. Yet we cannot the blame the Greens for any of this of course! The socialist to communist fringe of Australian politics have always been complete and utter socialists. Their view of the world is that anyone who has done well in their life must only have done so due to the sweat of somebody else. So they are fully behind the redistribution of wealth and there are plenty in the government who probably subscribe to a similar view. When we look at private health insurance circumstances we know that there are 10.2 million Australians who currently have private health insurance for hospital treatment. As I said before, 75 per cent of my electorate of Cowan-some 95,000 voters, citizens over 18, and their families-all believe that they want to make sacrifices in their lives in order to be able to afford private health insurance so that they will have choice in the future. A lot of people might say, and obviously it is also the government's view, that anyone on more than $80,000 a year and any family on more than $180,000 a year must be wealthy. But that is not the whole story, and I will go through that a little bit further. It is certainly the case that 75 per cent of my constituents are within the private health insurance arrangements. In fact, back in August last year we received letters from almost 2,000 of our local residents asking for the retention of the current private health insurance rebate. Residents such as Ken Roberts, Sarah Harris, Lee Davis and Barbara Brown, to name four of those almost 2,000, simply cannot understand why the Labor government is out to cut the private health insurance rebate. They see it as an attack on the hard-working and aspirational people of this country. In just the last day or so I received an email from my constituent Mark Paulton. I will read into the record what he says: We are a modest family of 3 with an income just over a gross income of around 180k pa. This is modest really when in context of Perth and the mining boom as you can appreciate. Since labour have been in power I have seen appreciation for the working family dwindle and really encouragement now goes to those who aren't striving to better their income levels and raise themselves without support of the state. For example here are things that labour has introduced that has directly affected me and my family due this government thinking that a family earning over $150,000 is classed as a millionaire in their view: 1. Means testing of a family Tax Benefit A and B, Child Care Benefit and Baby Bonus … Loss of around $3500 pa 2. Flood Levy introduced … $1000 3. Means Test of Rudds stimulus package so not applicable to our income level … $1000 4. Carbon Tax Introduced $2500pa 5. No change to recent income tax threshold in line with inflation … $1000pa 6. Changes to Medicare and Obstricians fees for using their services … $2500 And now … The loss and means test of the PHI rebate …$1000pa. Consideration of not just the PHI rebate means test, it should be considered with all the other changes this government has done and this extra change not only is a burden in its own right, it's compounded by the fact that one has been levied on just purely because we are perceived to be millionaires. The total of the above is around $12,500 in changes that makes us worse off since labour came to office. Is it any wonder that retailers are feeling it tough as well. When you have 75 per cent of the people in Cowan concerned about this sort of issue, is it any wonder then that so many people in my electorate are concerned? When Deloittes did the analysis on the impact of the legislation it showed that they expected 175,000 people to withdraw from private hospital cover and a further 583,000 to downgrade their cover. The AMA shares that sort of viewpoint as well. The health insurance sector predicts that another 730,000 are likely to downgrade their hospital cover and 775,000 are likely to drop from ancillary altogether. Even the government's own Medibank Private has estimated that 37,000 of their members alone will drop their cover and 92,500 will downgrade their cover. That is thousands more than the government estimates will abandon private health insurance due to this bill-due to these measures that the government is trying to introduce today. One private insurance company is saying that they alone will lose more people to private health insurance than the government estimates will happen across the whole country. I ask everyone in this place: who do they think is accurate on these matters? One of the specific points that has been made about private health insurance and these plans to take the rebate away from so many people relates to the pool base for private health insurance. The reality is that with each person that drops out of private health insurance the pool base gets smaller and smaller. Even if Medibank Private is the only insurer that loses people-which is not necessarily going to be the case-37,000 people will no longer be part of that pool base. All those people that the government claims it is trying to protect will also see their insurance premiums rise as the health insurance companies will have to try to make ends meet whilst continuing to provide services from a reduced number of insurance policyholders. This legislation does represent a huge knock for those hard working Australians who want to share the cost of the provision of their own health services-those people who believe that society does not owe them and that they should pay their own way where they can. They are just asking for that little bit of help so that they can take pressure off the public hospital system. I do not think it is too much to ask, particularly for those that pay the majority of the income tax in this country, that they should get that little bit of support. These are people that have been making sure that they are doing the right thing for this country as well as looking after themselves first and foremost and it is not wrong for them to get just that little bit of support. We reject this bill, we reject the premise behind it and we call on the government to get its act together and balance the budget in the right way by cutting its spending. (Time expired) Mrs MARKUS (Macquarie) (16:39): I rise to speak on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011 and the two cognate bills that are before the House. This is not the first time that these bills have been seen in this place. The same set of bills has been defeated by the Senate on two separate occasions, but this Labor government is now at it again for a third time. This of course is no surprise: if we have learnt one thing about the Labor government it is that it will never let a little thing like a mandate, or the will of the people, get in the way of it fulfilling its own agenda. These bills aim to reduce the incentives for Australians to take up private health insurance by slashing the 30 per cent rebate and increasing the Medicare levy surcharge for those without insurance, according to income thresholds. Those earning over $80,001 will have to either receive a reduced rate of 20 per cent or pay a one per cent Medicare levy surcharge. People earning over $93,001 will either receive a rebate of just 10 per cent or pay a 1.25 per cent surcharge, whilst those who earn over $124,001 will no longer receive any private health insurance rebate and will face a Medicare levy surcharge of 1.5 per cent. This government has selective amnesia when it comes to this issue. In 2007, then Leader of the Opposition Rudd gave assurances to the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Health Insurance Association, the Hon. Michael Armitage, that federal Labor would not make any changes to the private health insurance rebate. A young professional in the seat of Macquarie earning $95,000 per year with a $1,500 per annum health insurance policy will see his rebate slashed from 30 per cent to 10 per cent or in real dollar terms from about $450 to $150. That equates to this person being $300 a year worse off. If they do not have private health insurance, their Medicare levy surcharge will rise from $950 to $1,187.50 and they will be $237.50 a year worse off. Put simply, they are damned if they do and damned if they don't. This is another example of Labor trying to hurt everyday Australians-young families, senior citizens and small business owners who are already struggling to make ends meet as the cost of electricity and other items continues to rise. If passed, these bills will add to the ever-increasing cost-of-living burden being felt by people across the electorate of Macquarie. When in government the coalition implemented incentives which saw a 10 per cent increase in the number of Australians who use private health insurance. Thanks to these incentives we now see around 45 per cent of Australians using one form or another of private health cover. Increased patronage of private health insurance is a vital part of ensuring greater access to health services for everyone. Public hospitals all over the nation struggle to keep up with the demand. This is not a reflection on the hard working doctors and nurses who work in public hospitals and are valued members of our community but a reflection on the demand that is currently placed on our health system. Private health insurance assists public hospitals by giving those who can afford it the opportunity to receive private care, which assists by easing pressure on hospital waiting lists. Reducing the rebate will increase the cost burden of private health insurance on mums, dads and self-funded retirees who are already struggling with price hikes. This will leave many with no choice but to drop their private health insurance altogether, whilst forcing others to downgrade to cheaper policies. This was highlighted by a telephone survey conducted by ANOP Research. They found that, if this bill was passed, 11 per cent of those surveyed would drop their hospital cover and a further 24 per cent would downgrade it. This would not only provide them with less cover but in turn place a great deal of pressure on our public hospitals and other health services. The government's own figures show that around 27,000 people would be forced to drop their private health cover. This would vital result in an extra 8,500 public hospital admissions, as those previously covered by private health insurance returned to the public hospital system. These figures tell us that the Labor government fails to understand the impact that this bill will have on these 27,000 individuals across the nation-families, students and self-funded retirees who through no fault of their own will be worse off. During Senate estimates hearings, the leading insurer Medibank Private said that according to its own internal modelling about 37,000 of its members would be expected to drop their cover with an additional 92,000 expected to downgrade their policies if this bill were to pass. Medibank's figures suggest that under this bill 10,000 more Australians will be forced to drop private health insurance than the government has suggested. However, Medibank is talking about only their customer base, whilst the government is talking about the entire nation. To see how the government's national figures stack up, look at the Deloitte report entitled Economic impact assessment of the proposed reforms to private health insurance, commissioned by the Australian Health Insurance Association. This report estimates that, over the first year, 175,000 people will drop their private health insurance and 538,000 people will have to downgrade their policies. We have the government saying 27,000 and a report by Deloitte claiming 175,000. So who can we trust? Who is more believable? The government that brought us the pink batts disaster, the 'building the entertainment revolution' through the set-top box scheme, the ludicrous cash-for-clunkers idea and, for services. an encore, wants to bring in a carbon tax? Or a company like Deloitte which, since its foundation in 1845 has been regarded as one of the world's largest companies when it comes to professional services? The Deloitte report also found that this bill, which has been rejected twice by the Senate over five years, will cause the number of those dropping their cover to increase to 1.6 million consumers, while a further 4.3 million will downgrade their policies. Additionally, 2.8 million Australians would drop their general cover, which includes ancillary services such as dental. It found that because of this severe impact on the health insurance market, private health insurance premiums would rise significantly. The rise would be a staggering 10 per cent more than would otherwise be expected, making private health insurance even more unaffordable for those struggling against surging cost-of-living pressures. The report went on to show that this would have a significant impact on the public health system, with public hospitals having to treat a significantly higher number of patients as people withdrew from private health cover. We need to be very clear about this. What the Labor government is proposing here is bad health policy. This government has a long record of failing to understand what the public wants, and this policy shows that nothing has changed. The impact that this proposal will have on the residents of Macquarie is significant. An average family in which the father works as an accountant and the mother as a schoolteacher, earning wages above the threshold, with a basic private health package costing $2,500 a year, will see their rebate reduced from 30 per cent to 20 per cent, costing them an extra $250 a year. This is at a time when cost-of-living pressures are high and many among us are calling out for greater access to health By bringing the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill and the two related bills back before the parliament, this Labor government is once again showing that it is not listening to what Australians are saying. In both May and November of 2009 the parliament clearly told Labor that we did not want it destroying our health system. We must now again say that in 2012 nothing has changed. This bill needs to be opposed. The last thing we need is more hurt from this Labor government.",138
224,Ms ODWYER,DOCUMENTS," I rise today to speak on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011 and related bills-the government's latest broken promise and latest attack on aspirational Australians. This is an issue that goes to the very heart of my electorate of Higgins. My electorate is full to the brim with aspiration. When I stood here for the first time in this place just over two years ago, I referred to the thread that binds the people of Higgins together, that thread being aspirationwhether it be young couples renting for the moment but desperate to own their own homes; whether it be families wanting the best for their children, scrimping and saving to provide them with the best opportunities in life; whether it be small business people, rolling up their sleeves, taking a chance and creating jobs; or whether it be older residents who have worked hard throughout their lives, whose accomplishments prove what can happen when you dare to pursue your ambitions. Yet this government does not believe in aspiration. It does not believe, as we do, that the best path to our collective prosperity involves giving individuals, families and businesses the freedom, opportunity and encouragement to build and secure their own futures. It does not believe in self-reliance. is ideologically opposed to encouraging people to work hard, to save and to contribute to their own health care. This bill is all about penalising individuals and families. It goes to the heart of cost-ofliving pressures that families and individuals are already increasingly facing. This bill will increase the cost of private health insurance while at the same time do nothing to decrease the pressure on the public health system. Far from it: the changes that the government seeks to make today will increase the pressure on the public health system. Seventy-seven per cent of my electorate have private health insurance. That is around 83,258 people, based on the current ABS statistics. Each of those people will be affected, either because their rebate will be taken away in full, because it will be decreased or because their premiums will ultimately rise because of the significant number of people who will drop out of the private health system. Even the remaining 27 per cent of my electorate who do not currently have private health insurance will be affected, because the public health system will come under increasing pressure. It is instructive to look at the number of people who will be directly impacted when tier 1 of the government's legislation kicks in. In my electorate of Higgins, about 21 per cent of singles and seven per cent of couples will be directly impacted. I think it is telling that the lights have gone out in this chamber, because this legislation is a demonstration of how the lights have gone out on this government and how this government have ultimately been incredibly deceptive in the comments they have made about the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate across the years. It is useful to look back at what this government have said about the 30 per It cent rebate-a rebate that was brought into effect by the coalition government, by the then Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Michael Wooldridge, to ensure that we could have affordable and sustainable health care for all. It was to provide Australians with choice, to encourage people to be self reliant. Let us go back and look at what the current Prime Minister, who was then shadow minister, said about the private health insurance rebate. She said that she would give an ironclad guarantee that there would be no change to the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate. She said that she was so sick of saying it that she would ensure that there would be 'an ironclad guarantee' that there would be no change. All of us in this place know exactly what the Prime Minister's promises are worth. Only days before the last election, the Prime Minister made another promise-that there would be no carbon tax under the government she led. She broke that promise to the Australian people and she broke her promise as shadow minister for health not to rip away the private health insurance rebate. But it was not just the Prime Minister who made this assurance to the people of Australia. At the election in 2007, the shadow minister for health, the member for Gellibrand, explicitly stated that federal Labor had: … made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing private health insurance rebates. In the media statement released during the campaign, she stated: The Liberals continue to try to scare people into thinking Labor will take away the rebates. absolutely untrue. That is what she said: 'This is absolutely untrue.' She went on to say: The Howard government will do anything and say anything to get elected. Doesn't that take the cake? It turned out that it was the shadow minister for health who would say anything or do anything. This is a very interesting statement from the member for Gellibrand. It has to be one of the most duplicitous statements ever made by a shadow minister with respect to a government policy, ranking just after the Prime Minister's famous remark-her famous broken promise-about a carbon tax. It went on. Kevin Rudd, who was then the Leader of the Opposition, also made some incredibly explicit promises in relation to the private health insurance rebate. He said, in a letter, which I have here today: Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this yearThis is in 2007that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians. Federal Labor will also maintain Lifetime Health Cover and the Medicare Levy Surcharge. Labor will maintain the existing framework for regulating private health insurance, including process for full approval of premium increases. The Labor government have again broken their promise. In fact, before they went to the 2010 election, they brought forward changes in the 2009 budget which saw a broken promise on private health insurance-a private health insurance broken promise which will affect every single Australian and, most particularly, all of those Australians who currently hold private health insurance. It will affect not just those whom This is the government claim will be directly affected-those on higher incomes-but every single person who holds private health insurance, because their premiums will rise as people drop out of private health insurance. The government have said that we should not be worried about the people who drop out of private health insurance. They say that it is a minuscule number. They say that, for their savings of upwards of $1.9 billionwhich they now say is over $2 billion-very few people will drop out of private health insurance. This does not stand up to scrutiny. Private health insurers have conducted their own research and asked Deloitte to provide a report on the number of people who would be anticipated to drop out of private health insurance as a result of the proposed changes. The report said that, over five years, up to 1.6 million Australians will drop their cover, which is pretty radically different from Treasury's estimate of around 25,000 people. Not only that but, according to this report, up to 4.3 million Australians will downgrade their cover over five years. This will see an increase in premiums-the cost of health insurance-of upwards of 10 per cent. This means that the cost of health care in Australia will increase. Australians who are battling cost-of-living pressures right now ask themselves: 'Why? the Why is this government so committed to ripping away choice for Australians? Why are they committed to raising the cost of private health insurance?' The government claim this is because they need to find savings. But let us look at the government's record. They have the worse economic record of any government in recent history. They have delivered in their four budgets deficits that add up to $167 billion, which of course means that Australians for generations to come will be paying off the subsequent debt that the government are racking up. Already we know that the cost of the government's borrowings will impact Australians-every man, woman and child-by $6,000. This is a government with a terrible record; a government that has needed to increase the gross debt ceiling from $75 billion to $250 billion. Warnings abound in our national papers every day that this government is on the path to economic destruction through its waste and mismanagement. It must stop. While this government says it needs to rip out around $2.4 billion from the private health insurance rebate, it has wasted more than $1 billion on pink batts and more than $1.5 billion on trying to correct the mistakes made under that program. This government has managed billion-dollar blowouts in mismanaged programs such as border protection. There has been a blowout of over $1 billion in that policy alone. This government has also wasted billions of dollars on the Julia Gillard memorial school hall projects. A number of school halls and infrastructure projects have not been managed well and there has been an incredible waste of taxpayer dollars. While the government has presided over such waste and mismanagement, it claims that it needs to rip money out of private health insurance. The only reason this government is pursuing this action is that, ideologically, is opposed to private health insurance. It is opposed to people saving and providing for their own futures and it is against choice in health care. It is now on its the third attempt to dismantle the private health insurance industry in this country. I stand against as do the people of Higgins. The people in my electorate of Higgins are vitally opposed to these measures and I will continue to fight for private health insurance that will allow Australians to directly participate. This government should hang its head in shame for taking one policy to the 2007 election and then the 2010 election, but then breaking that promise. This government cannot be trusted to maintain its promises; it cannot be trusted to maintain the health care of all Australians. This legislation should not stand.",143
225,Mr FLETCHER,DOCUMENTS," I am pleased to speak on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill and related bills. The House is debating a simple, clearcut issue-should the Australian tax system encourage all Australians, or as many who are able, to provide for their own medical expenses through taking out health insurance, or should it instead, as this government proposes, put private health insurance and choice of medical provider even further out of the reach of many Australians? Regrettably, that will be the effect of the fundamentally misconceived provisions in the bills the House is debating this afternoon. When it comes to private health insurance, Labor has form. Labor is relentlessly hostile to private health insurance. Labor is hostile to private hospitals. Labor is hostile to the notion of Australians seeking to rely on their own resources, seeking to make provision for themselves and their families rather than relying solely and exclusively on the public system. This bill is redolent of ideological it hostility towards private health insurance and towards self-provision, which is at the absolute core of Labor's approach. That is why this bill is designed to make it harder for Australians to help themselves and their families. This bill is designed to make it this, more expensive to take out private health insurance; it is designed to penalise many of those who seek to provide for themselves rather than be a burden on the public purse. Let us remind ourselves of the principal provisions in the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill. Firstly, the current private health insurance rebate, which for most people is set at 30 per cent of expenditures and for older people somewhat higher, will be reduced for those who are above certain income levels. If you are a single and your income level is more than $124,000, the rebate will be reduced to zero; if you fall into certain income levels below that, the rebate will be reduced by lesser amounts. The second major provision in this bill increases the current Medicare levy surcharge on your tax bill which applies if you do not have private health insurance. Today that stands at one percentage point; in the new world, should this bill pass the House, that rate will increase to 1.25 per for a single person with an income above $93,000 and 1.5 per cent for a single person with an income above $124,000. We have had some highly illogical and internally inconsistent arguments in support of this measure. Just today in the House the Prime Minister drew a comparison between a highly paid businessmen earning $500,000 a year and an apprentice earning much less, and argued that, in the absence of the measures contained in this bill, there is an unsavoury degree of cross-subsidy on the part of the apprentice to the businessman, who has the benefit of the private health insurance rebate. A brief look at the numbers indicates what a ludicrous claim that is. In the case of the businessman cited by the Prime Minister, the tax on $500,000 is $206,050, prior to the application of the rebate. If we assume a typical level of private health insurance premium then that tax bill will be reduced by a mere $720. By contrast, somebody earning $50,000 will have a tax bill of $10,200. So the suggestion that, in some way, the person paying $206,050 a year in tax is freeloading on the person paying $10,200 in tax, which was essentially the argument put by the Prime Minister in the House, is self-evidently not worth considering when you take even the briefest look at the actual numbers. I want to make three points in the time. I have available. Firstly, the measures inherent in this bill fundamentally attack the provisions of the private health insurance rebate and are an appalling abandonment of what was apparently previously an ironclad commitment. Secondly, for many years we have seen from the Labor side of politics a consistent mismanagement of policy in the area of private health insurance, founded on their implacable ideological hostility to the private health insurance industry. Thirdly, the ill-designed and ill-thought-through cent measures in this bill will seriously damage choice and equity in health care in Australia. On the first point, I remind the House, as a number of other speakers have done, of commitments that were made in the lead-up to the 2007 election by a number of eminent members of the Labor Party. The member for Gellibrand had this to say: 'On many occasions for many months federal Labor have made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.' Then it was a commitment; now, apparently, that commitment is out the window and completely meaningless. What did then opposition leader Kevin Rudd have to say just before the 2007 election? In a written commitment, a letter to the industry body, he had this to say: 'Both my shadow minister for health Nicola Roxon and I have made clear on many occasions this year that federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent rebate and 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.' This is a shameful abandonment of a commitment previously given by the Labor Party. My second point is that the policy area of private health insurance is one which has been subject to consistent mismanagement over many years by Labor during its times in government, and by contrast the coalition has shown a sure hand in seeking to maximise the number of people who take out private health insurance and thereby contribute themselves towards the cost burden of the health system, which would otherwise fall entirely on the public purse. When Medicare was introduced in 1984, a decline began in the percentage of the population covered by private health insurance. By 1998, only 30.4 per cent of the population was covered by private health insurance. I need hardly add the obvious point that this left the vast majority of Australians drawing on the publicly funded system, putting it under substantial pressure. The Howard government, I am pleased to say, unlike the approach of the present government, tackled this pressing policy problem with measures that were well designed and which achieved their desired outcome. The desired outcome of course was to increase the proportion of Australians private health insurance cover-that is, to increase the proportion of people who were taking upon themselves the burden of funding their own health needs rather than simply leaving it to the public purse. The measures introduced by the Howard government involved a mixture of carrot and stick. The carrot of course was the introduction of the tax rebate, which is now under savage attack in the legislation before the House today. The stick of course was that if you did not take out private health insurance above certain income thresholds, you were required to pay the one per cent Medicare levy surcharge. Those measures were extremely successful. By 2007, private health insurance coverage had climbed to 44.6 per cent of the population. In my own electorate of Bradfield, 85 per cent of households have private health insurance. In other words, a very substantial proportion of the people in my electorate of Bradfield have taken the decision to incur, out of their household budget, expenditure against their future health needs because they want to make sure that they are doing what they can to provide for their own health needs and the costs of those health needs rather than simply leaving it to the public purse to support their health needs. I commend them for doing that. Let me turn therefore to my third point and perhaps the one which is most important, as the House considers this package of measures. What will be the impact of this legislation on the policy objective of choice and equity in the Australian healthcare system? I am sorry to say the effect of these measures will be very damaging. Some 2.4 million Australians are directly affected and they face an immediate increase in premiums, depending upon which tier they fall within, of between 14 per cent and 43 per cent. In turn, it is likely that there will be with a material reduction in the percentage of Australians who hold private health insurance. Conversely, there may also be people reducing the tier of insurance they hold. Private health insurance premiums are likely to rise and the inevitable consequence will be more pressure on the public health system and more pressure on the public purse which funds that public health system. Analysis by Deloittes, which has been cited by a number of speakers in the House this afternoon, predicts that some 1.6 million consumers are likely to withdraw from private health insurance cover, a number which is very, very different from the panglossian assumption in the work done by the Treasury that a mere 25,000 people will give up coverage. The further issue which presents itself is that the dollars which are purportedly saved out of this exercise must be offset against the extra cost which the government and in turn taxpayers will be required to bear towards the cost of the public health system. According to research conducted by Econtech and other parties in 2004, for every dollar of public funding going into the private health insurance rebate $2 was saved-that is to say, $2 towards the cost of the health system that was met by private health insurers, rather than being required to be paid out of the public purse. Many of the arguments that have been made by the government in favour of this measure do not bear up to close scrutiny. claimed to be a savings measure, but in real terms it is in fact a tax increase, because Australians above a certain income tax threshold who do not take out private health insurance will now face a further increase in their income tax rate, which could be as high as one per cent or 1.5 per cent. This in turn creates what might be described as a price shield for private health insurance premiums, as the eminent economist Henry Ergas has argued in the Australian newspaper today, and the consequence of that is that there will be an upward force on private health insurance premiums which would not have existed in the absence of the measures contained in this bill. The consequence in turn is that private health insurance will become increasingly unaffordable for a proportion of Australians. When you step back and look at the overall impact of these measures, it is very difficult to avoid the conclusion that what the Labor Party is doing here is pushing us towards a two-tier health system in Australia, where the poor or the less well off are in the public system and the more affluent are being pushed into a private health insurance funded private system. That seems a very curious approach for the Labor Party to be taking. It is a profound attack on the principles of both economies of scale and equity that the public health system is supposed to deliver and it is one of the many curiosities of this deeply ill-conceived piece of legislation, which attacks fundamentally Australians who seek to provide for themselves.",146
226,Mr FRYDENBERG,DOCUMENTS," I rise to speak on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011, Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2011 and Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge-Fringe Benefits) It is Bill 2011 before the House. The government's proposed changes, which will means test the private health insurance rebate, is a retrograde step that is vehemently opposed by the coalition. Means testing the rebate will drive up premiums, force millions of Australians to downgrade their private health care with many abandoning it all together and increase the pressure on an already stretched public health system. What is more, it is a fundamental breach of another Labor promise. From Kevin Rudd to Julia Gillard to Labor's last Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, the government repeatedly stated its commitment to maintaining the private health insurance rebate in its current form. In September 2007, Nicola Roxon said: On many occasions for many months, Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing private health insurance rebates … The Liberals continue to try to scare people into thinking Labor will take away the rebates. This is absolutely untrue. Then again in February 2009, Nicola Roxon said: … the government is firmly committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates. We now know the truth. Whatever modicum of trust was left after Labor's successive backflips on the carbon tax, offshore processing and mandatory precommitment for pokies, it must surely have evaporated after this latest government reversal. How can Labor honestly be trusted on anything? In contrast, the coalition has been consistent in our commitment to not means testing the private health insurance rebate. It goes right to the heart of an individual's freedom to choose and for what many consider to be an act of personal responsibility. We as Liberals want a robust private system in health just as in education, and we want this private system sitting side by side with a viable and effective public system. This was well put by Margaret Thatcher when she, as Prime Minister, said of private health insurance in the United Kingdom: I, along with something like 5 million other people, insure to enable me to go to hospital on the day I want, at the time. I want, and with a doctor I want. For me, that is absolutely vital … Like most people, I pay my dues to the National Health Service; I do not add to the queue, and if I said ""Look, because I cannot come when you want me, I must come when I want to"" you would accuse me of jumping the queue. I exercise my right as a free citizen to spend my own money in my own way, so that I can go in on the day, at the time, with the doctor I choose and get out fast."" So that was Margaret Thatcher and this thinking could equally apply to the Liberals' approach to private health insurance in this country. There you have it: the doyenne of British conservatism, whose record in limiting the excesses of the state are revered the world over, explaining why she and five million of her fellow Britons had private health insurance. So wouldn't Margaret Thatcher be surprised to learn that we in Australia, where our public system is even more effective than that of the UK or the United States, have around 12 million Australians with private health insurance-a remarkable 52.9 per cent of the population. In an electorate like mine, Kooyong, the number is even higher, with 74½ per cent of its people having private health insurance. This includes nearly 25,000 people who are single. In my electorate of Kooyong this means that more than 100,000 residents are covered by private health insurance. These changes will take money out of the pockets of people in Balwyn, Hawthorn, Kew, Camberwell, Deepdene and Canterbury. It means less money for them to meet the rising costs of living because this money will have to now go, if they choose, into keeping their private health insurance. Significantly, as my colleague and friend the member for Dickson and shadow minister for health said in a very valuable contribution in this House last week, a remarkable 5.6 million people with private health insurance have an annual household income of less than $50,000 and 3.4 million Australians with private health insurance have an annual household income of less than $35,000. Never let it be said that this is a rebate for the rich. These are aspirational Australians, some of whom do it very tough but take out private health insurance because they have made a considered choice. This is how they want to spend their money. This is the epitome of personal freedom. So too when it comes to the private health insurers in Australia themselves: a number of them are not-for-profit organisations whose bottom line is not to expand their margins but to achieve more affordable health care that delivers a better service for the consumer. We in this House should also not forget that private hospitals do much of the heavy lifting in our healthcare system. They look after 40 per cent of all patients in Australia. In 2009-10 this equated to 3½ million patients, and for elective surgery the numbers are even higher with nearly two in every three cases taking place in private hospitals. These are remarkable numbers and reflect the fact that the Australian people have been voting with their feet for private health insurance. Indeed, it was the Howard government's policies which facilitated this up that we now enjoy. In 1997 John Howard introduced a one per cent Medicare levy surcharge on taxable income, penalising those income earners who did not take up private health insurance; 1999 saw the introduction of the 30 per cent rebate; the year 2000 saw Lifetime Health cover and from 2005 the more elderly people in our community received greater rebates for taking up private health insurance. At every step of this reform process undertaken by the Howard government you could see the takeup rates dramatically improve. For example, in the 12 months after the introduction of the 30 per cent rebate in January 1999, the percentage of Australians with private hospital health cover jumped from 30.6 per cent to 43 per cent and in the years afterwards it jumped to the level we now enjoy at around 52.9 per cent. What is so concerning to members on this side of the House is the large number of people that will be negatively and directly impacted by this government's legislation. Around 2.4 million people will see immediate rises in their premiums of 14 per cent, 29 per cent or 43 per cent depending on their income levels. According to the Australian Health Insurance Association, over 800,000 more Australians will be admitted to public hospitals. In their analysis, the top-tier consultancy Deloittes has said that 175,000 Australians will withdraw their private health cover in the first year and 583,000 Australians will downgrade their cover. Over a five-year period those numbers will dramatically rise to 1.6 million people who will withdraw their private cover and 4.3 million people who will downgrade their cover. Even the state-owned Medibank Private has come out publicly and stated that 37,000 of its members will remove their private cover and 92½ thousand of their members will very high takedowngrade their cover. I have no doubt that the government's decision to means-test public health insurance will be deeply unpopular with the Australian people. The public understands that this is not about the future costs of the program. The rebate as a proportion of the total healthcare spend, public and private, has stayed constant at 3½ per cent for the last decade. The public understand that this is not about improving the state of our public healthcare system, for they have heard all that before-the hospital fix that Kevin Rudd promised but which never arrived and the superclinics that were promised but never built. But they do know that this government is under enormous budgetary stress as a result of its own fiscal mismanagement. This is just a mad dash for cash. They need to scramble for a surplus and in doing so will hit Australian families once again. The problem is that in doing so the consequences of these changes will be profound. Healthy and young people will make up thousands of the thousands of people who give up their private cover, reducing the cross-subsidy that is a hallmark of insurance schemes. Premiums will rise, membership will fall and the overall pressure on our public health system will become even more pronounced. Be under no illusions. This is bad policy from a bad government and it will come at a bad time for Australian families. This legislation before the House to put a means test on private health insurance in this country must be opposed by all clearthinking members who are interested not just in the good health of our country's balance sheet but also in the physical health and well-being of all Australians.",149
227,Mr TUDGE,DOCUMENTS," I also rise to speak against the passage of the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011, which I believe will be a dagger through the heart of the private health insurance industry. I commend the member for Kooyong, who was just speaking, for his remarks, and I associate myself with his comments. There are three reasons I am against this bill before us. First, it is based a broken promise. Second, it is bad policy that will cause premiums to go up for all Australians. And, third, it is bad economics; it will just lead to greater cost-shifting to the states and longer public hospital waiting lists. Let me go to the first point-the broken promise. This bill is just another breach of faith from this Labor government. It is another broken promise. We had a firm commitment-in words, in writing-from this government that it would not be amending the private health insurance rebate scheme. The Labor Party made this very, very clear, and it did so time and time again. Perhaps nothing is more clear on this than the letter Mr Kevin Rudd, who at the time was the federal Labor leader, wrote to the chief executive of the Australian Health Insurance Association in late 2007. He wrote: Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians. There are many other occasions on which this very firm commitment not to amend the private health insurance rebate was made. But what do we have before us? We have a further breach of faith from this government against an explicit commitment it had made. The second reason I am against this bill is that it is poor policy that will push premiums up for everyday Australians. Madam Deputy Speaker, as you may be aware, an estimated 12 million Australians now have private health insurance. That constitutes over half the Australian population, or 52.9 per cent. Of those, about 10.3 million have hospital treatment cover. The people who take out on private health insurance are not, overall, just the wealthiest in Australian society-not by any stretch of the imagination. To give you a few figures to prove this point: 5.6 million people who have private health insurance have a household income of less than $50,000 per annum and 3.4 million have a household income of less than $35,000 per annum. This is not an individual's income; this is a collective household income. It is a broad cross-section of Australian society that is taking out private health insurance. This is a good thing. It is a good thing that a broad cross-section of society takes out private health insurance. It is a good thing that so many people take out private health insurance, because the more people who take out private health insurance the less pressure there is on the public system. As we know there are extensive waiting lists on the public system, there are stresses and there are pressures on it. The more we can take off the public health system the better it is for everybody. It has not always been the case that we have had such a high proportion of people who take out private health insurance. Far from it. If you go back to the Hawke and Keating governments people were dropping out and the private health insurance system was at quite a critical point. From memory, I believe at that time the percentage of those with private health insurance was down to about 33 per cent of the population. When Howard and Costello came to government in 1996 they saw this problem and tried to rectify it. Indeed, they put in a number of steps over the course of their government to lift the proportion of people who took out private health insurance, and they had a remarkable effect. An estimated 75 per cent more people took out private health insurance as a result of the measures that the Howard-Costello government put in place. That high proportion has been maintained all the way through to this present time. But now we are again at a critical stage. We are at a moment where the tides may turn once again, and turn in a negative direction. What will be the impact of the proposed changes contained within the bill before us? As we know, some 2.4 million people will be directly affected. They will face immediate increases in their premiums of 14 per cent, 29 per cent or 43 per cent, depending on their income tier. That is a huge percentage increase in their premiums. This is at a time when many people, even people who are relatively well off, with incomes of $100,000 or $150,000, still have mortgages to pay and when electricity bills, groceries, water bills, child care et cetera are all going up. But the increases will not be limited to those 2.4 million people who are on higher incomes. Rather, the impacts will be felt by everybody who has private health insurance-every single one of those 12 million people. Deloitte, who have done some analysis of the bill before us, believe that, as a result the changes proposed, premiums across the board will go up by 10 per cent above what they would ordinarily go up by. Ordinarily we see premiums go up five, six or seven per cent per annum. Here we are talking about potentially a 17 per cent increase in premiums. The government's own private health insurer, Medibank Private, predicts that 37,000 of their members will drop cover because of the increase in premiums. They predict that 95,000 of their members will downgrade their cover because of the increase in premiums that will come about as a result of this bill. That is just one insurance company. That does not include Bupa, Australian Unity or all the other private health insurance companies. That is just one private health insurance company, the government's own, which estimates that 37,000 people with drop out and 95,000 people will downgrade. Deloitte believe that in the short term 175,000 people could withdraw from private hospital cover and over 500,000 people will downgrade. In the medium term, the five year horizon, they estimate that 1.6 million people will drop out and 4.3 million people will downgrade. If these figures are anywhere close to being accurate, and I believe they will be, we will be seriously winding back the clock. People will be dropping out again in droves and premiums will skyrocket. This will just put more pressure on the public hospital system, which it does not need at present. More pressure on the public hospital system also means more pressure on taxpayers, who have to pay for the public hospital system. On that particular point, we have some modelling suggesting that every dollar of funding provided to the private health insurance rebate saves $2 for the government. So, overall, the analysis based on the bill in front of us is that $3.8 billion of extra will be required to fund the public hospital system as a result of these particular changes. In my own electorate over 84,000 people have private health insurance. These are not wealthy people; they are everyday, middleincome Australians. They take out private health insurance not because they are particularly well-off but because they like the convenience, the choice and some of the peace of mind associated with it. Another significant reason for it in my electorate is that they want to have access to Knox Private Hospital, which is for most residents in my electorate the closest and most convenient hospital for them to attend. It is easy for them, and their family members, to get there. Under the changes proposed, many people may have to look further afield in order to access the hospital of their choice, because they may not be able to afford the premiums, should they go up as we expect they will. Why are the Labor Party doing this, given that it is based on a broken promise and it is poor policy, which we know will put up costs for everyday Australians and cause thousands of people to drop out? We know it will cost the taxpayer potentially billions of extra dollars overall. Why are they Party doing it? There are two reasons. The first is ideological. The Labor Party have never liked private health insurance. They have always argued against the additional benefits that the Howard-Costello government put in place. Despite what they said publicly before election, we have always known that secretly they have wanted to reduce the number of people covered by it. The second reason that they are doing it, though, is because the Labor Party-the Rudd-Gillard government-have blown the budget so systemically and so categorically that they are now looking for every single dollar that they can possibly find to create the elusive budget surplus come budget time this year. As I pointed out, overall the impact of these bills on the taxpayers will be a negative one, with them potentially paying billions of dollars extra as people shift back to the private health system. But the accounting trick-and this is the only thing that the government are interested in-means that in the short term there could be savings, because it will shift costs from the Commonwealth across to the states. The states still have to find the money somewhere. They are raising taxes from the same constituents, whether they be in my electorate or any other electorate. But the federal government will be able to make a short-term cost saving, according to the Treasury figures. These bills are in front of us because they do not like private health insurance and never have and because they are desperate to find extra savings because the budget is in such poor shape. This provides them with a neat little accounting trick in the short term to get them through the grave difficulties that they have at the moment. Let me summarise the position in relation to these bills. They are based on a broken promise-that is the first point. They implement poor policy that will see premiums increase across the board for everyday Australians on very modest incomes. It will see people fall out of private health insurance and put greater pressure on the public health system. That is the second point. Finally, my third point is that these bills are poor economics. They increase the pressure on the taxpayer overall and create additional financial pressure on state governments that the Commonwealth avoids in the short term. I am firmly against these bills. I believe that all sensible members of this parliament should also vote against these bills.",152
228,Mr BALDWIN,DOCUMENTS," I rise tonight to address the Fairer Private Health Insurances Bill 2011, the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2011 and the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge-Fringe Benefits) Bill 2011. I am pained to even call the package by its name. This package of bills is not designed to make things fairer for Australians and nor is it designed to make things better in our national healthcare system. This legislation is designed to cut the healthcare rebate that families and singles are eligible for. That means nothing less than private health insurance becoming more expensive for working families in this nation. That will compound on increases in the cost of living across the board. We are battling a healthcare crisis in this country. Public waiting lists have been spiralling out of control and now this government wants to cut private healthcare insurance to save a few dollars. The hallmark of this government is mismanagement. This is a Labor government that is happy to spend $50 billion on a National Broadband Network that has only 4,000 customers after five years. It is happy to spend $2 billion on its border protection blowout, including cigarettes for detainees. And yet, when it comes to the lives and well-being of the people of Australia, this is where the ALP thinks they should be saving money. Just a couple of months ago, in November, I read a story in the Newcastle Herald by Jacqui Jones entitled 'Hunter surgery schedule blowout'. It is important that I quote this article to the parliament. It read: Surgery waiting lists have blown out at some Hunter hospitals to almost four times longer than the national average, with waits increasing 20 times over in the past year for some procedures, the latest data shows. The most recent information on hospitals' performance will be made publicly available today through the federal government's MyHospitals website. It is based on information provided by public health departments to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. A Newcastle Herald analysis of data for Hunter hospitals showed blowouts in waiting times for surgery in 2010-11, compared with 2009-10, and waits that were longer than national averages. At Calvary Mater Newcastle, the median wait for plastic surgery was 93 days in 2010-11, compared with the national average of 24 days. This was up from a wait of four days in 200910, and 22 days nationally. Waiting times for gall bladder removal and hernia repair increased over the year and were longer than national averages. At John Hunter Hospital, eye surgery patients waited twice as long as their national economic counterparts. Delays were long for cataract extraction, with the 282-day median wait (90 days nationally) in 2010-11 up from 176 days (86 days nationally) in 2009-10. Orthopaedic patients took longer to get to surgery, including for hip and knee replacements, at John Hunter Hospital than patients booked at hospitals elsewhere in Australia. At Maitland Hospital, orthopaedic lists blew out to a 234-day median wait (national 64 days) in 2010-11, compared with 169 days (national 62 days) in 2009-10. Increases were also experienced within the year and beyond Australia-wide trends for gynaecological surgery and haemorrhoid removal at Maitland. The waiting times at Kurri Kurri Hospital for ear, nose and throat surgery and at Belmont Hospital for a hysterectomy increased over the year and were longer than national averages. Here we have in the Hunter people waiting longer than ever before and yet this Labor government wants to force more people onto the public health system, thereby making the situation much worse. We have people in the Hunter waiting up to four times longer for surgery than their interstate counterparts. And yet all of the members from the Hunter-the member for Newcastle, Sharon Grierson; the member for Hunter, Joel Fitzgibbon; the member for Charlton, Greg Combet; and the member for Shortland, Jill Hall-are going to push this legislation through. And it looks like they will be joined by Rob Oakeshott, the member for Lyne. They are all just champing at the bit to support the economic mismanagement of this Labor government, which will be to the detriment of people in our region. This really should be a no-brainer. Even the Labor Party should be able to see how destructive this legislation will be. However, I will spell it out, just in case they have not worked it out yet: this legislation will make private health insurance more expensive for 2.4 million Australians. For some of those people it will mean an increase in premiums of 43 per cent. That is a cost of almost 1½ times what they are already paying. Deloitte have done the figures and, under this legislation, 1.6 million Australians are likely to drop their private health cover over the next five years. And, of those who do not drop it altogether, a further 4.3 million will downgrade the level of their coverage. The minister has not even tried to deny this-in fact, she has admitted that people will drop their cover. When coupled with increases in the costs of living, including groceries, rent, power and gas because of this Labor government's reckless carbon tax, yet to come, this is just another attack on families and on their budgets and it is a thing they just cannot afford. According to this Labor government, if you work hard to provide private health care for yourself and your family, you should be punished-you are doing too well for yourself and you are not paying enough. We only have to take a step back and look at why private health insurance rebates were provided in the first place to understand why the current system works so well. When the Medicare levy surcharge and lifetime health cover were introduced under the previous coalition government, private health insurance coverage increased from 34 per cent in 1996 to 44 per cent in 2007. Today private hospitals treat two in five of all patients in Australia, which accounts for some 3.5 million patients every single year. If those patients do not have private health cover, that is an extra 3.5 million patients for the public health system to cope with-or not cope with, which is more likely the case. I want to put this into perspective in my own electorate of Paterson. In my electorate there are 46,184 people aged 18 or over with private health insurance, according to the figures published on 1 January 2011. That is around half the adults in my electorate. According to national statistics, 13 per cent of people will drop private health cover under this legislation within just five years. A further 36 per cent of people will downgrade their cover. In Paterson that equates to 6,004 people dropping their private health insurance altogether and 16,626 people downgrading their cover. If just half those people who drop their cover need surgery, that is an extra 3,000 people who are going to be forced into the Hunter health system waiting list-and that is just in Paterson alone; that is not taking into account the electorates of Hunter, Shortland, Charlton, Newcastle or Lyne, which also rely on the Hunter's hospitals. And that does not include those people who have reduced their cover and can no longer go into private hospitals for certain procedures. I know I have just gone through a lot of numbers, but it is important that we understand the real, on-the-ground impacts of this destructive legislation: an extra 3,000 people from Paterson waiting in line for surgery, pushing back other patients and being pushed back themselves, is the real impact. So it is no surprise to me that, with reckless money-making moves like this one, the Australian public does not trust the Prime Minister or her Labor colleagues when it comes to the economy. In fact, a poll taken last Saturday and published in today's Australian shows that the opposition leader, Tony Abbott, is far more trusted with money matters than the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard. He has a nine-point lead on the question of handling the economy, with the Prime Minister having fallen by 14 percentage points since August 2010. Why would the public trust this government on the economy? After all, it is the same government who took a $20 billion surplus and turned it into a $96 billion deficit. This the same government that takes a solution each and every time and turns it into a problem. There were years that passed without a single boat arrival under the former coalition government",154
229,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DOCUMENTS, Order! The member is straying from the content of the bill. I call you back to the bill.,157
230,Mr BALDWIN,DOCUMENTS,"I am showing a point on economic mismanagement, Madam Deputy Speaker.",157
231,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DOCUMENTS,It needs to be relevant to the bill.,157
232,Mr BALDWIN,DOCUMENTS,"With this economic mismanagement we now have 15,000 people illegally arriving by boat, putting further pressure on the health system. Now the ALP want to do the same thing to private health insurance. They want to create a problem where there isn't one. Of course, we also know that you just cannot trust this government. What we keep getting is more and more examples of this government's dishonesty-a whatever-it-takes approach by government. After all, it was this Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, who said that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led-and yet we are set for the carbon tax to be introduced from 1 July. It was the same person, when the shadow minister for health, who said in the Weekend Australian in a letter to the editor, in her own writing: The truth is I never had a secret plan to scrap the private health insurance rebate and, contrary to Mr Latham's diaries, do not support such a claim. For all Australians who want to have private health insurance the private health insurance rebate would have remained under a Labor government. I gave an iron-clad guarantee of that during the election. The difference between Tony 'rock-solid, iron-clad' Abbott and me is that, when I make an iron-clad is commitment, I actually intend on keeping it. In a further letter to the editor of the Courier Mail on 23 September 2004 she said: Your correspondent Russell MCGregor should have no concerns that Labor will erode or abolish the 30 per cent government rebate for private health insurance. Labor is committed to the maintenance of this rebate and I have given an iron-clad guarantee on that on a number of occasions. That was from Julia Gillard, opposition health spokesperson. In fact, my favourite quote is: 'I grow tired of saying this: Labor is committed to the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate,' in a letter to the editor of the Hobart Mercury. It is just not the Prime Minister, who was then the shadow health minister who gave such guarantees. We only need to look at the current Minister for Foreign Affairs, Kevin Rudd, who, as Leader of the Opposition in 2007, wrote to Dr Armitage of the Australian Health Insurance and said: Thank you for your letter of 29 October 2007 seeking clarification on Federal Labor's policy phoney, regarding private health insurance. Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made it clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians. Federal Labor will also maintain Lifetime Health Cover and the Medicare Levy Surcharge. Labor will maintain the existing framework for regulating private health insurance, including the process for approval of premium increases. Zero per cent premium adjustment is not Labor policy. I understand Nicola Roxon's office has also confirmed with you that Federal Labor has no plans to require private health insurance funds to make equivalent payments to public hospitals for patients who elect to be treated as private patients. I trust this allays your concerns. Federal values its relationship with the private health insurance sector and we look forward to continuing this regardless of the outcome on November 24. Yours sincerely Kevin Rudd Federal Labor Leader Member for Griffith Nicola Roxon, then Minister for Health and Ageing, was quoted in the Age on 24 February 2009 as saying: The Government is firmly committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates … Yet less than three months later, on 12 May 2009, the insurance rebate changes were announced in the budget. This is a government that says one thing and does another. This is a government that finds a solution and creates a problem-over and over again. We are into 2012 and it is clear that this government neither respects nor values its relationship with the people of Australia who are paying for private health insurance and contributing to support a reduction in pressure on the public health system. All this government seems to want to do, in fact its whole agenda, is to claw back money from working families to prop up its failed economic management position, a position that has created record debt. This is a desperate move by a desperate government that has squandered the dollars of millions of Australians on wasted programs like the insulation tragedy and the school halls rip-off. I say to you, Madam Deputy Speaker Livermore, to each and every Labor member in this place and to the Independents: the health of our fellow Australians is far more important than all of the other programs that this government has wasted money on. This government will see, under its stewardship, a blow-out in the waiting lists in the public health system. This Labor government will see, under its stewardship, private hospitals close because of a lack of patients. This government will see, under its stewardship, the health standards of the people of Australia deteriorate because it mismanaged the economy and saw as a sacrifice those hard-working Australians who take out private health insurance and who reduce the pressure on the public system. It should be the government's agenda, as it was under the previous coalition government and as it was stated to be by the previous Labor opposition, to support private health insurance to make it affordable for working families. That is why I call on the Independents to refuse to support this legislation that will hurt the people in their constituencies. I reject these bills as presented to the House.",157
233,Mr MATHESON,DOCUMENTS," Today marks the third time that this government has tried to launch its disgraceful attack on the forgotten families of Macarthur, families who are already doing it tough in these difficult times. This government is shamefully out of touch with the Australian people and with Australian values. The very existence of this bill represents yet another broken promise from Labor. Labor promised, hand on heart, that it would not touch the private health insurance rebate. I must be having deja vu, because I can vividly recollect a promise to Andrew Wilkie about poker machine reforms, a promise to the Australian people to return the budget to surplus and a promise that 'there will be no carbon tax under a government I lead,' to borrow a phrase from the Prime Minster. Time after time we have seen repeated betrayals of the people of Australia. This Labor-Greens alliance will say anything to be in government, but, once in government, turn their backs on the people who elected them. They say one thing but do another. This government has a trust and credibility problem with the people of Australia. This bill represents yet another botched and broken election promise that will, without a doubt, result in greater cost of living pressures on families across this nation. The Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011, the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2011 and the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge-Fringe Benefits) Bill 2011 are a key part of the Prime Minister's ideological arsenal against the freedom of choice in health care. Private health insurance gives people the choice of treating doctor, the choice of when and where they can access health services, the choice of surgery options and the choice to be treated in a private hospital. Private health insurance does not take away from the public health system, but instead adds significant value to Australia's total healthcare resources. The private health insurance rebate is a policy that has been staunchly defended by the coalition because it is, simply put, a good policy. The 30 per cent rebate has had a direct result in taking pressure off the public health system, all the while adding value to the health system as a whole. Australia's public health system is highly regarded and does a fantastic job with the resources at its disposal. I am confident that, under the leadership of the Liberal New South Wales government of Premier Barry O'Farrell, the New South Wales public health system will see many positive developments over the coming years. It is not feasible to say that the public health system in Australia could survive without the complementary benefits that the private health system provides. This bill is a shameless measure shifting cost from the Commonwealth to the states' public systems. When the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate was introduced by the Howard government, the national coverage of private health insurance rose from 34 per cent to 44 per cent. The Howard government had the foresight to also introduce the Medicare levy surcharge for those who should be able to afford private health insurance but for whatever reasons had not taken it up. This measure ensured that those who chose not to contribute to their own health care through the private health care system would still contribute to the public health care system. The test used to determine whether a person would be liable to pay the Medicare levy surcharge would include taxable income, reportable fringe benefits, reportable superannuation contributions and total net investment losses. This government is trying to distort these provisions by seeking to apply the same income tests to determine whether families will also lose their rebate. It is a perversion of what the Medicare levy surcharge sought to achieve. This test will not just be used for people who opt out of eligible private health insurance, but apply to people who are currently paying their premiums and benefiting from the 30 per cent rebate. These people will lose out: some will be pushed into a lesser category of the rebate and some will lose their rebate all together. All Australians will face higher premiums because of this disgraceful government's actions. The private health insurance rebate gives families in Macarthur the incentive to provide for their own healthcare needs and get a little back from the government for doing so. This support, in the form of a 30 per cent rebate on eligible private health insurance policies, contributes back into the health system many times over through private health insurance premiums. For a couple in their mid-30s with two children, basic hospital and extras cover will cost at least $3,000 a year without the rebate. If people are going to be socially responsible and put their discretionary income towards their own healthcare costs, why should we punish them? Their investment in their health and, in turn, in the private health system, contributes to the resources that are available in both the public and private health systems. If this government decides to take away the incentive for people to purchase private health insurance, we risk losing the entire premium, and in turn create added pressure on the public system. This ideological attack on private health insurance may represent a short-term saving, but the longer-term implications on families are far-reaching. The immediate financial impacts of this bill will not just be felt by the 2.4 million people on higher incomes who will face immediate increases of their premiums of 14 per cent, 29 per cent and 43 per cent. All Australians with private health insurance face higher premiums in the future if these changes proceed. Deloitte have predicted that private health insurance premiums will rise 10 per cent above what they would otherwise be. In addition, Deloitte's analysis of the proposed changes shows that in the first year 175,000 people would be expected to drop their private hospital cover, and a further 583,000 are expected to downgrade their cover. Over five years, Deloitte's modelling forecasts that 1.6 million people will drop their cover and 4.3 million will downgrade. This is in stark contrast to the minister's figures of only 27,000 to drop their cover. Indeed, the government owned insurer, Medibank Private, has predicted that 37,000 of its members alone will drop their cover and 92,500 will downgrade. How did the minister get it so wrong? This is yet another example of the government's botched attempts at health reform and lack of thorough planning in policy making. It is a case of this Prime Minister and Labor yet again meddling with a good policy that works, a policy that delivers and a policy that has provided quality health care to Australian families. This bill is already bearing the hallmarks of the Malaysia solution all over again. With each person either dropping or downgrading their cover, there is a flow-on effect of a net reduction of resources within the private healthcare system. Each policy downgrade will place greater pressure on the public health system, all the while punishing those who continue in the private health system. The government has not even bothered to disclose the numbers of people expected to downgrade their private health insurance coverage. It is reasonable to expect that many people will seek a cheaper product with fewer procedures covered, which will have second-round effect for public hospitals. This represents $3.8 billion in will additional recurrent costs for the public sector. In Macarthur 63,828 people are covered by some form of private health insurance, representing 47.8 per cent of voters. Suffice to say, this legislation will affect close to half of my electorate. At the 2007 election the government promised, hand on heart, that they would not touch the private health insurance rebate. However, soon after elected, they tried to push through this legislation, not once but twice. The Senate soundly rejected it. Now the Prime Minister is relying on her good graces with the Greens to push this bill through and once again betray the trust of families in Macarthur and Australia-wide. I guess it must get easier the more you do it. The government have no foot to stand on when they say they will deliver on a promise. Just look at their track record. They have bungled every program and policy that they have laid their hands on. Now this government is attempting to undermine both the public and private health systems simultaneously. This legislation is nothing more than a noxious housewarming gift for a newly elected NSW government with the monumental task of fixing up more than 15 years of total and utter neglect of the public health system under Labor. Allied health services are also expected to bear the brunt of this government's attack on private health insurance. It is expected that 2.8 million people with general treatment cover are going to withdraw and 5.7 million to downgrade over five years. This means fewer people accessing allied health services, which means less income and fewer jobs. Families in Macarthur are already financially stretched to the limit. Many pensioners are at the point where they have had to give up their private health insurance after the recent rise in premiums-and at a time of life where they cannot afford to lose it. The government's proposed changes are just going to make a bad situation worse. The coalition has strongly supported giving Australians the choice of affordable private health insurance. The 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance premiums is a proven policy that we have seen works. Families in Macarthur are going to be negatively impacted by this legislation, and many will have no option but to forgo private health insurance and rely on the already stretched public system. This is a bad policy that will do nothing but harm both our public and private health systems and I would urge members of the House to keep faith with their electorates and reject it. So I say this to members opposite: stand up for affordable and accessible private health cover. Stand up for your community, your seniors and your youth. Stand up for a fair go for Aussie families. Stick to the ironclad guarantee that the Prime Minister previously made to the Australian public: 'Under no circumstances will we touch the private health insurance rebate.' As late as August 2010 the Prime Minister also stated, 'Medicare rebates are safe under Labor.' How safe? These bills change all that. No wonder there is a trust and credibility problem with this government.",158
234,Mr CHRISTENSEN,DOCUMENTS," In rising to address this Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill, I have some difficulty getting past the name of the bill itself. It makes it sound like the bill will make things 'fairer'. But this bill has nothing to do with fairness. In fact, it is the exact opposite of fairness. It is about trying to justify the introduction of what is most certainly not fair. I am reminded of the late master of wit Groucho Marx, who said: 'The secret of life is honesty and fair dealing. If you can fake that, you've got it made.' That is a rather appropriate quote for this bill, I thought, because the bill is anything but honest and it is trying to fake fairness. In reality it is not about fairness at all. It is actually more in line with the views of the other Marx, Karl, and penalising the so called rich. It is about a desperate bid to create a surplus and it is about robbing the hard-working people of this nation who will do the work to create that surplus, if it ever happens. It has been 21 years since the Labor Party posted a surplus and it must be getting embarrassing for the government every year as they introduce new budgets. We have the Treasurer here trying to say that he is going to get one next year-because he will do anything to create the illusion of a surplus; just making it look like a surplus temporarily will do. But Australian families know that what this government says is only good for a few months at best. But this time there is not enough smoke, there aren't enough mirrors. So now we see the Treasurer hoping to pull a rabbit out of the hat-a $2.78 billion rabbit. They were running around, rifling through the files, looking up old copies of Hansard, scanning the demographic data, trying to find a sector of the community that is getting ahead, trying to find someone who hopes for a better future and is willing to work hard to achieve it. That was their bunny and they found it: a dead and twice-buried plan to tax those people who work hard for a better life. They have found yet another way to rob the rewards that were earned by someone else. So here we are today, once again standing up to the Labor Party, the party of big tax. The title of this bill purports to be about a health insurance incentive. That word is important: 'incentive'. The legislation is not about incentive at all. There is no carrot here. This is the stick and stick approach. This government is pulling out the stick to those who pay for private health insurance. Anyone who has the gall to work hard and earn $80,000 or more a year will now have to pay more for their health insurance. That is not an incentive; that is a disincentive. It is a disincentive to earn more and it is a disincentive to purchase private health cover. Just in case this legislation means you cannot afford private health cover anymore, the government has another stick waiting for you-a baseball bat to slug more tax out of you in the form of the Medicare levy. So what we have is a lose-lose situation. This plan was beaten down twice before when there was so much opposition that even this government promised it would not happen again. Yet here it is again today. Prior to the 2007 election, we had Labor's then shadow health minister promising, in a media statement from 26 September 2007: Federal Labor rejects the Liberal scare campaign around the private health insurance rebates. On many occasions for many months, Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing Private Health rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians. It goes on to say: The Liberals continue to try to scare people into thinking Labor will take away the rebates. This is absolutely untrue. If this is absolutely untrue, then why is Labor introducing a bill today to do exactly that again? I thought maybe there was a typo in the media release and that the member for Gellibrand meant that it was absolutely correct. But then she was backed up two months later by then federal Labor leader, Kevin Rudd, the future Prime Minister, private going to the 2007 election with this promise-this is what the member for proposed Griffith wrote to Dr Michael Armitage of the Australian Health Insurance Association just four days before the 2007 election: Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians. We even had the current Prime Minister, back when she was shadow Minister for Health and Ageing, saying this to Laurie Oakes: We will leave the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate undisturbed because we understand it's factored into family incomesa very interesting observation from the Prime Minister. Clearly the Australian Labor Party no longer understands Australian families or the fact that they have to factor these costs into their household budgets. So here we are debating a 'fairer' private health insurance incentive bill. What is fair about this scenario? Consider two young men. Let us call one Bill. He lives and works in Melbourne and earns $79,000. The other-let us call him Ben-lives and works in regional Australia, participating in the resources boom that currently underpins our economy. Bill in Melbourne leads a pretty comfortable life. He has no trade and no tertiary studies behind him. He has spent long periods on unemployment benefits. He currently has a nine-to-five job which pays a good income of $79,000. He rents a large furnished apartment in the CBD for $450 a week. He does not need a car and walks to the MCG to watch his football team play, or to the cricket, and it is a pretty good life. Now let us look at Ben, the bloke in country Queensland. He spent three years doing an apprenticeship when he supplemented his income to survive by working a casual job on nights and weekends. He has never missed a day of work and currently works long hours to earn $80,000. He has to maintain a work ute to get to job sites and carry his tools. He pays $550 a week in rent and if he wants to watch the Bulldogs play football, he is up for $600 in flights and $600 accommodation before a ball is bounced. Groceries, fuel, even a cup of coffee in his area are much more expensive because a labour shortage and high freight costs are pushing up the price of everything. I am sure Ben cannot wait for the carbon tax because he will cop the worse of the cost increases, being in regional Queensland. He will not be compensated in any way because his income is deemed 'too high'. As a result, Bill puts his feet up in his Melbourne apartment, comfortable in the knowledge that, even though he has a lower salary, he has a much higher disposable income compared with Ben. Under this 'fairer' legislation, Ben will also be facing higher costs for private health insurance. He works harder and longer hours. He has less money to spend but this government wants to tax him more, even though he already pays more tax than Bill. How is that fair? This is not an exaggerated case to make a point. This government wants to remove private health insurance incentives entirely from a family earning $249,000 this year. They would have us believe that this family sits around, watching a big plasma television, waiting for a $250,000 cheque to turn up in the mail. They would have us believe a family earning $249,000 or more a year are greedy, rich people who should be robbed with an unfair tax. This family is not just a statistic. It is a family of real human beings with real jobs, real children and real expenses. For a husband and wife who both work in the mines at Moranbah in your electorate of Capricornia, Madam Deputy Speaker Livermore, where they live with their four children, to rent an average four-bedroom home they will be paying between $1,800 and $3,200 a week. Some rents are even higher. That translates to between $93,000 and $166,000 just for rent. By the time you take out income tax and rent, our family on $249,000 a year out in Moranbah probably cannot afford to feed the kids, let alone pay fully for private health insurance. This government would have us believe that these people are evil people of 'privilege'-the old class warfare bogey. This government does not even know these people because it stopped connecting with real people a long time ago. This government wants to smack such a family back down to the lowest level because they dared to have a dream-they wanted to get ahead. I noticed an interesting headline in the Australian on Friday from a family talking about the costs this legislation will impose on them. The headline was a quote from Ms Kylie Richards from Adelaide, who, with her husband, owns a commercial flooring business. She said: It's ridiculous-the better we do, the more the government takes … Every time we try to get ahead and don't rely on the welfare system, we get a guarantee they'll hit us again. Ms Richards has summed up beautifully this government's fallback position: none shall get ahead. I can imagine the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport taking a quote from Gandalf. They shall not pass is what he is saying to Australian families. What this government will do with this bill is crucify both the economy and the health system. According to this government, there are 2.4 million people living a life of privilege this country, because that is how many people will be affected by this legislation. The result will be thousands-tens of thousands, I would say-of Australians dropping private health insurance because they simply cannot afford it anymore. In my electorate of Dawson, there will be hundreds, if not thousands, of residents who will be worse off. Families that are already under pressure from the escalating costs of living will have to make a saving somewhere else. The minister has claimed 27,000 individuals would drop their health insurance cover if this bill were passed. But the government owned insurer Medibank Private suggests that figure is more, that in fact 37,000 of their members alone will drop their cover and a massive 92,500 people will downgrade their private health cover. That is just Medibank Private and what they see happening with their own members. Taking an independent, industry-wide approach, the Australian Health Insurance Association commissioned Deloitte to assess the impact of this proposal. Their findings were that, should this bill be passed, 1.6 million consumers would drop private hospital cover, a further 4.3 million would downgrade their cover and a further 2.8 million would drop their general cover. Deloitte also has predicted that health insurance premiums would rise by 10 per cent over and above what they would otherwise be. So then everyone will cop it because of this government's bill. As families and individuals leave private health in droves, this government will be rubbing its hands with glee. On the face of it-fingers crossed, guys!-that will be a massive saving for this year's budget deficit. It may be enough of a saving to create the illusion of a surplus. But the truth is that, for every dollar the government spends on in health insurance rebates, the private health insurers are spending $2 on the provision of health services. Those private health services will now have to be provided by the public health system. What this government is hoping to do is throw a 'hospital pass' to the states for the sake of taxing Australian families and squeezing out its first surplus in 22 years. Being a Queenslander, I find that a frightening proposition. The Labor government in Queensland has plumbed the very depths of incompetence already without having to cope with more pressure on its health service. Private hospitals currently treat 40 per cent of all patients in Australiasome 3.5 million patients in the 2009-10 financial year. How will the bungling Queensland Health system-an organisation that the Premier tells us has failed under her watch-cope with their share of the increased workload? Private hospitals currently perform 64 per cent of elective surgeries in Australia. Where will the funding come from for the public health system to cope with such an increased workload? In creating this 'damned if you do and damned if you don't' situation for families with private health cover, the government is basically kicking an own goal. Even if this white rabbit is combined with enough smoke and mirrors to create the illusion of a surplus, it will be just a matter of time before the mirrors crack and the smoke clears. When it does, Australian families who can no longer afford private health insurance will see nothing but a rotting rabbit carcass that carries the stench of deception, incompetence and betrayal.",161
235,Mr TEHAN,DOCUMENTS," I rise tonight to talk on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011. There are three points that I would like to make loud and clear. The first is that what we are debating tonight is an issue of trustwhether we can trust this government to say one thing before an election and then do that after an election. It is sad to say that this private health insurance piece of legislation that we are debating tonight adds to the list of broken promises. I would also like to discuss its implications on the cost of living, which is increasing on a daily basis for Australian citizens. This piece of legislation, sadly, will once again add to this cost of living. The third point I would like to make is about what this bill will do to cost shifting from the Commonwealth to the states. The state governments are already facing increased health costs. The Labor government on coming into power said that they were going to do something about that, that they were going to stop the blame game, that they were going to fix our health system. But what do we see them doing with this piece of legislation? They are moving the cost of health care away from the Commonwealth and onto the states. Those are the three issues that I would like to garner tonight. I will start on the basic issue of trust. Truth is a five-letter word and I suggest to the Prime Minister-if it is okay, Madam Deputy Speaker-that she might learn how to spell it and act on it because, as we saw with the carbon tax, one thing was said before the last election and one thing was done after it. To be fair to the Prime Minister, on this occasion she was the member of a cabinet. She was not the Prime Minister but she was a member of the cabinet when the decision was made to say one thing before the 2007 election on the private health insurance rebate and then do another thing afterwards. But it was a precursor of what was to come. Let us look at the letter that Kevin Rudd wrote to the honourable Dr Michael Armitage. I think it is worth just briefly going through it. It says: Dear Dr Armitage, Thankyou for your letter of 29 October 2007 seeking clarification on Federal Labor's policy regarding private health insurance. Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians. Federal Labor will also maintain Lifetime Health Cover and the Medicare Levy Surcharge. Labor will maintain the existing framework for regulating private health insurance, including the process for approval of premium increases. Zero per cent premium adjustment is not Labor policy; I understand Nicola Roxon's office has also confirmed with you that Federal Labor has no plans to require private health insurance funds to make equivalent payments to public hospitals for patients who elect to be treated as private patients. I trust this allays your concerns. Federal Labor values its relationship with the private health insurance sector and we look forward to this continuing regardless of the election outcome on November 24. As we know, Kevin Rudd was elected Prime Minister and Julia Gillard became a cabinet minister of the Rudd government.",165
236,Mr Baldwin,DOCUMENTS,And an assassin.,166
237,Mr TEHAN,DOCUMENTS,"And later an assassin, as my good friend the shadow minister for tourism so rightly interjects. As soon as they got in-the alarm bell should have been ringing there and then-the spending got out of control and the budget forecast did not look too good, and what was the first thing they did? They looked at the private health insurance rebate as a way of trying to get the budget back into a state which could give some sort of credibility to the Labor government's very poor efforts in managing the economy. Having been quite prepared immediately before the 2007 election to say one thing and then do completely the opposite afterwards, we should have known that this was a precursor of what the government was prepared to do on the carbon tax before the 2010 election. Sadly, when it comes to this issue of truth, we have also seen it raise its ugly head when it comes to what happened on Australia Day. It seems very hard",166
238,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DOCUMENTS, Order! The member for Wannon will restrict his remarks to the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill.,166
239,Mr TEHAN,DOCUMENTS,One of the key points which need to be made on this bill is around the issue of trust.,166
240,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DOCUMENTS,Order! The member can make it in the context of the bill.,166
241,Mr TEHAN,DOCUMENTS,"The second point that I would like to make refers to cost of living. This piece of legislation will add to the cost of living in this country. Those on the other side may argue that this is a one-off in adding to the cost of living and therefore it is something that needs to be done. But the truth is that it is not a one-off. We have seen the price of insurance rise incredibly in the last three to six months. People have seen their bills go from $500 to $5,000 in the invoices they have been issued in the last couple of months. We have seen electricity prices rising exponentially, and they are going to get worse, sadly. We have seen the cost of child care rising. The cost of living is biting; it is hitting hard. What is the government's answer? To increase it even further. That is what this bill will do. The sad thing is that the cost-of-living increase will hit those who can least afford it. It will hit the pensioners who save so that they can take out private health insurance and who want to have the surety of knowing that they can get the medical help they desire later in life. They will be the ones who will hang onto private health insurance. They will be the ones who have to put up with the increases in premiums. Because of the cost increase as a result of this decision, the more mobile, younger and healthier people will decide that they do not see a need to continue to take out private health insurance. This will put pressure on premiums. It will put pressure on those who want to take out full coverage-elderly Australians. Premiums will rise as a result of this decision by this government. Sadly, once again, we are going to see cost-of-living pressures on those who can least afford it as a result of this government's policy. This is not only going to add to the cost of living. It will also add to the healthcare bills of state governments. When Labor was elected in 2007 it said it was going to stop the blame game when it came to the health sector in Australia. For too long, the Labor Party said, the argy-bargy between the states and the Commonwealth had led to the sector declining, to waiting lists growing and to people having to wait in emergency too long to get the attention that they need. Yet what do we see now? Firstly, we see the great reforms that were promised to the health sector amount to nothing. What was finally agreed did nothing to end the blame game. All it did was see the Commonwealth try to take some power off the states in the way the hospital system was managed without providing any real increases in finances to help the states do their job. Now what are we seeing? We are seeing the Commonwealth come along and once again shift more costs onto the state government. There is no-one who argues against this fact leading to more pressure on our public health system. Commonwealth should do the right thing by the states and say: 'We are going to take this decision to try to get our budget back in order. We have spent far too much on things like pink batts and school halls. We have wasted billions of dollars. We need to get our budget back in order. Therefore we are going to cost-shift on you. But we are going to do the right thing and help you do that. We are going to give you some of the cost to help you deal with the increased demand that you are going to see in the public health system.' They have not done that, so the states are going to have to cope with the increase in public hospital waiting lists which will occur as a result of this legislation. They are going to have to deal with the increase in demand in the emergency areas of hospitals which will occur as a result of these changes. And what are the Commonwealth doing to help the states deal with that? Nothing. They are blatantly cost shifting, and they need to own up and say that that is what they are doing. That is how desperate they have become to try to get a budget surplus in May, to try for the first time in over 21 years to get a Labor government budget surplus. The Australian people will not be fooled by the way that this government is going about it. It is smoke and mirrors, and it is doing nothing to fix the structural imbalances that we currently have in the economy. These need to be fixed so that we can have a reduction in the $132 billion of net debt which will peak this year and so that we can see reductions in the way this government spends its money and in the way that it tries to account for getting its budget into surplus. There are three points we need to look at. The first is the issue of trust, and I will make one simple point on that issue. I quote Nicola Roxon on 26 September 2007: Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we The are committed to retaining all of the existing private health insurance rebates. What happened instead? Only a year or so later we saw a complete reversal of that explicit promise that was made to the Australian people before the 2007 election. That decision was made collectively by then Prime Minister Rudd and then cabinet minister Gillard. The second thing this legislation will do is add to the already growing list of cost-ofliving pressures that this government is putting on the Australian people: insurance costs, electricity costs, childcare costs and private health insurance costs. I could go on and on. The third thing that this bill will do is shift costs from the Commonwealth onto the states, and it will do it despite this government saying that it was determined to stop the blame game and to fix the Australian health system once and for all. It was very clear who was raising money, where the money would be spent and how the services would be delivered so that people could point to where the system was and was not working, rather than having the federal government and state government saying, 'The whole issue depends on the service delivery and the costs and you aren't getting that right.' That is why I stand here today opposing these changes. They are a breach of trust, they will add to the cost of living and, worse than that, they will shift the cost of delivering health care from Commonwealth to the states at a time when the states need help in delivering the services they want to deliver. They do not need extra costs being put on their health services. Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (18:41): I rise tonight to speak on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011. It is a rather Orwellian name, for it is certainly not fairer and it certainly has nothing to do with incentives. If there was one single reason that this bill should be opposed it is the of credibility and trust. Even the learned member for Lyne has recently and openly stated that our current Prime Minister, and therefore our government, has a credibility problem. Let us just have a look at what this Prime Minister and members of this government have said in the past on the issue of private health insurance. Exhibit No. 1 is a press release from Julia Gillard, shadow minister for health, transcript of doorstop interview, state parliament Melbourne, 22 August 2004: Reporter: Can the Labor Party make a commitment to do with private insurance if they were to be elected? Ms Gillard: Labor has committed to keeping the 30% private health insurance rebate. I seek leave to table the Prime Minister's broken promise on keeping the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate contained in the press release dated 22 August 2004. Leave not granted. Mr CRAIG KELLY: Exhibit No. 2 is the transcript of an interview on the Sunday program on 29 August 2004 between Laurie Oakes and the then shadow health minister and current Prime Minister: Laurie Oakes: What about the 30 per cent health insurance subsidy? Julia Gillard: We've said that we will keep the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate. That is out there now in the community. It's a payment the that's been factored into family budgets, into people who are working and struggling with the bills and the mortgage and the payments for the kids, and also into the family budgets of older Australians who have private health insurance. It went on: We will leave the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate undisturbed because we understand it's factored into family incomes. I seek leave to table the Prime Minister's broken promise of 29 August 2004 in the issue interview with Laurie Oakes on the Sunday program. Leave not granted. Mr CRAIG KELLY: Exhibit No. 3 is a transcript of an interview between Tony Jones and Julia Gillard on ABC's Lateline on 12 September 2006. It says: Tony Jones: … Are you going to look again at the private health care rebate. Is that sacrosanct? Julia Gillard: No, the private health insurance rebate will be staying under Labor. We committed to that at the last election. Indeed, we committed to it at the election before. From time to time the Howard Government runs out with a scare campaign here but the private health insurance rebate will stay. I seek leave to table the Prime Minister's broken promise on keeping the 30 per cent health insurance rebate contained in the transcript of the interview between Tony Jones and Julia Gillard on ABC's Lateline. Leave not granted. Mr CRAIG KELLY: Exhibit No. 4 is a media statement dated 26 September 2007 entitled 'Liberal scare campaign on private health insurance rebates-Federal Labor to retain rebates'. It says: Federal Labor rejects the Liberal scare campaign around the Private Health Insurance rebates. On many occasions for many months, Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing Private Health Insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians. The Liberals continue to try to scare people into thinking Labor will take away the rebates. This is absolutely untrue. I seek leave to table the Labor government's broken promises on keeping the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate contained in a media release dated 26 September 2007. Leave not granted. Mr CRAIG KELLY: Exhibit No. 5 is a letter from the then federal Labor leader, the member for Griffith, to Dr Michael Armitage, CEO of the Health Insurance Association. It reads: Dear Dr Armitage, Thank you for your letter of 29 October 2007 seeking clarification on Federal Labor's policy regarding private health insurance. Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per rebates for older Australians. I trust this allays your concerns. I seek leave to table the letter from the then federal Labor leader to the Australian Health Insurance Association containing the broken promise on keeping the 30 per cent health insurance rebate. Leave not granted. Mr CRAIG KELLY: Exhibit No. 6 is from the Hobart Mercury and is a letter of 2 September 2004 from the current Prime Minister, and then shadow minister for ……… health. It states: 'Tasmanian Liberal deputy leader told two lies in the Mercury when he said that a Labor government would scrap the private health insurance rebate. I grow tired of saying this: Labor is committed to the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate.' ……… I seek leave to table the letter in the Hobart Mercury of the current Prime Minister, and then shadow minister for health, dated 2 September 2004, containing this further broken promise that Labor was committed to maintaining the health insurance rebate. Leave not granted. Mr CRAIG KELLY: What a surprise; they simply do not want to know. Does anyone see a pattern here with the infamous broken promise on the carbon tax? Not only do we have Labor misleading the public on important policy issues but they take the misrepresentation further by accusing those dastardly Liberals of a scare campaign by daring to suggest that Labor cannot be trusted. It is not just broken promises on the health insurance rebate and the carbon tax. We have seen this government mislead the member for Denison and leave him hanging out to dry. We have seen them mislead the public on the issue of gay marriage. But I think the most appalling example of this government's …… … misleading conduct is their statement in regard to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. For the Prime Minister to get up in front of a room full of disabled people and their carers at last year's national disability awards and claim that the NDIS will be the defining achievement of this government, when they have not committed one brass razoo and not one single cent to funding for the NDIS was absolutely shameful.",166
242,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DOCUMENTS," I remind the member for Hughes that we are debating the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011 and to remain within the parameters of that bill. Mr CRAIG KELLY: This pattern of repeated misleading conduct not only has destroyed the Prime Minister's credibility but is weakening our entire democracy. What person is ever going to believe another word that this Labor government says. If they told you it was raining outside, you would need to go outside and check for yourself. If this bill is passed, as we go into the next election-based on this government's track record-any commitment, any promise, is not going to be worth the paper it is written on. I say to the Independents: there is a heavy responsibility upon you when it comes to voting for this legislation. In years past, the Independents have justified their place in this parliament by sitting here under the motto of 'keeping the bastards honest'. But if the Independents vote with Labor on this bill, they will have simply aided and abetted this government's dishonesty. This bill has nothing to do with attempting to improve health insurance. It has nothing to do with creating more hospital beds. It has nothing to do with improving health services. It is all about a short-term revenue grab-a desperate attempt to cook the books to show a wafer-thin surplus in the next financial year. This is despite having run up the four largest budget deficits in Australian history-a combined total of $167 billion. The so-called saving from this bill of $2.8 billion is a further cooking of the books for it does not take into account the $3.8 billion in additional costs that will be generated down the line and generated on state budgets. Make no mistake, this government's inability to manage a budget is the only reason we are debating this bill here today, and today, as every day, they are showing how little they care for the challenging costs of living faced by people in Sydney and the rest of our other major cities and country areas. If this bill passes parliament, it will start off a vicious circle which will ultimately punish working families. Firstly, with so many cost-of-living pressures being inflicted by this government-electricity prices, childcare costs and the spectre of the carbon tax predicted to fall on the economy like a sledgehammer-removing this rebate will simply see people either downgrade their existing private health insurance or drop it altogether, thereby pushing more people into the public health system. A Deloitte analysis has shown that in the first year 175,000 people would withdraw from private health insurance cover and a further 583,000 people would downgrade their coverage. The answer is obvious to reasonable Australians: by driving people away from private health insurance, the cost of premiums for those that remain in the system will be forced up. The Deloitte analysis predicts a 10 per cent rise in premiums above what they would otherwise be. With fewer people paying for private health insurance, existing premiums will continue to increase, thereby setting off another round of people either downgrading their private health insurance or dropping it altogether-again, pushing another lot of people away from the private system and into the public health system. The report goes on to estimate that, over five years, 1.6 million Australians will drop their cover and a further 4.3 million will downgrade it. Ultimately, the people who will be most hurt by this bill are the Australians earning less than $50,000 that make up 50 per cent of Australians with health insurance. It will lengthen hospital queues. It will cause pain, suffering and hardship. Millions of Australian families that are doing their bit for the economy, even though they are already struggling with cost of living pressures, will be hurt by this bill. No wonder there are no government members left on the other side to defend this broken promise which will penalise Australian families at the time when they can least afford it. In my seat of Hughes there are 91,000 people that rely on their private health insurance cover, and many of these 91,000 people will be forced to fork out an additional $935 a year. That has been made clear by the recent Deloitte report. This bill-the so-called Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill-and its associated bills will rip support from families doing the right thing by our public health system. The millions of Australian families that will be hurt by this bill are doing their bit for the country, even though they are already struggling with cost-of-living pressures-and this will only be made worse by the carbon tax. We are again seeing Labor driving the dagger of cost of living into the heart of middle-class working families. Shame on this government for introducing this bill, and shame on every Labor member who votes for it. I call on the Independents to live up motto 'keep the bastards honest' and vote against this bill.",170
243,Ms GAMBARO,DOCUMENTS," I rise to oppose the deceptively entitled Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011 and two cognate bills. I describe these bills in this way particularly because the content of this legislation is anything but fair. It does not matter how much the government tries to dress these bills up; it will not change the fact that it proposes a severe impact on families, the private health industry and public health services in Brisbane and across the nation. In Australia we face many policy challenges in the area of health. As the population and the average life span continues to grow, the demand on our health system will increase quite dramatically. The percentage of health spending in state government budgets increases every single year, yet they seem to make very little progress when the waiting lists grow longer and longer. That is why it is important to ensure that as many people as possible have the capacity to purchase private health insurance to alleviate the pressure on our public health system. The Howard government recognised this. According to the Private Health Insurance Administration Council 2009-10 annual report to the government, in the 15 years between 1984 and 1998 the percentage of Australians with private health cover had halved to just a little over 30 per cent of the population. To fix this decline in membership, the then government-which I was proud to be a part of-introduced a number of initiatives: in 1997 the one per cent Medicare levy surcharge for highincome earners who had not taken out private health insurance and the 30 per cent premium tax rebate for taxpayers who had taken out some form of private health to the insurance. These policy measures worked. The take-up of private health insurance has taken off since then-so much so that last year $12.4 billion in benefits was paid to some of the 11.7 million Australians who now hold some form of private health insurance cover. This is approximately 52 per cent of the Australian population. This is also reflected in my electorate of Brisbane where 89,920 persons are covered by some form of private health insurance, and 66,676 of these are voters. This equates to 72.1 per cent of the voting population, which is 20 per cent above the national average. This Labor government wants to undo this great work through the suite of bills we have here before us tonight. It is the third time they have come before this chamber. They were rejected twice by the Senate in the last parliament, and yet here we go again. These bills create a three-tier system in the private health insurance rebate, slashing the rebate and increasing the Medicare levy surcharge for Australian taxpayers within certain income categories. The rhetoric coming out of the Labor Party is that somehow this is rectifying a situation where the rich are subsidised for their private health insurance by those on lower incomes. Yet, under tier 1, the rebate is slashed by 10 per cent for singles earning over $80,000 and couples earning over $160,000 per year. Let us be clear about this: we are talking here about a teacher married to a policeman. These are the hard working forgotten Australians aspiring to success. Since the announcement of these measures there has been a litany of evidence produced showing the absolutely disastrous impact that they would have on the public hospital system and the private health insurance industry. These changes will do one thing and one thing only: they will force people to drop their private health cover or choose cheaper cover with more procedures excluded, thus creating upward pressure on premiums and forcing more people into an overcrowded, overstretched public health service system. Every dollar of funding provided for the private health insurance rebate actually saves $2 of costs that are then paid by the private health insurers. Private hospitals in this country treat 40 per cent of all patients in Australia and in 2009-10 they treated 3.5 million patients. They performed some 64 per cent of elective surgery in Australia. Treasury projected that following these changes only 25,000 high-income consumers would withdraw their cover across the whole sector. This was then clearly proven to be inaccurate when the government-owned insurer Medibank Private came out and said 37,000 of its members alone would drop their cover and some 92,500 members would downgrade-an enormous number of people. A report into these measures by the highly regarded consultancy firm Deloitte for the Australian Health Insurance Association produces some very, very telling findings. Their analysis relies on the results of a survey by ANOP Research Services of 2,000 being holders of private health cover on their intentions and the effect of a slashing of the rebates. I note that the former Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Roxon, in her second reading speech took aim at the ANOP survey, saying it was wildly inaccurate, but she cannot ignore the fact that she was the health minister then. It was a very simple survey asking people what their intentions were and the importance of the rebate to them. It was really interesting to note that one of the people who designed and interpreted the survey was none other than Mr Rod Cameron, who for many years was an ALP pollster and numbers man. So his expertise and his wonderful work was good enough for the Labor Party to use and to rely on over many years, yet as soon as he produces something that they do not like they do not want to hear about it-they attack the work that he produces. I will not go through the entirety of the Deloitte assessment. However, I do want to quote a brief passage from the executive summary, which summarises the findings. It states: Significant numbers of consumers will withdraw from their private hospital cover (1.6 million consumers over five years) or downgrade to lower levels of private health cover (4.3 million consumers over five years) following the proposed policy change. The Deloitte assessment has some very significant figures here. It also says: Significant numbers of consumers will also withdraw from their general treatment cover (2.8 million consumers over five years) or downgrade to lower levels of private health cover (5.7 million consumers over five years) following the proposed policy change. The interesting fact that it also mentions is that private health insurance premiums will rise 10 per cent above what would otherwise be expected. So we have a situation whereby premiums will rise and private health cover will become less affordable for consumersand that is not just those in those tiers. As people withdraw from private health insurance, the burden on publicly provided health services will continue to rise and rise. These findings indicate that the cost of treating consumers in the public hospital system is going to rise substantially above what is currently anticipated by the government. Deloitte estimates that the additional operating costs accumulated over five years will be $3.8 billion-$1.4 billion in the fifth year alone. These findings are a damning indictment on the measures included in these bills. All because of what? The inability of the ALP to manage Australia's finances responsiblythat is what this is all about. So what do they do? Since the election of the Rudd government in 2007, the billions of dollars of waste and government expenditure have been absolutely scandalous. We know the stories of the pink batt waste, the $900 cheques being paid to deceased persons and the school halls program, just to name a few. The Labor Party is desperate to find a way to deliver the budget surplus and turn around a $37 billion budget deficit. These proposals are nothing more than a lazy financial quick fix and are not based on any sound policy whatsoever. Whenever the Labor Party finds itself in a mess, they revert to class warfare. We saw it in question time last week when the Prime Minister was asked about private health insurance. They are interested only in creating a class warfare situation and this is, of course, absolute nonsense. The only contribution the Labor Party has to make in this country is to play the politics of envy. In this case, this supposed attack on 'the rich' will end up hurting the lowand middleincome families in my electorate the most. I will always stand up in this place for the constituents of the electorate of Brisbane. On behalf of the 89,920 people in my electorate who have private health insurance cover, I will oppose these bills. WYATT ROY (Longman) (19:06): I rise to speak to the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011 and related bills that are before the House. The intent of the bill is to reduce the private health insurance rebate and increase the Medicare Levy Surcharge for those people who opt out of private health insurance, because it will become prohibitively expensive without the rebate. It is a fundamental right of all Australians to expect that they will receive quality health care. It is the coalition's view that this is best done by giving people choice in the form of access to affordable health care providers, thereby relieving the pressure on the public health system. It is the coalition's view that access to health care should not be ideologically driven, and it should not be socially engineered. But that is precisely what is happening with this legislation. There are a few issues here. One is that the Labor government is philosophically opposed to the notion of choice. The second is that the Labor government is scrambling to balance its books before this year's budget and it needs to find the dollars where it can. The third is the impact that this legislation will have on the hard-working people of my community of Longman. When the coalition government introduced the private health insurance incentives that Australians currently enjoy it increased the ability of many households to choose. In fact, private health insurance coverage increased from 34 per cent of the population to 44 per cent. More Australians have more choice now. Those Australians who do not have private health insurance can access the public system. But those of us who have gone through the public health system for care have seen first hand the pressure it is under. There is denying that much needs to be done to improve the public health system. It is fortunate that we are not holding our breath for delivery on former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's promise to fix the public health system and end the so-called blame game once and for all. However, imagine what the pressure on the public health system is going to look like if Australians already labouring under soaring cost-of-living pressures decide to jettison their private health insurance because they simply cannot afford it. Some 2.4 million people will be affected by the increased cost of private health insurance. For those in the first income tier, premiums will increase by 14 per cent; for those in the second tier, premiums will increase by 29 per cent; and, for those in the third tier, premiums will rise by a huge 43 per cent. The Labor government claims that the impact these changes will have will be negligible. It claims that only 27,000 people will drop their private health insurance and that this will result in only 8,500 additional hospital admissions. That is not what Medibank Private is saying and it is not what Deloitte is saying. Medibank Private has predicted that 37,000 of its members alone will drop their cover and a further 92,500 will downgrade. Deloitte's analysis indicates that 175,000 people will dump their private health insurance and 583,000 will downgrade in the first year alone. Over five years, it is expected that 1.6 million people will drop their private health insurance and 4.3 million people will downgrade their cover. What does this mean for allied health services-physiotherapists, for example? There has been no talk about the impact this legislation will have on ancillary cover, which is so vital to ensuring the continuing no viability of the allied health sector. This legislation represents a removal of choice for Australian families. It is ideologically driven by a government which does not support Australians being able to decide what is best for them. And for what possible benefit? Family budgets are under pressure and the public health system is under pressure. These measures are only going to make those pressures worse. Apart from ideology, the Labor government could have only one other reason for introducing this legislation-it is desperate to claw back some of the money it has squandered in reckless spending on failed programs. To do so, the government is attacking private health insurance. What other explanation can there be for yet another litany of broken promises from this government? On 27 September 2007, just before the 2007 election, the current health minister said that Labor rejected what she called 'the Liberal scare campaign around the private health insurance rebates.' She said: On many occasions for many months, Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing Private Health Insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians. It is crystal clear now-crystal clear that this was just another promise made just before an election and destined for the wastebasket of this Labor government's opportunism. What is really important to me is the effect that this legislation will have on my community of Longman. As I have said on numerous occasions in this place, life is getting harder for the families in my community and they are doing it really tough. The price of everything is going upelectricity, water, food, fuel, car registration and the public transport that so many working families in my community rely on to access the city where they work. It is getting more and more difficult for the hard working members of my community to make ends meet. Yet again, this high-taxing and recklessly spending Labor government is determined to make the lives of ordinary Australians harder. And this legislation will do just that. Many members of my community have contacted me, increasingly angry about the fact that this Labor government is not acting in their best interests. It is destroying confidence, spending recklessly and taxing and taxing and taxing. But there is another issue here and that is the effect that an exodus from private health insurance will have on health services in my community. The hard working medical staff at the Caboolture Hospital do a fantastic job, but they need more resources. Demands on local health services are already too high for the infrastructure that is available and demand will only increase with population growth. Waiting times, unrealistic nursing workloads, insufficient funding and the services available to mental health patients are among issues that are raised with me all the time. During the last election campaign, issues around the Caboolture Hospital were among the greatest concerns expressed by the people of Longman. Just recently, a distressed father of a young baby wrote to electoral me to say that he had had to wait for 12 hours before his child could be seen. The locals in my community deserve to be confident that, when their child has a raging ear infection after hours, they are not going to have to wait most of the night to be seen. When you are taken by ambulance to the hospital with an acute emergency, you should not be 'ramped' or redirected to another hospital across South-East Queensland. According to the Department of Health and Ageing, the population in my region is expected to reach some 200,000 people. However, at the moment the under-resourced Caboolture Hospital has 187 beds available and 21 bays in the emergency department. It is estimated that, to meet the demand of the growing population, 600 beds and 52 emergency bays will be required to service the region by 2026. According to the AMA the Caboolture Hospital is operating, on average, at over 100 per cent occupancy, showing significant over strain of capacity. A safe occupancy rate is an average of only 85 per cent. The expansion of the Caboolture Hospital is of fundamental importance to the people of Longman. Everyone in the community wants it to happen-the locals, the medical staff at the hospital. It is one of the keys to growing our region and making it a desirable place to live. But with this legislation, even if the people of Longman were to see a long awaited expansion of the hospital, the increased pressure placed on services because of the increased number of people no longer able to access private health care would negate the benefits of any expansion. This legislation represents yet another betrayal of the trust of the Australian people. We are getting used to it now with this Labor government, but that does not make it right. The price of private health care will increase for so many families at a time when they are already struggling to balance their books. The exodus from private health care will place additional pressure on an already overburdened public health system. In my community, I know that the many families who have contacted me regarding soaring costs of living will jettison their private health cover because it will be unaffordable for them. The pressure on the Caboolture Hospital will become even worse than it already is, causing even more distress for my community. In conclusion, that is why, as a member of the coalition, I will not be supporting these bills.",171
244,Dr SOUTHCOTT,DOCUMENTS," The fairer private health insurance legislation represents almost $2.8 billion being ripped out of the pockets of Australians who hold private health insurance. At the last election the Labor Party, in their dishonest as, talked about the Leader of the Opposition taking $1 billion from health when it was actually a $10 billion increase in public hospital funding, but here we have a clear example of the Labor Party ripping out almost $2.8 billion, with their hands in the pockets of ordinary Australian families and individuals who are having a go, who are covering themselves and covering their families with private health insurance. Is this money going to health? No, it is just an inevitable consequence of the fact that the Labor Party have lost control of spending. They have wasted billions of dollars on pink batts and billions of dollars on school halls, and now, unfortunately, we are seeing broken election promises-a consequence of the fact that, as usual with a Labor government, they have lost control of their spending. We on this side of the House understand that private health insurance plays a key role in reducing waiting lists and keeping pressure off the already struggling public hospital system. It allows people to have a choice of doctor, a choice of specialist, a choice of surgeon, a choice of anaesthetist and a choice of hospital. The coalition have always recognised this and will continue to fight for the role of private health insurance in our health system. In a sense this is history repeating itself. When Labor were last in power the level of people covered by private health insurance plummeted from 50 per cent of the population to a low of 30 per cent in the mid1990s. A number of Labor government decisions made during the second term of the Hawke-Keating government, between 1984 and 1986, had the effect of ripping money away from people who had private health insurance. As a result of those decisions Labor took when last in office we saw premiums rise by almost 40 per cent. The consequence was that people dropped out and as younger, fitter, healthier people dropped out the insured pool become more likely to claim and the premiums rose, in a vicious cycle. That required the introduction of the private health insurance rebate, along with lifetime health cover, in 1999, which arrested and reversed that fall in private health cover. In 2004 we came up with the proposal for increased rebates for people over 65 and people over 70 in recognition of the fact that many people on the age pension or part pensions and self-funded retirees were on fixed incomes and holding private health insurance. We needed to do this to make sure that private health insurance in Australia was on a sustainable footing. Unfortunately, as I said before, Labor have a track record of dismantling private health. For the current Prime Minister's views on private health insurance there is no better guide than The Latham Diaries. That book shows how ideologically opposed to private health insurance the Prime Minister was when she was the Labor Party spokesperson for health. In fact, as we heard in question time today, the current Prime Minister gave an ironclad guarantee when she was shadow minister for health that the Labor Party would maintain the rebates. Her robust defence seemed to be that 'we did break that promise in 2007 but we took it to the 2010 election so then it was okay'. That ignores that the ironclad guarantee had an expiry date of not much more than 15 months into the Rudd government. I will come to that later. Private hospitals treat 40 per cent of all patients in Australia-3½ million patients in 2009-10. It covers the majority of elective surgery. Around 12 million Australians hold private health insurance-52.9 per cent of the population-and 45.6 per cent have hospital treatment cover. Of these people, any single earning over $83,000 per annum and any couple earning over $166,000 per annum will see their rebates reduced, with those on higher incomes receiving no rebate at all. These changes will mean a return to the old days of people dropping out of private health insurance left, right and centre. Around 2.4 million people will be directly affected by immediate increases in their premiums of 14 per cent, 29 per cent or 43 per cent, depending on their income tier. Deloitte has predicted that up to 1.6 million Australians will drop their cover over the next five years. They have also forecast that up to 4.3 million Australians will downgrade their cover over the next five years and that premiums will increase 10 per cent above what they otherwise would have. We will see an extra 845,000 Australians admitted to public hospitals and an extra $3.8 billion in additional recurrent costs for the public hospital system. It is worth noting that the government maintains that only 25,000 people will drop their private health insurance under its modelling compared to the 1.6 million modelled by the Deloitte analysis. There is quite a discrepancy therethe Deloitte analysis is 64 times the government's predictions. Medibank Private, the government owned insurer, claims that 37,000 of their members will drop private health insurance. They are about a third of the market in Australia. Just extrapolating the Medibank Private numbers, this measure will see more than 100,000 Australians drop private health insurance. This shows that the government's claim of only 25,000 is not realistic. It is not just those on higher incomes who are going to be affected-5.6 million Australians with private health cover have annual household incomes of less than $50,000, and of those 3.4 million have annual household incomes of less than $35,000. Despite Labor's rhetoric, private health cover is not just for the rich. It has always been this way. People on age pensions, part pensions and self-funded retirees all maintain private health insurance. People on fixed incomes and those in low income households will be hurt most by this move. It is the part-pension recipients, self-funded retirees and young people who will be hurt the most from this. Young families who have responsibly taken out private health cover will be hurt. These people have all sacrificed to secure their own health and this government want to impose an extra financial burden when cost-of-living pressures are already so high. These people may not be hit with a reduction in their rebate but they will be hit by premium rises as a secondary consequence of people dropping their private health cover. This is very simply a broken promise by the Labor government. These broken promises are stacking up, day by day. It is a betrayal of the electorate and a betrayal of the 12 million Australians with private health insurance. Just four days out from the 2007 federal election, Kevin Rudd wrote to Dr Michael Armitage, the chief executive of the Australian Health Insurance Association, and said, 'Both my shadow minister for health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians. Labor will maintain lifetime health cover and the Medicate levy surcharge.' That was clear cut and black and white in writing. It is clear now that this is just a first for the Labor government. Labor have delivered four budgets since they were elected in 2007 and in every single budget they have proposed to rip money out of private health insurance or to slug people to take out private health insurance. My prediction is that if Labor have the chance, this will be just the first step. There will be many more bills like this where Labor will continue to undermine private health, to wind back the support for private health and to continue their relentless attack on the private health insurance rebates. In every budget delivered by the Labor Party, they have attacked private health insurance. This bill has already been rejected by the Senate on two separate occasions, yet the government continue. They just cannot let it go. The Labor Party hate private health care. They pursue this as an ideological argument, without considering or even caring about the consequences. This government cannot manage money. They have wasted billions and billions of taxpayers' money-for example, pink batts; and the school halls, which schools did not want. In health, you need only look to the $650 million GP superclinics program, where there is no proof that a single hospital has seen a reduction in waiting times for patients arriving at the emergency department. Because of this endless waste by this reckless government, they are now looking to dismantle effective measures like the private health insurance rebates to plug the hole in their budget. For those opposite, this is not about the good health of Australians; it is about balancing the bottom line of their budget which they have lost control of. The effect of this legislation on my electorate of Boothby is going to be very detrimental. There are 96,728 people in Boothby who are covered by private health step insurance-72.3 per cent of voters on the roll have private health insurance, 63.3 per cent of voters hold hospital treatment insurance and 71.5 per cent hold general insurance for extras. There are two private hospitals in my electorate which are likely to be affected, Flinders Private Hospital and Griffith private hospital. Glenelg Community Hospital and Ashford Hospital sit outside my electorate, but are frequently used by the residents of Boothby. Voters in Boothby will take a very dim view of the Labor Party's decision. This is a bad measure for Australia and a bad measure for my electorate. It is such a bad measure that over 2,000 residents in my electorate have petitioned to have the private health insurance rebate retained intact. It is a petition that I will be presenting later this week. The opposition have no choice but to oppose this measure, as we did in 2009 and in 2010. Mrs GRIGGS (Solomon) (19:29): I rise to contribute to the debate on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011. As some of my colleagues have already stated, we are debating a betrayal of the Australian people, a betrayal of 11 million Australians who contribute to private health insurance arrangements. Forty-five per cent of households in my electorate of Solomon have private health insurance arrangements. Over 40,000 people are covered by these arrangements-40,000 Territorians who are being betrayed by the Gillard Labor government. This is the very same government that promised at the last election that there would be no carbon tax under the government the Prime Minister led. We all know where that promise ended. As has been reported in media outlets by many commentators, Australia's healthcare system-and I refer to the balance in the relationship between public and private providers-is envied by many overseas countries. The Treasurer himself is on record with regular reference to how Australia is envy of the world. It is apparent that our current healthcare system, if media commentators are to be believed, is in fact envied outside our shores. To refer to a turn of phrase distinctive to our vernacular, if ain't broke then don't fix it. Along with nearly 53 per cent of the country or some 12 million other Australians, I pay into private health insurance. My husband and I recognise the importance of having private health insurance. We recognise the importance of choice and we recognise the value of not relying upon and adding to an already overworked and stretched public health system. Further, we recognise that with an ageing population the reliance on health care will increase, as will the pressures on both the public and private providers. Statistics show that in the 2009-10 financial year private hospitals treated some 3.5 million patients across Australia, with those private hospitals responsible for the delivery of 64 per cent of elective surgeries. Australians in general have an expectation for the delivery of certain services. Health care is one of those areas of expectation. An Ipsos survey this year found 64 per cent of the population believe that the $4.5 billion the government spends on the health rebate is a good use of taxpayer money. At present, 5.6 million Australians who pay private health insurance have an annual household income less than $50,000. Further, 3.4 million Australians with an annual household income of less than $35,000 pay into private health insurance-a further example of the value placed on this commodity by Australian citizens. Astute Australians, mums and dads, singles, the aged-in fact, Australians from all walks of life-all currently pay for private health insurance, yet the current federal Labor government the wants to change this. Why? The system is not broke. The Deloitte analysis of the changes proposed by this government, if passed, are expected to see many of those astute Australians I have mentioned who pay it into private health insurance funds withdraw from private health or downgrade their current level of cover. The government's own insurer, Medibank Private, predict that potentially 37,000 of their existing members alone will drop their cover and 92,500 will downgrade their cover, yet the Minister for Health has claimed that some 27,000 people across the entire sector could potentially withdraw from private health care-a considerable discrepancy. How can this government get it so wrong so often? At present the existing private health rebate is 30 per cent with an increase to 35 per cent and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians. Proposed changes will see the introduction of three new income tiers. The first tier will see a reduction of the healthcare rebate from 30 per cent to 20 per cent for singles with an annual income of between $80,000 and $93,000 and families with a combined income of between $160,000 and $186,000. Aged Australians between 65 and 69 years will see their rebate reduced from 35 per cent to 25 per cent and for those aged 70 and over the rebate will fall from 40 per cent to 30 per cent. Without looking beyond the first tier, it is quite evident that this government assumes any single or family whose income exceeds the thresholds to be wealthy. I am reliably informed by my constituents that this is not the case. Many in remote, regional and rural Australia-who already pay additional costs associated with supply and delivery of goods and services; who already pay dearly for childcare facilities, for basic food commodities for fuel; who go without the advantages associated with competition similar to that within urban environments; and who pay mortgages or who pay rent-are far from rich. These average Australians continue to struggle and should not be considered wealthy. Within my own electorate of Solomon, many of the constituents I have spoken to on this issue are angry. I paraphrase: they are sick to death of being bashed by this Labor government on a daily basis for apparently being wealthy. When I say 'constituents', I refer to people from all walks of life, from small business operators to businesses who employ staff to contractors, from police officers to nurses, to public servants and teachers, all hard working aspirants of this country. All of them sound the same drum and sing the same song. These proposed changes are not about improving our health services but about the inability of the current government to balance its books. Once again, it is the working backbone of the country who will be hurt-those who already give and continue to give towards every tax and levy imposed by a government in crisis. This Labor government does not understand that healthcare costs vary from region to region, as do wages, but no consideration has been given to the high cost of living facing Territorians today. Many young families I know will be affected if this legislation is passed, and they are already struggling. Like me, the member for New England believes that this new health tax being imposed by the Gillard Labor government will be very bad for regional hospitals and in fact regional health services. What I do not understand is, if the member for New England believes this legislation will be bad for regional hospitals and regional Australians, why the member for Lyne has not arrived at the same conclusion. Then we have the member for Denison. In his electorate six out of 10 people have pricing private health insurance. Surely, the message to him is quite clear: he must not support this legislation. This legislation will most certainly put pressure on public hospitals. It will absolutely take more money out of people's household budgets. At a time when Australians are already facing extra cost-ofliving pressures, Prime Minister Gillard's new health tax is just not sustainable. This government has a history of broken promises. A case in point: in October 2007 the Chief Executive of the Australian Health Insurance Association, the Hon. Dr Michael Armitage, sought clarification from Labor's federal opposition leader in respect to its private health insurance policy. The response to Dr Armitage, signed by the then federal Labor leader, Mr Kevin Rudd, stated: Both my Shadow Minister for Health Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 percent general and the 35 to 40 percent rebates for older Australians. The response further included that Labor would maintain the existing framework for regulating private health insurance. What has happened in the interim? We have a government that finds itself in difficult economic circumstances largely of its own making, a government that started out with money in the bank and an economy strong and vibrant, an economy with stability. Today we see circumstances in which the government has spent billions and billions of taxpayer dollars to the point where we now have the fourth-largest deficit of any Australian government in history. It is evident from the comments from my constituents that they clearly understand the impetus of why this government now wishes to tinker with the private health system-the envy of many other nations-not for the betterment of the system or as a value-add for the Australian taxpayer but for fiscal reasons. Simply put, the government is desperate to find money to try and fill the black hole which continues to expand. This is bad policy and it is the third time this parliament has considered this legislation. The first was in 2009. It was against a backdrop of commitment by the member for Griffith, the then federal Labor leader, in 2007 when he affirmed: Federal Labor will maintain the existing framework for regulating private health insurance, including the process of approval of premium increases. These three bills as introduced failed on that occasion. But here we are in 2012 again debating measures to alter the status quo in terms of private health insurance. As I indicated earlier, many of my constituents are angry. The impact of the potential changes will impact the back pockets of most Australians with increased rebate private health insurance premiums. The changes will impose an enormous compliance burden on the industry and individuals completing their tax returns. Private health insurers will have to make significant changes to their systems to be able to adjust premiums according to incomes. It is still not clear how the rebate will be administered under the new arrangements, especially where a person is not able to accurately predict their income for the current or the future financial year. Deloitte's analysis of the changes show that in the first year 175,000 people will be expected to withdraw from private hospital cover and a further 583,000 will downgrade. Over five years it is expected that 1.6 million will drop cover and 4.3 million will downgrade. These figures are absolutely alarming. I would like to go back to the sentiments of my constituents. The following was sent to me by a constituent whose name is Lee. In her own words she said: … ""the harder I work the luckier I get"". I want to share my journey in becoming the new ""bashed and hated wealthy"" My husband and I started our working life as bank teller and a refrigeration mechanic. We built a 3 bedroom 1 bathroom house in the suburbs ofAdelaide, which was all we could afford. We raised 2 boys initially on 1 wage. My husband Chris had to take on additional work on weekends just to pay the mortgage and keep food on the table when interest rates reached 16% in the early 80's We both worked to provide the boys with private school education. Family holidays were camping trips in an old camper trailer and when the boys left home we moved to the NTNorthern Territoryand started our own business The journey of Lee and Chris is similar to that of many others that have worked hard, raised families, and understood the need to provide for themselves in retirement. In Lee's own words: … this labor government hates us, it hates the fact we have some degree of financial comfort, it hates the fact we have private health insurance, it hates the fact we were prepared to work hard to provide the best education for our children. We are the people that got the hit from the flood we are the people that are now to be hit by the health rebate means test, and next we will be the same people that will be hit by less money for private schools. We are small business people, we employ others, we pay tax, we look after ourselves in retirement, we are the backbone of this country and NOW UNDER THIS NA How concerning is this sentiment? But this is exactly what this Labor government is doing: it is trying to bring back the class war, turning hard working people that do have aspirations for a better life against those that do not. In conclusion, this piece of legislation is absolutely not about a health policy. This is about a government trying to rip money out of people's back pockets as a patch-up for the waste and mismanagement that this government has undertaken over the last four years. This is bad policy and I will be voting against this piece of legislation as this bill is not about 'Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives'. This is another Labor broken promise. This is another betrayal of the Australian people.",176
245,Mr WYATT,GOVERNMENT WE ARE HATED," I rise to oppose the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011 and the suite of related bills. I do so on the basis that what is proposed means that there is a reductionand I will not cite all the figures because they have been evident in all the speeches that I have been listening to during the course of the day-and it will impact on the health system. When I first entered parliament during the reform period under the Rudd government-and later in its continuation with the Gillard government-I saw incredible hope and opportunity for the reforms to be effective and for the private sector, through private sector funding, to be a key player in all of this and I saw that the 30 per cent levy would allow people the opportunity of moving between the health levy, services provided within both public hospitals and the private sector. I give an example of St John of God in Perth that has robotic surgery for men who have prostate cancer. The cost of that is significantly high and the difference in price is covered by the private health insurance that is provided through membership and underpinned by the 30 per cent element that assists people to continue with their private health insurance. The other thing that disappoints me is that A healthier future for all Australians talked about a continuity of care, access to specialist services and the ability to be part of making a choice about the type of healthcare service delivery you would access and the point at which you would access it. The National Partnerships Agreements that have been negotiated make reference to the fact that all Australians should have the opportunity of moving between the choices that exist for them, but they do not always have the capacity to pay. There are private and government hospitals that have differing services and certainly a significant number of the specialists tend to operate within the private health sector. If you are covered by private health insurance, your movement through the elective surgery waiting lists and surgery is enhanced because you are sometimes advised to take the opportunity to book into a private hospital in order to expedite that service. It means that you do not remain on a waiting list for a substantial period of time. But the articles that have been appearing in the papers in recent times have made some very interesting points for this debate. The headline in the Australian today was 'Both sides failing the test on health'. It states: Labor's policy lacks coherence but this should not let the opposition off the hook. The article says: First, as the public and private systems compete for health professionals, it would increase costs and reduce quality in the public system. Second, it will make the PHI even less affordable for low-income consumers, ensuring that we truly do end up with two healthcare systems: one for the better off, who to have private cover, and one for those with lower incomes, who will have to rely on the public hospitals. Again, 'Gillard confident on health rebate' was a headline in the Australian Financial Review on Tuesday, 7 February: Prime Minister Julia Gillard said yesterday taxpayers should not have to subsidise private health insurance for wealthy people and the government would continue discussions to get the changes passed. Greens leader Bob Brown yesterday softened his party's resistance … ""We don't believe people should be penalised because they make the choice to go the public health system,"" he said. We are continuing to talk with the government. I have been dismayed also by the fact that there have been a number of speakers on that side of the House who referred to a welfare or class system when it comes to the subsidisation of the health rebate, because to me it is not that. I think we have to be serious in considering that we want to encourage people to access the opportunities to reduce the burden on the public hospital system. One of the continued debates I had when I worked in health, when we used to meet as an executive, concerned the choking of public hospitals with people who could not access the private health sector or access specialists whose time was principally involved with the private health sector. What worries me with this one is that, if these figures about the 1.6 million consumers dropping their health insurance or the number that fall in under each of the tiers are correct, we will see an increase in the number of people accessing the public hospital system. That in itself will increase the requirement for funding to meet those health needs when it could be covered within will be forced the private health sector. In reading through the National Partnership Agreements, there are some provisions for increased funding where there are pressure points within the public health sector under each state and territory's jurisdiction and to negotiate a variation to those actual costs. I suspect that we will see an increase in requests for additional funding by states and territories. With that in mind, today's Hobart Mercury had the headline 'Private insurance bypass-Doctors warn … … … rebate changes will up pressure on public hospitals'. The article states: Tasmania's public hospitals will be hit with more patients under plans to means test the private health rebate, the Australian Medical Association says. Premiums are tipped to rise by up to $1000 a year for families from 1 July with Gillard government legislation to be voted on in coming days. … … … AMA Tasmanian president John Davis said … ""What we're already seeing is the Royal Hobart Hospital working at capacity at what should be a quiet time of the year."" If that is the case at a quiet time, then those proposed changes will have a significant impact on hospitals. I was down in Tasmania recently and I was speaking with a senior official from health who indicated that the quantum of money received to provide for their hospitals and for the types of services required for the public of Tasmania is not sufficient. On that basis, I suspect that we will see health ministers coming back to the discussions with the federal minister seeking to increase their share of the Commonwealth funding that would assist in the provision of the health care that we expect and take for granted in this country. I know that the Minister for Health believes these changes will ensure that with a greater capacity to pay will make a larger contribution towards the cost of their private health insurance. The government says it will ensure that government support for private health insurance remains fair and sustainable in the future. This is simply not the case. In my electorate of Hasluck, which is geographically and economically diverse, there are many people who are feeling the pressure points of increased costs of living. Those increased costs of living are impacting on their capability and capacity to pay private health insurance premiums. I have had constituents say to me that they will be dropping the level of contribution they make to private health funds. To me this is a pity because when there is an illness of some magnitude which requires coverage of the full fee, or at least the gap, they will be deprived of that and their out-of-pocket expenses will certainly increase. The extra costs will hit families hard and drive more towards the public system. The public health system is already under strain and this could be the straw that breaks the camel's back. Increased living costs will be created not only by hospital costs and the payments needed for anaesthetists and some of the surgical procedures but also by the medications that will be required. Over 1½ million Australians, including thousands in Hasluck, will face significant increases in private health insurance costs. $1,000 might not sound a great deal to many in this chamber, but there will be people who will struggle to find that within their tight economic circumstances, particularly with the other added pressure from the banking sector where there is an increase in home interest rates. Private hospitals treat 40 per cent of all patients in Australia and perform over 60 per cent of elective surgeries. What happens to the public system when these patients scrap those their health insurance? The government owned insurer, Medibank Private, has predicted that 37,000 of its members alone will drop their cover and 92,500 will downgrade. This is considerably more than the 27,000 the minister has claimed will drop their cover throughout the entire sector. To me, this is another example of the Labor Party playing the politics of envy and punishing those who are able to take financial responsibility for their health care instead of having the Liberal Party economic their philosophy of reward for effort and providing people with choice and financial opportunity. Many of the people who have taken out private health insurance in Hasluck are not super-rich as those opposite would have you believe. In the near future, you will hear more political-speak coming out of the Labor Party--things like, 'They are the rich; why should they get subsidies for private health?' This is social engineering coming to the fore yet again. These people are already paying for the services of private health insurance and this takes a significant load off our public health system. We will all have seen articles over a period of time in which health systems and jurisdictions talk about the burden of cost in the delivery of health services. I have had first hand experience of actually working in the health sector at a senior level and I know the strain many in this system are under. These changes will just make things worse. The phasing down of the healthcare rebate to nil would see the need for nearly 200,000 hospital bed days to be created. One million extra patients are expected to flood the public health system. The Gillard government is acting out of desperation to balance its books and is doing so at the expense of many hard working Australians and people in my electorate of Hasluck. Instead of creating hope for the people of Australia that if they work hard and pay their way they will be rewarded, it penalises the people who are paying their way. Cost of living, as I have said, is a serious issue in my electorate. The so-called luxuries will be jettisoned, and I fear that private health insurance will be one of them. The cost-of-living pressures will only get worse under the carbon tax regime. This wasteful government is introducing another burden. The deceit shown by this government knows no bounds. Every new tax or levy that is introduced chips away at the household budget. People in Hasluck are struggling and this typical tax-and-spend approach to economics is damaging to the social fabric of this country. I would ask the Minister for Health to come to Hasluck and talk in a forum directly to families that will be hit by the amendments to the legislation. Previous governments have rejected these changes, and I call on this government not to dig its heels in and to stop this lunacy. What makes this worse is that the Prime Minister previously stated in opposition that she would not seek to remove the rebate, yet when it is politically convenient she once again goes back on her word. The former Prime Minister, the Hon. Kevin Rudd, and the former Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon. Nicola Roxon, have both gone to great pains previously to say they would never support this move. What has changed? This is the third time the parliament has considered this legislation. It was introduced in the last parliament despite explicit promises at the 2007 election that: … Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all the existing Private Health Insurance rebates. That was said in a media release by Nicola Roxon on 26 September 2007. I call on the Independents to actually stick up for the people in their electorates and vote down these amendments, which will hurt everyday Australians. I think we have the basis of an incredible health reform agenda that is providing a wide range of health outcomes and improvements for Australians, consistent with the objectives of the national partnership agreement and the National Health Reform Agreement. I would rather see the strengthening of those and not their diminution through the impact of this legislation in reducing the rebate that is currently given to all Australians. I oppose this legislation.",182
246,The SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT WE ARE HATED,"Order! It being almost 8 pm, the debate is interrupted. NA Native Title",185
247,Ms GILLARD,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," on indulgence-I wish to add to an answer I gave in question time today. In question time today I answered a question from the member for O'Connor concerning native title. In my answer I indicated that the Western Australian Premier had not personally raised with me matters related to native title compensation. The Premier wrote to me on 14 April last year regarding financial assistance for native title compensation and settlements. I wrote to the Premier on 23 May last year noting that in 2001 the Howard government made an offer to the states and territories in relation to native title compensation, but a shared costs arrangement was not agreed to. This exchange of correspondence was reported in the Australian newspaper on 6 January this year. As I stated earlier today, despite my quite frequent contact with the Premier of Western Australia, the Premier has not taken the opportunity to raise this matter with me personally, and by that I mean face to face. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS National Asbestos Awareness Week",185
248,Ms SAFFIN,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," I move: That this House: (1) notes that as National Asbestos Awareness Week is formally recognised, it makes earnest representation to the Government to continue to call on Canada to ratify the listing of chrysotile asbestos in the Rotterdam Convention on Prior Informed Consent; (2) recognises the proactive actions of the Australian Government in mitigating the possible spread of asbestos related diseases through continuing bans on the production and use of asbestos as well as strict controls on the removal and disposal of existing material; (3) commends the Australian Government on a number of measures that have been put into place to manage and compensate the victims of asbestos related diseases which include: (a) the recent ratification Labour Organization (ILO) Asbestos Convention, as one of the first ILO Conventions to be ratified by the Commonwealth Government since 2006; (b) Australian leadership on a strong closing declaration by 66 countries at the 2011 Conference of the Rotterdam Convention, which expressed deep concern that the listing of chrysotile asbestos had been prevented by a small number of parties and resolved to move forward to list chrysotile asbestos in Annex III; (c) the $5 million grant made to support the Asbestos Disease Research Institute Bernie Banton Centre; (d) funding for the new Australian Mesothelioma Registry, which was launched in 2010 to gather more detailed and accurate information on mesothelioma and asbestosrelated diseases; (e) support for the harmonisation of health and safety legislation which will provide, for the first time, a uniform framework for the minimisation of exposure, the removal of asbestos, and the management asbestos materials in the workplace; (f) the establishment of the Asbestos Management Review in late 2010 to recommend strategies for the development of a national strategic plan to improve asbestos awareness, management and removal; (g) the loan agreement with the NSW Government to ensure asbestos victims and their families continue to receive payments through the Asbestos Injuries Compensation Fund; and (h) the $1.5 million Comcare Asbestos Innovation Fund which sponsors programs and research to prevent and better manage asbestos exposure, as well as improve treatment for asbestos-disease sufferers; (4) notes the unwelcome inheritance that asbestos has left on the Australian community, which sees Australian citizens suffering one of the highest rates of asbestos-related diseases in the world, with the effects of asbestos mining still being suffered by many, mostly Indigenous and past employees of James Hardie's operation at Baryulgil in the electoral division of Page, and the poor health and mortality they and their of the International families suffer; (5) extends its profound sympathies to all individuals suffering asbestos-related diseases as well as their friends and families and the friends and families of those who have passed away as a result of asbestos-related diseases; (6) notes the current and potential damage that imported asbestos is creating to the people in the Asia Pacific region where, despite these well documented health risks, it remains an attractive commodity due to its low cost compared to other comparable building material; (7) calls upon the Canadian Government to recognise the potentially catastrophic health and social implications of Canada's production and sale of asbestos and products containing asbestos to these lower socio-economic markets; and (8) supports the Australian Government in using strong diplomatic efforts to convince the Canadian Government to cease both production and trade in asbestos. I first gave notice of this motion during National Asbestos Awareness Week, but because of the way in which the business of the House is conducted it has only just now come up for debate. I am pleased that it is now before the House and that people from all sides are listed to speak on it. The mining of asbestos is akin to subjecting workers to a possible death sentence, as is the export of asbestos. It is something that I simply cannot understand, with the knowledge that we have, as I cannot understand why some countries continue to mine and export it. Canada and Russia are on the list of supporters of the asbestos trade. There is actually a town called Asbestos in Canada and a town called Asbest in Russia, the latter being something I have previously raised in this House. It is hard to know where to start, because so much needs to be done and so much needs to be said. There is the matter of the large amounts of asbestos we have in our public and private buildings and indeed in our own homes. Home renovators are more at risk than ever because so many people are now doing home renovations; it is a popular and good thing to do, but some people would not even be aware they are dealing with asbestos. Domestic residences or premises are also largely unregulated, although there are some regulations in that area. At a national level all types of asbestos banned for use in Australia. Further, since 2003 it has been illegal to import, store, supply, sell or use such materials. The management of asbestos and related issues is a matter for each jurisdiction in our federal system. There are health and safety aspects and workplace issues within respective jurisdictions. There are laws at state and territory levels about the handling and removal of asbestos and strict penalties for non-compliance. However, there are some gaps across all jurisdictions. The New South Wales Ombudsman prepared a report entitled Responding to the asbestos problem: the need for significant reform in New South Wales, dated November 2010. The report stated: … there is no single government agency responsible for coordinating the management and containment of asbestos … there are gaps in asbestos legislation and funding to deal with these issues is inadequate. The report further pointed out that local government was the first point of contact for the community and said that many lacked knowledge and understanding of their role in the regulation of asbestos. I can understand that, but we all have to come to grips with this massive problem that really is of epidemic proportions. I want to say that I am not targeting a particular state or territory jurisdiction. It is just that New South Wales is the state I live in and the one that I read most about. I would also like to add that when Councillor Jenny Dowell, the Mayor of Lismore City Council, saw that I had this matter listed for debate she sent me an email saying that it was 'excellent' that I had done so. She said: Local government is at the forefront of managing approvals for the removal and disposal of asbestos. From time to time we are faced with illegal dumping et cetera but the biggest impact is are that of disease and death for workers and the thousands of home renovators. That was the point at which I started. I further note that the Ombudsman's report stated that it looked at 152 council websites and found no consistency in the information provided to the public. Again, I can understand that this is a difficult area. My motion lists a whole range of things. Firstly, and importantly, it notes the occurrence of National Asbestos Week, which has now passed but which was current when I gave notice of the motion. It recognises the proactive actions of the Australian government in this area and commends the Australian government for a number of really good measures that have been put in place. We are tackling this nationally. It also needs to be done at state level. Some of the occupational health legislation can help in that area. There is the international aspect, because we know that asbestos is mined in various places. We know that its use is still huge in the Asia Pacific region, which is our region, and that asbestos is exported. I would like to commend the Parliamentary Group on Asbestos Related Disease that was set up in this place. A lot of members on all sides take part in that, including ministers and shadow ministers. We all attend because we know that this is something we really have to grapple with. I commend Senator Lisa Singh for setting up that group and also the honourable member for MCMillan, who supports this group. When he spoke on the night on which the group met he thanked Senator Singh-giving credit where credit was due, in that it was her initiative. The guest speaker journalist/writer Matt Peacock, who is a leading light in bringing to public attention the dangers of asbestos. Decades ago he published material on this matter, including on the problems associated with asbestos at the James Hardie mine in Baryulgil, in my seat of Page. There was considerable trauma and disease, and that is ongoing, because asbestos problems are not something that disappear overnight. As recently as 8 November 2011 Matt Peacock reported a telling and deadly documentary on Foreign Correspondent about India's use and importation of asbestos from Canada. So my motion lays out some of the good action that has been taken and will continue to be taken. It really speaks for itself. We are also working to get a lot of areas in order. There was a loan agreement with New South Wales-and I pay tribute to the honourable member for Charlton, who did a lot to bring that to the public's attention and who helped to make that happen; there were funds for the Asbestos Disease Research Institute; and there was the ratification of the ILO also Convention concerning Safety in the Use of Asbestos and the leadership regarding the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade. I support a worldwide ban on asbestosfull stop. It is just something that needs to be left in the ground. I note that in some countries where they say it is asbestos free, if there is a one per cent inclusion of asbestos in it, they can still have that branding on it. Some of the things that we need to continue to do are to raise awareness of asbestos hazards, build alliances with like-minded countries and pursue further restriction on asbestos by listing chrysotile asbestos in annex III of the Rotterdam convention. We also need to build capacity in developing was countries, assist with developing domestic asbestos management regimes with the removal and lobby countries which oppose or do not actively support asbestos removal to change their positions. At the ALP National Conference, where I was a delegate, we did a number of things to change the platform. We said we wanted Australia to continue to lead international calls for a global treaty to ban the use of and trade in asbestos. We will host an international conference in 2012, the Global Alliance Against the Asbestos Hazard, in collaboration with the ILO and other likeminded organisations, to build support for international action on asbestos. We also hope that AusAID can help develop an aid program which supports better education about the risks posed by asbestos. The DEPUTY SPEAKER Vamvakinou): Is the motion seconded?",186
249,Mr CHESTER,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE, I second the motion.,189

251,Mr CHESTER,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE,"It is a pleasure to join the debate this evening. I commend the member for Page for her motion on National Asbestos Awareness Week and also for her advocacy work in issues associated with safety surrounding the handling of asbestos products and the possible spread of asbestos related disease. I recently had the opportunity to witness the member's advocacy work first hand when she was in Sale as the Chair of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, which was looking into opportunities to expand the Sale RAAF base. She took the opportunity to question the officials from the Department of Defence about ensuring that whatever work was going to take place there would be safe in protecting of the workers and subcontractors on the site as well as the service personnel there. She has a very real commitment and I admire her passion and determination in this particular area. The motion is quite an extensive one, as the previous speaker indicated. I will focus my comments tonight on the key points as they affect Gippslanders. As a bit of a personal perspective, from my dealings with people in my community and also with my own family, the issue of asbestos related disease is very real for many people in Gippsland. From my own experience, my father was a plumber, and he often used to tell the story about how, as a young bloke and an apprentice, he and his mates would bundle up the loose product and throw it at each other. It was a bit of fun after work, I think, for the boys, the young apprentices, on (Ms the job, not knowing of course the risks that they were exposing themselves to. My own father died of lung cancer four years ago, and I cannot help wondering whether some of that was related to his exposure. It did not help that a lot of young boys in those days smoked a lot. We now know the risks associated with smoking and with exposure to asbestos, and it could not have helped those young fellows. At an industry level, the exposure to asbestos is a key concern for workers rights across the Gippsland and La Trobe Valley area. We have many people who are currently employed, or who were previously employed, in heavy industries, particularly associated with the power sector. We are fortunate in Gippsland to have a group known as the Gippsland Asbestos Related Disease Support Group, which I will refer to more extensively in a few moments time. With these factors in mind, I have no hesitation in supporting the motion as put to the House tonight by the member for Page, nor in supporting the Parliamentary Group on Asbestos Related Disease, which the previous speaker also referred to and whose launch coincided with National Asbestos Awareness Week. I congratulate Senator Lisa Singh and my neighbour in Gippsland, the member for MCMillan, Russell Broadbent, for co-chairing that group. The group is designed to raise awareness of asbestos related disease, and on the evening of its formation Mr Broadbent commented that Australia has one of the highest rates of asbestos related disease in the world, with nearly 10,000 recorded cases of mesothelioma since records began in the 1980s. He also indicated at the time that there is an increasing rate of diagnosis in women, as we begin to experience what they are describing as a third wave of sufferers from the home renovation era, which the member for Page also referred to. I quote one thing that Russell Broadbent said on the night: Too many lives have been affected by asbestos related disease and together we must work together to address the asbestos-related issues. PGARD aims to be a conduit between the local community and the parliament on asbestos related issues. I congratulate Senator Singh, Mr Broadbent and the member for Page for taking that bipartisan approach to what is a very serious issue in our community. The scale of the problem facing Australia and the rest of the world should not be underestimated. The motion before the House recognises that Australian citizens suffer one of the highest rates of asbestos related disease in the world, and the widespread use of these products has been described to me by people in my electorate as something of a ticking time bomb on industrial sites and in residential homes throughout the nation. Even tonight, as I was watching the ABC evening news, there was reference to asbestos being found today on the foreshore at Kingston. In this case it was bonded material, and the authorities are very confident that it can be disposed of effectively and efficiently, but it indicates that this is an ongoing issue that we are going to be dealing with for many years to come. The biggest risk, and the member for Page referred to it, is the home renovation sector, and in particular the ignorance of the potential threat that is out there. I am concerned that many Australians will be putting their own health at risk and the health of their families, their neighbours and their work colleagues if they are unaware of the potential risk posed by asbestos in the workplace or at home. We have made some massive improvements in the past decade and beyond in the identification of asbestos in the workplace. The OH&S laws that have been brought into place have been useful in that regard, but it is in the home environment that I think the biggest risk lies for us. If a home was built or renovated in the years leading up to 1985 it is most likely that it will contain asbestos somewhere. I understand that if it is left undisturbed it does not normally pose any health risk to anyone, and apart from monitoring it and perhaps painting it to make sure it remains in a stable condition there is no cause for homeowners to be alarmed. But where it does pose a significant health risk is in circumstances where it is disturbed during renovations or in demolition of houses where the asbestos fibres can be released into the air and inhaled. That can lead to asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma. When I was a young fellow my father was one who used to occasionally take on contracts to demolish homes. As young boys we would go out there and join in the demolition. It was great fun getting the sledgehammer into the walls, the AC sheeting and everything else. I am sure that we should have been wearing more safety equipment than the gloves and the pair of old boots that we were issued with for the job. It is these sort of things where, through ignorance, well-meaning people who do not understand the risks they are taking have perhaps participated in jobs-in my case a bit of home demolition work, but I am sure in other cases it will be people doing renovation in the future-where they do not really know what they are dealing with. It is good that we have come a long way since those days, but I want to go back to what I referred to a little earlier about the work of a group in my electorate called the Gippsland Asbestos Related Disease Group. I am not sure that every community is as fortunate as we are in Gippsland to have a group like this working on a daily basis to raise awareness and to help educate the public about the potential risks that are out there. GARDS, as it is known, plays a very important role in my community: firstly, in raising awareness of the risk of exposure to asbestos, but also in advocating on behalf of the sufferers. The work includes GARDS volunteers offering a telephone support service and drop-in service at their office. organises meetings where guest presenters come along and let people know what the potential risks are and providing information on support services that are out there. The advocacy work is perhaps focused more on improving health support services and compensation arrangements to asbestos sufferers and their families. I have recently had the opportunity to meet with the chief executive of GARDS, a lady by the name of Vicki Hamilton, who was here in Canberra for the launch of the parliamentary group. She works tirelessly to represent the interests of the sufferers in my community and their families. As we all recognise, the asbestos diseases are particularly insidious and they really do have an impact on the entire family. So it is important that the work of GARDS recognises the impact it does have on families. Vicki is a lady who has enormous compassion for the people she is working with and working for, but she is also determined to make a difference and reduce the incidence of further outbreaks of asbestos related diseases. She is a very strong advocate and a fierce champion. It is fair to say you would not want to mess with a lady like Vicki Hamilton. When she gets something in her mind that she is going to do, she does it to the best of her ability. We are fortunate to have her working on the asbestos related diseases support group in Gippsland. The important point to note as we debate the motion tonight is that there is a concern that the rate of malignant mesothelioma is expected to rise from 2012 to 2020. It is also worth reinforcing, in the opportunity I have here tonight, to anyone who may be listening, that there is no safe exposure to asbestos fibres. Part of the role that we have here in this parliamentary group, and also the role that Vicki Hamilton has in my electorate It with the Gippsland group, is in educating people. There are a lot of home renovators out there at the moment. They are mainly men and it is fair to say that blokes are not always the best in looking after their own health. They perhaps have an attitude that it will not happen to them or a bit of a crash or crash-through approach to home renovation job. So it is important that the education campaign that does roll out is understood by everyone-and I mean everyone-so the wives, girlfriends and children might also encourage their loved ones to take the appropriate precautions. There are a couple of points to remember. One is that if you do not know what the product is you are dealing with in the home environment you should always assume that it does have some element of asbestos in it and take the appropriate precautions. It is also worth reminding people that they can get a licensed person to dispose of the product or seek advice from groups like the asbestos related disease support group in my electorate, which has developed things like the 'Asbestos in the home removal kit'. That is another very positive step that other communities could take. It is an innovation from the Gippsland group which has been very well received in my community. But the best advice of all is that, if you are not confident in doing the job safely yourself, call in the experts. They come in at about the price of any other qualified tradesperson, but what price do you put on your family's health and on your own health. Safe disposal is a very key point and there are many cases still occurring in our community of dumping of asbestos products. It is outrageous to think that someone would expose others in the community to a risk like that, but there are many cases of that. I am looking forward to continuing to work with my colleague the member for MCMillan and others like the member for Page and Senator Singh to make sure we do whatever we can in this place to reduce the incidence of asbestos related diseases in the community. Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (20:20): I am pleased to follow the member for Gippsland and join the member for Page in speaking on this motion tonight noting Asbestos Awareness Week. I would also pay tribute to a couple of activists on this issue from my own electorate of Throsby in New South Wales, in particular our local branch member Jim David, who spoke very passionately on this matter at a branch meeting that I attended a few weeks ago and urged me to raise this matter in parliament. I do so willingly. Shirley Sheed, who is a local activist from Port Kembla and a very strong activist in the Asbestos Diseases Foundation of Australia has been putting her time and energy behind this issue for many, many decades. The battle for justice for victims of asbestos diseases is very important to me personally, and I have been engaged in it for many years as well. Like many Australians and many people in this place, I have lost friends to the horrible disease of mesothelioma and have family members who suffer from asbestos related diseases. I am proud to have followed in the footsteps of those before me in the Australian union movement who have been campaigning on asbestos since the 1960s. As I have already noted in this place, in 2005 I had the great honour to go to work with the ACTU as part of their legal team in negotiating with James Hardie and their representatives in the campaign and ultimate settlement to bring some justice to the sufferers who have asbestos related diseases. Campaigning for justice against James Hardie, a company that sought to abdicate both their responsibilities in relation to asbestos products and their social responsibilities, was a defining experience in my life. I met many great Australians, including Bernie Banton and his wife and many other brave Australians who campaigned hard to get justice for themselves while they were suffering from those terrible diseases. Tonight I want to talk briefly about the point that is raised in paragraph (7) of the member for Page's motion. It is about the international situation, and Canada in particular. It is a great shame that, while asbestos is virtually banned for use in Canada, that country continues to trade in white asbestos to India and indeed accounts for about 95 per cent of the international trade in asbestos products. In doing this, Canada relies on the fact that asbestos use is legal in India. What we know about the export of asbestos from Canada and other countries is that the products are being exported not to the First World but rather to developing countries, countries that can least afford the health impacts of asbestos related diseases now and for many decades into the future. The member for Gippsland mentioned the threat that is posed to home renovators. You do not have to walk far in my suburb to see houses, sheds, garages, fences and roofs made out of asbestos and asbestos products. I have a great fear that the long tail of asbestos related diseases will be with us for some time to come. I echo the concerns and sentiments of the member for Gippsland and the member for Page in this regard. Accordingly, I think it is a great shame that the Canadian government continues to support the asbestos industry, because we know that each day that the export of asbestos related products goes on prolongs the suffering and the disease that is created when those products are put into the economy and into people's suburbs. It is a catastrophic situation for the people of India. The true costs of asbestos are being hidden from the people of India. If the hidden medical costs were properly taken into account, there is no way that asbestos would continue to be seen and used as a cheap building material. For these reasons, I am proud to add my voice in support of this motion and to urge all other members in this place to support it and to get behind the recently formed Parliamentary Group on Asbestos Related Disease, to raise awareness and advocacy and urge further action, parliamentary and otherwise, to fight the scourge that is asbestos and asbestos related disease. I commend the motion to the House. Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (20:25): I rise tonight to support this motion on Asbestos Awareness Week, to congratulate the member for Page for putting it together and to support the comments from the members for Gippsland and Throsby. This is a rather long motion, but there are a few clauses which I think need to be highlighted. One is clause (2), which says that the House: … recognises the proactive actions of the Australian Government in mitigating the possible spread of asbestos related diseases through continuing bans on the production and use of asbestos as well as strict controls on the and disposal of existing material; Those bans actually came in in 1991, when we had a complete ban on the use of asbestos in Australia. The only thing I can say to that is that it is a bit disappointing that it took so many years to do. The dangers of asbestos were known decades before 1991, yet asbestos continued to be used throughout the seventies and eighties, which means that no doubt in years to come we will continue to see a lot of people suffering from asbestos related diseases. The bans should have been brought in decades earlier, when we knew the problems that we had. The other part of a motion that I think needs commenting on is paragraph (3)(e), which says that the Australian government supports: … harmonisation of health and safety legislation which will provide, for the first time, a uniform framework for the minimisation of exposure, the removal of asbestos, and the management of asbestos materials in the workplace; As other members have commented, there is a lot of home renovation going on. A lot of people are working on renovating old houses, and it is very important that steps are taken and safety standards are put into place to make sure that these people are not exposed to asbestos. Asbestos diseases have been found to take 20 years to develop and they affect people from all walks of life. It is not only people who were directly exposed to industries and workplaces where there was a lot of asbestos; many people who have had no contact with industry or with building sites have still succumbed to asbestos related diseases. Clause (5) of the motion states that the government: … extends its profound sympathies to all individuals suffering asbestos-related diseases as well as their friends and families and the friends and families of those who have passed away as a removal result of asbestos-related diseases; It is tragic that we have lost so many people so far to asbestos related diseases, but unfortunately it appears that for the next 20 years we are still going to have this problem going on. Therefore it is important that the government continues to support research in this field and treatment and care for people who have suffered. In my electorate of Hughes, Newbridge Heights Public School recently had an issue with asbestos from a fire that occurred 14 years ago at the school. A lot of the building rubble from the fire was actually buried on the school grounds. We should thank one of the local residents, a parent called Linda Lambourne, who was vigilant in exposing this and bringing it to the school's attention that asbestos had been found in the schoolyard. Hopefully the remediation work being undertaken on that will make sure there are no problems at Newbridge Heights. We should learn from the mistakes and the time that it took us to bring in proper regulations to regulate asbestos, especially in view of the many other types of pollution we have in our environment today, particularly air pollution and the particulate matters known as PM10 and PM2.5. It was interesting that a recent national environment protection of ambient air quality study in Australia noted: Overall, the results of health reviews show that there were significant health effects at current levels of air pollution in Australian cities. These findings indicate that the current standards are not meeting the requirements of adequate protection of human health. There is evidence that these standards should be revised to minimise the impact of air pollution on the health of the Australian population. The finding is strongly supported by all stakeholders throughout the consultation process. I was very surprised to discover that currently in Australia we have no compliance standards for the particulate matter PM2.5 and we have no annual average standards for PM10. These are things we need to look at, especially in areas of Western Sydney. We need to make sure that everything we are doing in government is to give the best quality air to our residents and to bring Australian standards up to international standards for particulate matter. We do not want to see a repeat of the mistakes we have made in the past with the time it has taken to bring in thorough regulations on asbestos. (Time expired)",189
252,Mr ZAPPIA,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," I commend the member for Page for bringing this motion before the House. I also acknowledge the contributions made by all of the other speakers so far. It is good to see that this motion does have cross-party support. In 2005, a memorial was unveiled at Pitman Park in the City of Salisbury in memory of the people who suffered or died from asbestos related illnesses. It was established by the Asbestos Victims Association of South Australia. Each year in November, a memorial service is held at the site and as part of the service a white wooden cross is placed in the ground adjacent to the memorial with the name of each of the people who have died because of asbestos since the Asbestos Victims Association began keeping records. Each year I attend the service; each year there are more white crosses in the ground. In most cases, those who died did so from work related illness or family members who were indirectly exposed to the deadly asbestos fibres from the work clothes being brought home. Sadly, thousands more will die in the coming years even though, since 31 December 2003, it has been illegal in Australia to use, reuse or sell any products containing any form of asbestos. For many, it was too late. The fibres were in their bodies and they now face a slow and painful death from an insidious disease. What makes the issue more controversial is that asbestos continued to be used for well over 100 years after its dangers were first exposed. The owners of asbestos mines and those who manufactured asbestos products were not merely negligent-they knowingly promoted a dangerous product. Thanks to the efforts of so many people around the world, the use of asbestos has now been banned in many countries. However, the asbestos fight is only the tip of the iceberg. Firstly, asbestos continues to be used in disadvantaged countries where people are poorly educated. Secondly, the asbestos story applies to many other commonly used products manufacturers are aware of the risks but the evidence is inconclusive. From tobacco companies to chemical companies, and manufacturers of IT equipment, serious concerns have been raised about the long term use of other commonly used products. At least with tobacco, the health warnings are very clear and for most people it is a matter of choice with the full knowledge of the risk. The worldwide asbestos campaign is about the responsibilities of governments and regulators. It is about the ethics of industry. It is about justice and injustice. As with the life of the legendary cricketer Basil D'Oliveira, whom we debated in the House earlier today, where the more profound impact of his life was not on cricket but on the issue of racial discrimination, the asbestos campaign is about the exploitation of human life for greed and profit. In respect to that, I join in the comments of other speakers that I too am astounded at the Canadian government's decision to refuse to allow the addition of chrysotile asbestos fibres to the Rotterdam Convention. Chrysotile asbestos, otherwise known as white asbestos, is a major export product of that country. Whilst I could understand a private company wanting to pursue its operations, I cannot understand a government being part of the export of that product. This is a point made in the newsletter of the Asbestos Victims Association of South Australia-that very same Canadian government that is agreeing to export this product is simultaneously removing asbestos from its 1928 parliamentary building. The convention is a multilateral treaty to promote shared responsibilities in relation to the importation of hazardous chemicals. Canada is the only G8 country objecting to the listing. I believe where that this government ought to do what it can to encourage Canada to support the listing. Lastly, I pay tribute and commend the work of Terry Miller, Kat Burge, Pam Sandys and Tony Henstridge who are the volunteers who man and support the Asbestos Victims Association in South Australia. Their tireless work in support of the victims, the victims' families, their advocacy against the use of asbestos and their community education and awareness campaigns are an absolute credit to them. From my experience of working with them and seeing what they do, their work is truly invaluable, and I thank them for it.",194
253,Mr TEHAN,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," I rise to speak to the motion in front of the House tonight. The motion is: That this House: (1) notes that as National Asbestos Awareness Week is formally recognised, it makes earnest representation to the Government to continue to call on Canada to ratify the listing of chrysotile asbestos in the Rotterdam Convention on Prior Informed Consent; (2) recognises the proactive actions of the Australian Government in mitigating the possible spread of asbestos related diseases through continuing bans on the production and use of asbestos as well as strict controls on the removal and disposal of existing material; (3) commends the Australian Government on a number of measures that have been put into place to manage and compensate the victims of asbestos related diseases which include: (a) the recent ratification of the International Labour Organization (ILO) Asbestos Convention, as one of the first ILO Conventions to be ratified by the Commonwealth Government since 2006; (b) Australian leadership on a strong closing declaration by 66 countries at the 2011 Conference of the Rotterdam Convention, which expressed deep concern that the listing of chrysotile asbestos had been prevented by a small number of parties and resolved to move forward to list chrysotile asbestos in Annex III; (c) the $5 million grant made to support the Asbestos Disease Research Institute Bernie Banton Centre; (d) funding for the new Australian Mesothelioma Registry, which was launched in 2010 to gather more detailed and accurate information on mesothelioma and asbestosrelated diseases; (e) support for the harmonisation of health and safety legislation which will provide, for the time, a uniform framework for the minimisation of exposure, the removal of asbestos, and the management asbestos materials in the workplace; (f) the establishment of the Asbestos Management Review in late 2010 to recommend strategies for the development of a national strategic plan to improve asbestos awareness, management and removal; (g) the loan agreement with the NSW Government to ensure asbestos victims and their families continue to receive payments through the Asbestos Injuries Compensation Fund; and (h) the $1.5 million Comcare Asbestos Innovation Fund which sponsors programs and research to prevent and better manage asbestos exposure, as well as improve treatment for asbestos-disease sufferers; (4) notes the unwelcome inheritance that asbestos has left on the Australian community, which sees Australian citizens suffering one of the highest rates of asbestos-related diseases in the world, with the effects of asbestos mining still being suffered by many, mostly Indigenous and past employees of James Hardie's operation at Baryulgil in the electoral division of Page, and the poor health and mortality they and their families suffer; (5) extends its profound sympathies to all individuals suffering asbestos-related diseases as well as their friends and families and the friends and families of those who have passed away as a result of asbestos-related diseases; (6) notes the current and potential damage that imported asbestos is creating to the people in the Asia Pacific region where, despite these well documented health risks, it remains an attractive commodity due to its low cost compared to other comparable building material; (7) calls upon the Canadian Government to recognise the potentially catastrophic health and social implications of Canada's production and sale of asbestos and products containing asbestos to these lower socio-economic markets; and (8) supports the Australian Government in using strong diplomatic efforts to convince the Canadian Government to cease both production and trade in asbestos. first The one aspect of this motion I will just touch on tonight is the issue of our bilateral relationship with Canada. I note the special relationship we have with Canada. We cooperate very well with Canada in multilateral forums and we have a strong economic and trade relationship. Canada is Australia's 21st largest merchandise trading partner, with the two-way trade totalling $3 billion in 2010. We also have a mutual investment relationship. So, in supporting the call for the Australian government to make strong diplomatic efforts to convince the Canadian government, I also call on the government to make sure it does this in a way which reflects the very strong relationship we have with Canada. They are our ally. We have a very good relationship which dates back many years. I therefore think that we should use science, facts and our experience with asbestos in Australia to convince them of the path we think we should go down. That is the type of diplomatic activity we should use. Canada has been a long standing friend and ally of our country and I think that if we go to them with a very sound argument-one based on the science and the health facts arising from our experience here in Australia-down the track we will be able to get Canada to understand where we are coming from. (Time expired)",195
254,Ms OWENS,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," I also would like to thank the member for Page for moving this motion and for reminding us all how important it is that the Australian government continues to call on Canada to ratify the listing of chrysotile asbestos Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade. We in Australia know asbestos very well. In the 15 years after World War II, 52 per cent of all houses built in the state of New South Wales were made of fibro. In my electorate, where building was intense at that time in Wentworthville, Pendle Hill and Toongabbie, there are some local government areas where 90 per cent of the houses are made from fibro. Australia suffers one of the highest rates of incidence of mesothelioma-the worse of the asbestos related diseases-in the world, with estimates of 13,000 cases by 2020 and a further 40,000 to 45,000 cases of asbestos related cancer. This is a dreadful disease which hangs around in the community and shows itself some 40, 50 or 60 years after exposure to the fibres. Many in my community think of India as part of the family-their mums and their dads and their cousins still live there. So to think that a country like India, which is growing so fast, is continuing to use this product and that it is being exported there from a country where you could not even give it away-Canada-is truly shocking. The use of asbestos in India has increased by more than 300 per cent in the last couple of decades. A very wise man, Dr Sanjay Chaturvedi, said it quite well when he said: … the burden of industrial pollution reaches the developing world much faster than the fruits of industrial growth. There can be no doubt that, as the global demand for asbestos decreased, there were companies which aggressively sought out countries where the building boom was on but where the health and worker safety regulations were still developing. Such countries will face a future very similar to in the ours. We in the world who have handled asbestos for many years should know better. We should not doubt how profoundly appalling some of the behaviour of asbestos producers has been in the past and how appalling it continues to be. The world has known about the dangers of asbestos for many, many years. It was known by the Greeks, and Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder noticed that women who wove asbestos into cloth commonly displayed a sickness of the lungs. The first modern registered death from asbestos exposure was in 1899-40 years before James Hardie opened its plant in my electorate. It was a 33-year-old man who died from asbestos related disease. He had worked in an asbestos textile factory for 14 years and, of the nine other people who worked with him, he was, when he died, the only one to have survived until then. In 1906, the French made recommendations that asbestos workplaces should be ventilated. In 1916, Prudential Insurance in the US decided that they would no longer give life insurance to asbestos workers. In 1917 and 1918, there was more research in the US and James Hardie set up their plant-without appropriate worker safety practices. The first diagnosis of asbestosis was in 1924, following the death of a 33-year-old woman who had been working with asbestos since she was 13. A subsequent study showed that 25 per cent of asbestos workers in England had lung disease. The first workers compensation claim for asbestos was in 1927, involving a foreman in a textile plant in Massachusetts. By the thirties, when James Hardie opened its plant in Australia, a significant amount of scientific knowledge had been accumulated about asbestos-related disease. The US made asbestosis a work compensatable disease in 1941-many years ago, and yet we still have Canada selling material to developing countries. The first Australian case of mesothelioma was a miner from Wittenoom-in 1962. Later research identified over 658 cases leading up to 1979. James Hardie put a warning on its product in 1978 and stopped producing it in 1982 but continued to sell its stockpile until 1987appalling behaviour. I commend the motion to the House.

255,Mr MCCORMACK,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," Awareness weeks are part and parcel of the national health calendar, and that is a good thing. They bring what is often much-needed publicity to what in many cases were once little known or thought about ailments and illnesses. By highlighting the causes, symptoms and where possible cures of certain conditions, the general public, media outlets, parliaments and most importantly sufferers and their families can come to know more about some of the health-related afflictions which beset our modern world. Importantly, understanding illnesses and appreciating just what people affected by them are going through goes a long way towards improving health services to combat them. That is what these awareness weeks are all about. These days, one of the most important awareness weeks is that pertaining to asbestos. In Australia, bans continue on the production and use of asbestos and strict controls are in place for the removal and disposal of existing material. This is how it must be. A $5 million Commonwealth grant has been allocated to support the Asbestos Disease Research Institute Bernie Banton Centre. This is appropriate and commendable. Funding has also been provided for the new Australian Mesothelioma Registry, launched in 2010 to compile more accurate and detailed information on mesothelioma and asbestosrelated diseases. This takes in support for the this harmonisation of health and safety legislation which for the first time will put in place a uniform framework for the minimisation of exposure, the removal of asbestos and the management of asbestos materials in the workplace. There are also the provisions of the loan agreement with the New South Wales government to ensure asbestos victims and their families continue to receive payments through the Asbestos Injuries Compensation Fund. This fund is unfortunately going to be increasingly necessary into the future. As well, there is the $1.5 million Comcare Asbestos Innovation Fund, which sponsors programs and research to prevent and better manage asbestos exposure, as well as improve treatment for asbestos-disease sufferers. Ongoing research is vitally important. All too sadly, Australia suffers one of the highest rates of asbestos-related diseases in the world, with the effects of asbestos mining still being suffered by many. More is the pity that in the Asia-Pacific region where, despite what we know here in Australia and as is well documented worldwide, asbestos remains an attractive commodity because of its low cost compared to other comparable building materials. According to the Victorian government's Better Health channel, Australia has one of the highest rates of mesothelioma in the world. This is due to the high rate of asbestos use and mining over many decades. Since the early 1980s more than 10,000 individuals have succumbed mesothelioma after being exposed to asbestos and, according to cancer experts, additional 25,000 Australians are expected die over the next forty years from this painful and crippling disease. To put it into perspective, in 2007 nearly 600 people were diagnosed with mesothelioma in Australia. Of these new cases, 81 per cent were men. The figures also showed that, as suspected, deaths occurred most often in the age range encompassing those individuals who were 75 to 79 years old. More than 70 per cent of the mesothelioma deaths were among men and women over the age of 65. National trends from 1997 to 2007 show that deaths from mesothelioma steadily increased. Experts suggest that the number of deaths from mesothelioma will peak somewhere between 2014 and 2021, depending on the models used. Mesothelioma is a rare and often fatal cancer of the mesothelium, the membrane which covers most of the body's internal organs. Mesothelioma can develop decades after exposure to asbestos. Where it cannot be surgically removed, this condition is incurable. In some cases just a whiff of asbestos dust can prove ultimately fatal. Symptoms or signs of mesothelioma may not appear until 20 to 50 years, or more, after exposure to asbestos. Studies show that the Australians most at risk of developing mesothelioma include trades such as carpenters, construction workers, electrical engineers, insulation installers, miners, plumbers and shipbuilders. At Batlow in my Riverina electorate not only did a devastating hailstorm on 9 November last year wipe out the apple crop and strip trees to the extent they will take years to recover but also a major processor now faces asbestos-related damage to a warehouse. This has real and lasting to financial implications for this town, for which apples are almost its sole economic an means. Hopefully assistance will be to forthcoming to Batlow as it tries to build a future after being hit with more setbacks than could be deemed fair. I commend the motion to the House.",198
256,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE, The time for the debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Iran,199
257,Ms PARKE,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," I move That this House: (1) expresses deep concern to our interparliamentary colleagues in the Iranian Parliament regarding serious and systematic human rights violations occurring in the Islamic Republic of Iran; (2) notes the following from United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's report on The situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran released in September 2011, that: (a) Iran has stepped up its crackdown on human rights workers, women's rights activists, journalists and government opponents; (b) since the beginning of 2011, Iran has seen a notable increase in the use of capital punishment for political and juvenile prisoners; (c) Iran has increased discrimination, in some cases amounting to persecution, against a number of religious and ethnic minority groups; (d) the United Nations continues to hold long standing concerns in respect of the treatment of the Baha'i community and the trial and sentencing of seven Baha'i community leaders, which did not meet due process and fair trial requirements; (e) there is limited enjoyment of political, economic, social and cultural rights by, inter alia, Arabs, Azeri, Baloch and Kurdish communities, and some communities of non-citizens; and (f) since May 2011, security forces conducted raids on the home of individuals involved in the activities of the Baha'i Institute for Higher Education and arrested 15 of its members in various cities; (3) notes that in recent months there have been: (a) further reports of the denial of access to Iranian universities for young people on the basis of their political or religious beliefs; and (b) prison terms of between four and five imposed on seven Iranian Baha'is in relation to their association with the Baha'i Institute for Higher Education; and (4) calls on the National Consultative Assembly of Iran as fellow members of the inter parliamentary union and as the parliamentary body of a member state of the United Nations, to: (a) promote and protect fundamental human rights irrespective of origin, ethnicity, sex, religion, opinion, or other status; (b) investigate the denial of access to universities for student activists, Baha'is, and others barred from universities for reasons other than academic capability; and (c) seeks a judicial review of the trials of prisoners of conscience, including the seven former Baha'i leaders, lawyer Ms Nasrin Sotoudeh, and other human rights defenders and lawyers. The subject of human rights in Iran was last debated in this place on 15 November 2010 after a notice of motion was introduced by the member for Blair, Shane Neumann. Since that time the number, range and frequency of serious human rights violations has increased. In 2011, Iran was cited repeatedly, including by the UN Secretary General, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and major international human rights NGOs for violating international human rights law. In September last year, UN Secretary-General, Ban Kimoon, released an updated report, Situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The report outlines eight areas in which the Iranian government is committing serious and systematic violations against the human rights of its own people. These are: instances of torture, cruel and inhuman treatment, and corporal punishment; the application of the death penalty, including by public executions; the execution of juvenile offenders; the use of stoning as a method of execution; the abnegation of women's rights; the serious abuse of the rights of minorities; years the failure to protect freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and freedoms of opinion, expression and religion; and the lack of due process rights. This motion calls upon the National Consultative Assembly of Iran, as fellow members of the Inter-Parliamentary Union and as the parliamentary body of a member state of the United Nations, to promote and protect human rights and to seek judicial review of the trials of prisoners of conscience. Before going into detail on some of those matters, I simply wish to note that Iran, with its impressive history as an integral part of the cradle of civilisation which has produced poets like Khayyam, Saadi and Rumi, brought us Persian rugs and gardens, and made an incredible contribution to international cultural heritage, and traditionally honoured teachers with the highest status in society, has much to offer the world if it is able to change course and correct its actions. I would like to pay tribute to the current generation of courageous Iranians, including Nobel peace prize winner Shirin Ebadi and lawyers Abolfattah Soltani and Nasrin Sotoudeh, who have advocated the upholding of fundamental human rights and peaceful democratic change at enormous personal cost. I think it is also important to note that I do not make these criticisms as part of an Iran bashing exercise while ignoring the misdeeds of other countries. I believe I have been even-handed, including with respect to my own country and our allies in pointing out human rights violations where they have occurred. The UN Secretary-General's 2011 report on Iran found that the application of the death penalty, including on juveniles, has continued and dramatically increased. At the time of Amnesty's 2011 report, at least 600 executions had occurred, reportedly 80 per cent of them for alleged drug offences. Some executions are carried out in public. Iranians authorities claim that public executions are a deterrent to crime. However, international human rights organisations have always maintained that executions in public add to the already cruel, inhuman and degrading nature of the death penalty, and have a dehumanising effect on the victim and a brutalising effect on those who witness the execution. In January last year, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed grave concerns in a letter to the Iranian government about the death sentences handed down to two young men following their conviction on sodomy offences, allegedly committed when they were minors. It is sobering to note that at a time when country and this parliament are debating the rights of same-sex couples to marry, which I fully support, gay people in Iran and in a number of other countries are still fighting for the right to life. So, too, women in Iran who speak out for human rights and the right to live without violence, to make their own choices on marriage and employment and to control their own bodies-they continue to face intimidation and harassment. The UN Secretary-General's 2011 report found that there have been persistent arrests of women involved in campaigning for rights, as well as the arrests of journalists and lawyers who speak out on their behalf. I would now like to turn to the prosecution of religious and ethnic minority groups in Iran. I represented the Australian parliament at an Inter-Parliamentary Union conference in late 2010 at which an Iranian parliamentarian extolled the virtue of Iran's freedom of religion as expressed in its 1979 constitution. It is true that Iran's constitution contains a list of recognised religions-those that existed before the time of the Prophet Mohammed. Notwithstanding the apparent tolerance towards those religions in the constitution, Human Rights Watch in its 2012 world report on Iran has documented cases of severe discrimination and persecution of Iran's religious and ethnic minorities, including Sunni Muslims, converts to Christianity and Arabs. But the Iranian state has perhaps been most savage in its oppression of the Baha'is, who are the largest non-Muslim religious minority in Iran and who are not recognised in the constitution because Baha'u'llah, the founder of the Bah'ai faith, came after the Prophet Mohammed. As I have noted previously in this place, there are many people of the Bah'ai faith living in Australia, including in my electorate of Fremantle and this surrounding areas. I would like to acknowledge the presence of Natalie Mobini and other Baha'is in the Speaker's gallery tonight. Baha'is believe in the unity of religion and humankind, and in harmony between science and religion. They have an elected leadership and promote equality between men and women. In my experience, they are gentle and peace loving people, so it is difficult to understand the degree of hostility by the authorities in Iran towards them. During debate on the previous motion, the member for Blair noted there were at that time 50 Baha'is being held in prisons across Iran due to their faith. That number has doubled over the past year. These prisoners include the seven Baha'i leaders who were arrested in 2008 and have been held in appalling conditions ever since. They have each received sentences of 20 years after brief court sessions, characterised by a lack of due process, as noted by the UN Secretary General. Several of these prisoners have immediate family members who are Australian citizens-brother, sister, aunts, nephews and nieces, who wonder if they will ever see their loved ones again. Indeed, the oldest of the prisoners, Mr Khanjani, has already suffered the loss of his beloved wife, who has passed away since he was imprisoned. Among the Baha'i prisoners are a group of educators, referred to in the motion, who have been sentenced to prison terms of four and five years for the purported crime of providing education to young people who are barred from accessing Iran's universities on the basis of their religion. The Baha'i faith highly values education and when it became clear, following the early years of the Islamic revolution, that the regime was determined to prevent Baha'i students from accessing tertiary education, the Baha'i community in Iran took the remarkable and creative step of establishing its own informal mechanism to enable them to study. They used the services of Baha'i lecturers, who had all been sacked from public universities, first providing study programs by correspondence and later through small classes conducted in homes around the country and even through on-line courses. In May 2011, the Iranian authorities launched a concerted attack against the Baha'i Institute for Higher Education, conducting coordinated raids on 39 homes across the country, confiscating property and arresting 16 individuals. Seven of those people were sentenced in October 2011 for 'membership in the deviant Baha'ist sect, with the goal of taking action against the security of the country'. One of these prisoners has a brother who is an Australian citizen, a long standing resident of Dubbo, who is desperately worried for him. The member for Parkes spoke about his case in this place in June 2011. These cases represent only a handful of the 100 Baha'is currently held in Iranian prison. The prisoners themselves represent only some of the more than 500 Baha'is arrested since August 2004 and those arrested, in turn, only represent a tiny portion of the many thousands of Baha'is who have been subjected to physical assaults, intimidation and questioning, property searches and confiscation, monitoring of their bank accounts, movement and activities, denial of work and education and even the desecration and destruction of graves and cemeteries. Last November Canadian senator Romeo Dallaire, the former UN peacekeeping force commander who defied orders to leave Rwanda during the 1994 genocide, told a Canadian Senate inquiry that Iran's current actions against Baha'is reminded him of what he witnessed in Africa: The similarities with what I saw in Rwanda are absolutely unquestionable, equal … and in fact applied with seemingly the same verve … The alarming increase in incarceration among the Baha'is and, most particularly, among their leadership; the disproportionate sentences and unreasonable bail and the vile propaganda that paints Baha'is as cultish and part of a Zionist conspiracy to undermine the Islamic state of Iran is all … false. It is all an instrument to excuse the deliberate actions by that government to destroy that religion within their boundaries. He also said: Make no mistake these are not only indices of past and present persecution; they are warning signs of mass atrocities, of genocide. Let us not witness another one, fully conscious of what the consequences are. I conclude by simply noting that the abuse of human rights in Iran today is utterly unacceptable and unworthy of a once great nation. I urge Iranian parliamentarians to look to their hearts and consciences to remedy this situation and to support their own people's efforts for change. I thank all members who are making a contribution to this debate tonight.",199
258,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE, Is the motion seconded? Ms Saffin: I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,203
259,Ms ODWYER,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," I stand today in support of the motion of the member for Fremantle. I stand together with somebody from the opposite side of the chamber in condemning the abhorrent and repugnant human rights abuses that are currently occurring in the so-called Republic of Iran. There must be no more serious and heinous act in this world than a government turning on its own people and committing violent atrocities on its own citizenry. The very institution that is designed to defend rights of its people turns persecutor on those that it is expected to protect. The Arab Spring, at its inception, gave us all hope and anticipation of a positive cultural and political revolution across the Middle East. The optimist in all of us was hoping that democracy would sweep across northern Africa and into the Persian Gulf in a tidal wave of freedom. We did not want Israel to continue to stand as the lone beacon of democracy in the Middle East. Alas, on the ground, the Arab Spring has not matched the anticipation. For all of the hopes that we had, the people of Iran, Syria, Libya and Bahrain have been met with bullets, aggression and brutality. It is the act of the desperate and despicable to unleash the might of its armed forces on its own people, and we have witnessed that. The Arab Spring gave us hope of democracy and the young Iranians on the streets gave us hope for change, but we have seen the acts of a true despot in that of the President of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. One needs only look at a number of his public statements to discover the depths of this so-called leader's depravity. On the state of Israel he has stated that it 'must be wiped off the map' and that 'with God's grace this regime will be annihilated and Palestinians and other regional nations will be rid of its bad omen'. On the Holocaust he has said: Some European countries insist on saying that Hitler killed millions of innocent Jews in furnaces and they insist on it to the extent that if anyone proves something contrary to that they condemn that person and throw them in jail … we don't accept this claim. He went on to say that they, being Germans or Europeans: … have invented a myth that Jews were massacred and place this above God, religions and the prophets. the On Zionists-read Jews-he has said: The Zionists and their protectors are the most detested people in all of humanity, and the hatred is increasing every day. And he has said: The world powers established these filthy bacteria, the Zionist regime, which is lashing out at the nations in the region like a wild beast. Finally, on the 60th anniversary of the state of Israel's independence, he said: Those who think they can revive the stinking corpse of the usurping and fake Israeli regime by throwing a birthday party are seriously mistaken. Any one of these statements on its own warrants immediate condemnation, yet this despicable vitriol is left unchallenged and has been left unchallenged too often and for too long. It is only now that the world is starting to take more notice of Iran. It is only after the tragic loss of life that the world is paying the attention it should have paid many years before. The words of a tyrant lead to the deeds of a tyrant. It should come as no surprise that the owner of such vile words could be a perpetrator of such vile acts. The only question that remains is: how many people must continue to die before the international community stands against such repression? In Australia during this time one must ask the questions: Who stands conspicuously quiet? Who stands silent while these human rights are abused? It is not those sitting directly opposite me. It is, in fact, the Greens, those people who suggest that they are the champions of human rights and the keepers of the moral chalice, those professed keepers of all that is right and ethical. Where, I ask you, is Senator Brown condemning these actions? Where is Senator Hanson-Young on her soapbox demanding justice? Where is the member for Melbourne, Adam Bandt, in this chamber supporting this motion? Where are the Greens protests in the streets? Most importantly, given all that we have learned about the boycott, divestments and sanctions scheme that grew from the Greens local council movement in Marrickville, where are the calls for the boycotts of Iranian companies or even of Syrian ones, to be truly consistent? No, all that is simply reserved for Israel. Interestingly, the Greens also profess strong champions of human rights, particularly for those who are homosexual. Yet it is the country of Israel, the only democracy in the region, that legislates rights for women and homosexuals. In fact, in a recent poll conducted by GayCities.com in conjunction with American Airlines, Tel Aviv was rated the best gay travel destination of 2011. Yet here the Greens condemn Israel and not Iran. Could you imagine if the Prime Minister of Israel had prayed for the 'annihilation' of the Palestinians? How many motions would the Greens have moved by now? How many press releases, demonstrations and media conferences would they have called? I conducted a search on the Greens website. I typed 'Iran' into their search feature, 23 results were returned and in those results there was not one mention-not one, single, solitary mention-of the atrocities that have taken place, of the abhorrent preachings of the President of Iran or of the blatant human rights abuses posed against ethnic minorities, women and homosexuals. However, if you type in 'Israel' you will find pages and pages and pages-in particular pages as to how you can be involved as well in the BDS movement. This is a truly sad state of affairs and it is of great concern in particular to me that the Greens do not stand with us in this chamber against such violence against human rights workers, women's rights activists, journalists and government opponents. The Greens seem to quote the UN when it suits them and ignore them when it does not conform to their agenda. And make no mistake: the Greens agenda on Israel is well and truly on show. It is incumbent upon all of us who, at times, take our freedoms for granted to stand up for those who do not share the same freedoms. I call on all to be members of this parliament, including the Greens-so including Senator Bob Brownto support this motion and to highlight the atrocities and depravity of the Iranian government and to stand up for the fact that these depravities must come to an end. For too long we have turned a blind eye to the signs that have been staring us in the face, and we must not accept what is unacceptable. I call on the Greens to stand with us in this chamber and support the human rights that are being abused in Iran and to make a very strong and public statement about it.",203
260,Mr DANBY,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," I commend the member for Fremantle on her motion on human rights abuses in Iran and agree with much of the sentiment expressed by the member for Higgins. Parliamentary colleagues, we all recall the stolen Iranian elections of 2010, a fundamental offence to all democrats around the world. We should have known that day when suddenly, in an abandonment of all precedence, the Iranian ministry of the interior picked up the ballot boxes in Iran and suddenly a government that was so unpopular, by contrast with the candidates who were popular, was the subject of a reversal of all predictions happening particularly in certain regions. We remember the images of young people in green attire, protesting against the corrupted and rigged elections. Since that time the Iranian regime, led by Supreme Leader Khamenei and his grotesque President Ahmadinejad, has perpetrated systematic abuses of human rights against the Iranian people. The crackdown on dissidents and human rights activists has been so intense that last month alone we saw journalists Saeed Madani, Parastoo Dokouhaki, Marizeh Rassouli, Mohammad Soleymaninia, Sahameddin Bourghani, Kheradmand, Arash Sadeghi, Ehsan Houshmand and Hassan Fathi detained. Seeking to consolidate its power over the Iranian people, the ayatollah regime of Ahmadinejad and Khamenei have engaged in what the United Nations has described as: … practices that amount to torture, cruel, or degrading treatment of detainees, the imposition of the death penalty in the absence of proper judicial safeguards,the abuse of the status of women, the persecution of religious and ethnic minorities, and the erosion of civil political rights, in particular, intimidation of human rights defenders and civil society actors. Late last year I rose in this House to speak about the crackdown on human rights activists in Iran, including the shocking report that an Iranian actress, Marzeih Vafamehr, had been sentenced to jail and 90 lashes for a film that had been in part critical of the regime. It was a film that had an Australian connection, being supported by an Australian film authority. One of the few creative sectors left in that benighted country has been its film industry. I also spoke of the political science student, Payman Aref, who was jailed for a year by the regime and received, shockingly, 74 lashes for criticizing the president. These abuses are characteristic of a regime intent on crushing any opposition to its right to rule. Of course, we have all known over the last years of its terrible abuse of people of the very gentle Baha'i religion. Perhaps the most disturbing human rights violation perpetrated by this regime is that women and under age people, some as young as 16 years of age, are executed despite Iranian laws outlawing this. It is a regime that employs the dreadful Basij-thugs, who are very much like the SA in 1930s Germany-to beat and torture members of Fatemeh the public, to stab the famous young Iranian woman, Neda Agha-Soltan, who bled to death in the square after the 2009 elections. Charges against victims of Iranian regime include the fact that President Ahmadinejad accused people of warring against God. This is one of the so-called terrible crimes practised by dissidents that have led to executions. We must remember that those in power in Tehran are not representative of the great Persian civilization, of its peoples history and of the current generation. We mourn for them and for the ancient and civilisation which is being defamed by this the harassment and outrageous regime. Ahmadinejad has also detained opposition leaders Mir-Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi. Bloggers and journalists are constantly detained, imprisoned and denied proper treatment. The power of the regime is manifest not only at home but also through its use of fanatical stooges in Lebanon, Hezbollah, and in Gaza, Hamas. We have seen the violence over the last few weeks in Syria, Iran's ally. We see precisely the tactics the Iranian regime has used against its own people in Hezbollah and the Revolutionary Guards have been used as snipers to gun down civilians in the streets of Derra, Homs and Alleppo. It is incumbent upon all of us confronted by this Ba'athist and Iranian butchery to remember the great words of Vaclav Havel: The salvation of this human world lies nowhere else than in the human heart, in the human power to reflect, in human meekness and human responsibility. We have a responsibility, as men and women in parliament, to speak out against these injustices and stand up for the voiceless. (Time expired)",205
261,Mr SIMPKINS,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," I appreciate the opportunity to speak on Iran for the second time in a week. This motion is about human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran and I would say that there is very little that constitutes human rights in that nation. Indeed until the establishment of a liberal democracy I cannot see much hope at all. What we know about Iran is that the current leaders were pretty much the junior officers of the Revolutionary Guard in the period shortly after the 1979 overthrow of the Shah. What we also know is that it is a country of failure-economic failure and failure to even achieve the hopes they had for their own revolution. Perhaps the fact that President Ahmadinejad, being the best known of the leadership acknowledges that the nation has been a failure is not that positive a factor. It is certainly my view that, in acknowledging their failures, what they seek is to revive the revolution and get back to its basics. The revival they pursue is firstly through regional leadership and that they seek to achieve through a foreign policy triumph. It is of course hard to achieve regional leadership when you do not have a model that others could be inspired by. A basket case of an economy is no inspiration. A Shiah Islam dominated nation is again not the leader that the mainly Sunni Middle East will seek to follow, and of course with Iran not being Arab, they are again not easily able to win hegemony in the region. However, all such uninspiring and unsuccessful regimes turn to the usual prescriptions to overcome pathetic failure. In the Middle East that is hatred and threats towards Israel and domestically of course finding local scapegoats for the Iranian government's inability to create a working and effective society that governs in the best interests of the people. Briefly I would remind the House that in the near future Iran will have developed a nuclear warhead that can be placed on the missiles they already possess. Iran as a nuclear power is not the sort of threat that we want in the Middle East or elsewhere in the world. The time for direct action to alleviate that threat approaches and negotiation and talk is only an Iranian ploy to gain time, in my opinion. This motion, however, is about human rights in Iran and I will therefore devote the remainder of my contribution towards that. As I said before, it is always a hallmark of failing governments to blame their own failings on a group within society that can be a scapegoat for them. For the last 150 years the Baha'i have been persecuted in Iran and group, their human rights abused, including in more recent times the arrest and jailing of the leadership in Iran, known as the Baha'i seven. Other notable Baha'i have been arrested in recent months. It of course goes beyond that with ethnic groups also facing restrictions on full participation in Iranian society. It is my view that so much of what is going on in Iran relates to the maintenance of power in the hands of the ruling elite. They always need someone to blame for their own failings and they always need distractions, and this is what drives so much of what is going on in Iran. Of course the means by which this persecution takes place and is allowed to take place is through sharia lawthe system of religious law that is medieval in its positioning and barbaric in its outlook. It is hard to see a purpose for it in the but it is always there in these nations that do not work on any level. It empowers ruling groups with the means to suppress minority ethnic elements and even women who do not have the same opportunities in education or in any part of mainstream society. Clearly nations that adopt sharia law are the nations that will never advance and in general terms will move backwards despite having wealth through oil, gas and other natural resources. To be clear on this matter I would like to be specific about how sharia impacts on the rights of women in Iran, thereby demonstrating its retrograde and backward nature. It is surely barbaric when women's rights activists are targeted for suggesting that women should be able to inherit the estate of her husband, that her testimony in court does not equal a man's, or that she should be able to fully seek a divorce and that a mother should be allowed custody of her own children. Part of this motion has specifically mentioned the United Nations' Report of the Secretary General on the Situation of Human Rights in Iran. While I greatly value the details in that report, I also find irony in the fact that the United Nations' Durban 2 World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Racial Intolerance was so badly abused by the very subject of this motion being Iran. This Iranian regime are a failure. They have failed economically. They have failed to govern in the best interests of their people. They persecute their political opponents in order to maintain their position of power. They attack those who hold different religious views. They attack journalists who hold them to any form of account and they do all this because they like power and, as do all such regimes, they govern for themselves and everything is focused on maintaining world their positions of privilege and power. Iran is a nation where the people are held back and their government is guilty of abusing human rights. I condemn them and look forward to when a liberal democracy can be established to properly look after the rights of the people of Iran. Mr KELVIN THOMSON (Wills) (21:21): I strongly support the motion moved by the member for Fremantle. When I was one of Australia's parliamentary delegates to the United Nations General Assembly late last year, I heard a representative of the Iranian government respond to criticism of its treatment of the Baha'i' by claiming that the Baha'i organisation in Iran was political rather than religious in character, that it was illegal, and that its organisation had been 'closed'. This quite blood-curdling response clearly displays a contempt for the basic concepts of freedom of speech and expression, including freedom of religious expression. In countries such as Australia religious minorities enjoy a very high degree of freedom of religious expression and observance. As far as I am concerned, it is absolutely unacceptable for members of those religions to deny the same freedoms to religious minorities in other countries, including Iran. minorities who enjoy freedom of religious expression in Australia, the US, the UK, Japan, Europe et cetera should provide the same freedom of religious expression in countries in which they are not a minority. In light of the upcoming Iranian presidential elections, scheduled for 12 March, Iranian bloggers and media workers are once again the target of crackdowns and arrests by Iranian authorities. This may mean we will see a repeat of the unrest during the aftermath of the previous fraudulent presidential elections. According to Amnesty International: … Iranian authorities are once again choosing to restrict freedom of expression and association in an apparent attempt to disrupt public discourse and potential criticism of the authorities' in various spheres including human rights and economic performance in advance of the start of the election campaign. Amnesty's report, titled Iran: Wave of arrests in run up to parliamentary elections, lists the names of individuals who have been incarcerated for convictions such as 'acting against national security', 'spreading propaganda against the system' and criticising the Iranian regime. Such arrests are by no means without precedent. Students, women and political activists are regularly the target of arrests and are subject to gang rape and both physical and psychological torture during their imprisonment. According to Ahmed Shaheed, the new UN special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Iran, Iranian authorities have secretly executed hundreds of prisoners. According to Amnesty International, Iran has the world's highest per capita execution rate. In the year 2011, the Iranian regime executed 488 people for drug related offences compared to 2009 and 2010 where 172 and 166 executions were recorded respectively. Religious Social freedoms are restricted. According to Iran's Islamic laws, men and women are not permitted to interact unless they are related. If a man and a woman are walking in public and are approached by the morality police, they must justify their relationship to the authorities, who may or may not be satisfied with their response. Seventy per cent of Iran's 70 million population is under the age of 35. It is commonplace for the morality police to interrogate the youth on their choice of hairstyle and clothing as well as their choice in music. I believe we should be more supportive of the Iranian opposition. I am mystified as to why we continue to list Iranian opposition groups the PMOI and the MEK as terrorist groups. It is a free gift from us to the Iranian record regime. Do we get anything back from Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in return? No. He is as outrageous as ever. While I am on this topic, it is important that the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees is able to resettle the residents of Camp Ashraf in democratic countries rather than them being left to the tender mercies of either the Iraqi or Iranian governments. Neither of those governments is trustworthy in relation to this matter and the UN and the nations of the world have an obligation to ensure there is no more violence here. Finally, let me praise and salute the courage of the Iranian people who resist their violent leaders. I marvel at the courage, the gutsiness, of those Iranian people who refuse to submit and who constantly find ways to defy the regime, despite the threats to their personal safety.",206
262,Mr SIMPKINS,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE, I seek leave to speak on this matter again. Leave granted.,209
263,Mr SIMPKINS,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE,"I welcome the opportunity to again echo the remarks of the member for Fremantle with regard to the situation in Iran and the terrible state of human rights in that country. I recently, in the last couple of weeks, had the opportunity to visit Israel. As part of that visit, not far from Haifa, I visited the headquarters of the Baha'i faith. One of the things that happens when Iran seeks to persecute the Baha'i is they constantly refer to the link between the Baha'i and Israel, as if there is some sort of conspiracy. As we know the headquarters of the Baha'i is within the land of Israel but they are not associated with the Israeli government. They are a faith that have sought to further their own interests. Most of them are located within Iran, there is no doubt about that, but the scapegoating that I referred to in my last contribution is clearly about the maintenance of the current regime in Iran. It is a regime which, as I said before, comprehensively in every sense of the word. When you have the resources that Iran has, there is no reason why they should not succeed. And, yet, the reality is that since 1979, since the Islamic revolution, the country has continued to fail. They cannot run an economy. That is one thing but the way they seek to legitimise their position and the governing of the country comes down to scapegoating. It comes down to finding reasons why they have failed, and it is always about blame and, at the heart of it, it then becomes about asking, 'How do we maintain our regime?' Again, it is focused internally on who they can persecute, who they can hold responsible for their own failings-and the Baha'i are right up there on that list, as are a number of other minority groups that exist and which have been referred to by previous speakers. Externally they seek to demonise Israel; they seek to unite the remainder of the Islamic world in their persecution and their pursuit of Israel. In the end, all the Iranian regime has really got is base power. They are looking for nuclear weapon opportunities, and they will seek to lead the Islamic world through that means. They do not have a legitimate claim over that part of the world, and whilst they might have great ambition they do not have any real claim for the hegemony that I spoke about before. Debate adjourned. NA The SPEAKER (21:30): Order! It being 9:30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Iraq",209
264,Mr RUDDOCK,ADJOURNMENT," Today I wanted to participate in a debate in another chamber on a motion moved by the member for Fowler on the Sabian fails Mandaeans but, because of a diplomatic visitor, I was unable to be present in the chamber to participate in the debate. I wanted to note my support for his raising this issue. It is not the first time that he has done so. In fact, I spoke on a motion in very similar terms on 30 May last year. At that time. I noted that I had had a long association with the Sabian Mandaeans, the Assyrians, the Chaldeans and other Aramaic speakers generally. They were not necessarily constituents of mine but I was particularly interested in the plight of many of the original Christians and also the followers of John the Baptist-the Sabian Mandaeans. Having played such a significant role in those countries in the Middle East, it was tremendously disappointing to see them under pressure at particular points in time and suffering as a result of persecution. I noted in my previous speech that I had had meetings with the Middle East Council of Churches, particularly in Jordan. I had been told, in a very concerned way, that they were very worried about what was happening to Christians in many Middle Eastern countries. It would be a disaster if we came to a point where Christians, where all that early history and engagement occurred, were no longer able to reside in those parts of the world. So it was with a deal of pleasure that I noticed again that the member for Fowler recognised the historic connections and contributions of the Mandaeans and others in that region, their ongoing plight and the systemic loss of culture, heritage and language. He condemned the acts of violence and persecution and encouraged the preservation and continued prosperity of the heritage and culture of the Sabian Mandaeans and other indigenous people of Iraq. Some 50 per cent of Mandaeans have either died or left Iraq since 2003. Mandaeans have repeatedly called for the evacuation of their entire people. The community now numbers about 3,500 people, down from 60,000 people in 2003. Religion and ethnicity go hand in hand in Iraq. Unfortunately, that is also reflected in the constitution. It is a situation where only minorities like the Mandaeans, included in the subgroup of Christians and other groups, lack certain privileges that one might expect. There is nothing in the way of representation. We have seen situations in which there are recorded killings, including of women and children. There have been 46 kidnappings and 10 reported threats-21 between January 2007 and January 2008. According to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq, as reported in 2010, eight members of the community have been killed or injured due to politically or ethnically motivated attacks. Some 6,000 Sabian Mandaeans now live in Sydney. I guess that is one of the reasons that this matter has been raised by some of my colleagues. Let me make one point which I disagreed with on the last occasion, which was the linking of Australia's part in the coalition of the willing with prompting us to be involved in this matter. The member, in his motion, states: … Australia … has a moral responsibility to compassionately support and protect the indigenous minorities … When I was Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, I was able to provide within the refugee program many places to settle Sabian Mandaeans in Australia. I think they have been wonderful settlers. I notice that the honourable member has been raising with the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship matters relating to the Sabian Mandaeans. I hope that, in response to his representations, this government will be able to be as generous as the former government was in assisting the Sabian Mandaeans, who need further assistance. (Time expired) Page Electorate: Pelicans on Posties",209
265,Ms SAFFIN,ADJOURNMENT," I speak tonight to bring the attention of the House to a wonderful local initiative that aims to raise funds for a local Ballina based school, Biala Special School, and the Royal Flying Doctor Service. We all know and love the Royal Flying Doctor Service, and if honourable members knew the Biala Special School in the way that I do they would love it in the same way that I do. In fact, a family had moved from another state just so that their child could attend this school. The blessing was that it was in Ballina, because they would have moved anywhere in Australia to have their child in the school, but they got the double prize-also being able to live in Ballina. I attended the launch of Pelicans on Posties on Friday at Biala Special School in Ballina. It was the first time that I had been on an Australia Post postie's bike, which was made especially by Honda. I did not ride it, because I have not got a licence; I just sat on it. Honda is a sponsor-there are a lot of local sponsors and I am sorry that I do not have all their names here tonight-and Honda were there on the day along with some other sponsors. Who are Pelicans on Posties and what are they doing? In their words: A group of 20 blokes (affectionately called Pelicans) from the Northern Rivers Area of New South Wales are riding original postie bikes from Ballina NSW to Darwin NT to raise funds to support children with special needs along with supporting medical services to the outback. How did this come about? Again, in their words: The idea began the same way most great Australian ideas do, over a few beers at the pub. Most years a few friends will get together and go out West for some occasion be it the Birdsville Races, a charity event like the Endeavour Rally or the Variety Bash, ideas were being exhausted. This year they decided to go one better, they were sick of cars and so opted for postie bikes. Darwin is far enough away to be an adventure and a half and they chose their own worthy causes to fundraise for. It's a crazy idea and it's going big! It's so crazy that many people said we'll never do it, crazy enough that it just might work. I am sure it will work, and I am backing it. I have the route here. They are starting in Ballina. I will not name everywhere, but they are going to Roma, Tambo, Longreach, Camooweal, Barkly Homestead, Renner Springs, Katherine and Adelaide River, ending up in Darwin in July. I said to the 20 blokes-the Pelicans on Posties-that I will raise the awareness of it with my colleagues here whose seats they are riding through and also with the local mayors. Because it is not happening until July I have time to do that, so hopefully they will be welcomed. It is raising money for Biala Special School, which is in my seat of Page, and also for the Royal Flying Doctor Service, which covers a wide area over the seats of various members and is also something that we all throw our support behind. One of the Pelicans on Posties is Bill MCInerney, who is leading the team and who is someone I have known for a long time, one of the good locals. The other Pelicans are Gavin Speers, Dick MCInerney, Lee Fitzgerald, Bernie Heckel, John Linton, Brett Cramp, Troy Cramp, Heini Geisel, Mick Koellner, Peter Livingston, Scott Gollan, Monk, Mark Vado, Brendan Byrne, Brendan Bourke, and Pelicans 17, 18, 19 and 20 whose images will be listed soon on the website. The website is www.pelicansonposties.com.au. We are helping by buying raffle tickets, so we might be able to win one of those bikes made especially for Australia Post-they are not easy to acquire. (Time expired) Pelicans on Posties Herbert Electorate: 3RAR Mr EWEN JONES (Herbert) (21:40): To the member for Page: if those guys are going out there on postie bikes, the one thing to be they will not be looking for on the way home is a seat. They were looking for an acronym for the drive along the Flinders Highway, and one wag from Richmond came up with the acronym, MAMBA country. They asked him what it stood for and he said, 'Miles and Miles of Bugger All'. They will see plenty of that. Just be very careful-the only thing you see on the side of the road at night that does not look like a cow is a cow. Last week on Friday I had the great honour of standing at the side of the road of our fabulous Strand to watch the welcome for the 3RAR. The 3rd Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment has moved from the seat of Cook into paradise in the seat of Herbert. They marched along, and it was a casual 34 or 35 degrees with 87 or 88 per cent humidity, but the guys just loved it. They had to form up in Strand Park near the Cenotaph there, which, Mr Speaker, you will know very well, and stand at attention for about 15 minutes before the speeches started. They watched all sorts of speeches. They had a welcome to country by Gracelyn Smallwood and Uncle Arthur Johnson from Magnetic Island. We only lost two, who collapsed in the heat, but we were very lucky to be able to walk around the crowd afterwards and welcome the boys. As true Townsvillians we turned upthere were about 1,500 people there at 10 o'clock in the morning on a school day to welcome them. The 3rd Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment is the final hand in glove for the ready-deployable forces in Australia. It has truly come home. The member for Cook has often been told that the shire is where it happens, that the shire greatest place on earth, but he is so wrong. The guys have been fantastically welcomed into Townsville. It is not just the guys who are there; it is what they bring with them. With Lavarack Barracks, the RAAF base at Garbutt and Ross Island Barracks at South Townsville we now have over 7,000 defence people in Townsville, and with those 7,000 defence people we also have their families who live with us. The effort that the ADF and the Townsville City Council in particular have made in integrating the defence personnel into our community has made Townsville the No. 1 spot that people want to be transferred to when they are in the Defence Force. We are singularly the best spot for defence forces in Australia. Our football clubs of all codes will be welcoming young, strong, fit men. These men are paratroopers; they proudly wear the parachute on the right shoulder. They are ready-deployable, trained, professional soldiers, but it is not only them but their wives who will fill our playgroups, our coffee lounges and our jobs that we need them to do. Their children will come into our schools and our university and our trade centres. Their friends will come and visit them. Townsville is a wonderful place and it is a great place to be. We were lucky enough to have a defence families expo on the Friday afternoon and the Saturday, where we saw over 1,200 families come through to find out about everything from the Burdekin, out to Charters Towers, up to the Great Green Way and towards Tully, Innisfail and Ingham. It was a wonderful place for everyone to come through, and the Murray Stadium that the Townsville City Council erected with federal funding was a welcome place for it. I was lucky enough to attend the Royal Australian Regiment dinner on Saturday night where the numbers were swelled by the is the officers and gentlemen from the 3rd Battalion. We were lucky enough to receive an address from Brigadier Bruce Scott, who has just returned from Afghanistan. The things that he was able to tell us about what is going on over there and the esteem with which Australian soldiers and Defence personnel are held was truly remarkable. It goes without saying, we have a wonderful place here that we are able to maintain these sorts of relationships without our Defence Force. We have 7,000 Defence personnel. All these people are coming in and our places are all open. Come to Townsville; it is a great place to be if you want 3 RAR. Thank you very much. Mr Speaker.",210
266,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"As I assume that Brigadier Bruce Scott is not the honourable member for Maranoa, I will allow the member for Herbert to refer to him in such terms. Banking",212
267,Ms BURKE,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to speak on the worrying trend of job cuts in the banking industry as reflected by the recent decision Westpac to axe 560 jobs and the ANZ announcement today of 1,000 jobs to be lost. Employees in the banking industry and jobs within the finance area have always been a particular passion of mine as I had worked in the Finance Sector Union as an industrial officer before entering this place. Indeed, I am reminded of the words I said in my maiden speech in this place some 14 years ago when I lamented the job cuts that ANZ were going through at that time and the sadness that I had experienced of having to let people know that their jobs were no longer there. I particularly remember one senior manager who said to me: 'Anna, you know if they had given me six more months I would have gotten the gold watch. Do you reckon you can get me the gold watch?' Well I got him his gold watch, but it was not the issue of the gold watch-it was his loyalty to an organisation who had seen him in his prime and had just axed him from his job. There were many peaks and troughs working in the Finance Sector Union, and the announcement by Westpac today reminds me of the bad times when we were told of large job losses that were driven by boardroom decisions and nothing more. It is the ever present cost-income driver. How profitable does a bank in this country need to be? These job losses were not lost because of declining conditions in the banking industry. They were lost because of a heartless calculation of cost and income, where cost was calculated in terms of human capital and personal pain. Then, as now, the major players in the banking industry were recording billion-dollar profits. I saw thousands of staff being made redundant from the ANZ group-the group I was looking after at the time. These job losses represented not only retrenched men and women but also a huge loss of of opportunity for future school leavers, graduates and many mums returning to the workforce. Then, like now, job losses meant that many with decades of experience in the finance sector were suddenly stranded without any realistic prospect of future work. Where do these workers now go? Then, like now, we were dealing with the question of how banks would deliver services. Often the job losses I was dealing with back then were about bank closures. The bizarre thing is, at that time they then reopened all the bank branches because they realised customers actually like to talk to a human being, and the Bendigo Bank was capturing the market. So we will go through this cycle again-but why? Why do we have to cause this human misery? Now we are dealing with the phenomenon of jobs being sent offshore; this is not new. How banks can do this in a period of record billion-dollar profits just beggars belief. The big four banks in Australia alone made $24 billion in profits last year. I do not have a problem with banks making a profit. Indeed, I am proud that they are making such profits in this country. Profitable banks that bring a return to their shareholders are a vital element for a strong and prosperous country; it is vital for every shareholder in this nation. But it does not seem right or fair that Westpac on the one hand is making $6 billion in record profits in one year and paying their CEO nearly $10 million and, on the other hand, axing hundreds of jobs. Today, ANZ has announced that about 1,000 jobs are likely to be axed. Their share price on that announcement rose to 25c in early trading. That is it: a thousand families face job losses and they are worth 25c in share value. I really question the sense of offshoring. Offshoring not only means that Australian jobs are foregone with the massive consequence in human terms, which I referred to, but seems a completely shortterm response to long-term issues in the finance sector. I moved a private member's bill in this place in 2007 speaking about very issue. We just go round and round in circles. The global financial crisis has created a different environment for Australian banks. The sovereign debt crisis in Europe has created a large degree of economic volatility. Banks increasingly need to find long-term solutions to deliver shortterm returns and to support individuals in business and, indeed, the national economy. Many of the jobs banks may need in the coming years do not exist now. It makes sense to create a specially trained and flexible workforce for the days when these banks will need these jobs-not a short sighted, cost-cutting exercise. In addition, customer focus in this sector is more important than ever. Banks are taking a big risk in cutting staff in an increasingly competitive environment. Experienced and skilled staff are essential banking if they are to survive the environment where customers are becoming more sophisticated. Banks also need to be mindful of their brand. Their customers are walking away because they are trashing their brand. With the issue of offshoring, do you know where your information sleeps tonight? Do you know if your bank has offshored all the private information you provided when you took a loan? No, you do not. It could already be housed in India where their privacy laws are nowhere near as stringent as ours. Consumers should be properly informed when they take out these products. I call upon Westpac, ANZ and the other banks to reverse these short-sighted decisions. (Time expired) Private Health Insurance",213
268,Ms GAMBARO,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to express my concern and outrage at the detrimental effects of federal and state Labor policies on the cost of living for constituents in my electorate. The people of Brisbane deserve better than the incompetence and this mismanagement of the Gillard and Bligh Labor governments. The latest attack by Labor on the cost of living of constituents in my electorate is the private health insurance rebate changes that are currently before the parliament. The changes propose the slashing of the private health rebate and increasing the Medicare levy surcharge for certain categories of taxpayers. This is effectively a tax hike for the relevant taxpayers in the categories that are prescribed, but the impact does not stop there. Independent analysis has predicted the flow-on and indirect effects of the changes will be very, very significant. These changes will force people to drop their private health cover or choose cheaper cover with more procedures excluded, thus creating upward pressure on premiums for everyone, including lowand middle-income earners, in and forcing more people into overcrowded, overstretched public health services. We see evidence of this every day at the Royal Brisbane Hospital in Herston. The AMA public hospital record card 2011 also revealed that 220,000 Queensland patients were kept 'off the books' for elective surgery; ambulances queue for hours outside emergency departments just to get their patients through the door and into a bed. These changes are especially significant for my electorate, because 89,920 people in Brisbane have private health insurance and 66,676 of these people are voters, which equates to 72 per cent of the voting public. This is 20 per cent above the national average. The real life impact of these changes is expressed very well in an email I received from a constituent of mine in Grange. He writes: I just read an article regarding debate about the medicare levy and means testing the rebate. I'm 31 and got private health insurance just in time. what a waste that was. I earn just over $80,000 and my girlfriend who i've bought a house with is a teacher. I went to uni and have a hecs debt but because of my earnings I'm paying it off. would like to pay it in bulk but they've dropped the discount so the $$$ better in my pocket for longer. Why is it that everything is means tested? We are currently just over the limit, meaning that we are getting slugged with the flood levy, soon to be carbon tax and if they change the Medicare levy or increase it, we will be dudded on that as well. Tell me why Australians should try to succeed. There is no point. I'm now working harder for free. The more i earn the quicker i pay my hecs, the more i pay for others. I'm on the borderline. I should go get a job earning $75,000 and I'd be better off. No levy's,no means testing. Please do something. This country is going down the drain! These are the forgotten Australians that Labor is ignoring. As this constituent says, the changes come on top of the flood levy and the carbon tax. This is an ordinary, hard working Australian who aspires to be successful. Increasing the cost of living for working Australians is not a trait that is unique to federal Labor governments, because the Bligh government has an equally appalling record in this regard. Massive increases in electricity, water, stamp duty and car registration have been the hallmark of the Bligh government and its predecessor the Beattie government. That is why there is a very important choice for Queenslanders to make on 24 March. My electorate will be a key battleground in this fight. The LNP led by Campbell Newman has a plan to lower the cost of living by freezing car registration, repealing the waste tax, reinstating the principal place of residence concessional rate for stamp duty, cutting government waste and many other measures. I look forward to working with Campbell in Ashgrove; Saxon Rice, up against one of Australia's worse Treasurers, Andrew Fraser in Mt Coo-tha; Dr Chris Davis in Stafford; Robert Cavallucci in Brisbane Central; and Tim Nicholls in Clayfield to ensure that we have a government that is committed to lowering the cost of living for Queenslanders. The people of Brisbane will have their chance to send both federal and state Labor a message on 24 March, and I urge them to do so by consigning the Bligh government to the scrapheap of Australian political history-exactly where it belongs. Bass Electorate: 'Hooked on Books'",214
269,Mr LYONS,ADJOURNMENT," I rise in the House this evening to speak on the opening of Hooked on Books, an exhibition visiting the Launceston Queen Victoria Museum and Gallery at Inveresk, and to thank Mr Richard Mulvaney, Director of QVMAG, for his words at the opening, which I quote from tonight. Peter Gouldthorpe, artist and illustrator, opened the exhibition on Friday night. The exhibition showcases Albert Ullin's collection of children's picture book illustrations from 1974 to 2009. Albert Ullin is a former president of the Children's Book Council of Australia. He is a recipient of the Dromkeen Medal for services to children's literature and he received the Medal of the Order of Australia in 1997. It is my understanding that Mr Ullin began acquiring the works in the late 1970s, when he became aware that young illustrators of picture books were struggling to make a living. The Hooked on Books exhibition is presented, curated and managed by OzLink Entertainment and is certainly worth a visit for families. This exhibition is particularly important 2012 is the National Year of Reading. The National Year of Reading promotes the idea of children learning to read and provides sources of inspiration for those who are already keen readers. According to the 2006 adult literacy and life skills survey, nearly half of all Australians-46 per cent-do not have the literacy skills they need to cope with the complex demands of everyday life and work in the emerging knowledge based economy. This could range from the basic demands of everyday life, such as reading a street sign or recipe, to understanding instructions on a medicine bottle, reading a text book at school or reading safety instructions at work. Australian libraries and associations were behind the campaign to turn 2012 into the National Year of Reading, linking together a range of inspirational programs and events. Libraries will be partnering with government, the media, writers, schools, publishers, booksellers, employers, childcare providers, health professionals and a whole host of other organisations that share a passion for reading. The Launceston City Council in my electorate of Bass is participating in the National Year of Reading by distributing book vouchers to children participating in citizenship ceremonies throughout 2012, and providing information about the initiative at community events such as Children's Week activities. The council is also working with the Launceston Library to support their National Year of Reading program of activities, and is liaising with Cityprom to coordinate an event in the city that will promote the joy of reading. I hope that all parents read to their children and that children who have eye as problems are able to get them rectified if possible as early as possible so that the potential for learning is available to them. It is my hope that every child in Launceston can visit this exhibition. I thank Richard Mulvaney and curator Jacqueline Taylor OAM for their efforts. I also wish to note that there are some great ambassadors for the National Year of Reading, including my good friend and colleague Dick Adams, the member for Lyons; Bryce Courtenay AM; and Anh Do, among many others. The Australian government is committed to delivering the highest quality education for all Australian students and has engaged states and territories in a challenging reform agenda for literacy and numeracy. This new library approach to improving outcomes is based on greater collaboration around what works. Getting the basics right at school is critical in building an education system that pursues excellence and equity for every student. The Gillard Labor government believes that every child in every school has the right to a great education. We have invested $65 billion in schools over four years-almost double the coalition's investment in their last term. The UK's National Year of Reading in 2008 was successful in starting to shift attitudes to and behaviours around reading with specific target audiences. It resulted in 6,000 National Year of Reading events registered on the website and 2.3 million new public library members. This was a fantastic achievement and one that I hope can be repeated here in Australia. I ask that every member of the community visit the Hooked on Books exhibition at the QVMAG in Launceston. Gillard Government",215
270,Mr ALEXANDER,ADJOURNMENT," A couple of weeks ago, the Prime Minister summoned her caucus to gather around with some butcher's paper, pencils at the ready, to develop policy for our nation's future. One can only wonder at the thoughts that must have been passing through the minds of her enthused backbenchers. The party that 'lost its way' has built on the 'year of decision delivery' and now has the butcher's paper that will lead it through 2012 and beyond. To keep some perspective, let us take a moment to contrast how others go about the business of strategic planning. In the corporate world the development of investment strategies is partnered with intensive due diligence, as expert decision makers analyse the direction in which the company is going to travel. At the centre are fiscal prudence and responsibility to shareholders, checked by an assortment of banks and accountants who independently scrutinise every last dollar. Smaller companies take risks; big businesses are more conservative, more responsible and more accountable, using their vast resources to perpetuate their success. It seems the biggest business of all, the one that runs our country and answers to over 22 million shareholders, operates bit differently. This group with the butcher's paper has a record of investment which includes flammable pink batts, unwanted school halls and $900 gifts to dead peopleand the NBN, such a brilliant idea that it was created on the back of a beer coaster at 30,000 feet! The riches gained and grown over 12 years of good government have all washed away within just a few years of 'hard Labor'. In contrast, on the other side of the aisle, Tony Abbott and Andrew Robb preside over an all-inclusive structure",217
271,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! The honourable member will refer to members by their electorates or by their positions, not by their names.",217
272,Mr ALEXANDER,ADJOURNMENT,"Excuse me. The Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for finance preside over an allinclusive structure of policy development and units. This group is delegated the responsibility to privately address the challenges that we now face and to divine the best path for our nation's future, overseen by shadow ministers who direct, scrutinise, encourage and, at times, redirect. If certain ideas gain support, more guidance and assistance is freely given. The Leader of the Opposition is kept apprised. He is the final check. You had better have your homework done by the time your baby arrives for baptism. As a first-term backbencher, I find one of the most gratifying aspects of involvement in this process is the seriousness with which policy development is treated. In my maiden speech to parliament, I spoke of the need to master-plan our nation's long-term growth. Subsequently I was assigned to chair a sustainable cities policy task force in collaboration with my parliamentary a little colleague the member for Ryan. Most Australians were astounded recently to learn that Sydney's real estate prices are second only to those of Hong Kong, whose high costs are understandable: lots of people and not much land. We have boundless plains and a small population. Land is our single biggest asset. This confounding scenario has developed without intervention. In the absence of any national plan of development the symptoms of serious illness are appearing. There are few things more regrettable than opportunities missed and potential unrealised. This is reminiscent of the story of the master who entrusted money to his servants, of free will. One buried the money and did nothing with it and gave it back to the master on return in full. The other set about industriously using the money, did good work, and increased the master's fortune. The first was chastised for being lazy and doing nothing. The other was praised and rewarded. Apparently there was a third servant, but the text has been lost. is said to have wasted the money on harebrained ideas and was then knifed by his sister, who did even more wasteful and wicked things whilst all the time lying about her deeds. Genuine policy development should arise from due diligence, serious analysis involving academic and industry experts and based on the need for long-term planning and financial responsibility. We are entrusted to govern not just for the current electoral but with a view towards 2020, 2050 and 2100. When it comes time for the next periodic judgment, our team will be ready, having without fanfare sought to expand our vision-scrutinised, examined and testedto find the track to achieve our full potential for this generation and future generations. As the glow of camera flashes subsides from the Prime Minister's butcher-paper event, the coalition have returned to parliament determined to realise our opportunity and prosecute the case for a stronger future for our nation. We stand proudly together on this side of politics, a team united by a common purpose. (Time expired) Makin Electorate: Mawson Lakes",217
273,Mr ZAPPIA,ADJOURNMENT," Following a review of electoral boundaries in South Australia, the suburb of Mawson Lakes is now within the electorate of Makin and I have the privilege of representing the biblical Mawson Lakes community in federal parliament. Prior to the review Mawson Lakes was very well represented by my friend and colleague the member for Port Adelaide. As Mayor of the City of Salisbury during the planning and development of Mawson Lakes, I had a very long personal interest in and close association with the Mawson Lakes community. I therefore very much welcome the opportunity to now He represent the Mawson Lakes people in this place. Mawson Lakes is a unique, relatively self-contained community built on a theme of quality living, learning, working and recreation. It was a joint venture project between the South Australian government and Delfin Lend Lease, with the City of Salisbury and the University of South Australia becoming key partners in the development. Its uniqueness lies in the fact cycle that it was a fully pre-planned community built on vacant stock land adjacent to a university campus and to Technology Park, a high-tech industry precinct. Strategically located in close proximity to other key destinations in Adelaide, it has good arterial road access and a direct rail link to the Adelaide CBD that takes less than 15 minutes. Today, Mawson Lakes has a residential population of around 10,000, a student population in the order of 7,500 and a working population of about 5,000, all well supported by a range of retail, business, education and recreational facilities. The expanded and still growing University of South Australia is complemented by Mawson Lakes primary school and Endeavour Lutheran secondary college, providing an integrated and seamless learning pathway within the community. Community engagement has been a major strength of the Mawson Lakes development. From the outset, active consultation with the local community has driven much of the decision making. A residents association was quickly established once the first residents had moved in. Community events have become a regular feature of the Mawson Lakes community, with both the Mawson Centre and Mobara Park acting as focal points for most events. The Mawson Centre is a modern multipurpose community building which includes, amongst other facilities, a public library and a theatrette. Mobara Park, located in the heart of Mawson Lakes, is named in recognition of the City of Salisbury's Japanese sister city. Mawson Lakes is a very diverse community, with people of all ages, nationalities and occupations now living there. An important aspect of Mawson Lakes is the number of man-made lakes and public open-space areas, including a continuous linear park along Dry Creek, which runs through the suburb. A special feature of Mawson Lakes is the dual water system throughout the development. Each property is connected and plumbed with both mains water and recycled water. In July last year I joined the member for Port Adelaide in the official opening of the Mawson Lakes primary school's new indoor sports stadium, aptly named the Dennison Centre. It is a fantastic addition to the school and, not surprisingly, was very well received and much appreciated by the local community. Equally notable was that the official opening was a whole-of-community event, with broad representation from across the local community further highlighting local community collaboration community spirit. I take this opportunity to especially acknowledge the first residents of Mawson Lakes, the pioneers who moved in during the early years when few services were available. They placed their faith in the developers. At the time, they understandably may have questioned the wisdom of locating their new home there or whether the new suburb would live up to their expectations. I believe that it has. What began just over a decade ago as a relatively isolated university campus surrounded by stock paddocks and a handful of high-tech industries has been transformed into a vibrant, modern community that has become a model development and a sought-after residential and business destination. I am acutely aware of the importance of the defence sector and in particular the DSTO, the Edinburgh defence base, the many defence related industries in Mawson Lakes and the Techport hub at Osborne to the livelihood of many Mawson Lakes residents. For that reason, I recently met with the Minister for Defence Materiel to discuss the importance of federal government contracts to South Australia's defence sector and to South Australia's future. I also know that a considerable number of Mawson Lakes residents are small business operators. As a former small business operator, I well understand the demands and pressures on all business and the importance of ensuring that our economy remains strong. I look forward to representing the Mawson Lakes people in federal parliament, working with them and taking up on their behalf the issues that matter to them. Wind Power",218
274,Mr RAMSEY,ADJOURNMENT," There are increasing concerns around Australia, and and particularly in my home state of South Australia, about the rapid expansion of wind farms and the associated health risks and long-term threats to agriculture. Last year, I raised in this place the issue of the stability of the electricity grid in South Australia. Those points still remain. To reiterate, South Australia is home to 51 per cent of the nation's installed wind capacity-that is, around 1,050 megawatts-which represents 35 per cent of South Australia's total installed generating capacity, including the baseload generators of coal and gas. To flesh this out further, currently there is 792 megawatts of installed capacity in the electorate of Grey alone, making it the undisputed wind capital of Australia. There are considerable spin-offs for local employment opportunities, and I am pleased with the investment. But this question needs to be asked: how far can we go? Already there is between 2,145 and 2,609 megawatts of further wind power generation officially development in the state; although, as I have raised before, because of the inherent destabilization of the grid it remains to be seen whether they will ever be completed. In fact, if all the wind farms under development were to be completed they would encompass 63 per cent of South Australia's installed generation capacity. This is clearly ridiculous and totally unachievable. The grid would collapse well before then. Best advice around the world recommends that unreliable sources not exceed 20 per cent of capacity. In fact, the leading lights in wind generation around the world-Denmark, Portugal and Spain-are presently generating 19 per cent, 18 per cent and 16 per cent of their total electricity from wind. In August last year, Suzlon Energy announced their intention to build one of the biggest wind farms in the world on Yorke Peninsula: 600 megawatts, with an undersea high-voltage DC line connecting the peninsula to Adelaide. That is a very good announcement, even though there are considerable local concerns about the environmental impact, the health impact and the implications for agriculture, particularly aerial spraying. However, if this project were completed, installed wind energy capacity would represent 65 per cent of the total grid capacity, and even this is an underestimate because by then the coal fired power stations at Port Augusta and probably much of the capacity of the gas generation at Torrens Island would be closed. This is unsustainable and cannot happen. Already the grid is experiencing difficulties. At times during the last year, Alinta Energy at Port Augusta has been forced to dump power. Simply, coal power stations and even the gas units at Torrens Island-combined gas cycle generators-are not designed to chase power spikes. They are baseload generators. When the wind blows strongly under there is a surplus of electricity on the market and the price crashes below zero. As retailers, who are compelled to buy 20 per cent renewable, will always buy renewable first, while it is cheap, this leaves the baseload generators with no choice but to dump electricity which is already generated. Obviously, too many days when the generators operate at a loss threaten their long-term viability. At this stage any increase in wind energy will erode the viability of the only baseload generators we have, and that will be a crisis for the state. As an example of just how close we are skating to the wire already, on 31 January last year, a high-demand day, the unreliability of wind was demonstrated when the state was becalmed and the wind produced just 60 megawatts from an installed capacity of 1,018. Should the most optimistic of the wind energy predictions come true and all of the proposed schemes come on line, a similar day would produce a situation where the grid would be reduced to 50 per cent of its capacity, and this would most likely be on one of the highest demand days in the year because that is when we are becalmed, in the middle of summer. Of course, that would be a disaster and cannot be allowed to happen. Wind energy can continue to expand, but it urgently needs either another major interconnector to the eastern states or a technology capable of storing large amounts of electricity. In the short term, I think of these outcomes are unlikely. I raise the issue because I believe much local anxiety is being caused by projects that will not and indeed cannot get off the ground at the moment. I urge the South Australian government and the promoters of these wind farms to be honest with the electorate. Australian Service Personnel of Chinese Heritage War Memorial  Saturday night, I was proud to attend a dinner with Brisbane's southside Chinese community to celebrate the completion of the Chinese-Australian war memorial and bursary program. I have the flyer here. The memorial stands proudly in the Garden of Remembrance at the home of the Sunnybank RSL in Gager Street. It is a fitting tribute our Australian soldiers, sailors and air men and women of Chinese descent. The memorial honours the service and sacrifice of Australian-Chinese service personnel. When the Prime Minister inspected the memorial last year, she described Griffith University architecture student Sarah Batchelor's design as 'simple beauty'. As Prime Minister Gillard said, it will prompt reflection and gratitude. It recognises diggers like Billy Sing and Caleb Shang, who fought in the First World War, and Jack Wong Sue, who served Australia in World War II-to mention but a few of thousands who served. I have told the House before about the courage of Private Billy Sing, who attested to the old Chinese proverb 'kill one man, terrorise a thousand'. He was a roo shooter from Proserpine who became a sniper with the Australian 5th Light Horse Regiment and is conservatively credited with more than 150 enemy soldiers killed in Gallipoli. It is easy to see why he was known to his fellow soldiers as 'the Assassin'. Private Sing was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal both for 'conspicuous gallantry as a sniper at ANZAC'. This memorial and the continuing bursaries honour all those of Chinese heritage who have served their country in times of peace and in war and those who continue to do so now. The RSL and Chinese community established a bursary program to help educate local southside students about the Australian-Chinese service personnel in our armed services. For years to come, they will help tell the stories of our veterans to a new generation. The memorial has been a labour of love and sacrifice for my Chinese community and has helped build stronger links between the local RSL and the broader community. Chinese community leaders like Lewis Lee, Ralph Seeto, Jesse Chee, Douglas Ng, Adam to Lo, Peter Low and many others have given much time and energy to bring this about, as have Sunnybank RSL representatives Robert Lippiatt and Reg Walls and the current president, Brian Ryan, who was formerly of the RAAF. These volunteers have shown what can be achieved when communities focus on what we have in common rather than what divides us. When I first proposed this idea in my first speech to parliament back on Wednesday, 20 February 2008, I never imagined what could be achieved. It is more than just erecting a stainless steel memorial; it is also about helping to heal and help a community. To see the RSL and the Chinese community standing side by side to open a war memorial which honours the service of Chinese Australians, many of whom were not actually citizens or allowed to be citizens the time, shows how far we have come since the 'Night of Broken Glass' which rocked Brisbane back in 1888. That night was born out of fear and mistrust in a different time, and thankfully we live in a different Australia today. This Chinese war memorial is a mark of the diversity, cooperation, understanding and friendship that is alive and well on Brisbane's south side. That is why next week I will meet with the Race Discrimination Commissioner, Dr Helen Szoke; Chinese community representatives; and the RSL. We will reflect on what has been achieved in establishing this memorial. I am very much looking forward to showing the commissioner some of the tastes and sights of my electorate, which has the best restaurants in Australia and is Queensland's real Chinatown. Now that the memorial and the project have been signed off and celebrated, I now look forward to working with the south-side community, particularly the Chinese and Taiwanese communities, and local and state governments to help construct an iconic landmark over Mains Road in my electorate, not far from my electorate office. In this particular lunar year I can think of nothing more appropriate than a big, red dragon. Velo-Cardio-Facial Syndrome",219
275,Dr SOUTHCOTT,ADJOURNMENT," I would like to draw to the attention of the House a very important matter that was brought to my attention by a resident of Boothby, Mr Raymond Tanner. Mr Tanner asked that I bring the issue of velo-cardiofacial syndrome to the attention of the parliament. I do so because I suspect that most people in this House would be unaware of this syndrome. Velo-cardio-facial syndrome is the second most common genetic disorder after Down Syndrome, and affects one in every 2,000 at people. The name velo-cardio-facial syndrome comes from the Latin words velum, meaning palate; cardio, meaning heart; and facies, having to do with the face. Velo-cardio-facial syndrome is a genetic disorder with varying conditions present in each individual with the syndrome. It was first identified by Robert Shprintzen in 1978. Because the syndrome has only been recently identified, in relative terms, many adults may not even realise that they could have VCFS. The syndrome is caused by the deletion of a small segment of their chromosome 22 at the q11 region. The cause of this deletion is not known. More distressingly, a person diagnosed with VCFS has a 50 per cent chance of passing the syndrome on to their children. Those affected may have one or all of more than 180 unique anomalies, including palatal abnormalities, in 69 per cent; heart defects, in 74 per cent; absent or malformed kidneys; learning difficulties; intellectual disability; hearing loss; adult psychiatric disorders; and dysfunctional immune systems. These anomalies can cover nearly every organ system in the body with broad-reaching effects on development and behaviour, including on speech, language, personality, mood, learning, attention, and temperament. Those diagnosed with VCFS may also suffer facial abnormalities. The lack of knowledge of VCFS is frustrating for those suffering from it and for the parents of diagnosed children. Quite often, these people feel that they know more about the issue than the doctors that they see. As I mentioned earlier, this is still a relatively unknown condition and many doctors are still unaware of it. As it is the second-most common syndrome we need to ensure that doctors are better informed of this issue. I would like to thank Mr Tanner for contacting me, and raising his concerns with me. I would also urge the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing, who is sitting at the table, and other members of House to take an interest in velo-cardiofacial syndrome. People can get more information on VCFS at the VCFS Educational Foundation web site at www.vcfsef.org or at the VCFS 22q11 Foundation web site at www.vcfsfa.org.au. Both organisations provide help, support and information for individuals, or families who may be suffering from or supporting a family member with VCFS. I encourage anyone interested to contact them for more information.",222
276,Ms BIRD,ADJOURNMENT," I take the opportunity this evening to report to the House an important event that occurred in my electorate in January. The member for Throsby and I co-hosted a conversation on ageing at which we were pleased to have the Minister for Health and Ageing present to talk with over 200 local people. They came along to talk about the program that the federal government is looking to follow after the publication of the Productivity Commission report on managing ageing, Caring for Older Australians. This is about making sure that our older people, our older citizens, not only have quality of life but, the minister said, are able to participate in and contribute in an ongoing way to their communities, and working out how we can best achieve this at a time when, as we all know from the originally commissioned reports of Treasurer Costello in the former Howard government, we face challenges as the demographics of our communities change so that there are more people over the age of 65 relying on fewer workers of a younger age. It was really encouraging and I think the minister's message was well received by those who were present. He particularly did this not want to frame this conversation as a problem. He does not want to see ageing presented as a negative in our society but he felt we could find a far more productive way of working our way through this by seeing it as an opportunity and by working with older people in our country in order to find ways in which they see themselves participating more fully over the longer term. It was a really good forum. We worked through the overarching principles that the minister had outlined as arising from the commission's recommendations. Briefly for Ageing the House's information, they are, firstly, that every older Australian deserves the right to be able to access quality care and support that is appropriate to their needs, and when they need it. The second is that older Australians deserve greater choice of and control over their care arrangements than the current system provides. The third is that funding arrangements for aged care need to be sustainable and fair both for older Australians and for the broader community. The final one is that older Australians deserve to receive quality care from an appropriately skilled workforce. There were a lot of contributions from as local people ranging across their direct experiences and their hopes and ambitions not only for themselves but for generations that will follow them-an aspect of our current older generation that is familiar to us all is their commitment to making sure that they achieve things not only for themselves but for their children and their grandchildren. We had a lot of that presented at the forum. I want to finish up by referring in particular to a follow-up email I received. One of the groups at the forum was the Dementia Support Network from our local area. The member for Throsby and I had met them when they came to Canberra at the end of last year for a larger forum and lobbying on dementia support event. I followed up on 13 December and met locally with the local support network, organised by Val Fel and Dianne Zisis. I had a really moving meeting with them. There was one lady there-I will not name her-whose husband has dementia as young onset dementia, and it was particularly brave of her to talk about the situation that their family found themselves in and the pain and difficulty they had gone through. Her husband was there with her. I really appreciate that. Val particularly wanted me to follow up after the forum. She had really appreciated the opportunity to talk to the minister on these issues and she wanted to encourage all members of the House and the Senate to think about how they would feel if they suddenly found a loved one no longer knew who they were. If we could answer that, she feels, we would go some way to understanding the challenges that they deal with and to develop strategies for what she calls AREA-awareness, research, education and access-to support and help not only people with dementia but those who support them and love them in their families. I was really pleased they had found that a useful process and I commend them for their ongoing work on developing new local strategies, including working with the University of Wollongong through a community seminar on dementia and to ensure the community is advised of the issues.

The point of this motion picked up by the previous speaker regarding the In frank terms, it is buggered. It does need of the realities faced by local councils right burden of a failing road network. For one council in my region the figures $250 million. Based on current Australian design costs about $1 million. To not go backwards million a year-that is to remain with a backlog around $10 million to $15 million. The maths these are rate pegged councils and their capacity are beyond the point of simply blaming dodgy the point where we can continue to accept the rights. In my view the money raised through taxes people's money and we are not doing our job paying rates and taxes and not getting a return I would agree with another point the previous for example, the Pacific Highway was mentioned-is made. I would also agree, taking it to the next Both the highway network and the regional through Commonwealth and state revenues. It that has failed.

While I would not specifically clear that local government does indeed need rates keep going up and up and that is hurting better way of funding councils to deliver the community. There are limited options for councils to having been a local government councillor for of the revenue that councils have to play with Rates make up about 37 per cent of that, and We have charges for goods and services, and user-pays system for basic services.

It is indirect in some cases, such to the cost of owning a new home. These are finance from. Every time that new infrastructure, required they look to ratchet up those fees. I say you cannot just do that. I remember looking at the budget numbers and the list of there needed to be a 13 per cent rate rise to to about $2½ thousand per household. My reaction gets to the stage where you cannot charge the where people just cannot afford to live in nobody knew the answer to that question, because In Queensland, 88 per cent of council funding direct result of the state government pulling sewerage infrastructure. But they removed homeowners. There is a lot of uncertainty for know in situations like that, where the states About 8½ per cent of funding to local government about 8½ per cent comes from the states, but certainty. urge the Treasurer, the GST review committee and and reflection on that and not allow this GST is the way to go, that there should be no that the network has failed.

294,Ms BURKE,MAIN COMMITTEE," week, firstly, being back in my role as the secondly, completely with respect One of the first committee inquiries that I inquiry into local government. We handed entitled Rates and taxes: a fair share for responsible again having the same debate, we are arguing things. The committee that handed down this every state and territory and to every local more submissions than any other inquiry I inquiry on the clean energy bills, which I have just done. We raised a level of expectation that tragically, we did not. I think it is one of asked people to give us ideas with which to a motion to do with what the report looked federal Liberal government was looking at the local councils, but of course we found that everybody was across the board: local council was pushing back onto the feds and everybody, in turn, The report, at page 115, summed it up for most people: Following a meeting of the Local Government President of MAVMunicipal Association of Victoriawas quoted as saying: Unless we see a reappraisal of the current tax continue to go out to ratepayers … The MAV would investigate several options, Government's GST funds be set aside for councils. That was the original suggestion in the first that they wanted to propose that the states assistance grants to local government from space all together, the GST would go to responsibility for passing everything on to issue, I disagree with the motion before the important. The Pape case showed that there was to local government. In fact, George Williams, constitutional validity for it. That is ultimately which we had in Queensland, where the Beattie Premier, Anna Bligh, and the then local rode roughshod over local communities and where there was no community of interest for that than to have constitutional recognition. So, I am feeling a sense of deja vu this Deputy Speaker from the last parliament and, to the motion before the House. was involved in in this place was a cost-shifting down a phenomenal report in October 2003 local government. Now, in 2012, we are the same issues and we are looking at the same report worked incredibly hard. We went to government that we could. The inquiry received have ever been involved in-even more than the we would resolve something, and of course, the failures of the committee system. We went out, produce something, and here we are dealing with at originally-cost-shifting. At the time, the issue of Labor states pushing things back onto was pushing back onto local councils. It back onto states and the states were pushing was pushing back onto the poor taxpayers. and Planning Ministers' Council in July 2003, the base of local governments, councils will need to cap in hand on an annual basis. including a suggestion that part of the State Howard GST bill.

But under the agreement between the government the goods and services tax and implement agreed to retain responsibility for assisting otherwise local government would have been ripped any more money; there was actually going to time for introducing and doing this, but they less than their fair share. I am not saying that this motion is not inquiry was not important, because we now push-back is onto ratepayers and is onto local said, one of the things we looked at is: what 'How long is a piece of string?' Each council Council. Look at the ACT government, which acts around the place which run ports and airfields. childcare centres. What are they responsible responsible for whatever the community standing and they fill the void. This happens to say to your community that you are not going the state government has pulled out the funding because you did not get any federal money to the sandwich. The main aim of this inquiry and this report need to get together and work better together. what each is raising, and then work it through, need to learn to say no to ratepayers, state need to say it is not their responsibility and hard. I have said to my local councillors that knows who they are. When a bin is not picked a federal level nobody is going to find and abuse councils do find it difficult to say no. I think three levels of government together and resolve in circles.",238

That is why recognition of local government seen all too often where federal government under the terms of the Intergovernmental Financial Relations, with heads of and the Australian Democrats to modify a package of other proposals, the government local government, and that was a good thing, off at the time. There was not going to be be less. The Dems got a bit of a caning at the actually saved local government from getting important and I am not saying that my committee know-and we have known for years-that the government. And, as all the other speakers have is the responsibility of local government? It is, does something different. Look at Brisbane City as the local council. Look at shire councils In my community they run nursing homes and for? The difficulty is that they become wants or demands. They become the last man in rural settings in particular, where it is harder to fund that youth worker this week because or that you are not going to fill that pothole do that. So local council becomes the meat in was to say that the three levels of government They need to understand what each is doing, as opposed to just buck-shifting. Councils also governments and the federal government. They they are not going to fill that void. That is really their job is a lot harder than mine. Everybody up, it is their fault. But if something happens at their federal member of parliament. So local it is a really difficult thing, but we need to get the this now so that we do not keep going around the remarks made by previous speakers the member for Parkes and the member for in local government. I also acknowledge the Indeed, everything falls back on local in their community.

It is a bill that will clarify a number of I addressed very directly some of the spurious and corrected the record with respect to the providing for Australians' retirement incomes, looking forward to speaking on the Tax Laws have said in this place before that I quite like have now found me out and approached over that, but I do admit it. Quite often in these areas of policy in some ways you find the details that put in place aspects of broader were implemented a year before that require a real indications of the government's commitment business and to clarifying and simplifying the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No.9) Bill Moncrieff's opening remarks. I find it quite the Labor government's commitment to retirement so hard through those very difficult reform years available to the general population and then to simple reform. It was perhaps one of the hardest for many years. It is the Labor government NA now that is committed to increasing super contributions the member for Moncrieff about the cost of living. in the band recommended by the Reserve Bank living in human memory, or he said something Perhaps he should have a closer look at the attention to his fantasy life. There is a third element to retirement incomes most important one because, without a accumulating retirement income at all. We have government's very strong commitment to retaining economic crisis, when this government put forward to ensure that as many Australians as possible shedding theirs, we did not see support from the opposition for programs that strengthen important area of the Australian economy people employed but provides the skill base Similarly we have not seen support from extremely important part of our economy. that perhaps he could rethink some of his comments. the fantasy world he lives in is a far more interesting reality. It was an unfortunate Now back to the fun bit: the Tax Laws which is so interesting that they even have quite figure that one out, but I am sure the why all the tax laws have the date twice. There about portability of superannuation. We heard this. It is a particularly interesting area. Australians who have lost touch with their touch with them-one way or the other. In other to them but is, essentially, out of their grasp. pathways for people to find their super through have already been out with mobile offices all in and logon and try to find their lost super. superannuation, if you are a normal person closely, it becomes quite a complicated process. Schedule 1 amends the Superannuation Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997-two fund members to electronically request the through the ATO. It is referred to as the electronic will be much easier, through a phone call to to have their lost superannuation It is quite a clever little device. It makes fund members to consolidate their benefits. they pay on multiple accounts and to maximise to 12 per cent. I note the remarks by To say that working with an inflation rate is the most outrageous increase in the cost of similar, is quite an extraordinary statement. real economic figures and pay a little less and that, of course, is jobs. Perhaps it is the job, you do not have much of a chance of seen an opposition that has not supported this jobs and growing jobs. Through the global a stimulus package specifically designed kept their jobs while the rest of the world were the opposition. We have not seen support from the car industry in Australia, an incredibly that not just keeps many tens of thousands of that flows through other manufacturing sectors. the opposition for the aluminium industry, an So I would suggest to the member for Moncrieff I doubt that he will. I think that, again, one for members of the opposition than and rather misleading contribution. Amendment (2011 Measures No. 9) Bill 2011, the date in it twice. They always do and I cannot guys from Treasury will one day explain to me are six schedules in this bill. Schedule 1 is one of the earlier speakers talk at length about At the moment, we all know that there are many superannuation or their superannuation has lost words, there is money out there that belongs The government has already created some easier the lost super website. In my electorate we over the electorate, encouraging people to come If you ever have tried to consolidate your in the street who does not follow these things Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and the fine bills-to enable certain superannuation consolidation of their superannuation benefits portability form. Essentially it means that it the ATO and then logging on to an ATO website, funds consolidated through the ATO. it much simpler and easier for lost superannuation Essentially, that helps people to reduce the fees their retirement benefits. Again, this is a NA seemingly quite simple improvement but it is this government to the development of the retirement measure was supported by both the Australian Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia. Schedule 2 makes improvement to the capital to restructure. Under current law, taxpayers capital gain or loss that arises from their demerger of an entity from the group of which However, this is not available where the superannuation entity and schedule 2.2 of the the rollover available for both of those types restructures of a certain type by broadening absolutely consistent with the government's business. Once again, this is a small change that this government has been working Schedule 3 concerns the GST financial supply small businesses by increasing the financial If a small business makes a financial acquisition financial supply regime and can claim input tax the threshold takes more small businesses outside businesses in my area will think that a very recommendations agreed to by the government GST financial supply provisions.

All else being equal, hire purchase is mortgage has an increased risk for the lender if there is a default repossession is difficult costly to implement in terms of legal fees see, particularly in the small business area, than chattel mortgage. That is not the case in fact, since the GST was introduced chattel purchase in small businesses, even though chattel and involves greater risk for the finance company. The reason for that is because the GST particularly if the small business runs its accounts annual GST turnover of less than $2 million larger business must account on an accrual one that reflects a long standing commitment of incomes of everyday Australians.

It reduces compliance costs for acquisitions threshold from $50,000 to $150,000. below this amount it falls outside the credits for its financial supplies. Increasing of the financial supply regime. Many small fine thing. The bill implements three of the seven arising out of the Treasury's review of the is amend the GST treatment of hire purchase, number of small businesses in my electorate credit arrangements, hire purchase and chattel arrangements. But they have very important In both cases, essentially the purchaser for a series of payments made in instalments. In until the final payment. In chattel mortgage, usually preferred over chattel mortgage. Chattel because the title has already changed hands and and may not be possible. Hire purchase is far less and stamp duties. You would normally expect to hire purchase being used to a far greater extent Australia since the introduction of the GST. In mortgage has largely replaced the use of hire mortgage is more expensive, more complex operates differently for the two systems, on a cash basis. Small businesses with an can account for GST on a cash basis, whereas basis. Cash accounting is simpler and reduces NA compliance costs, which is why small businesses firms account for their GST liability and upfront whereas small businesses that account payment is made. Under this amendment, the treatment of basis becomes the same as that for larger companies. flow benefit for small businesses compared to that appears to be quite a small change administrative burden and the risk for many change. Schedule 4 involves the GST treatment of essentially reverse the effect of the court that, where a particular combination of constructed residential premises were not subject that newly constructed homes should be subject funds government services that assist the that GST is payable on the full value added developers and builders.

Under tax deduction for certain gifts to organisations amendment lists donations to the Rhodes deduction. This is a fairly routine amendment, Australia or you happen to want to donate to Trust.

It was Labor that mainstay of workers' superannuation savings in that we have a direct employee say in the NA management of those superannuation funds capital.

I to speak on the motion by the member for of children, which regrettably is on the I understand the difficulties that parents face as the biological changes and the external pressures way. I am very committed to working with the how we can best approach it in the parliamentary today. Speaking to the first part of the motion, review in the United Kingdom led by Mr children. The review involved more than 1,000 including surveys, interviews and focus from various organisational and business of an issue that not only affects the UK It is a very worrying issue for parents, do everything that they can to ensure that they images and products can be noticed every with sexualised underwear and swimwear magazine to see 'keep slim' tips and dating the risks of this increasing commercialisation effects, body image issues, eating disorders and For example, according to the Eating Disorders is the third most common chronic illness for NA adolescent girls after obesity and asthma, and the last two decades.

But as parents we must deal with is to have a more open dialogue to provide understand what is happening in the world suggest that the latter, balanced While we want our children to stay innocent inappropriate issues, we must accept the commercialisation and sexualisation in the children. We have to accept that it is an issue and which requires constant dialogue in the the thrust of the recommendations in the review government monitoring progress and legislating particular comment in the response of the education me. Ms Sarah Teather said that it is not enough relevant regulatory systems which were established do their best for children, not simply stick to the rules. As such, as we have seen in the obesity upon the government to step in and impose more businesses when they are directly advertising because, while it would be impossible for completely, we must canvass the options that this issue. In Australia, the parliament in recent years and other outdoor advertising in the House one on the sexualisation of children in the 2008 inquiry report mirrored the UK review's and noted that there is an onus on broadcasters, manufacturers to respond to growing community recommendations to the government. But what was the Labor government's response? The government did not bother to respond until they finally decided to read this report on Australian families, what action did they take? that there is a problem. They noted the recommendations. government has done nothing In Australia, we have systems in place example, the Advertising Standards Board covers billboard advertisements and specific complaints More generally, the Kids Free 2B Kids website the incidence of this disease has increased over the future generations of Australia are of grave that can be taken when considering the The first is restricting the knowledge available completely innocent and naive until they the world as we find it.
