3,Mr CHRISTENSEN,PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS," I move: That Mr Coulton be elected Deputy Speaker of this House. It is my pleasure to nominate the member for Parkes as the Deputy Speaker of the House. Farmers bring to this place a strong connection to the country in the industries that made this country what it is today. The member for Parkes has maintained a very strong connection with the land for generations, particularly around the Warialda and Gravesend districts-so much so that every second name in the local paper, The Warialda Standard, is a Coulton. The name 'Coulton' is now regularly mentioned in more than 40 newspapers across New South Wales, as the electorate of Parkes takes up nearly all of it, covering 393,000 square kilometres. But the Coulton in those stories never actually planned to be a politician. He knew from birth that he wanted to be a farmer, and he spent his first full day driving a tractor at the age of 10. The member for Parkes has spent 30 years as a farmer and grazier. He and his wife, Robyn, owned a farm producing cereal crops and beef cattle before he became the inaugural mayor of the Gwydir Shire Council in 2004. Those who know the member for Parkes will well understand the important role that his wife, Robyn, has played throughout his political career, giving up her career as a school teacher to dedicate her time to serving the electorate of Parkes as well. I have to say, she has also been a dedicated organiser in the Nationals chief whips' office. They are probably valuable traits that prompted the member for Parkes, some 35 years ago, to sell his best horse for an engagement ring. Should the member for Parkes be elevated to the role of Deputy Speaker, I have no doubt Robyn will be a tireless worker for this parliament as well. We can only hope that the member for Parkes is able to go as good a job in the Speaker's chair as he did horsetrading in the past. He has been the Nationals' whip for the past three years in government. He was the Nationals' whip for three years prior to that, in opposition. For the better part of those past six years the member for Parkes and I have been seated together in this House. He has provided wise counsel. He was probably seated there to keep an eye on me! However, given that he knows my propensity to interject, I am sure I am going hear a bit from him in the future when he is sitting in your seat, Mr Speaker. Speaking of your seat, Mr Speaker, taking up his new seating arrangement is probably going to be one of the highlights of parliament for the member for Parkes, because we were complaining only this morning about how we have not really moved much in the seating arrangement since we have been here-two to the left every time. Now he gets to go to the front of the parliament and sit in the box seat, and that is certainly a move that was worth waiting for. One thing that everyone will say about the member for Parkes is that he puts on a pretty good Christmas party. While it might be the Nationals' Christmas party, members from the Liberal Party, the Labor Party and Independents alike have all joined in the entertainment  which the member for Parkes has arranged. I am not sure we will see any karaoke machines in the Deputy Speaker's office, though. In all seriousness, the calm nature, grace and measured approach the member for Parkes has brought to parliament since his election in 2007 are welcome attributes in the Deputy Speaker. He is widely regarded as a voice of reason in the House. One of his favourite lines is: 'You get more done here with honey than with vinegar.' He is also a man of vision. He has long promoted the need for inland rail to open up for the future of this country-a passion of his before coming to this place. That dream that he has pursued is becoming a reality, with funding now available for preconstruction planning and for the purchasing of a corridor, and, hopefully, during his time as Deputy Speaker he will see that work commence. The member for Parkes is not in this place to be a politician. He is here to represent his local region and to bring to parliament his strong belief in agriculture and the land in inland Australia. I have no doubt that the member for Parkes will carry out the role of Deputy Speaker with great professionalism. I wish him all the very best in discharging those duties.",40
4,Mr HOGAN,PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS," It is an honour to second the nomination of the member for Parkes, Mark Coulton, as Deputy Speaker of this House. We know that we all bring two things to any position we have: our experience and our character. The member for Parkes scores mightily well on both of these traits. With regard to character, he is widely respected on both sides of this House. He is a person of great integrity and someone I respect very much. In relation to experience, he has been a member of this House for nine years. He has served in many capacities: as shadow minister, the National Party whip for six years-as the member for Dawson has just said-and he has been the chair, or the member, of many standing committees. He has been the chair of the Standing Committee on Publications and a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Appropriations and Administration. He has also been on the Standing Committee on Indigenous Affairs, the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings, Standing Committee on Health and Ageing and many more. Being the member for an electorate that spans nearly 400,000 square kilometres brings some unique skills. The role of Deputy Speaker, like the Speaker, very much sets the tone of this chamber. Given his sense of a fair go, his stability and his compassion for others, I know the member for Parkes would make a fine Deputy Speaker-one that would uphold and promote the importance of our democratic traditions and processes for the governance and future of this great nation. I commend the member for Parkes' nomination to the House.",41
5,Ms RYAN,PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS," I move: That Mr R. G. Mitchell be elected Deputy Speaker of this House. Mr Speaker, I join the Leader of the Opposition, the deputy leader and the Leader of the House in congratulating you on your re-election to the chair of the House of Representatives. As referenced by the member for Watson when he spoke this morning, in a spirit of bipartisanship the opposition quite deliberately supported your election as Speaker. Your unanimous election came about because we valued the role you played as an independent Speaker in the 44th Parliament and wish to see it continue. It is in hope of that same spirit of  bipartisanship and for those same reasons that I commend the member for MCEwen as Deputy Speaker. Like you, Mr Speaker, the member for MCEwen is someone who has shown the ability and the experience to be even-handed, reasonable and capable of considering the other's point of view and argument. He is in fact the most experienced person in this House at presiding over the House's daily proceedings. This experience began during the 43rd Parliament, when the member for MCEwen served on the Speaker's panel. He also served as deputy chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Regional Australia and as the deputy chair of the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network. He is nominated because he genuinely believes in the institution of parliament, which we all serve, and because his passion for better parliamentary standards holds him in good stead for the position of Deputy Speaker, as does his sense of humour. The member for MCEwen has been a valuable mentor to new members in this place, helping them to learn and understand proceedings and standing orders and giving generously of his time, encouragement and support to new members joining the Speaker's panel in the 44th Parliament. I commend the member for MCEwen into the House as someone in the mould of former Speaker Jenkins, who I think was adept at presiding over the House through goodwill and by earning the consent of members rather than through the use of the rule book. In this respect, I think that the member for MCEwen has been demonstrated in his time presiding in this place to have the right qualities. He is liked by both sides of the House, is respectful of varying points of view and, as he has demonstrated in this place, is diligent in applying the standing orders objectively when the pressure is on. I hope the House will put aside partisan politics and consider the member for MCEwen for this position today. I commend him for this role, not as a criticism or because of any perceived shortcomings of the member for Parkes, whom I congratulate on being nominated. Like many here, I admire the member for Parkes, having been a teller with him for the 44th Parliament, and wish him well. I commend the member for MCEwen because, like our current Speaker and unlike, perhaps, others in the past, he would come to this role not as compensation for dashed opportunities but as a willing servant of the parliament, committed to fairness and objective rulings in this, the people's House. With the House's indulgence, in just one more reference to the Bard, today, I would proffer that the member for MCEwen is our everyman, our Falstaff, in the people's House. It is in celebration of that and in recognition of those qualities that I urge the House to support this nomination",41
6,Ms CHESTERS,PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS," I second the nomination of the member for MCEwen as Deputy Speaker. The opposition today has shown a tremendous display of bipartisanship in accepting the government's choice for Speaker unopposed. Will the government now reciprocate that approach and support the opposition's nominee for Deputy Speaker? Given that the member for MCEwen is the most experienced person for this position, it should. The member for MCEwen has served in both the state and federal parliaments. In this place he has served on the Speaker's panel, been a government whip and served on several committees. In the 44th Parliament the member for MCEwen served as the Second Deputy Speaker in the House of Representatives. The member for MCEwen has always been a passionate advocate for improving parliamentary standards and the working of this place. He  is well regarded by members on all sides for his level of professionalism and integrity and the impartial way in which he chairs. His commitment to the role cannot be questioned. The member for MCEwen is aware of and understands the Australian people's view that parliamentary standards need to be improved. In working in this position as the Deputy Speaker alongside the member for Casey, the member for MCEwen would maintain the dignity and respect of the chair that the 45th Parliament needs. His becoming Deputy Speaker would be in keeping with the view of the member for Sturt, who championed the view that the Deputy Speaker should be a member of the opposition. In this context, obviously, the Deputy Speaker should be the member for MCEwen. We support that position put forward by the member for Sturt in the spirit of bipartisanship championed by the Prime Minister. The member for MCEwen and I are neighbours. I know how well respected and regarded he is across his electorate. The member for MCEwen has vast experience in the chair and in representing his community. I wholeheartedly second the nomination.",42
7,The SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS,The time for motions has expired. The question is that the question be now put. Question agreed to.,43
8,The SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS,"In accordance with standing order 11, the bells will be rung and a ballot taken. The bells having been rung and a ballot having been taken",43
9,The SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS,"Order! The result of the ballot is: Mr Coulton, 77 votes; Mr Mitchell, 71 votes. Mr Coulton is elected Deputy Speaker and Mr Mitchell shall be the Second Deputy Speaker.",43
10,Mr TURNBULL,PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS," On behalf of the government, I congratulate Mr Coulton on being elected Deputy Speaker. He stands in the boots of Bruce Scott, his predecessor, another National Party member and great farmer. As Deputy Speaker he will bring all of that wisdom and experience of the land to support you in your role, Mr Speaker, so we are delighted by his success in this ballot. Our congratulations, too, to the Second Deputy Speaker, Rob Mitchell, the member for MCEwen. I would say to the honourable member that his numbers might have been a bit better had the member for Bendigo not described him as the Labor Party's Falstaff. Of course, FalstaffOpposition members: Lalor!",43
11,Mr TURNBULL,PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS,"I do beg your pardon-Lalor. Falstaff had almost none of the qualities required of a Speaker, so that may have undermined his candidacy. Nonetheless, we congratulate the member for MCEwen on his election and look forward to him too supporting the Speaker in this House.",43
12,Mr SHORTEN,PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS, I congratulate the member for Parkes. I congratulate the member for MCEwen.,43
13,Mr JOYCE,PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS,"New England-Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (17:37): After that loquacious endorsement by the Leader of the Opposition, I would like to also add to the comments that the member for Parkes has had an exceptional career. He is seen as the person who has the capacity to reach out to both sides of  the House. He is absolutely recommended and commended by his colleagues. I am sure he will do an exceptional job, and I put his success down to the marvellous speech given by the member for Dawson.",43
14,Ms PLIBERSEK,PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS," I would like to start by congratulating the member for Parkes on the win that he has just had. There is a vacancy in my book of favourite Nationals, so I am hoping he will take over from his predecessor, Bruce Scott, who took over from Paul Neville. Of course, that will rely on you being a very good and unbiased Deputy Speaker. I have high hopes on that score. I also want to congratulate the member for MCEwen. Youse was robbed, Rob! We know you would have made a great Deputy Speaker, because you are a person with a very professional background who is deeply committed to his community and deeply committed to representing the people of MCEwen in this place-a man who takes our democracy very seriously but does not mind having a laugh with his friends too.  the Leader of the House, I join my colleagues in congratulating the member for Parkes and the member for MCEwen on their selection as the Deputy Speaker and the Second Deputy Speaker. Obviously they are both very important roles, especially in a parliament where the numbers are much closer than in the previous parliament. I am pleased to see that the Labor Party has agreed to join the Speaker's panel as well, in order to have some of their members find out what it is like to be in the chair and be able to take part in those proceedings. It is a very important role, and I do look forward to the member for Parkes being in that role. He deserves to be the Deputy Speaker, and to follow in the footsteps of the member for Maranoa, with his experience of the House. The member for MCEwen acquitted himself well in the Second Deputy Speaker role in the last parliament, and I am sure he will continue to do so into the future.",44
15,Mr BURKE,PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS," Congratulations to both the member for Parkes and the member for MCEwen. Both of them are well regarded and well liked on all sides. This will be a parliament that tests people's patience on many occasions. I do not know why people nominate for that particular role. We very much wish them both well; they enjoy goodwill across the House. NA Cameron, Mr Eoin Harrap The SPEAKER (17:40): I inform the House of the death on 23 June of Eoin Harrap Cameron, a member of this House for the division of Stirling from 1993 until 1998. As a mark of respect to the memory of Eoin Cameron, I invite all members to rise in their places. Honourable members having stood in their places",44
16,The SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,"I thank the House. Reference to Federation Chamber  leave-I move: That statements on indulgence in relation to the death of Mr Eoin Harrap Cameron be permitted in the Federation Chamber.  In doing so, I might add that Eoin Cameron was a very good and dear personal friend of mine. I served in the parliament with him from 1993 to 1998. His death at such an early age is to be marked, and it is very saddening for us all. I look forward to speaking in the Federation Chamber on his passing. Question agreed to. NA Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games",44
17,Mr TURNBULL,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," All of us over recent weeks have watched with pride as each of our Olympians donned the green and gold to compete for our country. The commitment, determination and courage of our athletes symbolised and embodied the Olympic spirit and propelled Australia to another top 10 finish in the medals tally. Of course, being selected for the Olympics is about more than being a gifted athlete; it is about hard work, discipline and sacrifice. Most of us, most Australians, will never know what it is like to compete in sport at an elite level. We can only imagine how those few minutes on the track, in the boat or on the bike represent the culmination of years of sacrifice, hours of training, overcoming self-doubt, pushing bodies to the limit and missing out on time with family and friends-all for the love of sport. Gold medal glory, let alone any financial reward, is all too rare. Each of our Olympians has won the respect of a proud nation. For a country of 24 million we have again punched well above our weight-an outstanding achievement and a credit to each of our athletes. The team brought home eight gold medals, 11 silver and 10 bronze. Let me reflect on a few of the many great moments. Anna Meares, a real Olympic legend, became our most successful track cyclist with four Olympics and six Olympic medals under her belt. What an achievement. Our women's rugby sevens team made history to secure the first rugby sevens gold at an Olympics, and of course they beat New Zealand in the final. Our champion swim team includes individual gold medal winners Kyle Chalmers and Mack Horton, and our triumphant 4 x 100 metre women's relay team. Then there is Tom Burton, the young sailor. His faultless tactics won him gold in the Laser. That will be emulated I am sure by many junior sailors for many years to come at every sailing race on every weekend. Kim Brennanwhat a wonderful role model for women's rowing and for women's sport-now has a gold medal to add to her collection. Chloe Esposito made history with Australia's first medal-and a gold-in the Olympic modern pentathlon. Jared Tallent-what a great Australian athlete. His great performance in the 50-kilometre walk won him silver. No other Australian male has won four Olympic medals in track and field. And, of course, there were so many more. But Australia's performance is not just measured by the final medal tally. Some of the most memorable moments, as we witnessed, were events where our athletes achieved their personal best and showed incredible grace and sportsmanship under the glare of the spotlight, often in the face of disappointment. These moments are an indelible part of our national life. To the athletes, the officials, the coaches, the families and friends that supported them with so much enthusiasm and love over so many years, to all of that wide family of the 2016 Australian Olympic Team, I know that I speak on behalf of all honourable members and indeed all Australians in saying congratulations on a job well done. ",45
18,Mr SHORTEN,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," It is a pleasure to join the Prime Minister in congratulating all 422 of our Australian Olympians on their efforts in Rio. Before we go any further, we send the goodwill and best wishes of this House and the Australian people to the 178 members of our Paralympic Team who are preparing for their games which will begin on 7 September. Every four years, Australians from all walks of life are consumed by the performance, by the athleticism, by the opportunity to watch the best in the world perform at the Olympic Games. We sacrifice sleep to follow the fortunes of people who have given up years of their lives in pursuit of excellence. At these Olympics, we had so much to be proud of and so much to cheer about. Mack Horton reclaimed the 400-metre freestyle title for Australia. We had the remarkable comeback of Kyle Chalmers, who was seventh at the turn and first to the wall in the 100-metre freestyle. In that same race we saw the extraordinary sportsmanship of Cam MCEvoy, who was overjoyed for his friend rather than disappointed for himself. Our sailors, as we have heard, raked in the medals yet again. And, as is so often the case, the women of the Australian team carried the torch for us at the Olympics, claiming five of our eight gold medals. We had the trailblazing success of our rugby sevens and Kim Brennan's stunning victory in the singles sculls. Catherine Skinner is the new hero of Mansfield in Australia, winning gold in the trap shooting. Our women's 4 x 100 metre relay team defended their London title. Chloe Esposito became the first Australian to win a gold medal in the modern pentathlon. Rather than basking in her well-deserved glory, she rushed back to the stands to watch her brother compete. In winter, we honour the achievements of our football codes. But, when it comes to the Olympics, our women athletes always deliver. The tradition we saw in Rio was the same tradition of the 1956 Melbourne golden girls-Marlene Mathews, Marjorie Jackson and Dawn Fraser-and Susie O'Neil and so many other Australian women champions. In Rio our women were led by the remarkable Anna Mears. Perhaps this might prompt us to redouble our efforts in supporting women's sport and the coverage of women's sport in this country. In Rio the Boomers, the Opals, the Stingers, the Sharks, the Kookaburras, the Matildas and the Hockeyroos gave their all against the best in the world. When I think about Australia's performance, I am a little disappointed by the lack of generous comment in some parts of our media about the accomplishments of our young athletes. When you look at any medal tally in the world, we do very well. And there is not an Australian who does not feel more proud of Australia at the end of an Olympics than at the start. Sure, we would always like to have more medals. But, when you think about how Australian athletes performed at the Olympics, they have everything to hold their heads up about. The Prime Minister and I had the opportunity to meet the Olympic athletes on their return from Rio. There, we also saw other people who deserve to be mentioned-the parents who drove their kids to practice before first light; the coaches inspiring, motivating, driving, timing and demanding every inch of effort and absolute self-discipline with early starts and late finishes; and the physios, the medicos and the support staff at Rio who kept these highperforming people healthy and well. And now so many of our heroes we honour today have spent the past week visiting their former schools and their junior sporting clubs, showing a new generation that the track marked on their school oval, the little lasers at their local beach and the humble community  pool were the training grounds of athletes and dreams. If the efforts of our athletes inspire more Aussie kids to try something new, to step away from the screen, to go for a ride or a run, to join a team and to be active and healthy, then it is a very good thing that they do. And for all those young Australians who watched these games, who witnessed the toughest of athletes shed tears of both joy and pain, who could see athletes from small and developing nations struck by the vivid delight of wearing their country's name in the highest global stage, it is not too much to hope that the Olympic ideal will live in their memory too-not just the pursuit of individual excellence to be the strongest, to jump the highest and to run the fastest, but to draw satisfaction from beating your personal best and from the thrill of simply taking part. In the 'modern spectators pentathlon', complaining about the broadcast coverage comes right after pretending you knew about judo! My particular favourite is 'the diver's splash was too big'! And, of course, there is the perennial event 'I reckon I could do that if I trained'-it is a great event and many of us enter it! I think we can agree that Channel Seven did an outstanding job of bringing the Rio games into our lounge rooms and onto our phones. The deeds of the Australian Olympic team deserve the widest possible audience and Seven did a great job in making it happen. In the weeks to come, some our team will already be turning their minds to the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games in 2018. I am sure all Australians, including our top sports administrators, will be backing our team for the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games and for the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2020. Others from Rio will be moving on to a new phase of their lives. But wherever our Olympians go, whatever the do, no-one can take away from them the fact that they were Australian Olympians and the rest of us are very proud of them. NA Days and Hours of Meeting  present a chart showing the proposed program of sittings for the remainder of 2016. Copies of the program have been placed on the table, and I ask leave of the House to move that the program be agreed to. Leave granted.  That the program of sittings for Spring 2016 be agreed to.",46
19,Mr BURKE,BUSINESS," The program that has been put in front of us means that from budget week till the end of the year this government has 6½ weeks worth of agenda to fill-from the May budget through to the end of the whole year. Contrast this with what the Leader of the House said when he was on this side of the chamber. I quote the Leader of the House: The people of Australia expect us to serve our electorates and legislate, not to spend 18 weeks here when we should be spending 20 or 21 or 22 weeks. Know that for this entire year he is only going to make it to 13½ weeks. He said on the same occasion: The government manage the schedule of business, and we are preparedand I agree with these words to let them keep on being incompetent. We will turn up. We will keep showing them up for the failures that they are. We will scrutinise them and hold them accountable right through to the next election. So, while the opposition will not oppose this motion, we certainly place on record our dismay and disdain for the management of this House by the current Leader of the House. He later said: Why doesn't it have to sit? There are two reasons. Firstly, it does not have a plan for the future for the Australian people. Secondly, it cannot rely on its numbers in the House to pass legislation to win a procedural vote. Can I say that for this government there is a third reason: every time the parliament sits, its party room has to meet, and the last thing this Prime Minister wants is for all the members of the Liberal Party to ever be in the same room. Have you ever seen a mob, the first time they get back after an election, looking as miserable as they have looked today? This is when you are in government. This is meant to be your happy day-your happy moment. They have arrived with all the enthusiasm of the speech we heard next door where the subtitles were the highlight. For those opposite, if this is an indication of the agenda to come, if this is your achievement after an election when you come here with the enthusiasm for the Australian people, you can be assured there is an enthusiasm and a hunger to make a difference for this country from this side of the chamber, and we will be here for every moment of it. Question agreed to. Leave of Absence",47
