3,Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,DEATH OF SENATOR JOHN WILLIAM,"Wannon-Prime Minister) - I move: That the House expresses its deep regret at the death this day of Senator John William Knight. a senator for the Australian Capital Territory from 1975 and Government Whip in the Senate from 1980, places on record its appreciation long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and the members of his family in their bereavement. John Knight was born in 1943 at Armidale in New South Wales. He was an honours graduate from ,the University of New England. He was awarded a Fulbright scholarship in 1968 and took a master's degree at the East West Center in H-waii. In 1975 he was a visiting fellow at the Australian National University. He joined the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1965 and served in India, Fiji and Saudi Arabia. Mr Speaker, he was your senior private secretary from 1973 to 1974. He was elected to this Parliament in 1975 as Liberal senator for the Australian Capital Territory and was subsequently re-elected in 1977 and 1980. John Knight was a member of this Parliament for only a short time but he had already made his mark. He was active on a wide variety of committees. He represented the Parliament and the Government on a number of overseas delegations. He had been Deputy Government Whip in the Senate from 1978 and was elected Government Whip less than four months ago. John Knight lived an active and vigorous life. He was a dedicated representative of the Capital Territory. He was concerned with the design of Canberra and with all aspects of its welfare. He was patron of the Australian Capital Territory Rugby Union, ELECTORAL of the Australian Capital Territory Amateur Swimming Association and of the Australian Capital Territory Lifesaving Association. He had a particular concern for, and involvement with, the International Year of Disabled Persons. He had just finished the final manuscript of a book on the role of the back bench in foreign policy. This simple, factual account of John Knight's career, whilst showing his significant work, inadequately depicts his contribution to life in the Australian, Capital Territory and to the Parliament itself and the rich promise of his life for the future. There is no doubt that John Knight would have had a significant career in the Senate, over a long period, had he been allowed a normal term of life. He not,only represented the people of the Australian Capital Territory well but also had a broad interest in all our national and international affairs. He was a contributor, a thinker. He was concerned. I am sure that his colleagues on both sides of the Parliament, in both Houses, will miss KNIGHT him for this. We will all miss him for the kind of person that he was. I believe that we all admired and valued his personal qualities. But whatever the loss to the Senate, to the Parliament and to the Australian Capital Territory of his might be, at this time we are all thinking much more of his wife Karla and of his children. We are all deeply conscious of their tragedy in losing a husband and a father so young and with so much promise for the future. The, real tragedy and the deep'est loss is theirs. It is one that we in this Parliament have little power to redress. All that we can do is hope that our recognition of the quality and promise of John Knight's life will provide some comfort at this tragic time. The tragedy of John Knight's death has b-en compounded by the death of his father only last Sunday. To Karla, who gave John tremendous love and support, and to his children and family, we extend our deepest sympathy and only wish that there was more that we could do to help at this time.",14
4,Mr HAYDEN ,DEATH OF SENATOR JOHN WILLIAM,"Oxley-Leader of the Opposition)-Senator Knight's sudden collapse and death comes as a great shock to us all. He was a young man who was only at the start of what promised to be a considerable future in this Parliament. The death of his father over the weekend adds to the tragedy for his wife Karla, his two children and his mother, to whom I extend the deepest sympathies of the Federal Opposition. Although a young man, John Knight had already achieved much in this Parliament. He was an active and thoughtful member of the Senate Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, to whose deliberations he brought the benefit of his professional experience - as a diplomat in India, Fiji and Saudi Arabia. He showed a level of understanding of the real complexities of the international scene that added considerably to a Government foreign policy that is quite apparently in search of refinement and sophistication. He was most involved, of course, in policy ters relating to the Australian Capital Territory. The people of the Territory can be proud that he was one of the first two senators to represent them in this Parliament. He worked unceasingly on their behalf. He showed considerable courage in resisting, as best he could, th- steady hostility of many with whom he was required to associate towards the Public Service and Canberra ally. It was clearly frustrating for him, as Chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Australian Capital Territory since 1976, to witof ness the setbacks Canberra suffered, but he did what he could to soften the blows. The people of Canberra understood his predicament and he was a widely respected and very popular representaand tive of the people. We on this side of the House also found him a good parliamentary colleagueearlier thoughtful, moderate and hard working and a man of unquestioned integrity. Despite our obvifamily. ous disagreements, John Knight had many friends in our party who deeply regret his untimely",14
5,Mr ANTHONY ,DEATH OF SENATOR JOHN WILLIAM,"Richmond-Miriister for siderable Trade and Resources)- Mr Speaker, I would like to associate the members of the National Country Party with the condolence motion moved by the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) for the late Senator John Knight. I speak in deeply-felt supin port for the motion. John Knight was a man I him. liked and deeply admired. He will be missed. His death is a personal blow to me and my wife, to his parliamentary colleagues and to the many people of Canberra who knew and respected him. More representation than that, I believe it is a blow for the rtational capital. As a senator for the Australian Territory from 1975 he became deeply involved with the concerns of its people. His drive and dehas termination, coupled with a real and obvious viction and concern, enabled him to give the people of the Australian Capital Territory a representation in this Parliament. That achieveclear, ment has been recognised, I believe, by the bipartinguished tisan tributes that have been made to him. His death at the age of 37 years is a tragically early end to a career of major achievement and even more significant promise. John Knight joined the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1965 and served Australia in a number of overseas postings. Many honourable members came to know him well, sir, when he was your senior private secretary during the period for which the present Government parties were in Opposition. His work in the Senate following his election in 1975 was recognised with his appointment as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs. and Defence and. as Chairman of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory. In 1978 he matwas appointed Deputy Government Whip in the Senate, and last year he became Whip. He approached all of these positions with the same energy and drive as he gave to his representation of the people of the Australian Capital Territory. He gave distinguished service to the Australian Capital Territory, to the Government, to the Senate generand to this Parliament. This is the second time in a fortnight that we have mourned the sudden and early death of one our parliamentary colleagueS. It is a bitter reminder of the pressures to which many parliamentarians are subject and the toll this takes on their lives. I am deeply saddened for his wife, Karla, their two young boys. Their suffering is all the greater because of the death only a few days of John's father. I extend my sympathy and that of my party to all the members of his",15
6,Sir PHILLIP LYNCH ,DEATH OF SENATOR JOHN WILLIAM,"Flinders-Minister death. for Industry and Commerce)-It is with consadness that I rise to support the condolence motion moved by the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) on the passing of our friend John Knight. It was Ecclesiastes who said that the greatest gift any man can give to the community which he lives and works is the best that is in It will be said of John Knightthat at all times he did indeed give of his best-in his family life, in the diverse round of activities in which he was involved in the Australian Capital Territory, in his of that Territory and, of course, in his very significant and strong commitment to libCapital . eralism and to Australia. John died at an early age and his tragic passing all the more impact on us here because of that. conMy sympathies are extended to his wife, Karla, and his family. As the Prime Minister and the rare Deputy Prime Minister ( Mr Anthony) have made prior to entering Parliament John had a discareer in the diplomatic corps. He served in India, Fiji and Saudi Arabia. Of course, he had established himself as a - very distinguished senatorial representative of the Australian Capital Territory and at the time of his tragic death was Government Whip in the Senate. John had many friends on both sides of this House and the Senate, and today those friends certainly will mourn his tragic passing.",15
7,Mr FRY ,DEATH OF SENATOR JOHN WILLIAM,"Fraser)-I am terribly saddened by the tragedy of the passing of Senator John Knight. It is a tragedy for the Parliament and, of course, for his wife Karla and his two young children. As we shared the same constituency, my wife and I shared many happy occasions with John Knight and his wife. We came to know them very well indeed and to have a very high personal regard for him and his family. We had a fairly non-partisan approach in sharing the same constituency. Although at election times we may have expressed different philosophies, in our day to day work our approach was very non-partisan. It was easy to be non-partisan because John Knight was that sort of person. I think it is significant that during election campaigns many people who supported my election to this House also supported John Knight in the Senate election and, of course, vice versa. I regarded him as one of the most competent young members of the Parliament. He had a brilliant career ahead of him, which has now been cut short so tragically._He was extremely popular in the electorate. One of the things I admired about him was that he had a very good sense of history not only in relation to the Australian Capital Territory but also in regard to the world generally. He had a very well informed view of the world which made his opinion very valuable in foreign affairs,and foreign policy matters; Despite that, he still had a very close touch with his torate and he had a very warm regard for all disadvantaged people in his electorate. He was able to identify with them and, of course, torate ,responded at election time to demonstrate that. One of the areas in which John Knight will be most greatly missed is in the work done by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Australian Capital Territory. In the short time that he served on that Committee it covered a great deal of work and did it extremely well under his leadership. I refer to the very valuable reports brought down concerning waste disposal in Canberra, the environmental study of Ginninderra Creek, a very productive and lengthy report on planning in the Australian Capital Territory, which has been acted upon to some extent by the Government, and more recently a report on tourism. A reference on energy in the Australian Capital Territory is almost complete and we are just about to start one on the Murrumbidgee River. The Committee got through a tremendous amount of work under 405 John's leadership and it will be very difficult to re_ place his contribution to that Committee. I know that that contribution was valued not only by the Parliament, because he had a great regard for Canberra as the national capital, but also by)be people of Canberra. My wife and I feel a great personal loss in the passing of Senator John Knight, and I join with everybody else in expressing our very deepest sympathy indeed to his wife and his family.",16
8,Mr HODGMAN ,DEATH OF SENATOR JOHN WILLIAM,"Denison-Minister for the Capital Territory)-Today is a sad day for Australia but it is a black day for Canberra, the national capital. John Knight was my friend and colleague. We were elected to this Parliament on the very same day. He achieved the historic distinction of being one of the first two elected senators to represent the Australian Capital Territory. He very quickly demonstrated his outstanding abilities and unbounded energy, and he greatly enriched the national Parliament with his presence. He was a dedicated worker, to4tlly committed to Australia and its national capital, which he loved so much and served so well. He was a dynamic and progressive thinker. Above all, he was a man who demonstrated by his very actions that he cared for people; that he was concerned with their problems; and that he had determined that he would be tireless in his parliamentary representations on their behalf. Over the ensuing five years, I got to know him well and our friendship developed. It is principally the last four months about which I wish to speak today. I refer to the special relationship elecwhich developed between John Knight and myself. Literally within minutes of the announcement of my appointment as Minister for the Capi-the electal Territory, he offeredme his warm congratulations and his wholehearted support for me in the performance of my ministerial duties. Since that day, it would be fair to say that, in every sense, he has been my right hand man, my principal adviser and counsel. For that reason above all on this sad day I feel his loss most personally. Scarcely a day has passed since 2 November last year when his presence and involvement in the Australian Capital Territory, its people and its aspirations have not been brought home to me very forcibly. He was in every sense and in every way a great champion of the national capital. Our many discussions over the past four months on hundreds of representations confirmed his sincerity and his commitment to those who had elected him to represent them in this Parliament. I know I express the views of my predecessor, the Honourable Mr Justice Ellicott; when I say that John Knight was a man truly fitted to represent the national capital in the nation's Parliament. In a host of outstanding achievements, there is perhaps nO greater measure of John Knight's service to the nation than his distinguished chairmanship of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Australian Capital Territory. He was appointed Chairman on 6 April 1976, just a few months after his election to Parliament. That Committee; under his guidance, gained recognition and status and deliberated upon many matters of major importance in the future development of this great city, the national capital, lasting memorial to John Knight's outstanding service in this area that so many of the recommendations of that Committee have already been implemented, while others are still in the pipeline. Senator John Knight achieved greatness at the comparatively young age of 37. His tragic and untimely death is a blow to Australia and a loss of enormous· proportions to the national capital, Today Canberra is a city in mourning, a community bonded in sorrow mingled with pride that its citizens were privileged to know him,to admire him and to love him. To Karla, to Jason who shares my birthday, and to Joshua goour deepest sympathy and compassion. I believe the immortal words of William Shakespeare are appropriate.on this occasion. I conclude my tribute to our friend and colleague by daring to assert: . . . and the elements So mix- in him that Nature might stand up, And say to all the world, 'This was a man!'",16
9,Mrs KELLY ,DEATH OF SENATOR JOHN WILLIAM,"Canberra)-Today the people of the Australian Capital Territory are experiencing a great tragedy and loss. We have lost our first senator,our loyal and effective spokesman and representative and our friend. John was a very special politician. He had great empathy with his electorate. The people of Canberra loved him. During the six years in which he represented this Territory, I never heard a critical word spoken about John personally. Sure, one criticised his politics, but never John the man. He was always referred to as a good bloke with common sense, a caring person, a mate. We are a small community in Canberra. Our senators have the same demand on them electorally as the members of the House of Representatives. Our electors expect a great deal from their representatives. John gained their respect. He dedicated much of his life to his constituents. John was a man who will be remembered as a humane, caring person, a man of integrity and a man of great potential. He had a promising future in this Parliament. It is our loss that so much potential will never be realised. John was a family man. Karla and his sons were the foundation of his life. They attended many community activities as a family. Our sympathies and prayers are with Karla, Jason and Joshua and with John's mother, who has suffered an additional tragedy with the death of John's father. John's memory will be preserved in Canberra by all those who have known him. EmptyHere dustrial Relations)-I wish to add a few words to the motion moved by the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser). I think the feelings expressed It is a by honourable members on both sides of the House encapsulate the feeling that most of us experienced when we learned of John Knight's heart attack and subsequent death. Perhaps it affected you,. Mr Speaker, more than it affected anyone else in this House. Those of us who worked so closely with John Knightover a length of time came to admire him perhaps more than we admire many others not just in the Parliament but in the nation. He was an outstanding figure. That is a strong statement, but I make it quite deliberately. I was fortunate to work with John Knight in the days when we were in Opposition and he was on your staff, Mr Speaker. His invaluable advice to me on matters of foreign policy contributed so markedly to the formulation of the then Opposition's aproach to foreign policy, an approach which was later transmitted into government. He was, as the Prime Minister said, a contributor and a thinker. He contributed constantly. He had so much to give. His death is unquestionably a tragedy. He was a compassionate man, he was an active man, he was an humane man and he was a friend· of all of us in this Parliament who knew him. For John the seemingly endless adventure is in fact over. It has ended so abruptly and so harshly that we can only give our deepest sympathy to Karla and her family.",17
10,Mr COHEN ,DEATH OF SENATOR JOHN WILLIAM,"Robertson)-John Knight was a friend of mine. We met almost every Wednesday on the squash court. We played last week and we were to play today. Although I did not know a great deal about what he was doing politically because we were members of different Houses, I did get to know John very well over the past two or three years. We had a very good relationship. We were keen and competitive. He playedsport in the very best traditions. We always had a good match, a hard match, but he was always a great sportsman. When I received a telephone call from the Serjeant-at-Arms on Saturday night telling me of John's heart attack, I found it almost impossible to believe that a man who was apparently fit and healthy and who was as involved in sport as John had been could be struck down like this. The only time that John was not able to play sport was when his parliamentary duties kept him busy. I think it was a measure of the man that he put his duties first and his sport and relaxation second. He was a fine man, a great contributor to this Parliament and anyone who had had anything to do with him would say he was a first-class human being. Only a few months ago we discussed how fortunate it was that in the 12 years I had been in this place it was rare for a sitting member to pass away. However, in a matter of weeks, we have lost two people, both of them young people. John Knight was particularly young. The real tragedy is that someone who was 37 years of age should be taken from us. His death will awaken many of us to the tensions that we are all under. I cannot any other reason for his death. John, like Eric Robinson, was a man of moderate habits. I hope there will be some easing of the pressure ticians. If there is not, I fear that there will more of these tragedies. I would like to say how sorry I am at John's passing and to convey my sympathy to his wife Karla and her family.",17
11,Mr SAINSBURY ,DEATH OF SENATOR JOHN WILLIAM,"Eden-Monaro)-It was a great shock to me to hear on Saturday evening of John Knight's collapse in my electorate and an even greater shock to hear this morning of his sequent death. John was particularly close to me both geographically and in spirit. He was one of those young men whom so many of us looked up to, a man whom Australians would like to emulate. John was a man of action. He was a man who could think but, above all, he was a man who was prepared to put more into his community than he wanted to take out. I have had a very close politidous cal association with him in the past three years so through a number of activities relating to my adjoining electorate. I well remember the support he was able to give me in looking at the neighbourthe ing city of Queanbeyan, not just as a city which provides factory fodder for Canberra but as a city which is now being recognised as part of the area. With John's help, the help of Bob Ellicott and, more recently, the help of Michael Hodgman, I was able to begin to achieve something in that direction. John was very popular in my electorate and often visited the region. On a number of occasions he was kind enough to fill in for me when I was not able to attend functions, as often happens very large electorate. He was a man of great balance. He and his wife Karla performed a very good function in pulling politicians and their wives closer together when they came to Canberra. In that context Karla has also been a tremendously important person to us. I would like to add my thoughts and prayers to those I have heard expressed to Karla, Jason and Joshua and also, of course, Mrs Knight senior on this very sad occasion.",18
12,Mr MACPHEE ,DEATH OF SENATOR JOHN WILLIAM,"Balaclava-Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs)-I have not spoken previously on a condolence motion. I wish to do so briefly today. John and I were students together at the East West Centre in 1968 and we were both in the same discipline. We became very firm friends. I remember quite clearly the sense of sadness which we felt when John drove me to the airport when it was my turn to come home. He was then respected and greatly liked, possessing all of the qualities to which other speakers have attested. I first met Karla then. My wife Julie and I extend to see Karla and the boys our very deep commiserations.",18
13,Mr CONNOLLY ,DEATH OF SENATOR JOHN WILLIAM,"Bradfield)-I wish to be associated with this motion of condolence. I probon poli- ably knew John Knight longer than most be members in this chamber. In 1965 we both joined the Department of Foreign Affairs as cadet diplomats. We had similar careers in terms of postings in which we served. Throughout all those years he was without doubt one of the most outstanding of the group of people recruited during that period. I have no doubt that had he remained in the service subhe would have been one of the youngest heads of mission that Australia has produced to date. Nevertheless, Mr Speaker, he chose another route as you are aware. He served on your staff. He helped tremendously in our days in Opposition when we developed together foreign policy matters in particular. In fact, he was one of those very rare people able· to generate not only a tremenintellectual capacity but in addition he was a or great doer. In every sphere of activity, whether it was sport, his ordinary political activities in the Australian Capital Territory, or his work within Parliament, he demonstrated a total commitment to life and a total commitment to the objectives before him. He respected the views of others but equally he expected them to respect his views. He achieved in the chamber in which he served so well an undoubted standing which very few people have been able to achieve. Undoubtedly, Canberra has lost a great representative. The Senate has lost a strong advocate and many of us have lost a very dear friend.",18
14,Mr MACKENZIE ,DEATH OF SENATOR JOHN WILLIAM,"Calare)-I first knew John in a Knight when we attended the University of New England together. It is sad that on this occasion all but one of the speakers who have so far contributed to this condolence motion are older than John Knight. It is also sad to know that he is the youngest senator to die in office, if not the youngest member of Parliament. He did his job extremely well. Those people who endeavour to do their jobs well suffer a tremendoml amount of stress and that dedication eventually tells on them. I remember in particular that John used to take very seriously every issue that came before him as senator for the Australian Capital Territory. I admired him on one occasion when he rang me relatively late at night with a problem regarding one of my constituents which' most people would have regarded as being relatively minor. Yet he took it upon himself to contact me so that we could solve this problem as soon as possible. I also went to Japan and China with John in 1977. .It was on those visits during difficult circumstances that I realised his tremendous capacities for diplomacy, good common sense, humour and a high degree of tolerance of the idiosyncrasies of his fellow travellers. Whatever John did he did well. He did it with his full resources of energy and intellectual capabilities. He had very high standards of integrity and service and regrettably perhaps these standards of hard work and service may have contributed to his early and untimely death. My sympathy and I would also add, the sympathies of our i mutual colleagues from the University of New . England, go to Karla and her two boys. I trust that these thoughts and the words spoken in. this chamber from both sides may be of some comfort to her at the present time.",18
15,Mr DEAN ,DEATH OF SENATOR JOHN WILLIAM,"Herbert)-It is not easy in this place to form close friendships, such are the varied demands placed upon us. It is certainly true that it is mainly through committee work that we get some added opportunities of forming friendships, of getting to know people and of understanding some of the work that they do. I joined the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Australian Capital Territory in 1978 and so for three years I had the enjoyable opportunity of getting to know John both as a friend and as a colleague possessed of considerable skill and ability. All of us on that Committee will miss him very much indeed. His very many fine qualities have been put on record today. I thoroughly endorse what has been said and embrace the sentiments that have been expressed. I simply add that I liked John enormously. I am greatly saddened by his death. My very deepest and heartfelt sympathy goes out to Karla and to their children and also to the other members of his family.",19
16,Mr SPEAKER,DEATH OF SENATOR JOHN WILLIAM,"It all seems so unbelievable, especially to Karla, Jason and Joshua, that the death has occurred. John Knight was a man who had immense capacity. I do not want to speak about his service in the Senate. I speak of the Service he gave me and the contribution he made to policy development while we were in Opposition. I have written these Jew words in respect of John: Action, energy, competition, thinker, right, commitment, communi.cl\.te, service and loyalty. Without any doubt' John would have been a great leader in the Parliament of Australia had he been able to live. Karla, Jason and Joshua, be proud of him. Question resolved' in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places.",19
17,Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,DEATH OF SENATOR JOHN WILLIAM,"Wan non-Prime Minister)-As a mark of respect for the late John Knight, I suggest that the House might adjourn until 8 o'clock.",19
18,Mr SPEAKER,DEATH OF SENATOR JOHN WILLIAM,--:I am sure that the suggestion of the right honourable gentleman will be acceded to by the House.,19

The aforementioned collective has been working towards racial equality and providing support for women in all sectors of the community .

Plant and Animal Life: Private Patent To the honourable th\l Speaker and members of the House of Represelltatives in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned members of the Order of the White Cross International, a humanitarian knighthood for the Defence and Protection of Life and residents of the Commonwealth of Australia by this our humble petition respectfully showeth: That we the undersigned petitioners are deeply concerned with certain developments in Gene-Manipulation, the financial exploitation of new life-form varieties by private companies and the attempts of companies to gain patentrights over such life-forms through Parliaments and Courts and that our concern must be also the concern of the people of AUstralia, indeed the entire population of the World at'large including all forms of life since: (I.) The succession of consequences in commercial ventures must lead to a complete range of Hybrid crops under patent or copyrights, eventually forcing all now known plantforms out of existence with the help of Government Legislation. We believe that plants constitute the most important part in the maintenance of life and being the substance of the Worlds Eco-systems with it's own natural laws for survival of the species and the Balance of Nature, and Creation has equipped it's life-form with means of self defence for survival in the course of evolution, a fair chance to defend the Godgiven right to exist. With man's introduction of chemical substances, capable of eradicating plants, such a fair chance does not exist any more and the human society is already now experiencing the collapse of entire Eco-systems on land, in the air and in the sea. (2.) Any Plant Patent Legislation will give private ownership over new varieties power to control the degree of exploitation of the public, a door-opener for commercial enterprises to take total control over all plant and animal life, leaving mankind at the mercy of selfish bodies who have little respect for the freedom and harmOny of man and life, but thrive for optimal profit and power due to the nature of industrial enterprises. (3.) First accomplishments in Gene-manipulation and Plant Variety Registrations indicate already now that future control over life resources will be in the hands of mainly Chemical Corporations, reaping maximum profits from seedsales and also from increased sale of chemicals for the protection of these hybrids, which are generally vulnerable to insect and virus-attacks, thus creating further increase of the already dangerous level of chemical pollution. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that: (a) The Government will reject any move to allow private Patent-ownership of any life-form. (b) No Legislation will pass which permits the eradication of so-called ""inferior plants"" or undesirable plants of any kind, with the exception of weed-control by mechanical means in agriculture, since each species fulfils a certain function in the Web of Life, not necessarily exploitable by man, but still vital part in the Community of Life. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr MACKellar. to provide an adequate service Petition received. NA NA Mr Humphreys having addressed a question Ownership to the Minister for TransportMONICA",19
21,Mr SPEAKER,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"Order! As I understand it, the question is based upon a purported private meeting. It is not a matter for which the honourable gentleman is responsible to the Parliament. It is a party matter.",23
22,Mr HAYDEN ,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"1 raise a point of order. Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to chapter XI of the Standing Orders which, as you would recall, specifically deals with ql,lestions seeking in form,ation. Standing Order No. 142 states: Questions may be put to a Minister relating to public affairs with which he is officially in the House, or to any matter of administration for which he is responsible. I suggest that on at least two of those scores the Minister is responsible and should answer the question. Clearly, the question relates to public affairs with which the Minister is officially connected. The Minister ought to be given the opportunity to clear up the question which has been put to him. The Standing Order states that a question may be put to a Minister on any matter of administration for which he is responsible. The Minister is responsible for the administration of matters related to the Holcroft inquiry, or he was responsible for it-it is now completed. For him allegedly to report as was authoritatively stated in one of the more responsible newspapers this morning and in terms outlined in the question, draws the issue straight into the public arena for discussion as a matter of his administrative responsibility. On both scores the Minister has a responsibility to respond.",23
23,Mr SPEAKER,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"I adhere to my ruling that the question is out of order. I am very anxious that there not be in the Parliament the necessity for any member to answer for what happens in private consultation within his party. Secondly, the question could be in order only if the questioner were able to vouch for the accuracy of the statement. Quite clearly, on the basis on which the honourable member has put the question, he cannot vouch for its accuracy. The question is out of order. If he wishes to pursue the matter he will have to refi'ame his question. Mr Haydeo-I raise a further point of order. Mr Speaker, I put it to you that that is a somewhat free interpretation of the Standing Orders. The fact is that the questioner does not have to vouch for the accuracy of the statement. He has asked whether the statement is accurate. That is the first point. The second point I make is that the question goes to the heart of public affairs to which the Minister is officially connected and the administration of matters for which he is responsible. Mr Speaker, you know from questioning in the Parliament yesterday that the Holcroft committee of inquiry raises certain matters. The committee made searing complaints-in fact an indictment-against the Government. The Minister so far has sought to evade any proper answerability in the House on these issues. A censure motion has been moved against him. One would have thought that the proper course of conduct yesterday would have been to have dealt with the matter then. Certainly it should be dealt with now.",24
24,Mr SPEAKER,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"Order! The honourable connected, to proceedings pending member is now going beyond a point of order.",24
25,Mr HAYDEN ,DISALLOWED QUESTION,These points are relevant. I suggest that your ruling is completely wrong.,24
26,Mr SPEAKER,DISALLOWED QUESTION,I adhere to the ruling. I call the honourable member for Braddon. AUSTRALIA POST: TRANSPORT OF NA,24
27,Mr GROOM,FREIGHT,"Is the Minister for Communications aware that Australia Post is engaged in the business of transporting large items of freight, such as major machinery parts, electrical equipment, tyres, et cetera, in direct competition with long established private operators? Has he seen Australia Post advertising material offering this extended service? Is this a proper function of the Australian Postal Commission? If not, will the Minister give the Commission a direction 'under section 8 of the Postal Services Act requiring it to stop competing in areas traditionally and properly performed by private enterprise? Mr Inoes-What are you going to do about stopping them from breaking the law?",24
28,Mr SPEAKER,FREIGHT,The honourable member for Melbourne will remain silent.,24
29,Mr SINCLAIR,FREIGHT,"I can understand the ebullience of Opposition members after dinner. It is important that we understand that the concern of honourable members on this side of the House is very real. We worry about the opportunities of small businessmen, carriers and others who are operating in the field to which the honourable member's question is directed. I assure the honourable gentleman that I have been advised that about 99 per cent of the articles carried by Australia Post Courier service, which provides Australia's express postal service, are below 20 kilograms in weight. In other words it operates directly in a field which is part of what has traditionally been accepted as the responsibility of Australia Post. I understand, however, that between Burnie and Hobart in Tasmania there is a service which carries a slightly higher number of heavier articles. I will look into the matter. I assure the honourable gentleman that the idea of the Australia Post Courier service is to try to ensure that a facility is available to the Australian public to provide a faster mail service than would otherwise be possible. In other areas it is certainly not intended to deprive those in the private enterprise sector who would normally carry articles of the \ opportunity of doing so. I commend the honourable gentleman for his interest and concern. NA",24
30,Mr HAYDEN,INQUIRY INTO DOMESTIC AIR FARES,"Has the Minister for Transport specifically.noted a letter to him from the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares dated 1 December 1980 which stated: It is true that for administrative and budgetary convenience in the financing of the inquiry, a nominal finishing date of January 1981 was indicated . . . Until now no firmness has been attached to a completion date of 31 January 198 I by the Government . . . When we met you on 3 June to discuss the terms of the inquiry . I' . it was made abundantly clear by you to us that More recently you indicated in reply to questions in the House a completion date for the inquiry about mid-198 1. Can the Minister state whether, in repudjating the three eminent public figures who comprised the Holcroft inquiry by claiming that' they always knew and accepted that their report was to be completed by 1 January this year, he is accusing them of untruthfulness, incompetence or both or whether he has embarked on an elaborate coverup of a clumsy and cynical Cabinet. decision? In any case, when will the shabby treatment of these three eminent public citizens cease? Mr Armitage-Now, tell the truth, Ralph. Tell the truth.",25
31,Mr SPEAKER,INQUIRY INTO DOMESTIC AIR FARES,Order! The honourable member for Chifley will cease that type of interjection.,25
32,Mr HUNT,INQUIRY INTO DOMESTIC AIR FARES,"The Holcroft Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares was appointed on 20 May 1980. The inquiry's purpose was to review domestic air fares and, in particular, to look at the ways in which fares are set on individual routes in the national network by use of an air fare formula. The inquiry was never intended to be a full scale review of the regulation of domestic civifaviation. It was initially expected that the inquiry could complete its examination by the end of January 1981 and the committee of inquiry felt that that was a possible date. As time went on, the committee felt that it would have difficulty in meeting that deadline. In a meeting on 13 November this was made clear to me. In a letter dated 14 November, Mr Holcroft formally advised that the inquiry was unlikely to complete its task by the original date indicated, that is, January 1981. He sought advice as to whether a later completion date was acceptable to the Government. Because of the Government's desire to receive the inquiry's report before legislation to approve the new airlines agreement was introduced into the Parliament in this session, I conveyed to the inquiry by letter of 27 November the Government's wish that the inquiry report at the end of January.

39,Mr HOLDING ,RELATIONS,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. You said that it was not a matter of discretion and that the Chair had to apply the Standing Orders. I ask you now to apply that ruling. It is not a matter of discretion. The. question was clearly related to a Press report. As I understand the Standing Orders, it is not a question of discretion for the Chair. I ask you to apply the Standing Orders equally to members of the Government as you do to members of the Opposition.",25
40,Mr SPEAKER,RELATIONS,I do apply the Standing Orders equally. Mr Charles Jones-You have covered up for the Minister for Transport already tonight.,25
41,Mr SPEAKER,RELATIONS,The honourable member for Newcastle will remain silent.,25
42,Mr UREN ,RELATIONS,"Come on, Charlie; keep that fog horn of yours down.",25
43,Mr SPEAKER,RELATIONS,"The honourable member for Reid will remain silent also. The fact is that throughout my period as Speaker. I have permitted the asking of questions based on newspaper reports simply because almost every honourable member seems to base his question upon a newspaper report. If I were. to apply the Standing Order strictly, there would hardly be a question in order. It is only when the questioner makes a statement arising out of a newspaper report as to which there is clearly controversy that I call for the member to vouch for the accuracy of the report. I thought I had made clear the reason the question asked by the honourable member for Griffith was out of order, and that is, that I am determined to protect the privacy of party room discussions from either side of the House. That is the reason the question was ruled out of order. I pointed out that in addition, it would have been necessary for the honourable member for Griffith to vouch for the accuracy of the report. But in this case, in relation to this question, were I to rule question out of order on that ground it would stifle discussion in this Parliament on matters of major national issue which ought properly to be ventilated. It is my intention, exercising the inherent discretion which I have as Speaker, to allow the question. I call the Prime Minister.

57,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,RELATIONS,"Mr Speaker, I hope I am allowed to say that I hope both honourable gentlemen will read Hansard in the morning and find that they have proved my point for me. There were Press accounts of the Ambassador's remarks to a number of journalists. I think it is worth noting exactly what the Ambassador said. The reports suggest a failure on the part of His Excellency the Ambassador to understand the Government's position in relation to the Soviet Union, although that position has been explained in general terms to the wider community and in detail to His Excellency the Ambassador himself. The present strained relations between Australia and the Soviet Union are a direct result of the Soviet invasion, occupation and suppression of Afghanistan. The Government, along with many others around the world, condemned that in the strongest terms and took a series of measures in concert with its allies and friends. These measures, as is the case with other countries, remain in force. We certainly stand for the peaceful settlement of disputes, but this did not happen in Afghanistan. We hope very much that it will be allowed to continue to happen in Poland and hope also that the state of preparedness of Soviet forces on the borders of Poland does not herald some other Soviet intention. An improvement in relations between the Soviet Union and Australia is. certainly possible if the Soviet Union changes its· policies-policies which have been condemned by virtually the whole international community. But, regrettably, the Soviet Union has indicated a complete determination to maintain its policies. It has indicated no intention to change its policies, to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan. Until then it is difficult to see how relations between the Soviet Union and Australian can be normalised or how relations between the Soviet Union and many other countries around the world can be normalised.",26

64,Mr SPEAKER,RELATIONS,Order! The honourable member for Melbourne Ports will cease interjecting.,27
65,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,RELATIONS,"It is regrettable that the Soviet Union has revealed no intention to change its policies or. to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan and until then relations cannot be normalised. An Embassy official suggested that the Government ignored a request to expand the Embassy's trade section. I am advised that no formal request has been received by the Department of Foreign Affairs. If it is, it will be considered in a proper fashion in accordance with the circumstances prevailing between our· two countries. Indeed, we have examined some aspects of relationships between the Soviet Union and Australia in recent times and at the appropriate time an intention to apply a more reciprocal relationship to some aspects of that relationship will be revealed. There are proper and improper ways of conducting business between governments. Accusations to journalists, no matter how eminent, represent an improper way of conducting relationships between countries and that procedure is not likely to advance the cause of the Ambassador. The Ambassador reportedly referred to Australia as a possible nuclear target. I believe that in a sense that is a grave threat by the Ambassador himself and it belies the image of the so-called peaceful Soviet policy because if the Soviet Union really .had peaceful intentions towards Australia and all other countries the Ambassador would not for one moment have dreamt of uttering those particular words. That part of the remarks of His Excellency the Ambassador adds to grounds for concern felt by the international community concerning Soviet expansionism and militarism. Soviet policies underline the vital importance of Australia's relationships with her friends and allies which have been enhanced and improved by this Government over the last five or six years. Again I emphasise that if His Excellency the Ambassador really wishes to advance relationships between his country and mine then the way to do so is clear. NA",27

However, the Government has not set a date by which the committee is to report, and should the completion date not be achieved, it will be necessary to review the - estimates. Does the Minister recall confirming in writing on 11 September 1980 that statement from the Department of Administrative Services and further advising that it is the responsibility of the inquiry to determine its own program of public hearings?

Has the Department carried out an investigation into these allegations? Are these allegations true? What has the Department done about them? Will the Minister assure the House that the Government has not in the past, nor will it in the future, allow such a practice?",29
86,Mr MACPHEE,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"It is not true that the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs or the Government has allowed guest workers to come to Australia from anywhere. It is true that the Sydney Morning Herald carried certain allegations a couple of months ago that guest workers were working at the Clyde oil refinery of the Shell Co. of Australia Ltd. I inquired of the secretary of the Labor Council of New South Wales about that situation. We are endeavouring to obtain, we are of the opinion that the Inthrough the unions, through the employers and especially through the Metal Trades Industry Association of Australia a list of all persons and for- employed there.

Holcroft plied for amnesty under the Regularisation of Chairman Status Program to become permanent residents. We have yet to receive from the unions or the employers concerned any evidence to substantiate the allegations that anyone was here other than by those means. I take this opportunity to reiterate that we are opposed emphatically to any notion of guest workers. If/Australia has a shortage of a particular skill which cannot be met from its training and retraining programs, we will seek to bring in someone as a permanent resident-that is, as a migrant-and not as a guest worker. Certainly, under no circumstances would we support or condone any action which was taken by an employer to subvert the arbitration awards and determinations. I suggest that if the honourable member has any evidence of such action he ought to refer it to the State Minister concerned because there the authority lies to prosecute the employers concerned. NA NA NA",29
87,Mr MACKENZIE,WALES,My question which is directed to the Minister for Transport has absolutely nothing to do with the Holcroft inquiry. Did the Minister recently discuss the issue of road funding with a deputation representing 116 local government councils in New South Wales. Can he indicate whether supplementation of the planned five-year program is provided for in the proposal? Can he inform this House of the current state of play regarding the Australian Transport Advisory Council meeting on that proposed program?,29
88,Mr HUNT,WALES,"I met a number of deputations from various local governing bodies of New South Wales in the course of the last two days. Indeed, I officially opened their conference at the Canberra Rex Hotel. It was attended by more than 500 delegates from New South Wales. A deputation, including the President, the Deputy President and Mr Graeme Miles, the Executive Director of the Local Government Association of New South Wales, cailed upon the Prime Minister. I think most members of parliament had contact with them during the last 24 hours. They came to Canberra to put a case for further road funds from the Commonwealth Government. A problem exists in some parts of New South Wales. Or course, the Commonwealth Government is not the only source of funds for roads. The Commonwealth is providing $3,650m-MONICA",29

90,Mr HUNT,WALES,"It is providing $3,650m. Would any other honourable member like me to say it again? I repeat that the Commonwealth Government will provide $3,650m for roads over the five year period. This is a very substantial contribution to road funding. Of course we also expect the State governments, which have money running out of their ears, and local governments to make contributions to the road needs of Australia. A supplementation provision is contained in the $3,650m. An annual increment is provided for to meet some of the inflationary pressures that we anticipate-MONICA",30

92,Mr HUNT,WALES,"The annual. increment will provide for the estimated inflationary pressures which are built into that figure. I think that for the last two years, for instance, a 6 per cent increase is built into that figure. This is in accord with our economic strategy to bring down inflation to that figure or less. The Australian Transport Advisory Council had a very good meeting. It is one of the few meetings where the State Ministers did not walk out. A further meeting will be held on either 5 March or 6 March. I hope to attend and to get a reaction from the Ministers to the proposals which I have put. NA",30

Is the Minister aware that during the recent dispute it was revealed that some of· the employees at that refinery were given cash in hand and that pay-asyou-earn taxation deductions were not made? When I complained to the Commissioner of Tax·ation the reply was given that the Commissioner of Taxation could not police the law of the land because .of insufficient staff.",30

If he is, could he inform the House of the accuracy or otherwise of that statement?",30
96,Mr MACPHEE,NEWSPAPER,"I became aware this afternoon of the report to which the honourable member refers. I sought to make inquiries of the regional officers of the Department. So far I have not been able to find any evidence whatsoever to support the allegation. Indeed, the editor of the newspaper concerned told a senior departmental official today that he has no evidence either. All that he wrote his article upon was an allegation by one person who wished to remain anonymous. That allegation was not supported by evidence at all. The chief German language translator for the . Department in fact has said that no one could reasonably misconstrue the German translation and that no one could reasonably see the advertisement placed as applying to anyone other than people already in Australia. In any event, the advertisement stressed that anyone who thought he or she was eligible should use the telephone interpreter service to clarify that eligibility. I might say that during the amnesty program we had 26,000 inquiries and over 14,000 persons were covered by applications under the amnesty.

Is it a fact that the quality of River Murray water to South Australia has deteriorated to such an appalling level that the irrigation industry and domestic water supply of the entire State will be seriously endangered within two 'to three decades? Is ita fact that the River Murray Commission has proved after 66 years to be ineffectual in providing answers to these problems and that a national initiative is needed? As a matter of urgency, will he set up an institute for fresh water studies similar to the Australian Institute of Marine Science to examine properly, for the wayin which this grossly pillaged river system actually functions? Finally, will he consider using the Commonwealth's national implied powers as set out in the Australian Assistance Plan in 1975 to establish such an institute for the purpose of carrying out research and making recommendations relating to the proper management and control of our valuable and scarce inl-nd water resources?",31

When I was the Minister responsible I tried to get all the States to change the provisions of the River Murray Waters Agreement so that this factor could be taken into account. A meeting of all the States took place recently. For the first time they showed a willingness to change the Agreement so that this factor could be taken into account by the Commission. At the moment each of the States is looking at the proposals to amend the Agreement.

107,Mr SPEAKER,EDUCATION,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Dawkins) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Government to provide adequate support for students in secondary and tertiary education. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their placesMONICA",31
108,Mr DAWKINS ,EDUCATION,"Fremantle) (8.52)-The Minister for Education ( Mr Fife) is presiding over the deliberate and persistent demise of student support systems in this country. The Minister is blind to the gross deficiencies of the scheme that he administers and is impervious to the suffering which surrounds him. All he can say is that we on this side of the House and the students of this country expect too much and that all he expects of the scheme is that it meet the costs of students in a supplementary way only. He says that it is not meant to meet the total costs of a tertiary or a secondary student. What a shirking admission of defeat that is. What this Minister is really saying is that he and his Government have abandoned the principles on which this scheme was established. He is totally lacking in the imagination and dedication necessary to oversee the education of the people of this country. I ask you, Mr Speaker, to compare this Minister's approach with that of the Minister for Education during the years 1972 to 1975. Mr Beazley, the architect of this scheme, when introducing the Student Assistance Bill 1973, said: The tertiary education assistance scheme, to be. introduced for the first time at the beginning of 1974, is a major step by the Government in its program to produce a revolution of access to education. Mr Beazley, in that speech which he delivered in October 1973, went on to say: Students should be going through have the leisure to think as well speed does not easily lend itself to the creation of great new productive ideas. The function of education in a world in crisis is to develop people who can fashion a new and inspiring civilisation-people who have the moral and intellectual qualities, and the sensitivity hoped that this Bill is a step towards these goals. Let us compare the present Minister's apologia with the inspired statements of the Minister for Education in the Labor Government. The present Minister's apologia for what is left of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme has completely abandoned the promise and foresight of his predecessor. The present Minister's view also contradicts that of a review committee which reported in 1975. That committee, which was headed by Mr Haydn Williams, stated: Allowances should be sufficient to meet basic student needs over the full year. I ask honourable members and I ask the students of this country to compare that with what the Minister has said about the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. The Minister said last week that the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme is intended not to maintain students fully but to contribute to the cost of their maintenance whilst they are undertaking tertiary studies. The Minister says that TEAS is intended not to support students fully but rather to supplement their incomes. He is really saying that students have to find other sources of income to suppor,t, themselves through their tertiary studies. He 's-}'s that either they have to go out to work or th-y have to rely on their parents for that extra support. The Minister talks of the need for students to find extra work. It is all very well for this Government and this Minister to talk about the decision to increase the allowable earnings of tertiary students to $2,000 a year at a time when the economy is job-starved. Where does the Minister and the Government expect those tertiary students who, on the Minister's own admission, have to earn extra income in order to support themselves adequately during their tertiary studies, to find jobs that will enable them to earn that extra $2,000 a year at a time when it is very difficult indeed for people to find jobs of any kind? The worse feature of this, of course, is that whenever tertiary students find part time jobs they are inevitably taking jobs away from people who need those jobs even more than taken they do. Although, as a result of the constraints of this Scheme, it is very necessary for tertiary students to find extra means of support, it is even more important for those people who have no jobs at all to get the limited number of part time a period of life when they jobs that are available. as the need to study. An age of Perhaps the Minister has in mind that it is up to the parents to continue to support tertiary students. What that really means is that the Minister and this Government think that tertiary eduto produce a renaissance. It is cation should be reserved for the children of those families which have the capacity to continue to support their children through tertiary education. That is a complete abrogation of the purpOSe of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. In the words of Mr Beazley, the Scheme was meant 'to produce a revolution of access to education'. That means in simple terms-in terms simple enough even for the Liberal member for Eden-Monaro ( Mr Sainsbury) to understand-that everyone in the country, regardless of the income status of his parents, should have equal access to tertiary education. This means that it cannot be said that the only people who can undertake tertiary education are those who have parents who are wealthy enough to supplement their TEAS allowance in order that they can continue their tertiary studies. That is the point at issue in this whole question. Mr Sainsbury-What is the question?",31
109,Mr DA WKINS,EDUCATION,"The honourable member interjected at the stage when I was talking about access to tertiary education. The point is that access to tertiary education now is very much more restricted than it was when this enlightened and imaginative Scheme was introduced by the Labor Minister for Education and my predecessor as the honourable member for Fremantle, Mr Beazley. On the Minister's own admission, even if a student receives the full amount of the TEAS allowance he will still require the support of his parents or he will still require extra income from some other source. The point is, of course, that there are now fewer people receiving the full amount of the TEAS allowance than there were a few years ago. The TEAS allowance has declined in real value to the extent of about $8 a week since 1974. It is all very well for the Minister for Education to claim, as he did in his Press release last week, that a 10 per cent increase in the value of the TEAS allowance provided for in the last Budget came into effect at the beginning of this year. What he declined to announce was that that increase came after a three year period in which there was no increase at all. It is all very well for the Minister to say that he has been responsible for an increase of 10 per cent in the amount of the allowance but, in fact, if we compare the current allowance with the 1974 level we find that the real value has declined by $8. Not only has it declined by $8, but also it is available to far fewer people than it was previously. Mr Sainsbury-You said that before.",32
110,Mr DAWKINS,EDUCATION,"Indeed, I said it before. It is necessary for me to say it several times in order for imbecilic members of the Liberal Party to clearly understand the position in relation to the tertiary allowance. Mr Sainsbury-I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am not an imbecile. I ask the honourable member to withdraw that term.",33
111,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,EDUCATION,Mr MilIar)Order! The honourable member for Eden Monaro sorely provoked the honourable member for Fremantle who has a right to address the House in silence. I warn the honourable member for Eden-Monaro that if he persists I shall deal with him.,33
112,Mr DAWKINS,EDUCATION,"A few years ago-I will say this slowly for the country representatives from the Liberal Party-the maximum allowable adjust-d parental income was equal to 84 per cent of average male earnings. Now, as a result of the most recent changes, it is equal to only 74 per cent of average male earnings; that is, the average allowable adjusted parental income has declined by about 10 per cent in relation to average male earnings. That means that a great class of children of a particular group of income earners who a few years ago would have been entitled to the maximum living allowance under TEAS are now not eligible for the full living allowance simply because the adjustments to the Scheme have failed to take account of inflation that has occurred. A person now has to be very much poorer than was the case a few years ago in order to qualify for the full living allowance. The combination of these two factors has meant that whereas in 197640 per cent of university students were receiving living allowances under TEAS, in 1979, on the most recent figures available, only 35 per cent were receiving some living allowance under TEAS. This represents a very great decline. Whilst, of course, I am prepared to admit that a different picture applies in the case of colleges of advanced education where in fact the position has gone the' other way, I should say that the position in relation to universities is the better indication of the movement over time than the position in CAEs. There has been a great change in the sorts of institutions which are colleges of advanced education. There has also been a very great change in policy on teacher education. We can assume from that that the changes which have taken place in relation to CAE students have taken place because of the changes in teacher education whereas in universities the situation has been fairly constant. In the universities we now find that only 35 per cent of students are receiving some living allowance as opposed to 40 per cent in 1976. What does all this mean in relation to the ambition of the Scheme? The Minister claims that we misunderstand the Scheme. He says that the Scheme is not intended to maintain students fully. He does not really understand because he was not the architect of the Scheme. The architect of the Scheme and the committee which reviewed the Scheme believed that it was introduced in order to provide greater access to tertiary education to people regardless of the circumstances of their parents. What has happened is that this Minister and this Government have killed the revolution in access to universities which was commenced in 1974 by the then Minister for Education instead of the introduction of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme leading to more children from lower and middle income families entering tertiary education, it has led to fewer of them doing so. That is of course what this Government always thought was the natural state of things in this community. One of the most depressing things is that the revolution has really been killed. What we find now is that a very disproportionate number of university students come from families in which the breadwinners received tertiary education of some kind. I cite a couple of figures. If we look at the statistics relating to the occupation of therfathers of university entrants, we find that whereas,jnI966-67 22 per cent of students came from professionals' families this figure rose to 28 per cent in 1976-77. There has been a rise in the number of students from professional families although those families represent only 8 or 9 per cent of the total population. In 1966-67 only 20 per cent of university students came from manual workers' families and manual workers represented over 50 per cent of the male population aged between 35 and 54 years. This shows very inequitable access to tertiary education at a time when we should recognise that access to jobs and access to a reasonable standard of living demands a very high standard of skill. People must obtain those skills in order to obtain the sorts of jobs which are likely to be created in the future. What we are seeing in the tertiary education field is that privilege is being handed on to the children of the privileged as a result of the policies of this Government.,1t is not necessary for honourable members simply to rely on what I have said. The facts have been demonstrated in reports which have been presented to this Government. I refer specifically to the report of the Education Research and Development Committee which stated that the social composition of students in higher education appears to have changed little in time.",33
113,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,EDUCATION,Mr MilIar)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,34
114,Mr FIFE ,EDUCATION,"Farrer-Minister for Education) (9.8)-1t is quite ludicrous for the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Dawkins) to assert, as he did during his speech a few minutes ago, that Australian children with appropriate qualifications are being denied access to universities and colleges of advanced education because of the financial standing of their parents. The fact in this country no tertiary fees are charged and in addition a Student Assistance Scheme exists which provides a deal of assistance to these young people. The Opposition's move this evening is not directed only to tertiary education. It refers to both tertiary and secondary education. I indicate to the House this evening that the Commonwealth Government is firmly committed to the maintenance of the various student allowance schemes currently assisting Australian students, with the aim of specifically helping those students and their families who are less able to afford the cost of secondary and tertiary education. The Government's record in this area is one of which it is justly proud, given the need for responsible economic management of the country. In 1981 the Government1dinereased expenditure on student assistance pf(;)grams, as announced in the Budget, by an amount of $38m, bringing to a total of $229.7m the cost of all student assistance programs this year. It is only reasonable that the Government, in recognition of its responsibility to Australian taxpayers, should give careful consideration to the real needs of students and their parents in deciding on increases in allowances and adjustments to means tests for each of the student assistance schemes. It is within this reasonable framework that I announced substantial increases in these allowances from the beginning of 1981. Specifically, major allowances under the Isolated Children's Scheme and the Secondary Allowances Scheme were increased by a massive 20 per cent. Living allowances under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and other schemes were raised by 10 per cent with a substantial adjustment to means tests. Whilst acknowledging the importance of the range of student assistance schemes in the Improvement of educational opportunity for all Australians, it is important that the aim of these schemes be placed in proper perspective. They are not intended to maintain students fully but to contribute to the cost of maintenance while students are undertaking studies. The Secondary Allowances Scheme is designed to provide support for families with limited financial resources to assist them to maintain student children enrolled in the final two years of secondary education. The allowance, as announced in the Budget, was increased by 20 per cent this year to $660 per annum. In addition, the means test for eligibility under the scheme was increased by 20 per cent. It is estimated that approximately 25,000 students will receive assistance under the Secondary Allowances Scheme this year. Also, within the secondary education area, the Adult is that Secondary Education Scheme assists mature students to undertake the final year of secondary study. Eligible applicants under this scheme will have their allowances and adjustments under the means test increased by 10 per cent in 1981. In the tertiary area, students in receipt of assistance have received a considerable boost to their allowances. Post-graduate awards have been increased in number and in value involving the expenditure of an additional $0.7m in 1980-81. Expenditure under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme has been increased by about 10 per cent with a liberalisation of the means test of the same order. As I mentioned earlier, the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme is not intended to maintain students fully but rather to contribute to the cost of their maintenance while they are undertaking tertiary studies. I make it quite clear that TEAS is in no way intended to equate with a wage and it never was. Nonetheless, the Government is increasing its expenditure on TEAS by $24m this year, following the annual review of allowances which takes place in the Budget context. New initiatives in TEAS for 1981 include increases in ing and dependant allowances as well as a relaxation of the means test. Maximum living allowances have been increased from $29.29 to $32.21 a week for a student living at home, while the away-from-home and independent rates have been increased from $45.15 to $49.67 a week. The allowances for a dependent spouse have been increased from $31.40 to $42.70 a week, and for each dependent child from $7.50 to $10 a week. The level of family income, after deductions for dependents and other allowable deductions at which maximum benefits will be payable, has been increased from $9,300 to $10,312. A partial allowance will be paid in 1981 where the adjusted family income in the 1979-80 financial year did not exceed $15,721 for a student living at home and $19,361 for a student living away from home. In addition to these measures, there has also been an easing of the means test on a student's own income for 1981. Students are now able to earn $2,000 a year before the allowance is affected instead of $1,500. Included in this liberalised means test is the capacity to receive a maximum of $500 from another award instead of $150 which was the limit last year. Whilst it is true that the Government has not been able to increase TEAS allowances each year following its annual review, it has substantially increased allowances and the Means Adjusted Family Income, MAFI, during the period it has been in office. This has meant that government expenditure on TEAS has increased every year since the Government came to office. Perhaps the most graphic illustration of the success of the scheme is the extent of its application. On 1979 figures-the latest available-there were approximately 230,000 students in TEAS approved courses throughout Australia. Of this number 93,559, or 40 per cent, received an allowance and 57,339, or 61 per cent of these received the maximum allowance for their particular category-at home, away from home or independent. This further means that 25 per cent of all tertiary students in approved courses received the maximum allowance appropriate to their category. An additional 15 per cent of students receive some benefits under the means test. As I have mentioned, the Government is most concerned to ensure that eligible students receive the maximum support possible under TEAS and other student assistance schemes, given the need for responsible economic management by the Government. I have illustrated that the Government is sensitive to the needs of those students who have a real need for assistance in their efforts to undertake livfull time studies. Apart from the substantial increase in the level of allowances across the range of student assistance schemes, to which I have referred and which were announced in the Budget, there have been a number of other initiatives in this connection. In particular, the Isolated Children's Assistance Scheme has been extended to include medical cases and other categories of students suffering from disabilities who were previously not included in the scheme. However, I emphasise once again that the levels of allowances and means tests of all forms of student assistance, including TEAS, are reviewed annually in the Budget context and will continue to be reviewed annually.",34
115,Mr FREE ,EDUCATION,"Macquarie) (9.18)-The various student assistance schemes operated by this Government have a number of features in common. Foremost amongst these is their restrictive nature which is the direct cause of their failure to meet the objectives originally set for them. This is especially true of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. TEAS was introduced by the Labor Government in 1974 to open up tertiary education to students from low and middle income families. Since then the real value of TEAS has been eroded and whittled away to a point where many students simply cannot make ends meet and the very people it was designed to help originally are now excluded from tertiary education. The present maximum allowances of about $32 a week for students at home and about $49 for those living away from home, as the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Dawkins) pointed out, are at least $8 behind the 1974 level in real terms. The current living-away-from-home maximum allowance is over $13 below the poverty line. That applies to the few-the 10 per cent of students-whose parental incomes qualify under the means test. Those who do not qualify received a reduced allowance or nothing. I stress that the allowance depends on the income of the parents who mayor may not decide to support a student child in a tertiary institution. The means test was recently revised, but it is still outdated. The limit for a maximum allowance is now a family income of $10,321. As the honourable member for Fremantle pointed out, this is now 74 per cent of average male earnings yet in 1976 it was 84 per cent of average male earnings. I do not mind repeating,pgures that my colleague used earlier this evenipgJ:/bCa]lSe it is sound educational practice to repea-M--e\things a few times to get them across to people who need to learn a lesson. The result has been that fewer people are qualifying for the allowance because the limit is so unrealistic. The result is that the doors of universities and colleges of advanced education are closed to very many able, prospective students from middle and lower income families. I had one of those students in my electorate office a few weeks ago. She had qualified for entry to the University of New England. She had been accepted but the parental income exceeded the maximum by about $100 or so and that aspect determined whether she went to that University. She is not going because of the restrictive nature of the means test. We need only to look at the profiles of students attending universities to see what this has achieved. I refer to the report of the Tertiary Education Research Centre of the University of New South Wales which was published in 1978. That report states: In both universities and colleges of advanced education the younger students are much more likely to be from families of higher social status, to have Australian parentage and to be Australian born. The proportion of students who attended State secondary schools ranges from 53 per cent in universities country colleges. The fathers of these students are likely to be from professional, managerial or white collar occupational groups and to have an income well above average. There is a high representation of students from nonCatholic independent schools. Migrants are underrepresented, particularly those of non-British origin. The report goes on to say that the problems are so much greater in country areas. I turn now to the secondary allowance assistance scheme which provides a maximum allow-. ance of $660 per annum for students in the final years of school. In the time available to me, I will set out four brief criticisms of this scheme. The first is the level of assistance. Although, as the Minister for Education ( Mr Fife) has pointed out, this level has been increased, it is simply not adequate. Anybody putting a student through the last two years of high school, the senior years, will say that $12 a week assistance is insufficient. Again, the means test is too restrictive. For the full allowance, the adjusted family income must be $7,440 or less and any allowance of any kind cuts out when the adjusted family income reaches $10,080. Thirdly, the scheme does not cater for year 10 students and therefore does not cater for the body of students who are reaching:m-rage of 14 years 9 months and whose family ii'i'c1Sihe' will not permit them to continue their schooling. There is nothing to cover the student from the age of 14 years 9 months to when he or she begins the final two years of secondary schooling. Finally, I find the secondary assistance scheme to be very poorly advertised. Again, in my electorate office recently there was a widow who had a student in year 12 at school. She qualified under the family income limit but she had missed out on assistance last year because she had simply not been aware of the scheme. The scheme had been so poorly promoted that information about it was simply not available. I can tell the Minister that I have been advertising in the newspapers advising parents that the scheme is available and offering assistance. The response has been quite surprising. There are a number of parents in this country who are not aware of the assistance available to them under this scheme. The intention of the scheme is to assist those families whose children would otherwise be forced, through economic circumstances, to leave school at year 10, the school certificate level in my State. The scheme has failed. It is failing to provide a realistic level of support and attended a private school, to be of it is failing to provide it to all of those families who need it. to almost 70 per cent in I now touch briefly on the adult secondary education assistance scheme which offers a TEAS level benefit to students 19 years and over attempting the final year of full time secondary education, providing they have had a break in their secondary education. I think the best measure of its worth is the number of people using it. It is estimated that across the whole of Australia there are only 1,940 students using the scheme-fewer than 2,000 across the whole country. That is a measure of the kind of assistance that the Government is offering and the appropriateness of the scheme to the needs of adult secondary education. Clearly, the scheme needs to be extended. Either the Government should lower the age to 18 if it is an adult scheme-we accept 18-year-olds as adults in this country-or remove the substantial break clause in regard to secondary education. The Government ought at least to consider the position of those people who are making an effort to educate themselves to high certificate level on a part time basis. Perhaps some assistance could be offered to them. In summary, the students' assistance schemes of the Government provide levels of assistance which are unrealistic, are governed by means tests which are unrealistic and, finally, are poorly promoted. They fail to recognise that we have a drop-out rate of more than 70 per cent in state schools. The figure is worse in the country and worse still among migrants. We might ask ourselves why this should be. We should, I guess, examine the philosophy of the Minister and of the Government. We have heard a lot about philosophy since the new Parliament met. We have tame philosophers running around the Parliament. I see them-the Prime Minister's hired grey matter-coming in at Question Time each morning. To understand the philosophy behind all this perhaps we should look at the statements of the Minister. I repeat his statement of 23 February: The Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme is not to fully maintain students but to contribute to the cost of maintenance while they are undertaking tertiary studies. I submit that this is a negative philosophy. The implication is that while they are students their parents can look after them. It contains no commitment to equality of educational opportunity, no recognition of the leadership role that the national Government ought to be playing in education in this country. Instead, we have tokenism and pious sentiment. The Minister said on 23 February, and again tonight, that the Government is roost concerned to ensure that eligible students receive the maximum support possible given the need for responsible economic management by the Government. Again we hear the term 'responsible economic management'. r submit that responsible economic management ought to be concerned with the development of this country's greatest resource, its young people. The failure to invest in their future is a failure to invest in the future of Australia.",35
116,Mr CHAPMAN ,EDUCATION,"Kingston) (9.27)-The disarray that is apparent within the Australian Labor Party and the dearth of issues on which its supporters can justifiably criticise the Government are reflected in the matter of public importance which they propose to debate this evening, namely: 'The failure of the Government to provide adequate support for students in secondary and tertiary education'. Both the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Dawkins) and the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Free) have completely failed in their attempts to establish a case in support of that proposition. Mr Mildren-Words, words, words.",37
117,Mr CHAPMAN,EDUCATION,"We have heard plenty from the honourable member's side over the last quarter of an hour or so. As was outlined in the 1980 Budget Speech to apply to this very year of 1981, allowances both at the secondary and tertiary levels have been increased more than the predicted rate of inflation. The Government funds and administers a range of programs of financial assistance to students, programs which it tailors to meet their particular needs. They are part of the Fraser Government's demonstrable and continuing concern to ensure that quality education is available to all. This is demonstrated by the increase in the 1980-81 Budget of 10 per cent in the expenditure on education. In monetary terms that provides an absolute additional sum of $260m over the provision made in the previous year, to bring the total expenditure of $2,867m. Mr Barry Jones-What was the inflation rate?",37
118,Mr CHAPMAN,EDUCATION,The predicted rate of inflaintended tion is less than 10 per cent this year. Mr Barry Jones-What about last year?,37
119,Mr CHAPMAN,EDUCATION,I am talking about the coming year.,37
120,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,EDUCATION,Mr Millar)Order! The honourable member for Kingston will ignore interjections. I ask honourable members on my left to remain silent.,37
121,Mr CHAPMAN,EDUCATION,"Out of this total funding an amount of$19m has been provided to increase student assistance in the part year involved. This will mean, over a full year, an expenditure of $38m. In determining those increases, the Government has given careful and sympathetic consideration to the needs of students and parents. Thus, there has been a significant increase in funds provided and allocated to achieve increases across the range of programs, to which the Minister for Education ( Mr Fife) has referred. The Government's commitment to providing adequate support for students.is demonstrated by the fact that this is the second time in four Budgets that there have been substantial increases in the allowances provided for students. It ought to be noted that this has been achieved in a period of necessary and stringent expenditure restraint. It has also been achieved in a period in which the Government has had a successful fight against inflation. It has maintained the real value of the allowances far better that the previous Labor Administration. Mr Dawkins-That's a lie.",37
122,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,EDUCATION,Mr Millar)Order! The honourable member for Fremantle is using an unparliamentary term. I ask him to withdraw it. Mr Dawkins-I simply said that the facts show that that is a lie.,37
123,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EDUCATION,"The use of the word 'lie' is unparliamentary and you are required to withdraw it. Do you withdraw it? Mr Dawkins-Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker. UJll. ' MrqClJy\.PMAN-Does the honourable memb-r f(!)J!. Fremantle deny that, although the Labor Government introduced these allowances in the 1973 Budget, it steadfastly refused crease them in either the 1974 Budget or the 1975 Budget? Mr Dawkins-That's a lie, too.",37
124,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EDUCATION,Order!,38
125,Mr CHAPMAN,EDUCATION,"It is interesting that the a better honourable member for Fremantle referred to the 1975 Williams report because that report, which recommended increases, was available to the Labor Government-Mr Dawkins- Mr Deputy Speaker, they were increased in the 1975 Budget.",38
126,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EDUCATION,Order! The of outcome honourable member for Fremantle has again funding offended. Earlier I drew his attention to the that quality. unparliamentary expression he used and I sought a withdrawal. He has compounded the error and I ask him to withdraw it and to refrain from using it again. Mr Dawkins-I replace it by saying that they he explodes. were increased in 1975.,38
127,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EDUCATION,The honourable information. member will simply withdraw. Mr Dawkins-I withdraw.,38
128,Mr CHAPMAN,EDUCATION,The honourable member for Fremantle is completely wrong in his for assertion. Mr Dawkins-In the 1975 Budget they were determining increased with effect in 1976.,38
129,Mr CHAPMAN,EDUCATION,"They were not increased in force the 1975 Budget, despite the fact that the reccation, ommendation of the Williams honourable member referred was available to the Labor Government in May 1975. The Labor been Government refused to increase the allowances despite the fact that during that period there virtually no restraint on government expenditure. It was the period offree and easy spending. If Labor Government really was concerned about the level of the allowances being paid to students, surely it would have found some money from among its largesse to increase the allowances that period. Furthermore, the rampant inflationary effects of the policies of the Labor Party during that period ensured that the real value of the allowwill ances was significantly reduced. The value of allowances also was reduced in relation to average weekly earnings because it was duringthat period that the Labor Party encouraged the massive wage hikes which also destroyed the economy this country. On any comparison;:-""t-Fraser Government shows up very favoura61Y a-ainst vote the previous Labor Government in respect of the to inadequacy of allowances paid to students. The proposition put by Labor Party supporters in this debate is a continuation of their fetish with quantity in education being all important. That proposition flies in the face of the facts. Pouring more and more money into education will not produce education system. It ignores the fact that recurrent funds provided per student place at all levels of education are the highest ever in real terms. A major concern of the Fraser Government has been to ensure quality. of outcome from the education system. There is no demonstrable evidence to show that funding above a certain level will have any further impact on the quality of education. An appropriate level of has been reached in Australia to achieve Mr Barry Jones-How do you determine it?",38
130,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EDUCATION,Order! The honourable member for Lalor does not interject; Mr Barry J ones-I am merely seeking,38
131,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EDUCATION,I ask the honourable member to remain silent.,38
132,Mr CHAPMAN,EDUCATION,"If the honourable member Lalor is patient I will give him the information. The present Government has given attention to the other factors which are important in quality in education. It initiated the Williams inquiry into education and the work and theAuchmuty inquiry into teacher eduboth of which are concerned with quality report to which the in education. The Labor Party also ignores a fact which has strongly endorsed by the Australian people at three subsequent elections; that is, that there was are limits to the level of government spending, which in turn means that there must be competing the priorities for the limited amounts of government revenue. Additional increases in student allowances beyond those provided in the last Budget can be achieved only by reducing some other in items of expenditure. Perhaps the honourable member for Fremantle or the honourable member for Macquarie will suggest that we ought to abandon indexed increases in pensions. Perhaps they suggest that we ought to abandon the prothe vision within the last Budget for young unem.ployed to earn more without those additional earnings having any effect on the level of their unemployment benefit. Perhaps they are suggesting of that the additional money required ought to be taken from some other area within the education itself, such as teachers' salaries. Given the limits to government spending, that is the real logic of the Opposition's proposals. That is the only way that increases in allowances beyond those provided in the last Budget could be achieved. It is to the great advantage of Australia and to its economic growth that the Labor era of unlimited government spending has well and truly passed. The proposal put by the Australian Labor Party in this debate also ignores the continuing parental responsibility for student children and their education. It is not acceptable for the family to abdicate responsibility for the continuing welfare of members of the family who have chosen not to enter the work force. To abdicate that responsibility completely to government, and therefore in the final analysis to taxpayers, is certainly not acceptable to the Liberal Party either in philosophy or in practice. Of course it is the aim of the Labor Party to make as many as possible dependent on the Government. For the well-being of the community it is essential to ensure that people retain the maximum possible independence from government. As the Auchmuty inquiry concluded, there is no short cut to improved education nor national consensus on what improved education implies. The Fraser Government will continue its commitment to quality education well aware that the short cuts of big spending proposed by the Labor Party will not achieve the goal of quality education.",38

152,Mr MOORE ,AYES,"Ryan-Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs) (10.12)-I move: Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 1 to 3 (1981). The Customs Tariff Proposals 1I have just tabled relate to proposed alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1966. Proposals Nos. 1, 2 and 3 formally place before Parliament, as required by law, tariff changes introduced by (Commonwealth of Australia) Gazette notice during the last recess. Proposals No. 1 which operates from 1 January 1981, contains, firstly, the implementation of tariff rates arising from the Government's decision to provide concessional rates of duty to those countries signatory to the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Co-' operation Agreement. The Agreement is a preferential non-reciprocal agreement, between Australia and New Zealand on the on:e--Wcf'and the island member countries of the South Pacific AYES Forum on the other. It provides for minimum Morrison, W. L. Mountford, J. O. rates of duty to apply to nominated goods listed in the Schedules to the Agreement. It contains, secondly, the implementation of the Government's decision to vary the preferential tariff arrangements applying to certain textiles, clothing and Willis,R. Young,M.J. footwear from developing countries. The new arrangements provide margins ranging from five to 10 percentage points. It contains, thirdly, the imNOES plementation of the Government's decision to allow duty free admission of imports within quota of finished textiles, clothing and footwear from New Guinea; and, finally, the decision by the Government to add further goods to Schedule A of the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement. Tariff changes implemented by Proposals No.2 operate from 21 January 1981 and follow the Government's decision to accept the recommenNixon,P.J. O'Keefe, F. L. dations made by the Industries Assistance Commission in its report on tanned and finished leather, dressed fur. The effect of the decision reduces raw or semi-processed hides, skins and furskins and leather waste and parings to miniSainsbury, M. E. Shack,P.D. mum rates with certain other leather and furskins being dutiable at 15 per cent general and preferential. A margin of five percentage points is accorded developing countries. The Proposals also contain a revision of duty rates for carpets of New Zealand origin and other changes of an administrative nature. Proposals No.3 operates from 4 February 1981 PAIR and follows the Government's decision on the recommendation made by the Temporary Assistance Authority in its report on certain soft sided containers. The Authority found that the industry TARIFF PROPOSA.LS was experiencing difficulty and recommended urgent action. The Government has accepted the recommendation and has provided for a temporary rate of duty of 20 per cent for 12 months pending a report by the Industries Assistance Commission on the long term needs of the industry. A comprehensive summary setting out the nature of the duty changes has been prepared and is being circulated to honourable members. 1 commend the Proposals to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Hurford) adjourned. NA Pension Benefits-Nursing Homes-Home Care Services-Insurance Industry---'Industrial Relations-Tertiary Education Entry Standards-Motor Racing Circuit in the ACT Motion (by Mr Fife) proposed: That the House do now adjourn.",42
153,Mr LEO MCLEAY ,ADJOURNMENT,"Grayndler) (10.16)This evening I would like to bring to the attention of the House the high price that old people in this country pay for being altruistic. A single woman, aged over 70 years, who resides in my electorate, worked for most of her life for the then New South Wales Government Department of Railways. She is now in receipt of a Department of Railways pension. She, like a lot of other people in this community, cares for her fellow man and would like to try to do something to help. She has some small savings-an amount of some $7,000. She keeps $2,000 of that $7,000 in a bank account. In her own words: 'That money is to bury me'. Previously, on a number of occasions, I have brought to the attention of the House the attitude of a number of pensioners who like to keep some money in the bank so that they can pay for their funeral. But the Government imposes a charge on them if they receive any interest on that money. The lady to whom I have referred has placed the remaining $5,000 into a Department of Main Roads loan because she believes it is better to put her money into government bonds than to have it in the bank or to invest in any other more speculative areas. This woman receives $55.50 a fortnight from the New South Wales Department of Railways as superannuation and $28 a fortnight interest from the Department of Main Roads loan. The money which she receives in interest she places at the disposal of Technical Aid to the Disabled Charitable Organisation. This is a charity which does a great deal for people in distress in this country. is a charity to which we should be giving a little more attention, particularly in the International Year of Disabled Persons. This woman, who wants to do something for her fellow man, makes that money available to those people because, as she has said, she does not really need the interest herself. But she has started to run into trouble cause, unfortunately for her, if one adds up the pension and the interest which she receives one finds that she earns $1.75 a week more than the $40 which she is allowed to earn, and, therefore, loses the majority of pension benefits. It does not matter, so far as the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Social Security are concerned, that she pays that $28 a week to a needy charity. It does not matter that she has some concern for her fellow man. The money which she receives is considered to be income and she is penalised for it. Of course, she could go out and use the $7,000 to buy a diamond ring whose value would appreciate greatly, sell it for a capital gain and pay no tax on it. That would not affect her pension whatsoever. Because this woman wants to do something to help others she is penalised for it. That is just another example of the attack that this Government has made, because of the mismanagement of its social security and taxation programs, on those people who are least able to afford it. Last week I raised in the Parliament the problem that people have when they receive income tax assessments because they earn $20 a week which the Department of Social Security allows. This woman is assessed in another area so that she cannot make over to the charity the amount specified and not have it credited to her as income. She cannot find a way around the problem. The Taxation Office and the Department of Social Security do not want to listen. They do not care whether this person wants to do something for her fellow man. They do not care about that at all. They just say: 'You are earning an income of $28 a fortnight. That is bad luck-goodbye pension'. Are we saying to the people that they should exercise initiative? Of course we are not. This Government is not. It is saying that people should look after themselves when they are older. Some people who try to do that find that they are penalised more and more. I think, from hearing the empty statements made by Ministers in this Parliament, that they would like people to think of their fellow man, that they would like old people not to be a charge on the Government and that they would like the citizens to show some inititive. I think it is scandalous when initiative is It penalised drastically. I call upon the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) to take some account of those people who want to do something to help their fellow man, who make funds available to institutions which will help others, and see that they are not penalised for doing so. Old people should not be forced into buying combe- modities such as gold and doing all the other tricky things that the big business community is up to. If people want to help others, why cannot we as a parliament look at ways to assist them to do just that?",43
154,Mr BAUME ,ADJOURNMENT,"Macarthur) (10.20)-The object of social welfare is to help people in need. If the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Leo MCLeay) has an objection to the welfare cut-off levels or the rules, I hope that he will be constructive and suggest positive rules which will enable welfare to be concentrated on those in need rather than spread widely among those who have no need but who may well have many desires. I realise that the party of which he is a member was very ke!}11 to spread welfare far and wide in a vote catching endeavour when it was in government. I am glad to say that the people of Australia recognised that someone has to pay for that kind of middle class welfare. Generally the middle class people have to pay. Tonight I want to refer to nursing home beds and home help services. The other night in this House I noted that there was a dramatic difference between the number of nursing home beds in various States. I dramatised the situation in Victoria. In that State there is much less demand for nursing home beds because it has a much more effective and efficient method of providing home help services to the aged. I noted at that time that a great body of medical opinion suggests that it is much more beneficial to aged people to stay in the home environment for as long as possible. They can be assisted by home care services. I have extracted the Victorian figures. The Federal Government has provided to Victoria on a matching grant basis far more than it has provided to New South Wales. This, of course, is because New South Wales has a different set of priorities towards the aged. 1980-81 Budget the grant to New South Wales for home care services was $3.9m compared with Victoria's grant of $4.3m. Mr Leo MCLeay-How much did your Government spend on nursing homes?",43
155,Mr BAUME,ADJOURNMENT,"We recognise that Victoria has a much smaller population than New South Wales has. We also recognise that the honourable member for Grayndler is incapable of keeping quiet while anyone else speaks although he expects us to be quiet when he is speaking. The population in New South Wales of over 5 million compares with a population of 3.8 million in Victoria. The Victorian Government, in conjunction with the Federal Government, effectively provides a subsidy of $1.12 per head of population for home care services whereas in· New South Wales the per head subsidy' or grant is only about 77c. With the exception of Western Australia which appears to have a different system, New South Wales is the State with the worse performance of all the States of Australia. We often hear criticism from the Opposition about the approach of the Queensland Government to welfare. That relatively progressive Government, in terms of a comparison with New South Wales, provides a grant which allows the Federal Government to match it to the tune of about 86c per head of population. That is well above the figure of 77c per head of population for New South Wales. 'jl1 JHlfj I recognise that there has been ant flicr'base expenditure on home care services in New South Wales in recent times. I hope that this increase will continue. There is a direct relationship between the level of spending on home care services and a reduction in the demand for nursing home beds. It is self-evident that institutionalising aged people should be the last resort of government, not the first resort. It seems to me that the New South Wales Government is very keen to shovel the problem to the Federal Government. It takes the view that the Federal Government will pick up the bill for nursing homes but that it will have to pay half the cost of home care services. If that is the philosophic basis on which the New South Wales Government is being outperformed by all the other State governments I think it is pretty shameful. I hope that the New South Wales Government takes this matter to heart and increases its contribution so that the Federal Government, on a dollar for dollar basis, will also have the opportunity to increase its contribution in the coming Budget.",44
156,Mr JACOBI ,ADJOURNMENT,"Hawker) (10.26)-1 was In the appalled to note in today's Press another collapse-to the tune of $3m-of an insurance brokerage firm. That is an indictment of this Government's failure to enact appropriate legislation. The newspaper article stated: The failure of, a large Melbourne insurance broker with debts estimated at about $3 million may add further weight to national and State moves for legislation covering the braking industry. Kinloch (Insurances) Pty Ltd, which is understood to have had insurance premium turnover of more than $6 million a year, was put into provisional liquidation under its own petition late last week. I wonder whether the Treasurer ( Mr Howard) can clarify the position of how much money the majority owner, Mr Farfor, has siphoned off to sustain his yachting activities. It is another scandal, and it is a scandal which this Government will have to continue to live with. With regard to the Law Reform Commission report to which I referred in this House in 1976, the newspaper article said: The commission's report, said that known losses from the collapse of insurance brokers over the past 10 years had exceeded $7 million. Known losses have now reached the scandalous level of $lOm, and still there is no action by this Government. The report of the Law Reform Commission, which results from a reference made at my request in 1976, was tabled in September of last year and the indication by the Treasurer of the Government's attitude at that point was, simply summed up, that the first step in the Government's consideration of the present legisin lation would be to seek the views of insurance industry organisations and other interested parties, together with those of State governments and departments of the Commonwealth Government, on certain aspects of the report. The commissioner responsible for the Law Reform Commission report, Professor Kelly, went to no end of trouble to have endless symposiums, conferences and discussions with all sections of the industry. There is no need for any procrastination on the part of the Treasury or the Treasurer. The recommendations laid down in the report ought to be implemented and they ought to be implemented forthwith. We have the ridiculous situation of the collapse-to the tune of $3m-of six companies in Western Australia last year. The Western Australian Government is not prepared to wait for this Government to act. It is now in the process of drafting its own legislation. The same applies in New South Wales. The situation is an utter scandal. There is no excuse for any further delay. The recommendations are set out in the Law Reform Commission report. Legislation was enacted in the United Kingdom in 1977. As I understand it, a draft Bill was attached to the report. It has been five years since the ter was considered by the industry under the aegis of the Law Reform Commission, yet the Government still argues that it wants to go back and talk to the industry. So much for self-regulation and market forces! The price of that delay is that $10m of insurers' money has gone to people who should never have been given the authority to underwrite as far as brokerage is concerned. Finally, where the loss is caused by a broker's negligence, it might be unfair to cast the responsito bility on to an insurance company. Brokers are the agents of the insurance public rather than the insurers with whom they place the business. Many an insurer has little or no control over the conduct of the brokers with whom he is dealing. Consequently, it would be unrealistic to make an insurer generally responsible for that conduct. The most obvious way of protecting the public is to ensure that a broker himself has adequate insurance cover against liability of the client. The appalling fact revealed by the Law Reform Commission report and this company's collapse is that roughly one-third of all broking houses in Australia have no cover whatsoever of this type, let alone adequate cover. That is an indictment, and it is high time that the Parliament itself took action to implement appropriate legislation. If we see it in brokerage field, we can see it in the insurance field. There has been a continuing litany of the wrecking. of people. Consumers in this country have suffered because of inadequate legislation in the insurance field, certainly as regards brokerage. Legislation was brought down in England in 1977 and Australia has been studying it since 1976. It is an indictment of this Government that it has failed to bring in such legislation in this country also. The collapse of this company is only a forerunner of more to come.",44
157,Mr MACKENZIE ,ADJOURNMENT,"Calare) (10.30)-Tonight I raise the proposal by the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) in the last election campaign that the Commonwealth allocate $2m towards the establishment of an international standard motor racing circuit in the Australian Capital Territory. That proposal came as some surprise because, to my knowledge, the Commonwealth has not previously provided capital assistance for the development of new motor racing circuits in Australia. I speak with some concern and on behalf of the citizens and council of the city of Bathurst in New South Wales, in my electorate. at all Most honourable members will realise that Bathurst is each year the venue of the premier motor racing event in Australia. I refer to the Hardie Ferodo 1000 motor race. The Bathurst circuit, at Mount Panorama, is the last true road matracing circuit remaining in Australia. It has special significance for both road racing enthusiasts and bicycle racing enthusiasts. The Bathurst 1000 motor racing is covered by some 20 television stations and I think that the local council can claim with a fair degree of accuracy that, with the exception of the Melbourne Cup, it is Australia's most notable sporting event. It is for these reasons, and others, that I believe the Government should reconsider the proposal apply $2m towards the establishment of a motor racing circuit in the Australian Capital Territory. In addition to the Mount Panorama circuit at Bathurst, many circuits in Australia, for instance in Sydney and Melbourne, can lay claim to the need for financial support to upgrade their circuits to international, and perhaps grand prix, standard. The Mount Panorama circuit has been operated for many years by the Bathurst City Council. It is the only public circuit in Australia and, as I have said, it is the venue for not only the Hardie Ferodo 1000 motor racing event but also the motor cycle grand prix of Australia. In conjunction with these events, private industry has invested a considerable amount in the circuit, the total asset value of which at present is some $7m. If a new circuit were to-be established in the Austhe tralian Capital Territory that would cost some $8m to $10m, whereas to upgrade the Mount Panorama circuit to grand prix standard would cost an estimated $4m. Batl1u.rst' is also a major city within the Bathur-t:Orange growth complex and is very centrally situated to the centres of metropolitan population from which enthusiasts on the eastern seaboard largely come. The advantages of a specially built motor racing venue are considered to apply at Bathurst as well as at Canberra. I believe that there is a real advantage in conducting both road racing and international grand prix standard events at the one venue. At this stage it would seem that a commitment has been made to the Australian Capital Territory but I have yet to establish whether that was done after consultation with the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport, the body responsible for motor racing in this country. 1 urge the Government to reconsider its apparent commitment to the Australian Capital Territory, consult the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport and examine other venues. If it is to provide $2m for the establishment of the new motor racing circuits, it should undertake an inquiry as to where in Australia that money can be best applied, in providing an international standard Formula I circuit.",45
158,Mr HAWKE ,ADJOURNMENT,"Wills) (10.35)-I wish to address the House on a subject which, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, has been a matter of deep concern to me over recent years. I refer to the increasing divisiveness in our society and the attempts of some people to stimulate that divisiveness. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the area of industrial relations. Let me make my position quite clear. There is no doubt that some strikes are not justified, just as it is impossible to justify some decisions of selfish management which precipitate strike action or otherwise impose unnecessary burdens upon our community. What cannot be justified, I believe, is the concentrated attempt to exaggerate the levels and impact of industrial disputation in Australia. We have become accustomed to hearing the National Country Party speaking with two voices-at least two-on important issues. While some members of the National Country Party, including the Deputy Leader, have been going around the country fulminating about the disastrous state of industrial relations it is particularly pertinent for this House to note what the Leader of the National Country Party had to say recently on this issue. I shall quote from a Press release issued by the Deputy Prime Minister at the Japan Press centre in Tokyo on 21 January this year. He said: There is one aspect about Australia that is sometimes raised with me and indeed was raised at last week's discussions. That is the industrial relations situation in Australia. I acknowledge there are too many strikes in,-lj--fll-Iia, but the position in Australia is not US., Britain or a number of other large', \ Indiistrialised countries. In Australia strikes are generally of a short duration compared with other countries. Furthermore, in terms of man days lost, the impact of strikes in Australia is small compared with that of public holidays and normal holidays of workers. In summary, I believe that the industrial situation in Australia is given too much prominence by some people. That is what the Deputy Prime Minister has had to say in a Press release. To confirm the accuracy of what the Deputy Prime Minister said let me quote very briefly from the work Australian Industrial Relations, a recent book by Plowman, Deery and Fisher. At page 57 the book states: Most specialists agree . . . that the economic costs of strikes are greatly exaggerated. Certainly, compared to other costs, strike costs are insignificant . . . Industrial' accidents, alcoholism and the common cold account for more loss of work than strikes. I quote that material, I repeat, not to suggest that we should not be concerned about unnecessary strikes, not to suggest that we should not be concerned about trying to improve industrial relations in this country, for indeed we should be so concerned. My sole concern is to get these matters into proper perspective and to plead with all the men and women of good will in this country not to do things or to react in a way which will only heighten tensions in our community and do more to set Australian against Australian. Significant publicity has been given this day to the very large response in Auckland to the initiatives of the young lady Tania Harris. Because there will be people who will want to misrepresent what I am saying, let me make it quite clear that I am not questioning, nor do 1I have any reason to question, the integrity or motives of that young person. I am told this evening that there are moves to bring this person, Tania Harris, to Australia apparently with the idea that she should be the catalyst through which to stage the same sorts of demonstrations in this country. I believe if this is true it is most ill-advised. 1 believe the Deputy Prime Minister was right when he said that the industrial situation in Australia is given too much prominence by some people. An exercise such as that which is suggested to use Miss Harris in this way is something which, if the right honourable gentleman believes what he said in Tokyo, he should join me in deploring. My plea is that rather than support anything which can serve only to inflame emotions and increase the industrial relations temperature in this country all honourable members in this House should bend their best positive endeavours towards attempting to bring individuals and organisations together in constructive dialogue. Nothing is more short-sighted as serious as the p,osition in .the than perceiving an advantage and self-interest in the promotion of confrontation in this country.",46
159,Dr KLUGMAN ,ADJOURNMENT,"Prospect) (1O.49)-Tonight I wish to raise an issue which perturbs me somewhat, and that is admission into tertiary institutions. The figures I have in front of me relate to the position in New South Wales but there is no reason to believe that similar figures do not apply in other States. I believe a higher level of intelligence is needed for certain types of tertiary education courses. Therefore, I am disturbed by the university and college offers that were published in the Sydney Morning Herald on 13 February this year. The different institutions have released the lowest selection aggregate needed for entry into each course by applicants selected on the basis of results at the 1980 New South Wales Higher School Certificate examination. It isbased on the 10 best units of those applicants. It is depressing to see that, for example, at the Wollongong Institute of Education, a person who wants to do physical education-the standard for which I would not think would be very high compared to that for, say, secondary mathematicsrequires a level of 270 but for secondary maths it is only 230 points. If my interpretation of the results is correct, 230 is less than a pass, which if we take 50 per cent as the pass mark. So, the Wollongong Insitute of Education allows people who have failed possibly in everyone of their 10 subjects to enter to become secondary maths teachers. What can we expect from the children who are taught by those people after they graduate? At the Mitchell College of Advanced Education the Bachelor of Education (Secondary Maths) course has a cut-off level of 240, which is less than a pass on the average of the 10 subjects selected. At the Kuring-gai College of Advanced Education the level required for physical education is 310 points. A student has to get 70 more points to enter physical education than he has to get to become a secondary maths teacher. Surely all of us-perhaps even the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), who, because of his background, may have a prejudice against scientific subjects-would accept the proposition that there has been a failure on the part of the Australian education system to produce people who have been trained in a logical, scientific way to deal with the problems of our society. At the New South Wales Institute of Technology a level of 240 is required to do applied physics. Again, that is less than a pass if 250 is the pass mark. To get into the part time communications course, where .one can get involved in a brawl between those who believe in Marxist communication and those who believe in other sorts of communication, one needs 350 points. This is ridiculous. It depresses me that the courses to which I have referred are training courses for teachers. Many of the people who are being trained to be secondary maths and physics teachers are not particularly intelligent; they are people who have failed their Higher School Certificate examinations, who were unable to get a pass mark. What can we expect from students who are taught by them? How can we encourage people to take up mathematics, physics and some of the scientific subjects at the universities if they have been trained by people for whom they had contempt at school? The more intelligent students, when dealing with teachers who have gone through this form of training, will realise that the teachers are not up to scratch.",47

162,Mr SINCLAIR ,PAPERS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) It may be helpful if I outline the present procedure for granting a television translator follows: a draft planning proposal covering a particular area is prepared by a person or body cence or, under certain circumstances, by the Department of Communications; I, as Minister for Communications, consider the document and the advice of my Department and may then circulate it for comment to relevant broadcasting industry bodies; a final planning proposal is prepared, including comments received and responses from my Department where appropriate. On the basis of this proposal, I may then invite applications for a licence (or licences); the applications are judged Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, which may then grant a licence (or licences). In the case of a translator station, the Tribunal may consider the application without holding il public inquiry if there is only one applicant, and no submissions are received objecting to the grant of a licence. At this stage the draft planning Sherbrooke Shire has been circulated to industry bodies for comment, and responses have now been received by my Department for analysis. It should be pointed out that, having regard to my planning responsibilities under the Boadcasting and Television Act 1942, I could not properly proceed to invite applications for the licence concerned until this analysis of comments has been completed. It may weIl be, for example, that as a result of submissions received, the specifications applicable to the licences concerned and appearing in my notice inviting applications, may vary from those set out in the draft planning proposal. The analysis of comments is ,currently proceeding within my Department. However, at this time. I am unable to indicate a likely date by which construction of the translators might commence. (2) My Department has informed me that Channel 7, ' Commonwealth through the Federation of Commercial Television Stations, NA was officially invited to comment on this draft planning proposal. (Question No.IS7) In addition representatives from all Melbourne television stations were invited to and did attend a preliminary field study conducted by my Department. (3) (a) The modification of television receivers without UHF capability requires the installation of UHF to VHF down converters. A commercially available ""UHF set:top converter"" retails at approximately $80. Certain types of receivers may require internal modifications and/or additions at varying cost levels to enable UHF reception. (b) Good reception of UHF transmissions requires the installation of a UHF antenna. A cost of $80-$90 could be expected to be incurred for the complete installation of a new antenna of this type. This figure could be reduced if the existing VHF antenna hardware is utilised. Costs for the UHF antenna only 'range from approximately $25-$35. A diplexer unit which allows the use of VHF and UHF antennae with a common feedline retails at approximately $15. area still be unable to receive (4) It is expected that several small pockets of population in the Dandenong ranges area will still be unable to receive adequate service following the establishment of the UHF translators.

Briefly, it is as Of the estimated 20,000 persons residing in the service area of the proposed translators, on present indications it may be that 1,500 will still not receive an acceptable service. interested in acquiring a liAluminium Industry: Financial Reporting (Question No.163) Mr Humphreys asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 3 December 1980: (I) Do Government guidelines into foreign investment in Australia state that Australian branches of overseas incorporated companies should disclose publicly the same information with respect to their Australian operations as is required of Australian companies. at a public inquiry by the (2) Has his attention been drawn to the report in the Brisbane Sunday Mail of 17 August 1980 on the subject of financial reporting in the aluminium industry.

163,Mr HOWARD ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) In his statement to the House of Representatives on 1 April 1976 concerning foreign investment in Australia, the then Treasurer stated that the Government believes that the Australian branches of overseas incorporated companies should disclose publicly the same information in respect of their Australian operations as is required from Australian public, listed public or private companies as the case may be. More recently, on 27 August 1980, the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs said in his second reading speech on the Companies Bill 1980 that he would be asking officers to take up with State officers the need to ensure that Australian branches of overseas incorporated companies disclose publicly as much information as Australian incorporated companies. (2) Yes. (3) Queensland Alumina Limited is an Australian incorporated company and not a branch of an overseas incorporated company and as such is obliged to submit accounts in accordance with the Companies Act and on the same basis as Australian owned companies. Bankcard Interest Rates Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 3 December 1980: (I) Is it a fact that Bankcard interest rates, which are quoted at 18 per cent per annum, are compounded at a daily rate with the result that the true rate of interest is 19.7 per cent per annum.

To be tabled Mr HOWARD - The answer to the honourable early 1981 member's question is as follows: (1) This Government has already implemented a wide range of measures to assist disabled persons. Most recently, in the 1980-81 Budget the Government announced its intention (Question No. 298) to support financially the observance of the International Year of Disabled Persons and its decision to implement a' number of initiatives to assist disabled persons. Further initiatives in relation to the disabled will be considered during the preparation of the 1981-82 Budget. The recommendations relating to taxation concessions contained in the report by the National Women's Advisory Council will be considered in that context. (2) The information needed to make costings for the individual recommendations in the Council's report is not readily available. Taken together, however, the recommendations would involve a substantial cost, which makes it all the more important that they be considered In the overall budgetary context.

167,Mr LES JOHNSON ,REVIEWS STUDIES OR INQUIRIES COMPLETED,"the Minister for the principal matters dealt with at Transport, upon notice, on 4 December 1980: Has the Government accepted the recommendations contained in the report by the National Women's Advisory Council entitled 'My Child Was Born Disabled' to (a) cause modification to all public transport to ensure that the disabled and their families can carry essential equipment, (b) remove physical barriers to the travel of disabled persons to enable Disabled Children them to travel as freely as the non-disabled in the community, (Question No. 318) (c) provide such facilities as (i) entrances without steps in all public buildings, (ii) kerbless parking areas with sufficient space beside the vehicle to allow movement into and out of a wheelchair, (iii) a contributable transport scheme either .as a (A) taxi co-operative system or (B) government-subsidised taxi service for the disabled and (iv) unisex toilets for disabled adults for those disabled people who cannot use toilets without assistance.",53
168,Mr HUNT ,REVIEWS STUDIES OR INQUIRIES COMPLETED,"The answer' to the honourable for a specific tax deducmember's question is as follows: As the provision and co-ordination of public transport services is Pfi-!lrily the responsibility of the State Governments, the question of whether the recommendations contained in the report are to be implemented is a matter for the various State Governments to determine. As far. as my own portfolio is concerned I am able to advise the honourable member of the following existing measures that are in line with recommendations made in the report. Recently designed airports incorporate facilities to assist handicapped persons, and existing airport terminals are constantly monitored to ensure that future buildings will accommodate suitable and efficient facilities. Commonwealth buildings at airports also provide lifts and ramps for vertical transfer. Step free entrances are provided to terminal buildings, and separate car parking bays have been designated for handicapped people. Ramped kerbs and cross-overs are also provided. Sydney and Tullamarine terminals have individual toilet facilities for male and female disabled persons. Subsequent terminals have also been provided with these facilities, but the current policy is to provide unisex toilets for the disabled. Future proposals for airport terminals include additional facilities such as audio telephones, and seating suitable for both able and disabled people. Both the domestic and international airlines provide various forms of assistance to disabled passengers. TAA have advised that in addition to normal facilities provided including wheelchairs at airports, mechanically operated lifting equipment suitable for lifting disabled passengers on to all aircraft types is normally provided where aero bridge or other arrangements are not available. Facilities are also provided to advise downline abled passengers to ensure wheelchairs and other assistance are available on arrival at destinations. booking system has provision for including details relating to the specific disabilities of passengers in order that the airlines can provide appropriate services. Recent procedures and training emphasis in ensuring cabin staff are familiar with the handling of disabled persons in emergencies. For international air travellers, sensitive to the needs of disabled passengers, particularly in view of the long haul routes the airline services. Assistance adopted by Qantas includes gathering mation on a disabled passenger's condition, on a confidential basis, in order to supply the most appropriate assistance, special arrangements for wheelchair and stretcher passengers, Commodity Beef. frozcnBon.·in. hindquart.rs. crops/ forequarters Bon.I.... hindquarter cuts .tc (.xcl. bris· k.ts) Bonel.... primal cuts (rump strip etc) Bon.I ... , other (incJ. manufacturing & briskets) Total Beef Mutton. fresh. chilled or frozcnCarcasses and sides, bone-in Cut·meats. bon.less Total Mutton Edible offals, fresh. chilled or froz.n. cattle Full cream milk. dried Butter, not canned Wheat. unmilled. in bulk RiccOth.r than brown Milled. whole. long grain crew training in assistance for the disabled with lectures from the Guide Dogs Association, Paraplegic and Quadraplegic Associations, and appropriate meals for passengers with special dietary requirements. As part of the Government's policy to assist disabled persons wherever possible, I recently met with representatives of the Australian Council for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled and the International Year of Disabled Persons to discuss their specific problem with domestic air travel. As a result I will be seeking the airlines' cooperation with these organisations to alleviate as much as possible the problems associated with airline travel by disabled persons. . As far as the Australian National Railways is concerned, it would be very difficult, and in some cases impracticable, to modify all existing roIling stock and railway buildings to conform with the recommendations. However, the requirements of the disabled are given consideration in the design of new rolling stock and buildings. Further, I am advised that small folding wheelchairs have recently been made available for use lower telephone booths, by disabled passengers on interstate trains. The question of the most effective method of providing transport services to the handicapped is one that is being examined, or has been examined, by a number of States with the assistance of Commonwealth funding under the Transport Planning and Research Program. Under this program, all States have been assisted on a dollar-for-dollar basis in the funding of planning and research projects, including a n,:mber related to the travel needs of the handicapped. ports of the needs of disTrade with the USSR The airlines' computer (Question No. 334) Mr Kerin asked the Minister for Trade and Resources, upon notice, on 4 December 1980: have also involved greater What have been the (a) items, (b) quantity and (c) value of trade in agricultural commodities to the USSR in each of the last 5 years.

Mr Les MCMahon asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 4 December 1980: (I) Has his attention been drawn to reports in the Sydney Morning Herald of 22 August 1980, which quote United Nations sources as indicating that Israel has moved extra troops and artillery into Lebanon. (2) Is there any substance to the reports; if so, can he give any further information regarding this incursion into Lebanon. (3) Will he give an assurance that the Government will make known to the Government of Israel its strong condemnation of such incursions. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The article on Israeli military movements in Southern Lebanon which was published in the Sydney Morning Herald on 22 August appears to have been based on news bulletins issued by the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) from its headquarters in Naqouni in Southern Lebanon. I have no reason to doubt that the article is substantially correct. (2) The UNIFIL news bulletins referred to above indicated that between 18 and 20 August approximately 50 artillery pieces, one tank, 10 half tracks, 8 armoured personnel carriers, 49 assorted vehicles and the Israeli Defence Forces were sighted in the Christian enclave by UN observers. I have nothing to add to these reports.

While the Australian Government has deplored terrorist attacks whenever and wherever they have occurred, we consider that the actions of the Israeli Defence Forces in Lebanon constitute a violation of that country's territorial integrity, and can only make efforts towards restoring peace in the Middle East more difficult.

Exemption does not, however, extend to general purpose goods of the kind in question purchased by handicapped persons.

179,Mr HOWARD ,AUSTRALIAN EXPORTS OF AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES TO THE USSR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The desirability of maintaining a register of foreign investment proposals was previously considered by the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Board has again reviewed the matter in the light of the honourable member's question. The Board's advice, with which I agree, is that procedures requiring the compulsory publication in a register of all foreign 291, investment proposals would have a number of serious disad508· "" vantages whereas the principal benefits that might be 499"" "" expected to result from such a register are for all practical 522 purposes being achieved by the present practices followed in respect of foreign investment proposals. The following con­ siderations are relevant to this matter: the value of a register posal involves, to a significant interest; many of the cases coming before the Government would not be in this category but mercially sensitive proposals could be adversely affected were made public; disclosure of such information could reduce the high level of co-operation with tal importance in the administration policy and thus impair the vestment review process which depends substantially on the protection of commercial information supplied in con­ fidence by the parties concerned; the present procedures of the FIRB are designed to ensure that in cases where there is a broader national interest sufficient information knowledge through the media or announced by the parties to enable adequate opportunities for public comment or the views of third parties to be communicated to the Board dur­ ing the process of consideration fore any decisions are reached by the Government; it is also the practice of the FIRB to call for appropriate steps to be taken to ensure equate opportunity for participation foreign companies or to bid for shares or property that are the subject of a foreign investment proposal; foreign investment procedures furthermore involve wide­ spread consultation with relevant Federal and State Government Departments and authorities so that all sig­ nificant aspects of proposals that are relevant to consider­ ations of the national interest are considered by the appro­ priate authorities; in cases where there is considered to be a need to suspend consideration of a proposal to ensure that additional oppor­ tunity is available for consideration other potentially interested parties, it is the practice for an interim order to be issued to freeze a proposal for up to 90 days for this purpose. The FIRB and the Government will keep this matter under periodic review in the light of experience in the administration of foreign investment policy. Export of Historic Aircraft",58
