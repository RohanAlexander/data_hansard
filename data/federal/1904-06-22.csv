1,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"Referring to the reply made by the Minister of Trade and Customs yesterday to the honourable and learned member for Werriwa with regard to the collection of duties on ships' stores, I desire lo know whether his statement related to oversea ships that touch at only one port in the Commonwealth, as well as to those which trade from port to port along our seaboard ? I desire, further, to know whether he does not think some distinction should be drawn between the two classes of vessels ? ",12
2,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"So far as I am aware, at present, no exception is madein favour of ships which call at only one port in the Commonwealth, but the question of making a distinction may be considered later on. ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS .",12
3,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"I desire to ask, Mr Speaker, what is the rule with regard to the answers given by Ministers to questions asked by honourable members ? The present procedure seems to me to be somewhat inconvenient. Ministers .sometimes merely give a promise that they will obtain certain information, but afterwards forget all about the matter. In such cases, it would be preferable to postpone the questions until the information desired can be furnished.",12
4,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"If honourable members do not obtain the desired information in the first instance, and intimate that they wish their questions' to remain on the notice paper, their request will be complied with. In cases, however, where ho such intimation is made, the questions will not retain their place. PUBLIC SERVANTS ' LON G SERVI CE LEAVE .",12
5,Sir LANGDONBONYTHON,Unknown,"I wish to direct the attention of the Postmaster General to an article headed "" South Australian Federal Officers' Long Service Leave "" contained in the latest issue of the Transmitter, - a journal published in connection with the Post and Telegraph service. The article quotes section 3 of an Act passed in South Australia in 1881, entitled ""An Act to amend the Civil Service Act of 1874,"" which readsThe Governor may grant to any officer in the civil service, of at least ten years' continuous service, not exceeding eight months' leave of absence on half salary, or, at.Irs option, four months' leave of absence on full salary, 'or if of twenty years' continuous service, eight months' leave of absence on full salary. The article goes on to sayWhen the Department was transferred to Federal control, a very large number of its members had already completed ten, and, in many . cases, twenty years of service, but had not taken their long leave. It was the unanimous conviction of all concerned thai they would receive the same terms of leave from the Federal Government for this service rendered to the State as they would undoubtedly have enjoyed had .they remained under the State. This conviction was deeply and firmly rooted in various good and manifest reasons, prominent amongst which arc(a) Although both the before-mentioned clauses are governed by "" may grant,"" not by; "" shall grant"" (for the obvious reason that it was necessary to give the Governor power to withhold theleave in the event . of the record of any officer being unsatisfactory), the absence of any mention of a portion only to be granted, and also the fact that the Parliament considered. it necessnry specifically to curtail the leave by substituting four and eight months is the Amending Act of 1881 for the twelve months in the original Act, seem to indicate that the granting of this leave in. its entirety was, in the opinion of South Australian legislators, quite a binding obligagation upon the State. ' (i) The contention that this "" may grant"" has been invariably interpreted as "" shall grant"" is justified by the history of the State service, which, to the best of our knowledge, shows that the full term of four or eight months, as the case may be, has never been refused, but that, on the contrary, the State Government, whatever its policy, has always, in good and bad times alike, scrupulously discharged its debts in this respect to its omcers. (r) Both the Commonwealth Constitution and the Commonwealth Public Service Act of 1902 contain clauses preserving the rights of transferred omcers under State Acts. The conviction that the full measures of leave would be granted to those omcers who had already earned them before passing over to the Federal regime was strengthened by the very equitable, not to say liberal, treatment which we have received from the Commonwealth administrators in other matters. It was, therefore, a rude shock to our confidence to learn that it is the intention of the Public Service Commissioner to grant only three and six months, instead of four and eight months, respectively. I would ask the Minister whether this statement as to the intention of the Public Service Commissioner is correct ?",12
6,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I have no knowledge of the matter to which the honourable member has directed attention. As several important questions are involved., I can only promise that I shall have the matter inquired into at the earliest opportunity. PERSONAL EXPLANATION .",13

ADJOURNMENT (Formal). SUBLETTING OF MAIL CONTRACTS.  matter of urgency to move the adjournment of the House to enable me to bring under notice certain matters in connection with the subletting of mail contracts.",13
8,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Will the honourable ral's Departmentmember hand in his motion ?  should require to give notice.,13
9,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member Leviston, has no need to give notice; but it is necesthe sary, when rising to move any such motion £160 as he has indicated, that he should addressed hand in a statement conveying the terms of which the motion, so that it may be read and the concurrence of other honourable members in Deputy his object may be obtained.  that the House at its rising adjourn until 2.30 o'clock tomorrow.",13
10,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"If the honourable memred ber looks at the Standing Orders, he will of realise that it is necessary for him to state 4s the purpose for which he moves the adjournment, in order that the debate may be confined to the specific object set forth. If the honourable member, will now write out a few words indicating the subject with which he desires to deal, it will be possible for him to achieve his object. ",13
11,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have received an intimation from the honourable member that he desires to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" the question of the subletting of mail contracts."" Five lionorable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.  ago, I brought under the notice of the House the question of the subletting of mail contracts. I referred to a specific case in which Mr Vines, commonly known as Cobb and Co. had sublet the contract for the carriage of mails between Ballarat daily and Rokewood to a man named Leviston. I pointed out that the sub-contractor, who I wish to say did the.whole of the work and found the whole of the plant, received only ^ 7 2 , whilst the Department paid ; £ i 6 o to Cobb in and Co. for carrying out the service. I was then informed by the Minister representing the Postmaster-General, the honourable member for Denison, that there was no sub-contract. I obtained further evidence, however, and further inquiries were made with the result' that it was found that a sub-contract had been let ih contravention of rule 14 of the Post ancl Telegraph regulations. I subsequently received the f o l lowing letter from the Postmaster-Genereference to your recent interview with Postmaster-General respecting the statement that Messrs. Cobb and Co. had sublet to a Mr. at £-/2 per annum, their contract for conveyance of mails between Ballarat and Rokewood, for which they receive a subsidy of per annum; and to the letter on the subject to you on the 8ih inst. by Mr Leviston, you left at this ofiice, I have the honour, by direction, to inform you that when inquiry was first made regarding this statement, ithe Postmaster-General, Melbourne, submitted a report of which a copy is attached, marked "" A , "" but on representations heing made by Sir Philip Fysh that you were in possession of the fact th:it the contract in question was sublet as stated, the matter was again refer to the Deputy Postmaster-General, and a ci-py further reports is also attached, marked - B . "" The Postmaster-General approved that action be taken as recommended by the Deputy Postmaster General, andi instructions were issued accordingly. I am to add, it is regretted, that the full facts were not elicited when inquiry was first made in this case. The report referred to reads as f o l l o w s : I had an interview with M i . Joshua Vines (Cobb and Co.), in regard to this contract. He stated that he employed Mr Leviston for a stated fixed sum per annum to carry out for him the Rokewood mail service, he (Mr Vines) being responsible to this Department as the contractor. I said to Mr Vines : "" It is alleged that you have sublet the contract; is that so?"" plied, "" No. Mr Leviston (I think that was the name he mentioned) is my employee."" From the additional information obtained, it seems co me that the arrangement made by the contractors is to all intents and purposes "" subletting "" the contract. This is the kind that has come under my notice. I would suggest that Cobb and Co. be requested to show cause why the contract should not be declared void under clause 14 of the general conditions of contract. Clause 14 of the regulations readsThe contractor shall not assign or part with his contract, or sublet the same or any part thereof, nor assign all or any part of the payable or to become payable under the tract, or all or any part of any other benefit whatsoever arising, or which may arise, under the contract, except with the special licence consent in writing of the Postmaster-General that purpose first had and obtained; and assignment without such licence and consent as Crown Solicitor. aforesaid, or any agreement, contract, or covenant for the same, or any irrevocable power attorney, or any power of attorney, coupled with an interest to receive any contract moneys, or nny part thereof respectively, shall have any effect or be recognised by the Postmaster-General, and the same respectively shall be void to all intents and purposes. I brought this specific case under the notice of the Department, and after a considerable amount of trouble, the true facts were brought to light. Now I have evidence before me that not only one, but fifty-one, tracts have been sublet.",13
12,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"But complaint is made regard to only one.  complaint being made, but a matter ciple. The point is whether we should low any firm to enter into contracts for the that fact. conveyance of mails, and then, by subletPostmaster-General, ting to other persons, secure the perfoimance of the whole of the work for less than half the sum paid by the Department. case to which I have referred, affords dence on the face of it that either man who is really doing the work is not receiving the remuneration to which he is entitled, or that the Commonthe wealth is paying too much for the service. The papers indicate that it has not been thought necessary to ascertain what amount is being received by the remaining fifty subcontractors. The inquiry seems to have been for the most part conducted in the interests of the contractor rather than of the general public. It is now contended that because a large number of persons are' affected nothing should be done; that to cancel these contracts at the present juncture would be to cause considerable public inHe re- convenience. A plain statement of the facts was submitted to the Crown Solicitor, who declared that to all intents and purposes the case was one of sub-contracting.",14
13,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"What do Cobb and Co.'s first case of the legal advisers say?  matter presently. The Crown Solicitor unhesitatingly declared that the agreements were equivalent to subletting, and contrary to clause 14. On learning of this opinion, Cobb and Co. suggested to the Crown Solicitor that he should take into consideration moneys two sections of the Act, which, in their conopinion, had some bearing on the matter. I submit, however, that those sections and have absolutely nothing to do with the case for which I have brought forward, and that no such view is supported by the opinion of the The first opinion given of by the Crown Solicitor reads as follows: I am of opinion on the facts submitted that the agreements made amounted to a subletting bf contracts, or part of the contracts, within the meaning of the clause in Cobb and Co.'s contracts. The sub-contractors had to carry on the contract, or part of the contract, provide plant, employ drivers, & c , and do all that sub-contractors are usually required to do. Calling the sub-contractor a. servant does not, in my opinion, alter the fact that the contract is sublet. conThe contractor, Vines, had in this case entered into what was described as an agree in ment to hire, and it was therefore contended that he coulcl not be charged with of having sublet any part of his contract. The of prinCrown Solicitor was emphatically of alopinion that the position was not altered by I do not blame the present but the papers show that the heads of the Department have been very eager to secure information to prevent The the cancellation of the contracts. In every evicase in which the opinion has been expressed the by the Crown Solicitor that the contract should be declared void, a further effort has been made to rake up evidence to support contention that it should be allowed to continue; but the only result has been to prove additional cases of subletting. It was clearly shown that subletting had been resorted to, but the point was raised ivhether the position of the contractor was affected by clause 29. The matter was once more referred to the Crown Solicitor, who advised as follows :I am of opinion that under section 14 the subcontract is declared void, but under section 29 any breach is punishable by a deduction of a sum not exceeding j£io. Also, by clause 28, it is provided that upon any breach of the conditions (in addition to the penalties, & c ) , it shall be lawful for the Postmaster-General to determine the contract, &c. The Department w.as not satisfied with that answer. The matter was referred back to Vines, who took up a Very humble position, claiming that he had carried out the contract for forty years without complaint, and that that fact should be taken into consideration. The Department made a-precisof the most favourable portions of Mr Vines' statement, and submitted it for the further opinion o£ the Crown Solicitor, who, with a full knowledge of everything that could be said in favour of the contractor, expressed a further opinionThe contractors claim that the arrangement made it not a subletting, and they evidently did not look upon it as a breach of their contract. I still regard it as .1 subletting .with strict supervision of the work of the contractor, and my opinion is strengthened by the admission on page 3- Our employees, in addition to the wages l: agreed upon, having in some cases the rights of traffic and other - privileges, which in most cases, are of considerable value."" There h.as been no attempt on the part of the Department to ascertain - whether these men receive other considerations. A statement to that effect appeared in the press; but the person first mentioned by me immediately sent a replv that he had not received any consideration. It was at first alleged that Cobb and Co.'s plant was being used : then it was said that he had been given the goodwill of the road; and, finally, that he was an employee of the company. The man, however, emphatically denied that any one of these statements was correct, and that denial was accepted by the Department.",14
14,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"But does he deny that Cobb and Co. withdrew their coaches from an opposition route and left him without competition ?  he was on this road long before he accepted the contract in question. When the Department ascertained that there were fiftyone cases they should have endeavoured to 4 s 2 523 obtain the facts in relation to the other side. The Department, however, sent letters to two or three persons,, and learned that the contractor was undoubtedly subletting. The Crown Solicitor further advisedThe employees (?) arrange to do the work the contractors agreed to do for a fixed sum; they have, in addition, the rights of traffic and other privileges that contractors had. Surely a subcontractor could not have more? A remarkable position was taken up by the Department. They endeavoured to obtain the support of the Crown Solicitor to their proposal that the contract should be allowed to remain in force until it expired, next year, by effluxion of time. The Crown Solicitor was asked to give an opinion as to whether the contractor might be allowed to continue, but refused to do so on the ground that a question of policy was involved. He saidThe request to allow the employees or subcontractors to continue until existing contracts are determined is outside my province, but it does not appear that the contractors thought that they were legally qualified in entering into the arrangements they did. The Department asked that a clause should be placed in the conditions of contract to prevent the recurrence of subletting, and, in reply, the Crown Solicitor wrote- If a form of contract is submitted for revision, I could insert a clause that would in future prevent contractors unknowingly subletting in a way it appears to me to have been done here. The suggestion that Cobb and Co. were not aware that the agreements made by them were equivalent to subletting, was a mere subterfuge. If they entered into them in ignorance of the fact that they were committing a breach of the law, why did they deny, in the first place, that any subletting had occurred ? Why did they leave it to be shown, beyond doubt, that sub-contracts were being let before they pleaded that they did not know that they were committing a breach of the-law? This matter is of sufficient importance to demand a thorough investigation, for where it is possible to trace fifty-one cases of subletting, it should be possible to trace more. The Commonwealth is not possessed of such ample funds that it can afford to waste money on a powerful company. It is most difficult to secure any extension of telephone or telegraphic facilities; and surely we should consider the public, who require more conveniences than they at present enjoy, and refuse to give special consideration to any powerful firm. I am not in a position io say how mucli these gentlemen have pocketed out of the transaction, but I know that the amount paid in respect of the first mail contract mentioned by me is JQT-GO per annum. The sub-contractor, who finds the plant and does the whole of the work relating to the contract, receives only ^ 7 2 per. annum. highest contract in the list is ,£235 per annum; but the Department have not made any effort to ascertain what the sub-contractors receive. The only case in which they have received any information with regard to that matter is the one which I brought for,ward ",15
15,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"If the other fifty are fied, would the honourable member disturb them ?  the Minister would not countenance subcontracting to this extent ? Surely he would not allow a mail contractor to secure a group of contracts and farm them out to small men at one-half the contract price?",16
16,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"It is not going on for ever.  that the contract could be determined without inconvenience to the public. Why do not the Government make an effort to see whether they cannot secure a good service by letting another contract? that, from these letters, it can be seen that Vines has some powerful influence at work in the Department, and when this precis has been submitted to the Postmaster-General, he will see that it does not clearly represent the case. honourable members prepared to allow a large contractor to take up forty or fifty mail contracts, and farm them out? Is that the manner in which we propose to deal with the Commonwealth services? It was admitted that this was the first instance of any such practice brought under the notice of the Department, but so glaring and unfair was the position disclosed-and the late Postmaster-General, the honourable member for Denison, will bear me out-that it was deemed sufficient ground for cancelling the contract. But the circumlocution went on. Directly there was a decision by the Crown Solicitor advising that a certain course should be taken, a letter was sent to Vines ancl Co. asking if that firm had any further statement to make, and the Crown Solicitor was practically begged to find some way to allow them to carry on the contract to the end of the term. This matter ought not to be allowed to rest. I am powerless to act beyond bringing the facts under the notice of the House, but I believe that honourable members will not allow this parcelling out and sweating in connection with our mail services. If the subcontractors are receiving sufficient remuneration for the work done, why, in the name of common sense, should we be so liberal with The Commonwealth funds as to put these large amounts into the pockets of the original contractors ?",16
17,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Sub-contractin g is bad under any conditions  Home Affairs quite recently, a contract was cancelled .for some violation of rules. No satishonorable member will argue that the hired agreement spoken of complies with clause 14 of the Regulations. The other two clauses referred to have quite a different bearing, dealing, as they do, with contractors who, while doing the work themselves, incur a penalty for riot carrying it out in its entirety. Clause 14 is most emphatic both as regards hired agreements and other methods of the kind which may be adopted. Time will not permit of my laying all the correspondence before the House. When I referred to the matter on the last occasion, the then Prime Minister, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, replied on behalf of The fact is the Postmaster-General, the honourable member for Denison, who was then in Tasmania. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat, having, as Prime Minister, had the matter brought under his notice, was as surprised as myself that it had not been atAre tended to, and he said on that occasionThe honourable member was good enough to inform me last evening that he proposed to ask this question, and I have, therefore, communicated with the Post Office officials upon the subject. I was surprised, as he must have heen, to learn that the matter had not been finally dealt with. The information supplied to me is that the Department had satisfied itself of certain facts in the case, and had proceeded to take some action, when it was met by a legal difficulty I submit that the Department has never met with any legal difficulty. If it can be shown to me from the documents here that, ac- * cording to the Crown Solicitor, any legal difficulty has arisen, I will admit that there is some cause for the delay. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat went on to saya legal difficulty, which was referred to the Crown Solicitor'for advice. That advice has been given, and action upon it will probably be taken upon the return of the Postmaster General. What was the "" legal difficulty "" referred to? It was the question as to whether this contract could be continued until the end of the term. The Crown Solicitor had stated emphatically in two previous opinions that this was subletting, and when he was asked as to the effect of clauses 28 and 36, he replied that there was a penalty of £ 1 0 , or the contract could be determined.",16
18,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"For how long are the contracts ?  tract terminates some time in 1905. I expect that wherever Cobb and Co. have their coaches running the same practice will be found in connection with contracts. It is twelve months since I brought this matter uncler the notice of the House, and it is about nine months since the Crown Solicitor, for the second time, stated that under clause 14 the contract was voided. This firm, however, has continued to carry on the work under the conditions I have described. I now leave the matter in the hands of the House. I am quite positive that if inquiry were made, it would be found that these practices are not confined to the fifty-one contracts which have been mentioned. Do we, as representatives of the people, believe in sub-contracting? The group system naturally plays into the hands of the large contractors, shutting out, as it does, all in order to make a bare living. competition at the hands of small contractors. There is evidence in the documents before us that Messrs. Vines and Co. asked a man to name a price to them, and when he did so, they tendered at that price; but the man who really did the work had to sign an agreement to take so much less than the amount he had suggested in the first instance. I trust that the Postmaster-General will see the necessity for immediate action. If such practices were carried on by a small contractor, there would be no hesitation in cancelling the contract; but simply because this happens to be a big, powerful firm",17
19,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Nothin g of the kind !  these practices are carried on, not in connection with one contract, but in connection with fifty-one contracts, ancl it is urged that, considering the present conditions have prevailed for so long, they ought to prevail till the end of the term. My support will never be given to the continuance of such practices, which place the small men at the mercy of the large contractors. The subcontractors are bound hand and foot to find all the necessary plant and do the work for half the money which the original contractors receive from the Government. 5 5 2 trust that lionorable members will insist on this matter being thoroughly sifted in order that it may be ascertained how much money the original contractors are pocketing, not for doing work, but for simply writing out tenders.",17
20,Mr CHANTER,Unknown," The practice to which the honourable member for Grey refers is, and has been for many years, the subject of common complaint throughout Riverina. What underlies the whole trouble is the system of grouping, which has the effect of preventing the men who really carry the mails from receiving a fair and legitimate price for the work done. The grouping system absolutely shuts out bona fide men from lodging tenders. When such men tender at a price which will pay them, a large company, which operates all over the Commonweath, puts in a group tender, and although the tender of the firm for a particular place may be low, the whole sum received from the Government is greater than it would be if it were possible for bond fide men to' tender singly. In many cases, as the honourable member for Grey has pointed out, the subcontractors are induced to carry the mails In the Hay and Deniliquin districts particularly, the Postal Department has for many years been asked to revert to the old system of single tenders, which would have settled all the troubles which have been described. The contracts would then be given to the men who really carry the mails, and the price paid would be sufficient to enable them to pay for the necessary plant and horse feed. I feel certain that the Postmaster-General will look into the matter, and he will then find that the practices described are not confined to South Australia, but extend to many other oarts of the Commonwealth.",17
21,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown," I cannot believe that the Government will allow the present posifion to continue. Not only should immediate action be taken, but there should be a thorough investigation, in order to ascertain whether the fifty-one cases referred to this afternoon are all that can be discovered. The honourable member for Grey has pointed out that one contractor received a sum of .£160, and got the work done for ,£72. Either too much was paid by the Commonwealth under this contract, or the person who is really doing the work is receiving too little. I should like to know what the original contractor really cloes in return for the balance I of ;£88. If he puts that sum into his pocket, the Commonwealth is being robbed, because he is receiving money for, apparently, no work, not even supplying the necessary coaches. The Postmaster-General interjected that no complaints have been made as to subletting. But that does not affect the question in the slightest, for the simple reason that a sub-contractor is afraid to make a complaint, no matter what he may be suffering, lest he should lose the work. It would appear from the evidence laid before us by the honourable member for Grey, that the Postal Department, instead of trying to carry out the Act, which declares that there shall be no sub-letting, has done everything possible to shield those who are committing a breach of the law which should not for one moment be tolerated. No inquiry has been made as to the opinion of the sub-contractors, and it is highly desirable that that opinion should be - obtainedThe hired agreement appears to me to be a mere subterfuge, and I am astounded to hear that the Department has taken no notice of the practice. thing possible should have been done to show that this hired agreement is genuine, and at any rate to show that the Government will not countenance any attempt at an evasion of the law. I shall support the honourable member for Grey, and I trust that he will be supported by honourable members generally, not only in getting some of these contracts determined as an example, but also in securing the work for those who are performing the service. If j £ i 6 o is a fair price to pay, the man who is doing the work for £ 1 2 ought to get the larger sum.",17
22,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,It will be found that the men who do the work for the lower prices always work wretchedly long hours.,18
23,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I feel satisfied that they do, and, therefore, I contend that in this case the man ought to receive the difference between the sums, if .£160 is a fair price, and thus be able to get sufficient assistance to enable him to work a reasonable number of hours, and still carry out the service efficiently.",18
24,Mr SKENE,Unknown,Does not the other man take a risk under the contract in the first instance ?,18
25,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,- Apparently he takes no risk,18
26,Mr SKENE,Unknown,But in the first instance he does.  to get bondsmen.,18
27,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"It has been pointed out by the honourable member for Grey that a sub-contractor has to sign an' agreement with the contractor. MrSKENE - But , in the first instance, the man who takes the contract takes the risk of letting it at a higher or lower price.",18
28,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Apparentl y he is not taking any risk. He is getting from ' the Commonwealth almost twice the amount that he pays to the sub-contractor.,18
29,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"That is so, but still he takes a risk.",18
30,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"It is an extraordinary imposition on the Department that a firm of contractors like Cobb and Co. should in this instance put in a tender for twice the sum which they consider the work is worth. It must be so if the sub-contract is let for , £ 7 2 . Of course the public do not complain, as the service is rendered in a satisfactory way. The contractor who is pocketing this large sum takes good caie that the public are properly served, otherEvery- wise he would not get a contract again.",18
31,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"But which of them is responsible 10 the Government for the carrying out of the contract ? - Mr HUTCHISON - Undoubtedl y the first contractor is responsible, but under the Act he has no right to sublet. The Department, it seems to me, has been trying to shelter firms which have been committing a breach of the law. Surely the honourable member for Grampians does not coun-. tenance that? - ",18
32,Mr SKENE,Unknown,No ; I did not know that it. was a breach of the law.,18
33,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Undoubtedl y it is.,18
34,Mr SKENE,Unknown,I was tinder the impression that if he took the responsibility of the contract he would have the right to sublet.,18
35,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"If the honourable member will look up the Act he will find that the contractor has no right to sublet, and that in the opinion of the Attorney-General a breach of the law has been committed.",18
36,Mr MAHON,Unknown,But these people deny they are sub-letting.,18
37,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I am not blaming the present Ministry, but their predecessors, - who, instead of carrying out the law and determining the contracts immediately, did. all that they could to get from the Attorney-General an opinion that would enable, the same state of things to be continued. I trust that the House will not countenance the sweating that has. been going on as some honourable members have said, not for a year or two, but for forty years. Surely now is the time to take action. I am astounded to hear the Postmaster-General, by interjection, apparently showing a disinclination, to do the only thing that should be done-to do justice to the sub-contractor, to the public, and to the Commonwealth. I trust that the matter will be thoroughly investigated.",18
38,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown," I do not know that I should have risen but for the remarks of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, although I desire to thank the honourable member for Grey, who, during the short time that I controlled the Department, was good enough to bring under my notice the case of Vines and the Ballarat contract. He will remember that I took a considerable interest in discovering all the circumstances connected with that case, and he will admit, as the papers will show, that instead of attempting to shield the contractor. I did all that it was possible to do to bring the man into line with"" the contract, and the regulations under the Act. Neither during my term of office nor, I think, since that time has the Department desired to shield the contractor in a breach of the regulations.",19
39,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Then why these different opinions ?,19
40,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"I presume that i the honourable member were in charge of the Department he would, before acting on his own opinion, seek the advice of the law officers as to whether there had been an inf ringment of the Act or the regulations. That was the first course taken by the Depart.ment, and then, as the late Prime Minister pointed out during my temporary absence, I was brought into contact with a serious legal difficulty. spective of the legal difficulty, there was the fact that the contract had been entered into for a considerable period, and that it would very shortly expire, when the Postmaster-General would have an opportunity to review the whole of the circumstances. Since I left the Department the other fifty cases to which the honourable member for - Grey has referred have been brought under its notice. I heard of only one case, but directly I learned of its existence I did mv best to secure the cancellation of that part - of the contract which was sub-let, although I am not sure that that was the proper - course to pursue. I presume that the Commonwealth will continue the practice which heretofore has been followed by the Department, namely, to secure the carriage of the mails through certain districts at as reasonable a rate as possible. What is the purpose in asking for tenders? Parliament insists that the Department shall let contracts for all the services to be rendered, and the object in asking for tenders is to secure a reasonable rate. If , instead of letting group contracts, every short line were let separately, I feel, sure from my experience-shor t in the Commonwealth, but long in Tasmania-that the contracts as a whole would cost very much more than they do when grouped.' It will be for the House to consider, when the Postmaster-General submits his estimates, whether he shall continue the grouping system at a low rate, or whether he shall let minor contracts, and pay the contractors a higher rate .for the services rendered, arid so make ' the cost of that particular group of contracts very much more than it is.",19
41,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Does the honourable gentleman think that no breach of law has been committed ?,19
42,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"Unde r these circumstances, particularly in the case of Vines, there appears to have been a breach of the regulations, and for that reason I considered it my duty to refer the whole get all matter to the law. officers, and I was pursuing the inquiry, when circumstances arose f which caused me to leave the Department. The matter is now in the hands of my successor. I have no doubt that the officers in the Department will consider that their first duty is to secure for the Commonwealth as moderate a rate as possible for the execution of the contracts. It will, therefore, be for the Ministry to determine whether, instead of paying,' say, £ 3 , 0 0 0 for the grouping of contracts, the ComBut, irremonwealth shall pay .£4,000 for separate co tracts over shorter distances. n  of rates, but a question of breach of contract, and of the contractor paying only one-half of what he receives to the' subcontractors.",19
43,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"Then will be considered that other very important point, with respect to the other fifty sublettings of contracts of which we hear, but of which, apparently, no complaint has been made by the sub-contractors, and that is whether the Minister will not be doing a mischief to the sub-contractors, rather than giving them any advantage in determining the contracts. Very many of them, it must be remembered, are in poor circumstances, and have to provide their own horses and vehicles.",19
44,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"There is no doubt about that, and their poor circumstances are taken advantage of in very manv instances.",20
45,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,Poor circumstances are taken advantage of in all cases where work is let under contract.,20
46,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Unles s proper conditions are made.,20
47,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"All the interjections I have heard from honourable members during the last few minutes suggest that, in their'opinion, the Commonwealth should not seek to get its work done at the lowest price, but at a price which is most convenient to a great number of the small contractors.",20
48,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"We should see that men who work for the Commonwealth are properly paid, and work reasonable hours.",20
49,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"I am satisfied that what is running in the minds of these honourable members is a desire to serve a number of small contractors. It must be apparent to us all that it is to the interest of the Commonwealth to get the work done at as low a rate as possible, instead of giving to a great number of small contractors the opportunity of tendering at a higher rate. If that is to be the policy of the Government the expenditure of the Department will be very much in excess of what it is. I think that the House should be satisfied to leave the matter where it is. I trust that the honourable member for Grey, having again called attention to the circumstances, will not press his motion for adjournment. I suggest that he should either ask for an inquiry into all the circumstances, or that honourable members should be given full particulars of the report from the Department, and of the papers in the case, before they are called upon to express an opinion. ;  gentleman call for an inquiry?",20
50,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"No;.ther e will be no occasion for taking that course, I think, after the honourable member has called tention to the matter. I am quite satisfied that the Minister will see that justice fully done, but I hope that, before he cides to make a change in the direction dicated, he will give the House an oppor-' tunity of reading the full report from Department on the services which have been referred to, as well as a full report on each case, and a statement amounts which have been received by the fifty men who have been spoken .of, and who have, apparently, made no complaint.  complaint, but a question of what they are getting for their work.",20
51,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"With, this information in their possession, honourable members would be in a position to make a comparison, and to ascertain whether the contractor was making out of the sub-contractors anything like the proportion which it is said is made out of the contract with Vines. I imagine that it will be found that the contractors for the whole of these groups are not making a sum so serious as that which is made in connection with the case of Vines. We all know that during the last two years this firm has made a serious loss over their contracts throughout Australia. I am not speaking of the loss of a few hundred pounds, but of a loss of some thousands of pounds. On one occasion my predecessor had to consider whether the contracts of this firm should not be cancelled, or whether he should make a serious reduction in their favour, so that, although one case may be pointed out where there appears to be such, an extraordinary dissimilarity between vh<* amount paid and the amount contracted for, yet it is one case out of fifty or sixty, and we shall find that on an average there has been no such dissimilarity. If , before the consideration of the Estimates for the Department is commenced, all the papers in these cases are laid upon the table, honourable members will be in the position to judge how far the claim which is set up by the honourable member for Grey is a fair one, and how far they consider it desirable to stop the system which has hitherto existed of letting contracts in groups rather than separately.",20
52,Mr SKENE,Unknown," The honourable member for Denison, with his intimate experience, has, I think, put this mathonorable ter very well, that is as to whether we should do away with these large group contracts, or whether we should call for special contracts for every small postal line. I atdo not intend to go into the question referred to by .the honourable member for is Hindmarsh. I do not know that any illedegality has been committed. I am not one into raise my voice in favour of the commission of an illegality. But to my mind it the is a question as to whether these sub-contractors are not better in the hands of ls!-?,e contractors than in taking a contract showing the from the Government.",20

55,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"In every line of business a contractor takes a big risk. make a profit on one line, and a loss on another. I have risen to give a concrete instance which came within my own knowledge, and which illustrates what might occur if the system of allowing small contracts to be taken, direct from the Government were enforced. In the district which I represent a mail contract was accepted at so low a rate that the guarantors had to come in and take it over from the original contractor.",21
56,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,That frequently occurs.,21
57,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"I have no doubt that it does. I do not remember who was Postmaster-General at the time to which I refer, but the guarantors asked me to look the matter, to see if anything could be for them. The original contractor, whom they had guaranteed, was unable on the service, partly because of the high price he was called upon to feed on account of the drought, and the guarantees who had to take over the serVictorian vice from him, and who knew nothing whatever about the work, asked me advice.  has to find a substantial man to back up.",21
58,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"The only advice I could give was to submit to the first loss, and get out of the affair in the best way they ting. could. As I have said, they knew nothing about running a mail service, and had no one cases. horses of their own, so that they were actually losing on every week's working. company such as Cobb and Co., however, would probably take all the circumstances of a case into consideration. They would not be bound by hard and fast lines.  generally do take all the circumstances a case into consideration.",21
59,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"ther e are liberal men we change the law. connected with the management of companies, just as there are liberal men elsewhere; - and in the case of the failure of a subcontractor there are no guarantors to suffer hardship. If the sub-contractors f a i principals carry on the service themselves, or find some one else to do so. If the has letting of contracts is made illegal, the Department will be bound to a system under which separate contracts will have to be let in many cases for lines of five or ten miles in length. At the present time, by reason of the disorganization of the railway service in Victoria, through the disconHe may tinuance of trains, a number of small road services have had to be arranged by the Postal Department; but the persons employed are not a whit better off than they would be in the hands of a contractor such as Messrs. Cobb and Co. It seems to me that it would be. absurd to put on one side a firm such as that of Cobb and Co., which, under several managements, has been taking contracts ever since I was a boy. But if we make subletting illegal, that is what must happen. The Department will be bound to let out the mail services in small contracts throughout the whole Commonwealth. ",21

Those services have always been good, for and we are now falling back upon them again, in some of the country districts, in place of the railway service, because they him are more frequent. I do not see how we can get along without letting large contracts. The honourable member for Grey to has given only a few instances of sublet",21

63,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"If contractors are not of guilty of an illegal act in subletting, we cannot prevent them from doing so, unless  says that they are guilty of an illegal act.",21
64,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"The Postmaster-General has not said so. The question resolves itl , the self into a consideration as to whether it is better that the large contractors should be subabolished. I feel myself that the small sub-contractors are no worse off in the hands of the large contractors in the hands of the Government, and I speak from personal experience in the case I mentioned.",21
65,Mr MAHON,Unknown," I do not complain of the action of the honourable member for Grey in calllaw. ing attention to this matter, because there are undoubtedly some very important ciples bound up in this apparently trivial case. In the first place, as the late Postmasin ter-General pointed out, the question arises whether large contracts should be let in groups, or each individual mail service rately advertised by the Department. subject is so important that I think this is not a proper occasion for its discussion. Such an occasion Avill arise when the mates of the Postmaster-General are under tracts ? consideration. There is little doubt in my mind, ancl there can be little doubt in mind of any one who has considered the matter, that to let every individual mail tract to a separate contractor would increase the cost of the postal services of the Commonwealth. That being so, I think that the matter is one with which should deal on an occasion when honourable members are prepared for its consideration, and not in connection with the discussion the isolated case brought under notice the honourable member for Grey. He has referred to ihe Ballarat-Rokewood contract as being beyond doubt a case of subletting, and I understood him to say that the tractors themselves have admitted the fact.  admit it, but the Crown Solicitor does.",22
66,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The . Crown Solicitor considered it a case of subletting, but contractors do not. They sayIn form our agreements are for hiring and vice. ""We also affirm that they are such in substance and fact, and were certainly intended as ments for ' services at specified wages.

70,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I have the utmost faith him; but his opinion would not save the Department from the cost of defending an action at law, if we cancelled the contract, sepaand I am doubtful whether we are justified The in putting the public to that expense.",22
71,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,How does the honourable member propose to prevent the same Estithing being done again with the next con,22

73,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"There can be very little of subletting if there is no letting in groups by to large contractors. I do not express any opinion on the subject now, though I must say that the group system has worked fairly well in the interests of the public, and cercontainly of the Department, and should not be judged by an isolated 'case. I say that in all kindness and consideration to the honnot orable member for Grey. He has also drawn attention to the disparity between the amount paid to the sub-contractor and the the amount received by the contractor; but my information is that the sum of £ 7 2 a seryear given to the sub-contractor is not the only consideration which he received. I "" agreeam informed that Messrs. Cobb and Co. l l our agreed to withdraw their coaches from the mail line on which Mr Leviston was running his coaches.  are running their coaches there today.

76,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"As the honourable member has not seen the paper from which I am about to read, it is rather rash for him to sav that it does not fully state the case. I hope he will allow me to read it before he forms his opinion. This paper was prepared by the Secretary to the Department, who, like myself, knows neither party, and is absolutely impartial. It contains this statementIn the case brought uncler notice by Mr. Poynton, a complaint appears to have been made to him on behalf of Mr Leviston, who entered into an agreement with Cobb and Co. to carry on that particular service, Ballarat and Rokewood, for £ j z per annum, for which Cobb and .Co., as contractors, were receiving £160 per annum. There was, however, a further consideration, Cobb and Co. withdrawing their coaches, which were being run in opposition to Leviston, and transferring to him their business on that road, and the good-will thereto.  phatically denied that.",23

81,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,It is a very one-sided statement.,23
82,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The Secretary to the Department continuesEven if Leviston made a bad bargain, and this is not shown, it is scarcely a fair thing to endeavour to bring pressure to bear upon the Department without making any complaint or state'ment to either the Department or any of its omcers.  that unless a sub-contractor complains, the practice of sub-letting would be allowed to continue?",23
83,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Why did he not - complain to the Department if he had a ' pleading. grievance? He seems to have gone to a Member of Parliament instead.,23
84,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Some honourable members appear to have interpreted my interjection as to no objection having been lodged by other sub-contractors as indicating a state of mind which certainly does not exist so far as I am concerned. All I say is that, in the absence of objections on the part of the alleged sub-contractors,' and the public, there is every reason to suppose that the arrangement is working satisfactorily. It has been going on for thirty years, and this apparently is the first time it has been challenged. If the persons who are carrying on the work are content, and the public convenience is fully studied, is there no good reason why the present arrangement should not be allowed to continue?  letting be permitted, whilst we have a regulation providing that there shall be no subcontracting ?

The Crown Solicitor, of course, says that there has been a breach of the regulations, but the contractor says that he has not sublet, and threatens that if we cancel this particular contract he will take action at law.  from the papers.",23
85,Mr MAHON,Unknown,It is somewhere in the official papers. Mr .POYNTON - It does not appear among them now.,23
86,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"All I can say is that Mr Vines threatens legal proceedings if we interfere with his contract, and that, as a practical man, I object to involve the Department in very heavy law expenses in regard to a contract which will expire within a very few months. Possiblv it will save time if I read the rest of the remarks made by the Secretary of the Department in his memorandum. He there gives the reasons which have largely guided me. He saysIn view of the fact that there are so many services which may be said to be in the same category-sublet-that no other complaints have been made by any of the parties concerned, or by the public, who appear to be well served, and especially in consideration of the fact that in order to redress the grievance of one individual, fifty others would be _deprived of their business, and probably their means of livelihood.  that that is not correct.",23
87,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,That is a bit of special,23
88,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Honourable members must recognise that if these contracts are cancelled, it does not follow that the men who are now carrying on the work will secure them, and thus be able to continue in their present occupation. To that extent the statement of the Secretary to the Department is quite accurate.",24
89,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,But some other men would get the contracts.,24
90,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The memorandum proceedsthat to cancel so many services could not but lead to considerable confusion and public inconvenience, and probably also to increased expense, while the Crown Solicitor is satisfied that Cobb and Co., acting on the advice of their solicitor, were satisfied that their agreement under which the contracts were sublet, was not illegal, and in view of this, any action on the part of the Department adverse to them would probably be contested in the Law Courts. There is the statement to which I referred.  is all bluff.",24
91,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The memorandum proceedsThe Postmaster-General thought low these contracts to continue under the existing conditions until they expire shortly, and, in the meantime, to have the conditions of contract so revised as to preclude subletting of any kind, whether colorable or otherwise.  decided to allow the contracts to be completed ?",24
92,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The Secretary says that the "" Postmaster-General thought it better.'' I have not yet arrived at any decision in the matter. The memorandum concludes as follows: It may be as well to state that nothing was known of the practice complained of in the Postmaster-General's office until this solitary case was brought under his notice, and that it does not extend beyond the State of Victoria.  it does extend.",24
93,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,It extends into New South Wales.,24
94,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"It may so extend, for the reason mentioned by the honourable member for Grey, namely, that the contracts are let in groups. This House ought to decide whether that principle shall be followed. The burden of that responsibility should not be placed upon an individual Minister. If the House determines that it is inadvisable to let contracts in groups, and that each individual service shall be the subject of a special contract to different individuals, the' course to be pursued by the Postmaster General will be perfectly clear. If we interfered in the case referred to we should disarrange all the mail services around Ballarat, and involve the Department in a lawsuit, and it was owing to my desire to avoid these consequences that I hesitated to take action.  and Telegraph Bill was under consideration, the question of mail contracts engaged a good deal of attention. The position in Queensland was such that the system of calling for tenders resolved itself into merely a matter of form, because, owing to the grouping of the contracts, Cobb and Co. were able to secure nearly all of them. We were then told by the Minister representing the Postmaster-General that there would be no more grouping. The defence which has been offered by the Postmaster-General is one of the weakest I have ever heard from a Minister. I am sure that if he were not on the Treasury benches he would not accept as satisfactory the statement which he has himself made. The grouping system is one of the most pernicious that could be it better to al- permitted.",24
95,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I am not responsible for the grouping.  which the Minister presides is responsible. The honourable member for Grampians has put the matter very nicely for the contractor, but very badly for the sub-contractor. The honourable member for Grey has mentioned a case, in which the contractor is paid £ 1 6 0 per annum, and gets the work done by a sub-contractor for £ 7 2 . The honourable member for Grampians is not so simple as to suppose that the sub-contractor is not required to pay for forage for his horses. Does he think for a moment that the contractor would let a contract, and provide forage for the horses engaged in performing the work? The contractor is the "" butter-box man,"" who comes between the Government and the sub-contractor He scoops the pool all the time, and the other poor devil has' to do all the work. This is another Victorian swindle which needs exposure, and the sooner it is done away with the better. I am surprised that the honourable member for Grampians should stand up to defend the subletting system. I always looked upon him as one of the fairest men in - this Chamber, and yet he is apparently willing that the sub-contractors should be robbed of half of the amount to which they are entitled. Theman who is doing nothing is getting all the money, whilst the man who is doing the work is receiving nothing. Only two years ago, in Queensland, Cobb and Co., rhe great firm which was said to be the only one which could run the mails in that State, wanted to filch £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 from ihe Commonwealth. They said that they would not run any more coaches unless they received that amount of money. But the Postmaster-General was firm with them, and told them that if they did not perform their work he would re-let the contracts at their peril. He took this action with regard to some of the services, and Cobb and Co. had to cave in. Last year, when tenders were called for for the mail services in Queensland, every man had the same chance, because the contracts were not grouped, and now we. find that many of the services are being conducted at half the cost involved under the old system. In stead of one firm running the whole of the coaches in Queensland, the services are performed by hundreds of men, and this has proved of benefit, not only to the Commonwealth, but to the travelling public. In the old days, under the Cobb and Co. regime the fare between Winton and Longreach was 50s., and travellers had to - be very civil in order to obtain a place on the coaches. Now they can go to and fro for £ 1 or ios. each way. Cobb and Co. are monopolists of the worse kind.",24
96,Mr MAHON,Unknown,The Cobb and Co. Proprietary is not the same all over Australia.  firm in New South Wales and Queensland.,25
97,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"But not in Western Australia.  the same individuals are concerned. Cobb and Co. is, in each case, a syndicate, and big syndicates have no souls, and do not care how they grind the money out. so long as they pay big dividends. The right honourable member for Swan said there was no real grievance, because the man who was running the coach between Ballarat and Rokewood did not complain. The right honourable gentleman has been so accustomed to breaking the law that he is rather surprised when people object to that being done. The law has been broken in connection with these contracts.",25
98,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"Where is the proof of that?  Grey spoke for over half an hour, and gave information which should have proved sufficient to demonstrate that the regulations had been broken.",25
99,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"The Minister says that that is not so.  given not only of sweating, but of lawbreaking, on the part of the contractors The regulations specifically state that there shall be no subletting, and I am satisfied that the Postmaster-General has a perfectly good case upon which to proceed. I was very sorry to hear him shield himself behind the plea that if he took action the Commonwealth would be involved in law costs. Such threats, as have been made, should not frighten the Minister. If he is determined to give us honest, fair, and square administration, he should see that the regulations are strictlv adhered to.",25
100,Mr CHAPMAN,Unknown," I quite agree with the honourable member for Maranoa that the defence offered by the Postmaster-General was very weak. Notwithstanding the statement of the Secretary to the Postmaster-General, as to what the Minister thought best, he tells us that he has not yet arrived at a decision. He said, further, that although the law is against the subletting of contracts, he does not propose to see that it shall be f u l ly carried out.",25
101,Mr WATSON,Unknown,He is practically carrying out the decision arrived at by a colleague of the honourable member' in the Deakin Ministry.,25
102,Mr CHAPMAN,Unknown,"All I can say is that if my colleague acted in such a manner, I should condemn him, and it is idle for the Prime Minister to endeavour to bolster up the case of the Postmaster-General in that way. I ask him whether he does not agree with the honourable member for Maranoa that his colleague made a very weak defence? We have already condemned the grouping of mail contracts, and the Prime Minister has expressed himself strongly against that system.",25
103,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I still condemn it.,25
104,Mr CHAPMAN,Unknown,"If that be so, why should the Postmaster-General tell us that we should not throw the responsibility of saying whether the system is good or bad upon him? That is one of the matters regarding which the Minister ought to take the full responsibility.",25
105,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I contend that it is for the House to decide. MrCHAPMAN - The House has already decided the matter, and the country is entirely opposed to the system. It is idle to contend that the grouping of mail contracts results in a saving of money to the Commonwealth. We should aim at securing open competition, and accept the lowest tender from a legitimate contractor. The system of grouping contracts renders it impossible for a small contractor to put in a tender, and consequently he can secure employment in this way only by accepting a sub-contract.  member's opinion of subletting?",25
106,Mr CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I am opposed to the principle. Although it might occasionally be necessary for the Department to resort to what might be considered a harsh proence ceeding in order to avoid subletting, I ceract. tainly think that it should discountenance the system, and trust that the Minister reconsider his decision. I ""hope that recognise the temper of the House. If he is Department not prepared to accept the responsibility is the time to give him a plain intimation, before the Estimates of the Department submitted, that we will not permit the ing system to - continue. All contractors should be placed on an equal footing, and j f that be done there will be no cause for complaint. The - principal charge levelled against the Department has not been answered by the Postmaster-General. I do not say that he is responsible for the tem of which, complaint is made, but I cercontracts tainly think that the admission that he not prepared to take the responsibility of determining this matter is a weak one.",26

108,Mr CHAPMAN,Unknown,I do not say that the honourable gentleman should.

109,Mr CHAPMAN,Unknown,"That is my contenment is unsatisfactory.. tion, and I hope that the Minister will recognise, in the opinions expressed during this debate, an indication that the House considers that the grouping system should not be continued. A serious statement was made by tihe honourable member for Grey, who urged that the contractor in the case ferred to was an influential man, and that favouritism was being shown. ",26
110,Mr CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Are we to understand that the honourable member alleges that the officers of the Department deny to others the treatment which they extend to this contractor? The charge made by him should be inquired into; the Government should make sure that the supervision of mail contracts and everything associated with them is above suspicion. Unless every man is treated impartially, what opportunity will small contractors have to secure mail contracts? I have had some experiof the way in which large contractors I know that they secure a large number of mail contracts, and force will the small contractors to take sub-conhe will tracts at much lower rates - If the calledfor tenders, and now wealthy firms were the lowest tenderers, it would be difficult to prevent them from are taking up groups of contracts, but I hold groupthat the Department should do its utmost to prevent the adoption of that system.

Mr CHAPMAN - I am aware of that. A number of serious charges has been made against the Department, and I hope that the Postmaster-General will inquire into up them. Long before the Minister came into office, great dissatisfaction with the way which the Department conducted its busithe ness was expressed. I do not blame the Minister for this condition of affairs, and am sure no one doubts that he is anxious to mete out fair play; but charges against the Department have frequently been made by the public. It is said that the manageThere is undoubtedly a feeling of unrest on the part of the people, and the opmion is general that a thorough inquiry into the administration of the Department is necessary. I have a number of minor complaints to make against it, but shall refrain from menretioning them until "" grievance day."" The honourable member for Grey has done good service in bringing this matter forward, because it affects all contractors. We wish to know whither there is any ground for the charge of partiality, - and we wish the Minister to say that there shall be no more grouping, but that every one shall have an opportunity to tender for our mail contracts. If that system be adopted, we shall secure the most effective service at the most reasonable cost, and all cause for complaint will disappear.",26
111,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown," I do not think that the Postmaster-General should be held wholly blameworthy in respect of the system of which complaint has been made. There is a good deal to be said in favour of the practice of allowing a responsible firm to take up a number of contracts, for if the Department does not secure a strong financial firm to deal with them, it is likely in times of stress to be placed in a very awkward position. hold, however, that care should be taken to prevent subletting to the extent to which I believe the practice at present prevails. It has been urged that, instead of grouping a number of contracts, it would be better 1.0 invite small contractors to tender separately, and to accept the lowest tender. I disagree with the contention that it is desirable in every case to accept the lowest tender, for the adoption of that practice would, in a great number of cases, result in the worse form . of sweating. In many districts a man accepts a mail contract at so low a rate that it is necessary for him to sweat every one employed in connection with it. Under the grouping system, no firm should be allowed to sublet a contract at sweating rates. If the system is to continue the Department should be informed of any proposal to sublet a contract, and subletting should not take place without the express approval of the Department. partment would take care that a contract was not sublet at a price that would not allow a man to carry out the work under reasonable conditions.",27
112,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,No subletting.,27
113,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I do not think that my honourable friend realizes the magnitude of the postal service of Australia.  Hume spoke against subletting when the Post and Telegraph Bill was before the : House.,27
114,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I am not in favour of subletting as a general rule, but the Department should have a full knowledge of the cases in which it is resorted to. and should see that the prices paid will enable the sub-contractor to carry out the work without resorting to sweating. In travelling in various parts of Australia. I have often found mail coaches so underhorsed and under-manned as to render a long journey both difficult and trying. That should not be the case; but when I have spoken to the drivers of these coaches, or to the contractors, they have invariably replied, "" What could you expect at the price we are getting?"" '",27
115,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,If they do not receive a reasonable rate they have no one to blame but themselves.,27
116,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I agree that that is so, and for that reason I am not in favour of the Department accepting, in every case, the lowest tender.",27
117,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Why should the Government pay two persons in respect of one conI tract ?,27
118,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The distribution of a number of mail contracts, relating to remote parts of the Commonwealth, might perhaps be carried out to better advantage by a sound financial firm than by the Government. Such a firm would probably carry out the system better than would the Government, and could be compelled to observe the full conditions of the contracts. The - honourable member for Maranoa has referred to the attempt made by Cobb and Co. to rid themselves of the responsibility for a mail service in Queensland, owing to the difficulties which they experienced as the result of the long-continued drought. No doubt they lost money in connection with the contract.",27
119,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Some contractors were ruined.,27
120,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Doubtles s Cobb and Co. lost money in connection with The De- the service in question, but their contracts were not cancelled. Had those contracts been let Separately, no doubt, the whole' system would have gone by the board.",27
121,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,Unknown,What about the guarantor?,27
122,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I have had considerable experience of guarantors of contracts, and have 'found them in many cases to be men of straw. I wish it to bedistinctly understood that I am , not in favour of the Department invariably accepting the lowest tender. The officers of the Department should fix what is a fair rate to allowf o r an effective service. If that were done we should have no sweating, and the service as a whole would be: improved.",27
123,Mr SKENE,Unknown,How would the honourable member distribute the contracts?,28
124,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"It seems to that in certain cases the Government would not be able to distribute the contracts well as would a strong financial firm. is for that reason that I think that, the exception of services in respect of more freely settled districts of the Commust monwealth, the system of accepting tento ders for a number of contracts from strong financial firm is better than that accepting separate tenders for small vices from individual contractors who have no financial backing. In my own electhis torate-;-and , indeed, in many parts of New to some consideration. South Wales-smal l contractors are not receiving half as much as they should respect of mail services.",28
125,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,Many of them have taken contracts at starvation rates.,28

Some little latitude should be allowed the Department. There should not be a hard-and-fast rule in all cases the lowest tender shall be cepted, for if that system were adopted it would be of no benefit either to the public or to the contractors. The officers of the Department should be able to esticeive contracts. mate what is a fair amount to pay in spect of any service.

If the letting, however, is at a fair price, I should have no objection to the practice, because I thing of the kind. firmly believe that in various parts of Ausman's tralia the work can be better carried out in that way than under the direct supervision of the Postal Department, the offihard-and-fast cials of which may be many hundreds 0; thousands of miles away.

I suggest that this contract should be forfeited, because he has deliberately broken his agreement.",28

134,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I am as absolutely remaining tenders. opposed as is the honourable member for Grey to subletting, and I go with him to the full extent of his denunciation of the practice. But, if this rule is to be applied, I ask the Postmaster-General to show some consideration to the small.man who has taken the sublet contract, and has bought his eight, ten. twelve, or, it may. be, twenty horses, ancl made other provisions for carrying it out.

135,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,The small man is protected for the period over which he has agreed with the contractor.  for Franklin would rather allow the original contractor to pocket the difference all the time.,29

137,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"In Tasmania, there was a system- I do not know whether it is now applied in Commonwealth contracts-whic h answered very well indeed. Alternative contracts were always called .for, one for the whole group, and one for each line. In some cases, the smaller contracts were infinitely preferable, while in other cases - it was found better to let the whole in one group. Whatever we do, we ought to see that there is not encouraged a great monopoly by one or two large firms, who compel the* small contractors, in order to get any work, to take sub-contracts.",29
138,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,That is exactly what is happening.,29
139,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Sometimes in Tasmania when a contract for a main line, say, from A to B, has been let, and the running over small roads to isolated townships has been sublet, it is found that the sub-contractor really gets more from the original contractor than he would under a direct contract with the Government. Unfortunately, the largecontractors generally endeavour to monopolize the best paying roads, and, to use an American phrase, "" freeze out"" the small contractor every time. It is a common practice for one firm to put in four or five different tenders, and when it is found that two or three of those tenders are too high, to simply forfeit the deposits on them, and accept the contract at the lower figure of one of the I know that such a practice is not recognised or allowed, but all who have practical experience know that it is resorted to in all kinds of contracts. So long as there is open competition, there would be very great difficulty in drawing any hard-and-fast rule, which would protect the contractor, and allow him to get a fair price. I would far rather see contractors lose occasionally, or see occasional inconvenience and injustice, than I would allow a public Department to discriminate between tenderers, and decide what price was to be remunerative. There have been serious complaints from time to time in the different States, and even in the Commonwealth itself, that favouritism has been shown in the matter of mail contracts. Personally, I do not say there is any ground for the complaint. But such a charge was made, and is commonly made, because the Department, in the exercise of its judgment, gives a contract to one person in preference to another. I should like the Postmaster-General to bear in mind that if a hard-and-fast rule is to be applied, some consideration should be shown to the men who have already taken sub-cOntracts, and made all preparation for carrying out the work. Whatever punishment may be inflicted on the man who sublets, it ought not to extend to the man who has taken a subcontract, and is prepared to carry it out 10 the best of his ability.

Upon which Mr JOHNSON had moved by way of amendment That paragraphs b and c be left out.",31
159,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"-As the time of honourable members has been so much occupied this after in considering the question of subletting, k is, perhaps, appropriate to inquire whether it is necessary or desirable for us to sub-let so much of the business proposed by this Bill to the trade unions of Australia. I am quite aware, as has been stated, that one of the great objects of the meais the facilitating and encouraging of organization; but I take it that the only organization which should be enStates couraged is one for the purposes of this Bill, and not for other purposes. Now, a trades union organization is for other purposes. In some cases that purpose is to provide benefits; in many cases the purpose is political, and a large proportion of the subscription paid goes not to purposes such as this Bill provides for, but to other purposes which are not included within its provisions. Not only, in my opinion, could associations be formed altogether independent of trades unions, for the purposes of the Act, but it could be done at a much less subscription by the members of the associations than the subscription to the trades union, which necessarily is larger than would be required for the purposes of the Act, because the purposes of the union are considerably more extensive. I am not one of those who say that men should not be compelled to do something for the benefit of the community. I can quite see that if the measure is to be as beneficial as its ardent supporters think it will, it will be perfectly right to compel members of the industrial classes and employers in those classes to do something. But the question is, should that compulsion not be strictly confined to what is necessary for the purposes of the measure which enforces the compulsion? Should we not merely say that a man shall join an organization for the purposes of the Act only, and that he shall not be required to join an organization for benefit purposes, when, perhaps, he has already provided himself with benefits in a friendlysociety, or to join an organization which is political in its association, as some unions are, when he is absolutely opposed to the political policy which it supports? That seems reasonable.",31
160,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Nearl y impracticable, I think.",32
161,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I think I can show the Prime Minister that it is quite practicable, and more - easily practicable than the provisions of the Bill. Surely it is a reasonable conclusion. If so, then a proposal to compel men-becaus e it is practically compulsion, if it can be decided that employment is to be given to only unionists-to join a body which has purposes other than those for which they join, and probably purposes antagonistic to those in which they believe, is one that ought not to meet with the approval of honourable members. It has been interjected by the Prime Minister that these organizations need not necessarily be trades unions. In iheory that is quite true, but in practice it will be .found that they are trades unions. When this Bill becomes law, just as was the case in New South Wales, it will be found that certain existing trades unions will claim to represent the employees in particular callings. Although they may form only a small proportion of these employees, still they will claim to be an organization which can represent them, will be accepted by the Registrar as fulfillin g the conditions, andthen no other union will be allowed to represent those employees - Although the Acts of New Zealand and New South Wales do not absolutely say that trades unions shall be the organizations referred to, still practically it has been found that the trades unions have established their claim. Although in many cases they comprise only a few of the employees in the industry, still they have established their claim to represent those employees. So that, as a practical issue, we must recognise that in almost every case- I admit that' a few exceptional cases may arise; one or two may have arisen-thes e organizations will be the trades unions as we know them. It must also be remembered that the decisions of the Courts have gone very far beyond what possibly some members of the Committee anticipate. I shall allude to only one case, which has been referred to by the honourable member for Wentworth. Under a decision of the Arbitration Court of New South Wales, the employee of a baker in the area to which it applies must be a unionist-thoug h not necessarily when he enters the employ. If anybody in the employ of that baker does not within a ' certain period join the union, he must leave. This decision has been enforced on men who were outside the original dispute. It was enforced through an agreement' made by some bakers-master s and men, and that agreement being made a common rule by the Court, it was extended much beyond those who were parties to it. Under that common rule it was decided by the Court that a man who is not a unionist shall not continue to receive employment. Tf a non-unionist who has been in the trade for twenty years, says, "" I decline to join the union, because it has a political complexion or a political association, or because it has benefits which I have already provided for through my friendly society,"" then out of that business he must go. It must be acknowledged, therefore, that we are giving the opportunity for most drastic decisions. And when we see what has taken place, we must consider what may occur under this provision. If evidence be needed of the political complexion or character of some unions, it can be found in the case of the Shearers' Union, which has been referred to so often. that is largely a political body? In its rules it provided that there should be a contribution to a political newspaper.",32
162,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Not to a political newspaper. It is no more political than is any other journal.,33
163,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Well, to a newspaper which is largely political.",33
164,Mr WATSON,Unknown,As every newspaper is.,33
165,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"In same way I would object to force from men a contribution to the Age, the Argus, the Herald, or the Telegraph. .",33
166,Mr WATSON,Unknown,It is a newspaper which expresses political views.,33
167,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"It is a newspaper which has a strong political leaning, and gives expression to strong political opinions.",33
168,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"When the member has said that it is a newspaper, he has said everything.",33
169,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I am quite ready to admit that the same remark is true of a great many newspapers. In its rules, the Shearers' Union provides that there shall be a contribution to a newspaper.j and also a subscription to the political expenses of candidates. The latter rule has been brought before the Court, and a decision has been given which is intended to make an alteration in that respect.",33
170,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The Employers' Federation is strongly political.,33
171,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Certainly , and if ' there was any such provision as regards any such association, I should object to it on the same ground. In Sydney lately there was a proposal that all the associated unions should join the Political Labour League. A motion to that effect was moved, and it was defeated by only two votes.  League is a separate body from the Australian Workers' Union.",33
172,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,Unknown,"Of course it is ; otherwise there would be no need for the proposal to be made. There is no doubt that the two votes required will be readily obtained at a future date, and that the unions will become affiliated with the Political Labour League.",33
173,Mr WATSON,Unknown,If the majority of the members think fit.,33
174,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,A majority has nearly been obtained.,33
175,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"The Employers' Union Surely is political. ' Mr DUGALD THOMSON - I admit that it may be, and it is on some questions, but that is not the point. The Bill does not provide for the payment of subscriptions into the funds of unions of employers. The proposal in New South Wales was that the trades unions should join the Political Labour League. That proposal was defeated by a majority of two votes. But when the a number of new unions have been formed - a process which is always taking place under the Arbitration Act of that State- a majority will, no doubt, soon be obtained in favour of joining the Political Labour League.",33
176,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,It might be against doing so.,33
177,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Of course it might; but it is not likely that it will be honourable so. What would the members of - the Ministry say if the unions to which the operation of this Bill is to be largely intrusted were to propose to join the Free-trade or the Protectionist Association ?,33
178,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Some of them have practically done so.,33
179,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I am not saying that they have not a right to do so; I am speaking only of their relation to this Bill. If the whole of the unions to which the operation of the measure will be largely intrusted were proposing to become part of a Free-trade or Protectionist Association, would the Government support the proposal to force workmen to join a declared active political body to whose principles they were absolutely opposed?",33
180,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The unions are primarily . trades unions. If they become incidentally political that is absolutely a matter for those who compose them.,33
181,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"This is a creating of constituencies. I have given Labour the evidence in support of my conclusion. The facts are not denied, and I leave it to the Committee to judge of the soundness of my inferences. I know where the objections would come from if a majority of the existing unions, whose members comprise only a small part of the workers as a whole, were proposing, or were likely, to unite forces with any political party on this side of the chamber.",33
182,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Some of them have already done that, i i i opposition to the political labour movement.",34
183,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,Unknown,Have done what? Mr. WATSON - Hav e given weight to .a political organization other than the Labour Party.,34
184,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"To what political organization ? Mr WATSON, - To the Protectionist Association chief]v. Mr DUGALD'THOMSON - There has been no association of the unions with the Free-trade Party.",34
185,Mr WATSON,Unknown,A number of the leading men in some of the unions are strong free traders.,34
186,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,I quite believe that.,34
187,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Many of the members of the union with which I am connected would not vote for the leader of the Labour Party in the State Parliament.,34
188,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"But the unions are proposing to join the Political Labour League, which supports that gentleman.",34
189,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,All that the members of the unions are compelled to do is to contribute to their funds; they cannot be compelled to vote for any party.,34
190,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Ought we to compel men to contribute to the funds of unions holding political views which are contrary to their own convictions?,34
191,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Why cannot they vote as they think fit?,34

195,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Some of the best unionists in Sydney have been voting for the Free-trade Party all along, but we have not objected to them as. unionists.",34
196,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Of course not. But it is now proposed that all the unions shall join the Political Labour League, which votes one way, and one way only.",34
197,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Is that the honourable member's objection?,34
198,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,It is objectionable to compel men to join unions which hold political views and exercise political influence in opposition to their convictions.,34
199,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Where is the compulsion ?,34
200,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Are we not dealing with a clause which provides for employment being given to unionists only ?,34
201,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,The clause does not say that.,34
202,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"What is the use of this evasion? This is not the Arbitration Court of New South Wales, but the High Court of Parliament. The clause says The Court . . . may . . . direct that as between members of organizations of employers or employees and other persons offering or desiring service or employment at the same time, preference shall be given to such, members, other things being equal.",34
203,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,What does that mean?,34
204,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"It means that men may be forbidden, not merely to enter, but to remain in an employment because they are non-unionists. That has been done by the New South Wales Arbitration Court, acting under a similar provision.",34
205,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Onl y after a lock-out, I think.",34
206,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Not after a lock-out.,34
207,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,The same thing occurred in New Zealand in connection with the bootmakers' award.,34
208,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I believe that there has been only one case in New South Wales so far. In the New South Wales Government Gazette. No. 534, of 13th October, 1903, is published an agreement between the Sydney and Suburban Master Bakers' Association ancl the New South Wales Operative Bakers' Association, which was made a common rule by the Court, and an extension allowed, which carried it considerably further than the original parties to the dispute. Clause 12 of the award reads as follows :Any non-unionist operative baker hereafter entering the employ of any member of the Industrial Union of Employers shall join the New South Wales Operative Bakers' Association at or before the end of one week from the date of his so entering the employment. Wherever a non-unionist applies to an employer for employment as an operative baker the employer shall inform him of this condition of the agreement. That means that men who have been twenty years in the baking trade in New South Wales are absolutely forced, if they desire to continue at that employment, to become unionists.",34
209,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"It was open to them, when the common rule was about to be applied for, to ask for an exemption.",35
210,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,I do not know that it was open to them under the New South Wales Act in the same way as it will be under the Bill. They probably did not receive notice.,35
211,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The Court decided by rule that it would not extend an agreement without notice.,35
212,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"In that case the non-unionists could have raised an objection. Whether they did or did not I do not know. If they did, the objection has been overruled. Here is the head note to another awardA master undertaker may employ a non-unionist in a case of emergency, but cannot retain him permanently in his employ, without making r?asonable efforts to secure a competent unionist.",35
213,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,That seems perfectly right.,35
214,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I am only showing that these things have happened under the New South Wales Act, and may happen under the provision which I have read, which is practically the same as that in the State Act. It mav be said that without such a provision unionists .might be improperly dismissed from their employment; dismissed not for the manner of doing their work, or for unreliability, but for having chosen to take a certain attitude in the interests of themselves, or of their fellow-employees. But under the Bill, as it stands, a unionist might be dismissed for that reason. In any case, the onus of proof that he did not dismiss his employee except for good reasons other than the fact that the employee was a member of a union is cast upon the employer.",35
215,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The honourable member is confusing two things. We are not now speaking of the dismissal of the unionist, but of his right to preference of employment.",35
216,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown, but the honourable member has himself suggested that unionists might be penalized.,35
217,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Without this provision unionists might be penalized. ployer might say, "" You have compelled me to pay higher rates of wages; but I shall get even with you by dismissing you all.""",35
218,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,That could occur under the clause.,35
219,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,But having dismissed one set of unionists the employer would have to take another set of unionists.,35
220,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"No doubt the position of unionists is safeguarded, so far as it can be, by the Bill, whether they are members of political or non-political unions. In New Zealand the Government have been asked to give preference to unionists' in the railway service of that State, as will be seen by the following telegram from Wellington, dated 13th June:Replying to the request of a deputation of railway servants for the preference employment of unionists, Sir J. G. Ward said he could not see his way to grant the request. If he did such a thing, he would lay himself open to a charge of coercing men to join a society. It would be looked upon as very improper to say that a man who had been twenty years in the service should be dismissed, and one who might have been in only a year retained in preference. That is the opinion of a gentleman who is a member of the Ministry which introduced the first Arbitration Bill in New Zealand. I understand that Mr Seddon holds similar views.",35
221,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Neithe r of them disputes the clause that is in this Bill.,35
222,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,It was not applied to the railways.,35
223,Mr WATSON,Unknown,It would apply to the raihvays if the Court thought At. - Mr.'DUGALD THOMSON - But there is a special railway clause.,35
224,Mr WATSON,Unknown,There is a difference; but it does not arise in the way the honourable member suggests.,35
225,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Her e was a request made to the Government which was practically the author of the New Zealand measure, to do in connection with the railways of that, country what can be clone under this Bill, and the Minister of Railways actually refused it . I come to the question raised by the Prime Minister, whether, considering the difficulties of the position, any. other proposal than that of making use of the trades unions-politica l or non-political-for the purposes of this Bill, can be found. It seems to me that the Yes; - issue at stake at any time is one between employers and employees. That must be so. Therefore, why should not the employees ancl employers-no t a portion of The em- them, but the whole of them within a certain industry-be the parties to the matter? I admit that in discussing this measure we ' are under a difficulty. If it applied only to disputes extending beyond a State, this provision for preference to unionists would not matter one way or the other. I think the Prime Minister will admit that it is inapplicable to disputes that extend from one State to another. Put as the Bill in a great number of its clauses goes much further, and makes provision for this great industrial octopus taking hold of the industries of every State, Ave must consider the matter in that If it is found that that control can be obtained, and that practically the industries of every State will come under the management of the CommonAvealth, Ave should endeavour, at any rate within restricted areas, to have the question in dispute settled as between the whole of the employers an.l' the whole of the employees in an industry. We might limit the areas, as is done in NeAV Zealand. Why should a portion of the employees or the employers settle a question of much moment to the whole of an industry ? Would it not be infinitely setter than that a trades union or than that some little group of employers should act for the whole, that the whole body themseh'es should act in connection AA'ith the purposes of this Bill? Is that impossible? It might have been thought to be impossible when the first Conciliation and Arbitration Acts were introduced. But our business is to learn from experience. After eight years or so Ave ought to be able to make some improvements upon the original Conciliation and Arbitration Acts. In my opinion, it is not impossible. The alternative suggested could be more easily effected than the proposals of this Bill can be carried out. No doubt, one reason for naming the trades union as parties in the original .Act was that the unions had assets which could be dealt with if they raised unnecessary trouble by the Arbitration Court. But it would be possible to collect payments from the suggested organizations far more easily, and far more certainly, than it is possible to collect union subscriptions. The time of the Arbitration Court in New South Wales is occasionally considerably occupied Will cases for the 'recovery of union subscriptions and fines.",35
226,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,There is no necessity for its being so; it arises from a defect in the Act,36
227,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I do not know the reason, but it is so. If the whole of the employees within a given area in a particular industry were considered to be members of an organization, authority could be given by the Court to the employers to deduct an amount from their pay weekly. It would be a very trifling amount-nothin g like the union subscription. It might be a halfpenny or a farthing in the pound on the wages paid, or it might be less. That amount could be deducted and paid into an employees' fund, under the control of the Court. The employers, of course, would be required to pay in an equivalent amount light. to an employers' fund.",36
228,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,An amount calculated on their turnover or profits?,36
229,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,Unknown,"Every employer who paid his men on a Certain day in the week A\xmld deduct this little proportion, which might be fixed by the Court, and would hand that amount, with the names of those from whom it had been deducted, to an official of the Court.",36
230,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Is this proposal made in lieu of organizations?,36
231,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"It is made in answer to the Prime Minister's challenge in reference to the difficulty of providing any system to take the place of the unions. The parties immediately concerned in any dispute are the employers and the employees, and it is desirable to have all the employees and all the employers-no t merely a portion of them-mad e parties to action, dispute, decision. The reason why the unions were made use of in the first place AA-as that it is necessary to deal with bodies which have funds and a continual existence, and not with an unorganized mob. But in my opinion it is possible to constitute a body with a continual existence from the whole of the employees of an industry, and funds can be raised readily and simply by means of a small contribution deducted by the Court through the employers from the wages of the employees. The employer would pay in a similar amount as his contribution to the employers' fund.",36
232,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,That is compulsory unionism.,36
233,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The honourable member can call it what he likes. I call it compulsory organization for the purposes of this Bill, but not for any other purpose. I do not object to compelling people to do something for the good of the community, although I do object to compelling them to do something for the good of a section, and to the injury of the rest.",36
234,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Does the honourable member propose to alloAV the employers to stop a portion of the employees' Avages ?,36
235,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I would where allow the Court to do that; not the employers. The employer would only be the need to decide medium. Does not the honourable propose to allow a trades union to take much larger portion of the employees ings than I propose that the Court should the Bill , take?",37
236,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,What amount would the honourable member desire to take?,37
237,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"It would absolutely be a trifling amount, as any one can see. £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 were paid in wages in a city-an of-course much larger sums are paid weekly' in large cities like Melbourne or Sydneya penny in the pound would raise £ 2 5 0 the employees' fund, and £ 2 5 0 as the ployers' fund. That is much more would be required. A very small contrifoolish bution would be required, because the pose of it would be to do one thing, and thing only, namely, to carry out the purpreference. poses of this Bill . Of course, there be no question of preference for unionists then, because all the employees would long to an organization. The Court could regulate the associations and provide rules for them, including rules for the tion of their governing bodies.",37
238,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Would the honourable member compel the employees to join ?,37
239,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,Unknown,"They would be members by being employees. The Prime Minister admits that it' is desirable that the parties to a dispute should be not merely some of the employees and employers, but the whole of them. The only difference between the honourable gentleman and myself in that respect possibly thinks it is impracticable to achieve that end, and that as a substitute we have to utilize trades unions. I am pointing that, in my opinion, that is not necessary, and that it is possible to accomplish desired more readily and easily by recog nising all the employees in an industry as an organization on the one side and all employers on the other. No matter for advancing it. whom a man worked, there would be under the sanction of the Court a trifling deduction from his wages, and the record selves? ancl payment would constitute his sign manual as a member of the particular employees' organization. None of jections that can be raised against the proposal could be raised against that. For instance, the objection raised that employees might be harshly dealt with, bemust cause they were unionists, could all employee's are members of the - organization, and the Cqurt would not that none but unionists member should be employed. Then, . under my a proposal, the organization would be earnstrictly confined to the purposes of whereas, under the other scheme, the organization might be a political or benefit association, to which men might' be compelled to contribute in order to carry out objects to which they were opposed. I should like to point If out that, apart altogether from the quesd tion of preferences to unionists, the clause provides for preferences of another kind. Under it any perference the Court might as see fit to direct could be given to ceremtain employers or employees. There is than nothing to prevent the Court, if it were enough-of course, the idea is abpursurd-fro m deciding that men under five one feet ten inches in height should receive a The Courts, both in New Zeawould land and New South Wales, have, under a similar provision, given decisions which beI think are very unwise-if I may be alalso lowed to say that of a Court's decisionswhich may prove. exceedingly injurious to elecindustry, and consequently to the CommonAvealth. One of these decisions in NeAv South Wales affects one of the largest bodies of men in that State. The Court decided that the last men to be taken on should be the first to be dismissed. That is to say, that if ten men Avere put on today they should, in the event of any slackness of A\'ork, be dismissed before those previously engaged.",37
240,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,That is a very old custom is that he in all industries.,37
241,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Such a out piOA'ision might operate very injuriously, because among any ten, or twenty, or 100 what is men who may be taken on at any given time, some may be found who are capable : of rising to a good position, and of effectthe ing improvements in the industry, and thus Still, they Would have to go, whilst much inferior men Avere retained. What Would this mean to the men themI t Would keep a body of menthe same body-constantl y floating between Avork and wages and the borders of starvathe obtion. Is it fair to decree in regard union to any particular body of Avorkmen that, although they may be able to obtain Avork for a time, it is only for a time, as they always be the first to go in the event not apply of slackness of Avork?",37
242,Mr WATSON,Unknown,That practice is almost universal in private employment-othe r things being equal.,38
243,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,This is not a case of other things being equal.,38
244,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The honourable member must recollect that in the case referred to the men were engaged on.piece work, and that, therefore, it was not quite so importmen ant as it might be in other cases that the employer should be allowed to pick and choose his men.",38
245,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"But it is important to the employer, and very often for the safety of the employees in a mine, that the best men should be retained.",38
246,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,A decision such as that indicated would prevent a number of relatives from being put on when a change of management occurred.,38
247,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Perhaps so. Whilst the private employer' would, of course, endeavour to retain desirable 'old hands, and very properly so",38
248,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Many of them sack the old hands and take on younger men.,38
249,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,The honourable member is speaking of employers of whom I have not had experience.,38
250,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,- I know of many such as I describe.,38
251,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"So far from that being the case with many employers, I know that they increase the rate of pay given to their old employees, in consideration of their long service. Although it is recognised that they do not earn the extra money perhaps iri a direct way, still they give compensation for it by bringing their long experience and acquired aptitude to bear. At any rate, such consideration is only reasonable when extended to old employees.",38
252,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Hear , hear.. I wish all employers would show the same spirit.",38
253,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I think the that most employers try to keep on their older hands, but when new men show special aptitude or ability, the industrywill be advanced by their continued employment in preference to less desirable hands. Take, for instance, the case of the manufacture of porcelain and pottery. Some men by their special capacity and ability to design might lead to a large development of trade in Australia, and an increased manufacture, but under the rule now proposed the employer would not be free to make the choice when it became necessary to reduce the number of his workr men.",38
254,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The rule to which the honourable member refers has never been applied, so far as I am aware, except to the one case in which there was a uniform hewing rate for coal-getting, in which the were engaged on piece-work at so much per ton.",38
255,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I think there was another case; but I shall accept the statement of the Prime Minister. One effect of that decision is that men who, in comparison with others, are less careful, and who are more given, say, to neglect the use of safety lamps, have' to be kept on.",38
256,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Is not the honourable member splitting straws?,38
257,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,Unknown,Does the honourable member think I am splitting straws when I refer to considerations relating to the safety of mines. I am only giving an illustration.,38
258,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Does the honourable member know that that rule was insisted upon by the miners and by the Court, because it was alleged that the management were attempting to weed out all the prominent unionists, and get rid of them? That was the allegation, and the Court, in order to prevent that kind of thing, decided thatunless incapacity could be proved the men must be put off in rotation.",38
259,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I am only mentioning that case as an illustration of one of the preferences that might be made. An infinite variety of preferences could be given, ancl that which I have mentioned is not the only one. As to the wisdom of that form of preference, we may differ.",38
260,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I clo not say that I should approve of it in all cases.,38
261,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I cannot profess to know all the circumstances of case alluded to ; but I say that if the principle were generally applied it might seriously injure our industries. Under the clause a variety of preferences, quite apart from the question qf membership of the union, might be given. In my opinion, the Bill would have been a better one from the stand-point of its advocates if an advance hacl been made upon previous measures, and provision had been made for embracing the whole of the employers and employees within a certain area. If that had been done nearly all the objections I have spoken of today would have disappeared, and means would have been afforded for the satisfactory settlement of those difficulties between employers and employees, which we must all regret, and which we all desire to see removed. The very fact that all interests were represented in an organization would secure that reasonable average of opinion-as distinguished from the extreme views that are often entertained by small bodies, whether of employers or employees-whic h would more than anything else tend to the settlement of the industrial affairs of Australia. a proposal may be embodied in an amendment, but not at this stage. We shall probably have to recommit clause 4, and deal with the matter in connection with the interpretation of the word "" association."" I do not say that this course will be adopted, but it may be. I have only outlined my proposal, in reply to the challenge thrown out by the Prime Minister, when he invited honourable members to suggest, anything that could be substituted for the recognition of the trades unions which have aims and objects entirely apart from the purposes which it is sought to achieve by this Bill.",38
262,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown," I desire, the permission of the Committee, to amend my amendment by confining it tb the omission of the words "" direct that"" at the beginning of paragraph b. My object allow a test vote to be taken upon the question of omitting the whole of paragraphs b and c. Amendment amended accordingly.",39
263,Mr EWING,Unknown," I hope that we shall have an opportunity to consider, in some concrete form, the thoughtful views put before the Committee by the honourable member for North Sydney. I propose to endeavour to discover, as far as possible, how far honourable members of the Opposition are in agreement with the Government and their supporters. On every occasion when discussing the provisions of this Bill, I have pointed out that, in common with a considerable number of other honourable members, I feel that the general principle of arbitration is a good one. That the principle is a sound one is incontrovertible; but many of us feel that the Government have gone altogether too far in this proposal.",39
264,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"This Bill was framed by the last Government, of which the honourable member was a supporter. - Mr EWING - The honourable gentleman asks, in effect, whether, in supporting the late Government, I did not absolutely approve of theB ill introduced by them. Although an honourable member may support a Government, he does not necessarily approve of every detail of a Bill introduced by it.",39
265,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I could not blame the honourable member for failing to support the Bill, when so few members of the late Government are doing so.",39
266,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I have no desire to enter Such into any of those dissertations that are so interesting to honourable members; but would point out that I never approved, in its entirety, of any Bill introduced by a Government of which I was a supporter. A number of honourable members believe that many of the matters with which we are asked to.deal in connection with this Bill might well be left to those actually identified with States industries, and to members of the States Parliaments. We believe that it would be better for both the Federal and States Legislatures, and create a greater feeling of harmony if we did not in any way trench on the ground of the States Parliaments. I have sought with by examining the rhetorical sentences of honourable members opposite to discover the germ of their meaning, believing that it would be well to see how far honourable is to members of the Opposition are in agreement with them. The .discussion of this question of preference may give rise to the bitter feeling ""of antagonism that often exists between parties and individuals; but nothing that we are called upon to consider in this Chamber should call for even one unkind or unfriendly word. We may discuss the principle involved as vigorously as possible, but we should remember that the individual is widely separated from the principle. The first question we have to consider is whether this clause would give a preference to a unionist or a member of an organization. It is obvious that it would. I shall presently show a common ground of agreement between the Opposition and the Government and their supporters, but while we say that this clause would give unionists an absolute monopoly of the whole of the work in Australia, honourable members opposite declare that it would not.",39
267,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Unionist s could not do all the work.,39
268,Mr EWING,Unknown,No ; they can only do all the legislating.,39
269,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,And we could not get better men to do it,40
270,Mr EWING,Unknown,"If the honourable member will bear with me for a moment, I shall endeavour to get on absolutely safe ground, so far as he is concerned. position of unionists and non-unionists, under this clause, may be briefly illustrated. If A desired to purchase a piece of land from B,- and was informed by him that he could do so, but that the land was under offer to C, and that if C did not want it, he would be prepared to take his money for it, the position would be that the land was held under option by C. That is exactly the position in regard to unionists and non-unionists under this Bill. If the clause be carried, any work remaining to be carried out after, employment has been found for all unionists will be available to a man outside an organization. The scraps from the labour heap will be gathered by the outsider.",40
271,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,That is not the experience of New Zealand.,40
272,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The honourable member and I do not agree. Honourable members of the Opposition say that this clause would give unionists a monopoly of work, while 'honourable members opposite say that it would not do so. The common ground of agreement is that it would not give the monopoly, but would give unionists the option. Work that a unionist did not wish to do might be carried out by a man outside those organizations. We have heard a great deal about the sacred rights of majo- of rities, and it has been said that we see here an infringement of the great democratic rule of government by majority. I wish only to deal with facts, and shall quote the figures relating to the number of unionists in New South Wales, which are significant of the numbers in all parts of Australia. There are 66,000 unionists in New South Wales; while there are no less than 464,000 workers of a similar status. Of that number, 380,000 are males, and 84,000 females. If . as the result of the passing of this clause, the option of securing the labour of the State would be given to the 66,000 unionists, as against 464,000 non-unionists, honourable members are right in asserting that this is a proposal to infringe the sacred rights of the democracy. In this Parliament majorities always rule, but under this clause the majority of the working classes, who do not belong to unions, will be placed at a disadvantage. The statistics show that so far six workers out of seven have not joined unions in New South Wales, and now we are asked to say that only one man out of seven shall have any rights under this Bill .",40
273,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The honourable member is The speaking of women workers as male workers.,40
274,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Is not the honourable member including many workers who will be excluded from the provisions of this measure ?,40
275,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I am speaking of all railway servants, and male and female workers in New South Wales. The total number of persons belonging to unions is 66,000, while other workers, male and female, number 464,000.",40
276,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Non-unionist s will indirectly participate in the advantages of the Bill.,40
277,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I ' shall deal vvith that matter presently. It is impossible to discuss the principle of arbitration and conciliation without referring to the position in New Zealand. That Colony has been the home of this class of legislation for a considerable number of years, and has also enjoyed a large measure of prosperity, good seasons, and good prices, so that wages ought to have increased there. What do the statistics show? In New Zealand the average wage paid to male workers in 1891 was 29s. per week; in 1896, 29s. 9d.; and in 1901, 31s. 5d. per week, so that during a boom period extending over a period of ten years, the rate wages increased only 2 s. 3d. per week. In 1891, female workers in New Zealand received an average of 13s. 4d., and they now receive only 12s. 5d., showing a reduction of n d . per week. In New South Wales, where we have suffered severely from drought, and have hacl very little legislation in this direction, the average wage paid in respect of the same class of male labour is 35s. u d . per week, as against 31s. sd. in New Zealand, so that, notwithstanding the great advantages which New Zealand enjoys notwithstanding splendid seasons and high prices-mal e workers there receive 4s. 6d. per week less than is paid to the same class of workers in New South Wales. In New Zealand the women, as I have mentioned, are receiving 12s. 5d. per week, whilst in New South Wales the average rate is *3S3d., a difference of iod. per week in favour of the last-named State. Honourable members will be in agreement with me so far as this statement of fact is concerned. The figures are accurate, and I do not propose now to draw any inference from them. The next question for us to consider is whether it is proposed under this clause to force persons to join unions. When that question was first put, the reply of honourable members opposite was- "" We shall not force them to join a union; but we shall induce them - deo y them,"" The only difference between us, therefore, on this point is a difference as to terms. Let me state the position by means of a simple illustration, which I am sure will appeal to my philosophic friend, the honourable member for Darling. If he were sent to catch a horse, would he set out with a stockwhip or with a hatful of corn? I am inclined to believe that, with his knowledge of horses, he would take a hatful of corn; and in this clause we have the political corn with which the masses of the people are to be decoyed into joining organizations. There is, therefore, no real difference between us in regard to this point. It matters not how persons are led to join unions or organizations as long as they join, and in this case it is proposed to use political corn rather than a political whip. Le me deal with another aspect of the case, the cost of this Bill . honourable members opposite have stated, by way of interjection. that non-unionists receive all the benefits of unionism without bearing any of the cost of the system. If such a state of affairs exists, it is obviously unjust, and should be rectified. Honourable members should consider what is to be paid by Australia in order that the' whole of the workers of the Commonwealth shall be forced to enter the ranks of organizations or unions. I shall show honourable members the position of unions in New South Wales. I propose to make no passing reference to the reasons why men enter unions, but will refer rather to the rules and conditions laid down for membership, and to deal mainly 'with the cost which this legislation will impose on the people of Australia. of the New South Wales Operative Bakers' Association pay an entrance fee of ios., and applicants must have served an apprenticeship of not less. than four years, or be approved by three out of the five shops in which they have worked. I am not at this moment making any reference to yearly subscriptions, but merely to entrance fees. For the Sydney Coal Lumpers' Union a candidate must be nominated by two financial members two weeks prior to regular meeting, and, after running the risk of a ballot, must pay an entrance fee of £ 1 is. In the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners a candidate must be nominated by two members, and there must be testimony as to character, with a certificate of good health from the branch surgeon, the election being by the majority of members present. A candidate, other than an apprentice, must have worked at the trade for five years, and be a good workman, of steady habits, and good moral character, not less than nineteen nor more than forty years of age.",40
278,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,What is there wrong with those rules?,41
279,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Nothing , except that there is no room for old or weak men; even the honourable member for Darling would not be able to join this union. Another regulation in this society is that any candidate having only one eye shall not be eligible for admission.",41
280,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Is there any rule as to the colour of the eyes?,41
281,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Cyclops , who made thunderbolts for Jupiter, would not, with his one eye, have a ghost of a show of getSome ting into this New South Wales union. The Prime Minister, who has acted all through with the utmost courtesy and wisdom-o n which I am glad to be able to congratulate him-ha s taken a good deal of sting out of this discussionLike a sensible man, he knows how to give way when he cannot win. He is learning rapidly, and he says that unions shall be absolutelyopen.",41
282,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I expressed that opinion fourteen years ago in the case of the coal lumpers, who charged £ 5 as the entrance fee to their union.",41
283,Mr EWING,Unknown,The Prime Minister was right then.,41
284,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I hope so.,41
285,Mr EWING,Unknown,Bu the has been wrong many times since. Members Mr WATSON - Not often.,41
286,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I will not at any length emphasize the manner in which men get into unions. Obviously an out-' sider frequently cannot get in ; but the oneeyed man I regard as the most unfortunate. In the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners, members from the age of nineteen to twenty-five pay an entrancefee of 7s. 6d.; from twenty-five to thirty, ios.; from thirty to forty, 15s. In the 55° Conciliation and Federated Ironmoulders' Union a candidate is admitted on nomination by two members, initiation being at the following meeting, and the entrance-fees are-fro m the age of twenty to thirty, 5s.; from thirty to thirty-five, ios.; from thiitv-five to forty, 15s.; from forty to forty-five, 20s.; and over forty-five, £ 2 .",41
287,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,-And cheap at that.'.,42
288,Mr EWING,Unknown,"In this union, members over fifty years of age pay an entrance fee of 5s., but are allowed only dispute benefits.",42
289,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Tell us of the benefits of these unions. Mr EWING : - I shall a little later on. In the United Boiler-makers and Iron Shipbuilders' Union a candidate must be nominated by two members, and, on election, pay an entrance fee of 10s.",42
290,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,Has the honourable member no cheaper unions to quote?,42
291,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I have a number of "" cheaper "" unions, but will not quote them. The present limited benefits of unionism, the charges for admission, and, further, the entrance fees, are not matters to which I desire to direct special attention; my desire is to deal with what amounts to more than the entrance-fee, namely, the continuous weekly subscription. The Prime Minister has taken a good deal of the censure out of our remarks by his declaration that a union shall no longer be a close corporation, but, to use his own words, "" A fair business shall be done; there shall be a fair entrance-fee and a fair subscription."" Now, ,New Zealand is regarded as the special home of this most blessed of all legislation. In the Wellington Printers' case, a judgment was given, and that judgment shows what in New Zealand is regarded as a fair weekly subscription to a union. If wequote New Zealand as an example of the benefits of legislation of this kind, it is reasonable, also, to quote that Colony as to what is a fair rate of subscription. do not know what obtains in the organization with which the Prime Minister is connected, but in New Zealand the members of .the Typographical Society pay 6d. per week. In the award in the Wellington Printers' case, there is the following: If and after the Union shall so amend its rules as to permit any person now employed in the trade in this industrial district, and any person who may hereafter reside in this industrial district, and who is a competent journeyman printer, compositor, or operator, to become [RE PRE SE NTATIVE S.] Arbitration Bill. a member of such union upon payment of an entrance-fee not exceeding 5s., and of subsequent contributions, whether payable weekly or not, not exceeding 6d. per week. . . . I ask honourable members opposite if 6d. per week may be regarded as a reasonable subscription? Will the honourable member for Darling answer the question?",42
292,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,I shall tell the honourable member all about it by-and-by.,42
293,Mr I,Unknown,"IUTCHISON - The answer all depends on the benefits, but 6d. per week is about an average.",42
294,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I have the New Zealand example, ancl also the concurrence of my very reasonable and generous, if somewhat unwise friend, in saying that 6d. per week is a fair subscription. Now, 6d. per week means 26s. a year. In the last Parliament, and during last election, the two political parties fought very bitterly on the great question of free-trade and protection- a question which was the cause of much tumult, trouble, ancl worry, and of the change of a considerable number of seats in this Parliament. It is always conceded that the amount of money required by the Government of the Commonwealth is something over £9,000,000 per annum, to which narcotics, stimulants, excise, and so on, contribute about £4,000,000 or £5,000,000. This leaves something over £4,000,000 to be contributed by the great body of the people of Australia, or something over £1 per head. In order to become a unionist, if the rates approved by the honourable member opposite be correct, a man has to pay £ 1 6s. per year in addition to entrance fees; in point of fact, he has to pay more to become a unionist than the people of the country have to pay per head- I state the case in the free-trade way - in order to protect the whole of the industries of Australia. This taxation on the worker individually means more than the whole of the indirect taxation per head. I",42
295,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,But what cloes the unionist get in return?,42
296,Mr EWING,Unknown,"What I say is that £ 1 6s. per year represents to the individual worker a larger amount than the indirect taxation per head of the population, excluding excise and the duties upon narcotics and stimulants. I have epitomized for the benefit of honourable members the points on which the two sides of the House are agreed. First of all, we are agreed that this Bill gives a preference to a minority, inasmuch as it gives a preference to unionists.",42
297,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"The Minister of External Affairs admitted that fact, and justified it.",43
298,Mr WATSON,Unknown,That it gives a preference to unionists? Yes.,43
299,Mr EWING,Unknown,"""In New South Wales there are only 66.000 unionists as against over 400,000 workers outside unions, so that the Bill gives preference to a minority.",43
300,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"No ; because the Bill only gives the preference in specific instances, ancl refuses it in other instances.",43
301,Mr WATSON,Unknown,A preference is given only where the case makes it necessary.,43
302,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,In New Zealand the preference is as often refused as granted.,43
303,Mr EWING,Unknown,Then may I take it that sometimes the Bill gives a preference to a minority ?,43
304,Mr WATSON,Unknown,It may mean the majority of a trade.,43
305,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"We may take it that if a preference is given, it is given to a minority.",43
306,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The fact is quite the opposite.,43
307,Mr SWING,Unknown,"Honourable members opposite have granted that sometimes a preference is given to a minority, and that it is refused to a majority.",43
308,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,"In half-a-dozeii cases I can name at once, preference has been given to a minority.",43
309,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Who says so?,43
310,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order !,43
311,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,"I say so, and I can prove it.",43
312,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Of course/if the honourable member says, so, it must be correct.",43
313,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,In what trade has preference been given to a minority?,43
314,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order !,43
315,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,"In the case of the Barrier miners, for one.",43
316,Mr WATSON,Unknown,They are not in a minority.,43
317,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,And in the case of the bread-carters preference was given to a minority.,43
318,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order . ask honourable members not to persist in this conversation.,43
319,Mr EWING,Unknown,"It is provided in the clause that preference shall be given to members of the union affected, and as there are only 66,000 members of unions, as against over 400,000 outsiders, there must be a preference to a minority.",43
320,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,It all depends on the conditions in the union in question.,43
321,Mr EWING,Unknown,"It depends on a simple calculation, and if the honourable member cannot grasp the fact that 400,000 is more than 66,000 I must pass on. I take it that we are also agreed that this Bill means taxation, without the permission of the majority. If there be 400,000 outside and 66,000 inside unions, we force the former into a position in which they have to pay £ 1 6s. per annum. Surely that is taxation without the permission of the majority.",43
322,Mr WATSON,Unknown,No taxation without representation.,43
323,Mr EWING,Unknown,"But when it comes to a question of some nobler principle- I will put it that way-the Prime Minister abandons his idea that representation must go with taxation, and forces 400,000 people to pay JQL 6S. per annum each, in order to please 66,000.",43
324,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Does the honourable member say that one man can force five?,43
325,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Yes , if the five have no sense.",43
326,Mr WATSON,Unknown,But they will already be unionists if they have sense.,43
327,Mr EWING,Unknown,"It is said that at present a third of the House is governing the whole House; but that is a presumption which is incorrect. This Bill is preserving the labour of the country for a small minority, ancl leaving the scraps for a huge majority; as to that we are all agreed. Honourable members grant that the main labour of. the country is under option to unions which number 66,000 members, and that the scraps are picked up from the rubbish heap by the unfortunate people outside. I have no doubt, from the expression of the faces of honourable members opposite, that they agree with that position.",43
328,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"We dispute.the honourable member's figures, vvhich, as usual, are incorrect.",43
329,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The honourable gentleman will have an opportunity to prove that they are incorrect. My next point is that the Bill forces the great majority to join an organization. Honourable members say, I must "" We clo not force them, but we decoy or induce them to come in . "" Why are we quarrelling so bitterly when it is only a question of the difference between the word ""decoy"" and the word "" for c e "" ? On all these points we are agreed. Another point is that it is interfering with industries and other matters which constitutionally are within the province of the States, and will be better dealt with by the States. We are all agreed with regard to that matter, although we seem to differ with regard to the great national principle involved. My last point is that, instead of the Federal Parliament reserving this great power until the States have failed to secure what is desired, it is simply wasting its strength ancl energy by interfering in all sorts of pettydisputes, quarrels, and rivalries in the industries of the States. These are points on which . we are all agreed; these are the questions which underlie the whole of the argument, and it is extremely regrettable that when honourable members are agreed with regard to these thingsthe great democratic principle of control by majority, the sacredness of labour, and that if anything should win it is competence and honesty-ther e should be any difference of opinion. I have placed before the Committee a number of facts, and I question whether honourable members can touch one of those facts with regard to either numbers, or wages, or the essentials underlying the whole matter.",43
330,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"We cannot' touch the facts, but we can touch the figures.",44
331,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The honourable gentleman cannot touch a single figure that I have given. He cannot touch the point that taxation is being placed upon the people in order to create new unions. I am not dealing with the question as to whether unionism is right; I am only showing the people of this great country the facts of the case. On an occasion of this kind an honourable member should never do either of two things. He should never treat a subject lightly, and he should endeavour to sugar-coat as much as possible the dose which he intends to administer. I have told honourable members a large number of facts, to which reply on their part is impossible; and if I have sugar-coated the dose a little and made it palatable to them, it is mutually satisfactory. Mr G. B. EDWARD S (South Sydney). - I have not spoken very often on this B in Committee, but in my speech, on the second reading of the previous Bill, I said that I felt there were involved in its de- tails certain great principles on which there would necessarily be a fight. We are now considering one of the most important clauses in the Bill, and I hope that Ministers will not think that those who cannot see eye to eye with them as to the necessity for adopting this principle are bent on the destruction of the measure. I trust that it will get through the House in some form, but it is in the consideration of these most important clauses that we are bound to give and take a little on each side, in order to produce a complete and workable Bill . To my mind, it is clear that if the Prime Minister and the Minister of External Affairs had had sufficient opportunity of considering the simple alternative suggested by the honourable member for North Sydney, it would have shown them a way to make the measure much more perfect than it is in its present form. It would do for them all that they desire to do in the Bill, and more than they will do under its operation. It would give them the complete unity of all those who are employed in trades or callings.",44
332,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,How can they get a list of all those who are employed in the shearing industry ? It is impossible.,44
333,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"Unde r the provisions of the clause suggested by my honourable friend, every pastoralist would be bound to return to an officer of the Court the name of every person who has been employed as a shearer for a certain time-for three months, or, if it is preferred, for only one week, and side by side with that return would come in the shearer's subscription towards his union. By that means two things would be accomplished. First, it would secure the names of the members of the organization, and, secondly, it would get rid of the complaint of unionists that while they subscribe money to make the conditions of work in their calling better, non-unionists, reap the benefit of their sacrifice. By that means all men would be' got into the union, and the expenses would be fairly divided, and we should have a body which could meet under rules framed for its guidance, to appoint its officers and elect' its committee, who would be responsible to the Court for bringing employers before it, and charged with the duty of replying to any case which might be brought forward by the other side. It would do all ill that the draftsmen of the Bill desire to do, and much more than can be accomplished under its provisions in their present form. Perhaps it is rather late in the day to propose an amendment of such magnitude, as it would mean the recasting of the measure. But it Offers such a great advantage over the present sions . that it would be wise . on the part of Ministers, I think, to keep open the way for adopting the principle before the Bill is passed through the Chamber.. To my mind the provision in regard to preference is one that is fraught with all sorts of difficulties. At the same time, I see that if preference were done away with it might lead to the breaking down of what is sought to be gained by unions. If there were no other way out of the difficulty I should be prepared as a last emergency to accept the Bill as it is. But I am bound to vote against this clause, or for any amendment in the direction of adopting the suggestion of the honourable member for North Sydney, because I believe that while the principle of preference may in some cases be necessary, it might without safeguards bring in its train all the bad effects which are feared by the opponents of this kind of legislation. In the first place, it must inevitably create a large body of what might be called economic pariahs-me n of lower caste-o r if another form of expression - be preferred, it would create an aristocracy of labour, and side by side with that aristocracy of labour we should have quite another class who would be out of everything. Of course it is urged against this idea by the Minister of External Affairs that there are three ways in which these economic pariahs could secure employment. First of all, he says, a man, if he is competent, can get in, because the clause contains the words ""other things being equal""; secondly, he may join the union, and so get in ; and thirdly, he may make an organization of his own, or join with others in creating such an organization, and thus get in. It is a most difficult thing fr.r an outsider who has the bitter feeling of the whole union against him to prove that he possesses, not only more competency, but even sufficient competency to get in. The reply will be made to the man, "" The only way in which you can make.yourself competent is by joining the union."" form of compulsion which, I think, ought not to be put on any man, particularly when we come to consider not alone the past history of these unions, but what they are tending to become. Shirk the conclusion as we may, unions are tending to become more or less political organizations. frequently a great difficulty in the way of the men joining the unions. Take some of the employers' unions in New South Wales. The Chamber of Manufac4T previ- tures - a body which I never joined, although I am a manufacturer - is a strongly protectionist political body, and, consequently, a free-trade manufacturer does not feel inclined to join it. Similarly, if there were in Sydney an organization of employers under this measure, I might find myself quite at variance with them. That would be the position of many of the working men connected with our various industries. A great number of men are quite opposed to the politics of the Labour Party, ancl are unwilling to join unions which are dominated by the political element. There are good reasons for thinking that the outsider would not have an opportunity to obtain employment. It has been suggested that such persons could unite and form unions of their own; but, if they did so, their applications to register would be opDOsed by the existing organizations with all the influence they possess. To show how harshly legislation of this sort might operate, I would like honourable members to consider the case of a farmer driven off his land by a drought, and compelled to go to a city, to obtain work. Such cases frequently occur. He might go down to one of the wharfs, and apply for work in the unloading of a vessel - unskilled - labour which a healthy farmer would have the strength for. and would naturally take up. But he would at once be met by a demand f ° J£5 r as a n entrance fee to the Wharf Labourers' Union. He would have to pav that sum to purchase the freedom to work for his bread. Perhaps compelled by special circumstances, he would pay the monev, and accept the work. But after a little while he might be thrown out of employment again, and looking round for something else to do. might see an opportunity to carry a bricklayer's hod. But he would again be met with a demand for an entrance fee of, sav, 30s.. to enable him to join the organization of hod carriers. Possibly he might pay the money and co That is a to work, and, later on, he might again be deprived of employment. Then he might see an opening as the driver of a lorry, work for which his farm experience would fit him. But again he would be met by the draymen's organization with a demand for an entrance fee of £ 3 or £ 4 . There is Honourable members may say that the fees I have named are too high, but my reply is that the tendency will be to make them high. If we provide for the creation of close corporations the entrance fees will inevitably become larger and larger, until the unskilled worker, the man who belongs to the most hopeless class in the community, whom we should try to protect more than any other, will have nearly every opportunity of earning a living taken from him. While I am in favour of settling disputes by arbitration, ancl am committed to the general principles of the Bill, I think that the Committee should consider the matter very gravely before agreeing to adopt the principle of preference to unionists; because the adoption of that' principle will inevitably do great injustice to those who are not members of unions, and clo not desire to become so. The honourable member for North Sydney has pointed out that the corollary to the principle of preference is the rule that the last to come shall be the first to go, and he was right in saying that the adoption of that rule will stamp out all individual effort at improvement, because the last man appointed will know that, however well he does his work, and whatever his ability, he must be the first to go if .any dismissals are resolved upon.",44
334,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"That rule has been adopted in one case only, and there the men to whom it is applied are paid for piecework. Mr - G. B. EDWARDS - Quite so. No doubt it is not quite so objectionable in that case; but we cannot put. powers of this kind into the hands of persons whom self-interest prompts to have them used without having them abused. I cannot see why those who desire the measure to pass cannot adopt the alternative that has been offered. The rule that the last to come shall be the first to go is so absurd that one cannot understand how any person possessed of the sense of justice could wish to embody it in legislation.",46
335,Mr WATSON,Unknown,It has not been embodied in legislation; it is only an award of the Court.,46
336,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"If such a principle were applied to this Legislature, could we expect to have imparted to our proceedings a higher tone or a better intellectual character? Or we might imagine it being applied to our gaols. There is as much logic in one application as in another. The best judge of a man's capacity is the person who employs him. and the employer should determine who shall be the first to go. Seeing the injustice which the provision under discussion may inflict upon the weakest ancl most helpless of our workers, and remembering the possibility of accomplishing all that we desire without it, I think that the Committee should treat the matter very gravely. The Minister of External Affairs has told us that we have no right to consider legislation of this kind at all if we will not adopt the principle of preference. But that is quite a wrong view. We are bound to consider the interests of the working classes as a whole, and are providing for the settlement and prevention of disputes for the benefit of the whole nation. We can do that in the best way by adopting the suggestion of the honourable member for North Sydney, making all the workers in an industry members of an organization, and using their contributions to pay the expense of settling disputes. In that way we may get rid of what is perhaps the greatest element of bitterness in the present relations of employers and employees. At the present time, the fact stares us in the face that the majority of the workers are not unionists. I do not think that the figures given by the honourable ' member for Richmond-that only one man in seven is a unionist-ar e to be relied upon ",46
337,Mr EWING,Unknown,I got them from the Government Statist of New South Wales.,46
338,Mr SKENE,Unknown,Onl y one man in every four at Broken Hill is a unionist.,46
339,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"I think that those figures are more suitable, because in Broken Hill there is practically only one industry. In comparing the unionists with the rest of the population, it must be remembered that there are very many persons-book-makers , errand boys, and others - wh o are not connected in any way with the various industries to which the members of unions belong. If we make all engaged in an industry members of an organization, and empower them to appoint representatives, I think disputes will be more easy of settlement, because the Court will know that the whole body of workers concerned is represented, while at the same time we shall get rid of the objection that we are making, use of what are, more or less, political organizations to carry out legislation dealing with economical and social problems.",46
340,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown," I agree th.at the question which the Committee is now discussing is one of the most important with which we have had to deal in connection with this Bill ; and it is one to which, I apprehend, the fullest consideration that honourable members can give will not be objected to. For my part, I do not approve of the principle contained in the paragraphs now under discussion. I do not approve of the principle whereby this Parliament, or any Parliament, gives a preference in relation to employment to one class of men over other men who may be equally worthy - I hold that it is improper for this Parliament or any Parliament, to say to any workman, "" Unless you are a member of a certain union, your chance of earning your living will be less than it would be if you were a member of that organization."" To my mind, such a law is an unwarrantable interference with the rights of individuals. Not that I am one of those who believe that compulsion is always wrong. I think that the compulsion of an individual, for the benefit of the majority of the whole community, is in many cases desirable. But I certainly do not think that it is desirable in the interest of the community to say to a certain number of men, "" We will endeavour to make your task inearning your living as hard as possible, unless you join a certain organization, which you do not wish to join of your own free will."" Th.at is the principle upon which this paragraph is founded. It is a provision which seeks to compel employees to enter organizations by putting disabilities upon them, if they do not join. A grave and serious disability is cast upon employees unless they become members of unions. The onus of proving that that is justified, and that the extreme measure proposed is warrantable, lies upon those who support it. I think I can say without undue exaggeration that, so far, at any rate, as the weight of authoritygoes, it has been on the side of those who oppose the provision. In practice we find this principle to be very injurious in its effects. I have certain information which I propose to put before honourable members which will, I think, show that the actual working of a similar provision to this has produced mischief and injustice, and that,' therefore, it is extremely likely that mischief and injustice will be produced if we pass the paragraph as it stands. It has been stated - I think that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat was one of those who said so - that the Arbitration in New South Wales, and tration Courts generally, do' not give a preference to unionists, unless there is some very grave special why that preference should be given; such a reason as that the majority of the employees concerned are members 4T2 of a union. I think I can prove conclusively that preference to unionists has been granted in New South Wales, where the unionists were not a majority of those affected by an industrial award. Thereby a minority has obtained a special privilege over a majority, the rights of the majority have been infringed, and the status of the minority has been improved by legislative act.",46
341,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The honourable member's own union has, of course, certain privileges i",47
342,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,"I am not aware of the existence of any union to which I belong. But I belong to a profession which any man can enter if he has the necessary brains and the necessary application. The Minister of External Affairs is one of the bright and shining examples of what industry and ability can effect in this respect. The same course as he has taken is open to every other honourable member. Even the honourable member for Melbourne Ports might, I believe, in course of time-^-in a long time, possibly-attai n to such a position as the Minister of External A f fairs has reached. I propose to give some instances to show that the contention that the principle of preference to unionists has always been exercised in favour of the majority of those affected is not correct. I wish first to deal with the case of the bread-carters; ancl I may say that, for this purpose, I have carefully perused the reports of the New ' South Wales Court of Arbitration, and for every statement that I make relating to cases in New South Wales, I am prepared to give chapter and verse, when called upon. In that case the evidence showed- I am reading from the judgmentthat the members of the union and the non-unionists in the bread-carting trade were about evenly divided. The union, of course, claimed, as they claim in nearly every dispute that comes before the Court, a preferenceThe union's claim was that the employer should only employ a non-union carter on condition that the said non-union carter joins the union within one month, at fees not exceeding ios. nominaCourt tion, and rs. per week. Arbi- That seems to me to be a grossly excessive sum to compel men to pay. As a matter of fact, preference was given to the unionreason ists ; and the result, therefore, was that a large number of men-a n equal number of men with those who were in the unionwere put at a disadvantage. But they were 55 6 Conciliation and [REPRESENTATIVES.] put at a further disadvantage. There this important point in the judgment. was decided thatany non-unionist carter hereafter entering the employ of the respondentthat is the employershall join the bread-carters' union at or before the end of one month from the date of his entering the employment, provided the entrance fee to the union does not exceed 5s., and the weekly contribution does not exceed 6d. That is to say, while it was provided that any man hereafter going in for bread-carting should join the union, it was also provided that any non-unionist who went from one employer to another should join the union. The Judge saidThis condition does not apply to those who are already in employment; but to illustrate it, if a bread-carter in Mr Langer's employ should apply to Mr Law for employment, then Mr. Law would be bound to apply this condition to the bread-carter. That - is to say,, the practical operation of this award is to force a man who is a bread-carter into a union whether he likes it or not. Whether the objects of the union - eve n its industrial objects-mee t with his approval or not, he is to be forced into it. That was a case in which the union did not claim, and could not claim, that it represented a majority of those in the trade. All that it could claim was that it represented an equal number. Yet the unionists were given a preference-a n improper preference, in my opinion-ove r those who were not members of the union. case of the dispute between the Barrier Branch of the Amalgamated Miners' Association and the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, which is reported in Volume II . of the cases decided by the New South Wales Arbitration Court, the union claimed a preference. In this particular case the facts are striking, as showing to what lengths unions are prepared to go. The case against preference is set out by Mr Cruickshank. on page 546, and the facts stated by him were agreed upon by all parties. Cruickshank saysRespecting preference to unionists, I differ from my colleagues, and for the following reasons :-In this dispute, all the other issues were filed a long time before the hearing, and this particular demand for "" preference"" was never considered or thought of until after the Court arrived at Broken Hill , and was evidently the suggestion of somebody after the Court opened. That is to say, this particular claim for preference was a readied-up claim, after the Mr Robinson. Arbitration Bill. was real crux of the matter had been put before It the Court. Therefore, the natural inference is (and such' inference is supported by the evidence), that up to date there has been no trouble, and there would be no likelihood of any, provided things were allowed to remain undisturbed. There are about 6,000 men employed in or about the Broken Hill mines; 4,000 are non-unionists, and 2,000 are members of the union. Yet those 2,000 members of the union claimed preference over 4,000 non-unionists.",47
343,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,That is an ex parte statement.,48
344,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,"It is a statement by the Court. The honourable member has been singing the praises of the Court for the last three weeks, but when a statement is made by the Court which tells against him, he will not take it on trust.",48
345,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,What did the Court decide ?,48
346,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,"That there should be a preference to unionists. If the honourable member^vill look up the figures relating to trades unions, issued on authority by the Government Printer of New South Wales, he will find that the facts are as stated in this judgment-that the number of men in this union was a little over 2,000. Indeed, the facts stated in Mr. Cruickshank's judgment are admitted. It is a fact that is not denied that the unionists, were a minority; and the figures issued by the New South Wales Government Printer, and certified by the Registrar of the Unions, show that the members of the BarI n the rier Branch of the Amalgamated Miners' Association were only about one-third of the total number of the men employed in the mines.  ber say that there are 6,000 men employed' there ?",48
347,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,What did the Judge say?,48
348,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,"The Judge gave a preference to unionists in that case. All that I am endeavouring to prove from these facts, is that a preference is frequently Mr given to a minority. That is my whole position upon this point. That is to say, a minority of the employees obtained a preference over the majority. If the honourable gentleman still doubts the statement, and thinks that a member of the Court was lying, I will refer him to the figures taken from the reports issued by the Registrar of Trades Unions, which show that the Barrier Branch of the Amalgamated Miners' Association had 1,200 members in 1002. In September, 1.903, they had about 2,000 members. As an honourable member appears to doubt my statement that there were 6,000 men employed in the mines, I may state that I find that the President of the Court-the Judge- says, in his very opening sentences, that "" about 6,000 men are simultaneously employed at the mines"" - proving my statement to be absolutely correct. In that case, I say again, a preference was given to a union which included only a minority of those employed in. the industry. Then there was the case of the New South Wales Saddle and Harness Makers' Trades Society.' The members of that industrial union obtained a preference. At the time of the award, in 1903, the union embraced 208 members all told. The total number of men working for employers who had over five hands engaged was 550; but as the award applied to all employers, even though they only kept one hand at work, the award affected between 1,000 and 1,500 men. Therefore, the 208 members of the-union secured a preference over a large majority of the workmen engaged in the trade. These the& cases establish the proposition which I have been endeavouring to prove, namely, that in a number of cases preference has been given to unionists who represent only a small minority of the employees. Another reason why I object to preference being given to unionists is that when undue power is placed in the hands of any class or section of the community, or in the hands of individuals, there is an ineradicable tendency to use it oppressively. History teems with examples in proof of this assertion, and the records of the trades unions offer no contradiction. The preference for unionists has been used in the most cruel and unjust fashion in New South Wales, and I propose to quote some cases in order that the significant facts may be brought within the knowledge of the Committee. I shall first refer to that magnificent organization which extends over the whole of Australia, and which is presided over by the Minister of External AffairsAloft in awful state the godlike hero sits, would probably describe his manner of presiding over them. The Wharf Labourers' Union, of which we know the honourable and learned member is very proud, obtained a preference for its members over non-unionists. I am not now discussing whether or not such preference could be justified on any grounds. Possibly it might be justified, because the. honourable and learned member belonged to the union.",48
349,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Does the honourable and learned member know that, so far as Sydney is concerned, there were no wharf labourers outside the Wharf Labourers' Union ?",49
350,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,When ?,49
351,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Before the award was given there were none.,49
352,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,"This precious Wharf Labourers' Union wished to hamper, as far as possible, the admission of individuals into its ranks. That is the only way in - which we can read their application to the Arbitration Court in December, 1902. We know that since then the union has endeavoured to prevent men from joining it. The facts of the case are set out in a letter to the Sydney Morning Herald, signed by W. Briggs and J. Crameri. These men afterwards made affidavits that were filed in the Arbitration Court. Their letter reads as follows : Finding, since the constitution of the Arbitration Court, that preference regarding all work must be given to unionists, I and others were desirous of becoming members of the above union, so as to-be able to continue working without being molested as non-unionists, as the Wharf Labourers' Union covered the work that we were following up at the time. I , therefore, with four others, proceeded to the union meeting room to have ourselves proposed as members, and to pay the entrance-fee and yearly subscription, which amounts to £ 1 in all ; ios. for entrance, and ios. for a year's subscription in advance. Well, when we made application at the door for admission, we were told that we would not be able lo join; I asked the reason why, and I was told that the books were closed against the admission of any new members whatever. - When asked as to how long they were likely to be closed, I was told by the doorkeeper that he could not tell me. Well, sir, .we tried several times for admission after this, and always received the same answeT at the door from the man in charge. I then thought that the best thing to do would be lo go and see the secretary himself at his office in Erskine-street, which I forthwith did on the following day. I asked him if there was any chance of joining the union so as I could continue on with my work, and he said no, there was not, as the books were closed, and he did not know when they would be opened; in fact, he said we had no hope of joining, thereby absolutely prohibiting us from earning a livelihood, while our employer then was and is still wiling for us to work, if we could only manage to obtain the union medal, without which no man,- be he ever so good a citizen, let alone a native of the land he lives in, can do any work in this lovely city of ours called Sydney. I may here state also that I put the question to Mr Harrison, the secretary of the Wharf Labourers' Union, viz. :- "" Is your union legally justified in closing their books in this manner, to the utter exclusion of all men desirous of 1 becoming members?"" The answer I received was : "" That is for you to find out."" He then turned on his heel and left me. That was all the satisfaction we got from him, when asking for what we deem is the right of every citizen of this labour-ridden State-the right to become members of any labour union, should we desire it, and were willing to pay the ruling fees as to entrance. The Arbitration Court says that employers must give preference to unionists under a penalty, therefore, that being the case, no man should be debarred from qualifying himself as a unionist if he so wishes. Subsequently affidavits were made and filed in the Arbitration Court, and on Monday last Wm. Briggs, Joseph Crameri, and George Holmes, in their affidavits, stated thatIn February they together proceeded to the registered meeting room of the union in St. Philip's Schoolroom, Church Hill , Sydney, having previously arranged with Charles Jackson, a linancial member of the union, to propose their admission to membership and arrange a seconder. They applied for admission, but were informed that they would not be able to join, and that the books were closed to the admission of any new members whatsoever. Holmes and Briggs attended several times at later meetings, to be told on each occasion that the books were closed. When these facts came before the Court, it expressed itself as astounded at the monstrous injustice of the union presided over by the Minister of External Affairs, and ordered that the books should be opened, and that new members should be put on the books without the necessity of an election nr a ballot of any kind whatever. The Court stated that the union had practically admitted that it had committed a wrong, because about three weeks previ-, ously it had opened its books. So that it is clear it kept the books closed for a considerable time for the express purpose of debarring certain men from earning their living, and only opened them when it was forced to do so.",49
353,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Does the honourable and learned member know that the members of the Seamen's Union, ancl of the Waterside Labourers' Federation, numbering 11,000, could transfer to the Wharf Labourers' Union at any time?",50
354,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,What is the use of saying '.hat the members of another union could join the wharf labourers' organization ? What I say is that the union has endeavoured to take the bread out of the mouths of men who were not unionists.,50
355,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Is not the bread taken out of the mouths of the unionists if others get the work?,50
356,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,"On e class should not have a preference over another. The unionists were endeavouring to prevent those outside their organization from earning a living, and the judgment of the Court that their action was tyrannical and unjustifiable, affords conclusive proof that I was correct in my contention. Now I wish to refer to a very extraordinary case, in order to show that if too great a"" power is given to any individuals or groups of individuals they are bound to use it oppressively if they get a chance. It is the old story that "" eternal vigilance is the price of liberty."" I refer to the case of the boat Kiama. The steamer Kiama belongs to the Kiama Road Metal Company, and is usually employed in bringing road metal to Sydney. She was recently chartered by the Southern Coal Owners' Association to load a cargo of coal, to be discharged into the s.s. Wyandra. When the Kiama arrived, the Coal Lumpers' Union refused to carry the coal, on the ground that the men usually engaged in discharging metal were non-unionists. The objection was based, not on the ground that the coal-lumpers - were required to work with non-unionists, but on the fact that the men usually engaged in discharging road metal were non-unionists. The owners of the Kiama had engaged members of the Coal Lumpers' Union to discharge the coal; but when the boat arrived they refused to do the work. The men usually employed in discharging metal had, some months previously, tried to join the union, and paid the entrancefees. They were told, however, by the unionists, that they would be blackballed, because the union was determined not to admit more members; hence they. withdrew their applications. Now, as I wish to be fair, and to give both sides in this matter, I shall read the full official answer given by the secretary of the Coal Lumpers' Union, Mr A. D . MCDonald. This letter will show to what straits some people are driven in order to justify an improper position.  member has described take place under this Bill ?",50
357,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,Yes . ,50
358,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,"Mr MCDonald writes as follows: Permit me to contradict the statement made by the acting secretary of the Southern Coal Owners' Asociation, re the blackballing of the non-unionists who work in-the steamer Kiama, by the Sydney Coal Lumpers' Union. When that steamer first came to Port Jackson,- and was about to enter into the coal trade, I , in company with other omcers of this union, used every endeavour to get the non-union men, who followed the steamer Civility (of the same firm as the Kiama), to join the union. The men, after a great deal of persuasion, promised to join, and went so far as to be nominated, when all at once they found out that the union rate of wages would not be paid, and, when they had joined the union, their services might be dispensed with, other non-unionists being got to do the work, thereby leaving them on the already overcrowded labour market to do the best they could. Now, sir, I must characterize this statement of the acting secretary of the Owners' Association as nothing more or less than a misrepresentation of the position. These men never came up for ballot, although nominated, so therefore could not have been blackballed. With reference to the discharging of the Kiama, I may point out that the members of this union have too long been made a convenience - of by stevedores, and are always first to maintain industrial peace and existing conditions with all employers. This does not give the acting secretary of the Owners' Association much credit for such misleading statements to the public. I am, & c , Secretary The Sydney Coal Lumpers' Union. June 2. _ Mr BAMFORD - What has the Court done since ?",50
359,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,"The Court had no jurisdiction. In the first place, the secretary of the Coal Lumpers' Union has made a number of statements, which, as I shall show, are absolutely incorrect. He stated that the men found out that the union rate of wages would not be paid. That is wholly untrue. Then be said that they feared that when they had joined the union their services might be dispensed with, and that other non-unionists would be got to - do the work. That again is absolutely untrue. Members, of this union were the only persons who desired that the services of these men should he dispensed with. I propose to read some extracts from a letter written by Mr Salmond, managing director of the Kiama Road Metal Company, and published in the Sydney Morning Herald of 6th inst., and also from a letter sent to the same journal by Mr F. J. Thomas, the charterer of the steamer in question. Mr Thomas in dealing with the Kiama episode, wroteFirstly, I did not assert the Kiama non-unionists were blackballed at a ballot, but, being ted for membership, they withdrew at the moment for the best of reasons-that a proportion of them would undoubtedly be blackballed (an indignity they could not be'expected to mit to), and they with the instincts of true hood, loyally stood by each other and withdrew their nominations. Officials of the union on being asked if , in the event of a proportion of these sixteen men (some of whom had served Mr Salmond, of the Kiama Road Metal Co., for fourteen years, others for eight years, and by dexterity, sobriety, and faithful services have proved their efficiency; also having wives ancl families to support) being rejected by the union, although possessing all these qualifications as efficient workmen, would they expect the Kiama Road Metal Company to dismiss these rejected ones, and replace them by present members of the union, admitted that must of necessity be the result. No honourable employer, appreciating the value of faithful and efficient workmen, could so degrade his manliness as to treat men like that. I think most honourable members will agree with the sentiment expressed in the last sentence. The letter continuesSecondly, I have today seen the contract made between the Kiama Road Metal Company and the stevedore engaging these men, which expressly stipulates that union rates of wages must be paid to the workmen, which contract was in force at the time these men applied for admission ; which fact entirely subverts the secretary's statement that all at once they found out the union rates of wages would not be paid, and on A. D. MCDONALD, becoming unionists their services would be dispensed with. The simple truth of the matter is that the employers desired the men to join the union, and gave every encouragement to do so. Lastly. Regarding the episode of discharging the Kiama, while giving due credit to the patience and long suffering of the union in waiting for a favourable opportunity, and recognising the fine sense of equity and justice displayed by them in maintaining industrial peace, and existing conditions with all employers, still I might be pardoned if I suggest what might have conduced more to that end. This steamer had carried cargoes of coal for us before, within the last few weeks. Union men were always engaged to handle it, and I heard no objection raised, or any intimation that it was not working to the satisfaction of the coal lumpers. Then, without previous warning, industrial war is declared, and in the most arbitrary manner, we (having in all good faith engaged a steamer under contract to supply another shipping concern with coal for a mail steamer) are compelled to break that engagement and have a chartered steamer thrown on our hands, together with a cargo of coals, banned against discharge, a position absolutely without remedy, from which we were rescued only by the generous conduct of the proprietor in buying the coal for himself, and releasing us of the engagement of freight.",51
360,Mr KNOX,Unknown,Did this occur after the passing of the New South Wales Arbitration Act?,51
361,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,"Yes ; it occurred at nominathe end of May or the beginning of the last present month. I do not wish to lay anv stress on the loss which the employer was subcompelled to suffer, because I recognise that mana consideration of that kind would not receive much sympathy in certain quarters. But I would lay special stress on the injustice done to other workers. The letter from Mr Salmond, managing director of the Kiama Road Metal Company, set forth thatPrevious to the arrival of the s.s. Kiama from Glasgow in December, 1902, the gang of lumpers working the steamer Civility with stone cargoes were advised by our stevedore and by myself personally to endeavour to become members of the Coal Lumpers' Union, because we intended to work the new steamer in the coal and stone trade as business offered. With that object in view, eight of the gang went up for nomination, and paid their entrance fees. Prior to the'allotted period- a fortnight before the ballot-elapsin g one of the gang had a conversation with a friend as to his proposer and seconder, and he was told that if any individual members of the union acted prominently they would afterwards be debarred from work,' and as a matter of fact the men say that there was evidently no intention of the union accepting them as members. At any rate, it was asserted that there would be a few of them refused on account of the action they took during the 1890 strike by working this company's vessels then. Another of the men was told that whoever were accepted as members of the union would have to leave the s.s. Kiama and "" stand on the corner and take his chance with the rest."" On these conditions the men naturally withdrew their applications. This company contracts with a stevedore to discharge cargo, and has a properly drawn out agreement and specifications as to the manner in which work has to be performed. One of the clauses of the specification reads thus :- "" Current and, union rate of wages to be paid to the workmen employed by the contractor. If it shall at any time be proved to the satisfaction of the manager that a lesser rate than the union rate has been paid to .the workmen employed, and the contractor refuses to pay such rates, then the manager shall be at liberty to cancel the contract."" The stevedore employs constantly sixteen men. These men have been under m y supervision for from eight to fourteen years, and are as good a gang of men as can be found where, and will compare against an .equal number of picked men from the union. dore is classed by the men to be as fair as any man can be. The men in conversation with state that they make more money in the Kiama than they would under any union rules. I say that Mr MCDonald js simply juggling with word ""nomination,"" for the nomination is only the preliminary. With reference to what occurred on Monday, 30th May, when the steamer Kiama was ready to discharge cargo to the steamer Wyandra, the union lumpers refused to work, although on several previous occasions they had done so. We were taken wholly by surprise. In an interview with Mr MCDonald who is the secretary of the Coal Lumpers' Unionat 2.30 p.m. on that day, I begged of him to reconsider the position, as I would guarantee that the men would join if the union would accept Mr Robinson. them. He said he had just come from an executive meeting called to consider the case, and his men had agreed that the Kiama must work union, which literally meant that I would have to discharge sixteen able-bodied men, who have worked under me for from eight to fourteen years, and employ sixteen men from the union, whom I had never seen before. Had I taken the .line of least resistance I would have told my sixteen men to clear out, their only fault being that the Lumpers' Union would not accept them as members. My company was put to very great expense, and the difficulties I had to contend with cannot be treated of in the dimensions of such a letter as you would publish. This is a further proof of the injustice that may be perpetrated when the advantage of an unduly strong position is given to members of a union. This was a deliberate attempt to prevent a number of men from earning a livelihood, and a deliberate attempt, which, unfortunately, was successful, to inflict a heavy nnancial loss on an employer who had for a number of years employed a number of sober and reputable workers.",51
362,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Is the honourable and learned member aware that this practice was, unfortunately, in force for a number of years before the New South Wales Act came into operation?",52
363,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,What practice?,52
364,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The practice of preventing any one outside a union from working the traffic, and also of refusing admission to new members for a considerable period. The facts referred to by the honourable and 'learned member are no argument against the Act.",52
365,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,The honourable gentleman does not see the point.,52
366,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I certainly do.,52
367,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,Thes e men were nol anyasked to work alongside non-unionists. The steve- ' Mr WATSON - Quite so.,52
368,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,"But having entered mc into a contract to unload a boat in which - none but themselves would be concerned, the they said tp the employer, ""We will not do this work, because at some previous time you had non-unionists working for you.""",52
369,Mr WATSON,Unknown,That is - no argument against the Act.,52
370,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,"It is an evidence of absolute oppression, and every honourable member who values his liberty, and the liberty of his fellow citizens, should endeavour to prevent the recurrence of such incidents.",52
371,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The practice came into operation before the New South Wales Act came into existence.,52
372,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,"The honourable gentleman, and those who support him, are now endeavouring, to give a preference tc the organization which was guilty of thk practice, in order that its position may be made stronger than ever.",53
373,Mr WATSON,Unknown,No .,53
374,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,"If this provision is rot designed to place unions and unionists in a stronger position than ever, what is its object? Is it intended to weaken or strengthen their position?",53
375,Mr WATSON,Unknown,To give the Court the power.,53
376,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,It has been placed in the Bill for only one purpose - to strengthen the hands of one section of the community. Any one can see that that is so.,53
377,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Any one like the honourable and learned member can do so.,53
378,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,The Prime Minister can also see that that is the object of the provisionHe is not so thick-headed as he would have us believe.,53
379,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,"I wish to show the' arbitrary way in which this preference system frequently works by quoting one or two decisions of the New South Wales Arbitration Court. The first is In re Bull, reported in volume 2, part IV., page 335, of the New South Wales Arbitration Reports. It deals with the position of undertakers- a subject about which some honourable members were disposed to be facetious when it was previously uncler discussion, although I dp not know why men engaged in the undertaking trade should not have the privileges that are accorded to others. The heading of the case reads as follows :Under the preference clause in the undertakers' award, an employer, except in cases of emergency, is not justified in engaging a non-unionist without applying to the secretary of the employees' union to ascertain whether any competent union labour is available. That is to say, an employer is not to engage the best man he can obtain, but is to interview the secretary of the employees union and ascertain whether he can take on a man. The facts of this case disclose a very harsh proceeding. A man who was riot a unionist was engaged, and an endeavour was made to induce him to join the union. He took steps to do so, but occupied a little more time than he should have done in arranging the preliminaries. On the first occasion' that he proposed to join he did not have sufficient funds to pay the necessary contribution, but a few days later he was proposed as a member. His employer, however, was brought before the Court for employing a non-unionist, and was punished for the offence. I shall now refer to the case of In re Byrnes, reported in the same volume, page 349. The heading sets forth thatA master undertaker may employ a non-unionist in a case of emergency, but cannot retain him permanently in his employ without making reasonable efforts to secure a competent unionist. In other words, a man may employ a non-unionist in order' to tide himself over an emergency, but as soon as that emergency has passed the man who has assisted him is to be dismissed and a unionist engaged. This was an extremely harsh case. A coachman employed to take charge of a hearse had suddenly to leave his employment, and as there was a funeral to be carried out on the day of his departure, it was necessary to at once engage somebody to take his place. It was decided that in employing a non-unionist for the day in question he had not transgressed the law, but for continuing to retain him after the emergency had passed he was held to be only one remove from a criminal, and was fined, notwithstanding that he had sent the man to the secretary of the union and, had personally called on that officer, and endeavoured to get the man into the organization. It will thus be seen that a provision bf this kind leads to oppression.",53
380,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Thes e cases occurred under an exactly similar provision in the New South Wales Act.,53
381,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,"This case was brought under a section of the Act in which preference is given to a unionist. As an example of the way in which a trade - may be injured and hampered-by such a provision as this, let me quote the case of the Journeymen Coopers v. The Vacuum Oil Company, reported in vol. 2, part III . , page 253. The Vacuum Oil Company imports kerosene from America, and large quantities of the liquid are placed in casks. I suppose that every honourable member who has ever had a barrel of liquid in his possession knows that, owing to the weather and other causes, hoops sometimes become loose. The - Vacuum Oil Company had the temerity to employ a boy at a wage of something like £ 1 per week to go round with a hammer and tighten the loose hoops, and for that the Company was brought before the Arbitration Court, which held that a duly licensed cooper must be employed, and that that cooper must be a member of the union. I also wish to refer to the case of the Southern Collieries Proprietors' Association, reported in volume 2, - part 1, page 8. This was the case in which it was ruled, as it seems to me in absolute opposition to all reason and justice, that the last to come should be the first to gothat the man who had had the least employment' should be "" thrown out "" first. That plea was put forward by the secretary of the union, Mr Ritchie, who wrote the mine-owners a letter, in which notice was given that in the future, when it became necessary to shorten hands the miners would insist that the last to come should be the fiist to go. . Mr. Ritchie appears to be an individual who required severe checking by the Court. He made grossly untrue statements, which he got published in the daily press, and he had to apologize to the Court, by whom he was severely censured, for ' making those statements with a view to influence the decision. This shows that the legalization of preference to a union of this kind must lead Fo the further oppression of those who happen to be out of the organization. It shows how this claim for preference must work; and in this - connection I desire to refer to' two cases relating to musicians. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat stated yesterday that he intended to propose an amendment providing that unions must have rules under which facilities are given for the admission of new members.",53
382,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"An amendment providing be allowed. for facilities for the admission of new members, for no interference by administration with admission being given effect to, and, further, for continuance of membership without oppressive treatment.",54
383,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,"In regard to the last point of oppressive treatment, I think I can show the Committee the necessity for some very stringent legislation. There have been cases in which unions, to whom no preference has been given by the Court, have endeavoured to make matters extremely unpleasant for individuals who were not members. The musicians, who delight us at the theatres with their overtures, appealed against Mr J. C. Williamson for an order giving preference to members of their union; but the Court refused to make such an order, and dismissed the petition. That, however, did not worry the members of the union, who proceeded to take other steps. There was a member of .the union who played in an orchestra in which a man was employed who had committed the heinous crime of not joining a union; and because of this the member of the union was fined, by the Musicians' Union, 5s. for playing with a non-unionist. He was sued before the Arbitration Court, and the Court enforced the fine with costs. It is, therefore, evident that some provision must be made to prevent any action of that kind in the f u ture- If this power be left to the unions uncontrolled  worse and get off scot free.",54
384,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,That may be the honourable member's experience; it is not mine. In this particular case the sole reason that the Musicians' Association asked for a preference was most amusing. Because Mr J. C. Williamson,54
385,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Who had to ""back down "" eventually.",54
386,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,"Because Mr J. C. Williamson employed in his Sydney orchestra two Victorians, who were members of the Victorian union but not of the New South Wales union, the latter asked the Court to give a preference. When beaten on that point, the New South Wales Musi' cians' Union made it as "" hot "" as possible for any man who played with a non-: unionist.",54
387,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Is a Sydney barrister allowed to plead in a Victorian Court ?,54
388,Mr WATSON,Unknown,That would certainly not,54
389,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,That is a cruel question to ask.,54
390,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I have several times asked for order; but it seems - to me that no attention is paid to the request. It is absolutely necessary, in order that the business may be done expeditiously as well as thoroughly, that attention should be given to the remarks of an honourable member who is addressing the Chair. I ask every honourable member to assist me in keeping order, 50 that we may get on with the business. I may point out that we are in Committee, and if any honourable member hears any remark to which he would like to reply, the proper time is when he gets his opportunity to address Ihe Committee.",54
391,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,"I was about to say' that some very stringent provision, such as the honourable and learned member for Ballarat has indicated, is necessary in order to prevent the oppressive treatment of men' who have, notwithstanding the disabilities' placed on them, refused to enter unions. This is a matter to which I think the Committee should give their most serious attention. The Minister of External Affairs was, as usual, very entertaining yesterday when defending this particular clause; but we extracted from him a promise that the. Government would insert a provision against persons being prevented from joining unions. I am glad to see repentance even at this late stage.",54
392,Mr WATSON,Unknown,That remark is most unfair ; I expressed the same opinion fourteen years ago. .,55
393,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,"I am glad to see that the remarks of the Judge of the Arbitration Court are to bear good fruit, even in this Bill . Of course, we are told that this provision is the very essence of the measure, but we have been told that so often in regard to so many other clauses, that one scarcely knows whether or not to believe the statement. The Minister of External Affairs dwelt at great length on the enormous sacrifices which unions are making under the Bill, and on the little they ask in return. It is most extraordinary that if the unions are making such enormous sacrifices, they should be besieging Parliament to permit them to do sounions did not think they were going to get a great deal more than they give, they would not be in favour of the Bill for one moment; nor would any one else, because it is only human nature for men to endeavour to obtain the best they can for themselves. The Minister of External Affairs told us that, under the Bill, a unionist could not decline to work with a non-unionist. I presume the same was said in New South Wales; yet in the case musicians, we see that a man - was actually fined 5s., with costs, for working with a non-unionist. In the Kiama case, unionists actually refused to work, not because they were asked to work with non-unionists, but because non-unionists had previously been employed on the vessel. We are that unionists cannot, in a body, refuse to work; but that seems rather a wide assertion which the Minister would do well to moderate. I think it was pretty well laid down in the Teralba case, that all that was necessary was for unionists to give a fortnight's notice, in which case they could leave in a body. All that unionists give up is the right to leave their employment without notice, and nothing on earth can stop them from exercising that right, short of dragooning, and I do not suppose that that is proposed.",55
394,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Employer s have exactly the same right.,55
395,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,An employer has the right to shut up his works and 'allow his machinery to rust.,55
396,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,An employer may discharge each employee if adequate notice be given.,55
397,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,"In this respect there is no comparison whatever between' employer and employed. An employer's machinery must, in the vast majority of cases, be kept in use if he desires to maintain his position. We were told, further, by the Minister that non-unionists suffer no disability under this clause. If that be so, why have unions in the particular cases which have come before the New South Wales Arbitration Court, asked that there shall be a disability? Why have unions asked for special preference ? It is-because they desire, when work is short, that they shall have the most, and non-unionists the least, advantage.  the honourable and learned member a personal injury ? If the Mr ROBINSON - No . When men have discussed the question with me, and have asked my opinion, I have always advised them to join unions, which, it seems to me, have, in Great Britain and in Australia, done most valuable work, and, I think, will do much valuable work in the future. But what I object to is compulsory preference given by Act of Parliament. It is wrong that members of a union should by law have an advantage over men outsideof the that men who do not wish to belong to unions should be forced to join. Large £1 is. numbers of men in Victoria receive benefits from friendly societies. The society to which 1 belong, the A.N.A., comprises thousands of workmen, as also does the Manchester Unity Independent Order of Oddfellows. Members of such societies want told further no financial benefits which trades unions can offer, because - their own associations are far stronger financially, and have their funds invested in the most careful fashion. Why, therefore, should men, who do not desire sick benefit or other similar advantages, be forced by this Bill into joining a union, when they prefer to retain their individual liberty?  do for wages, in any case?",55
398,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,"The A.N.A. does not profess to do anything for wages, but to provide for men in their hour of sickness, and for widows in their hour of need. It does not follow that those who object to this provision say that every act of a union must be* oppressive and unjust. do - say, however, that to make a discrimination in favour of either employers or employed must have an injurious, effect. I firmly believe that if the majority of employers were, for the time being, put in the position of workmen, and given a preference, they would act just as tyrannically as the workmen propose to do. We who oppose this provision say there is a great principle at stake; that this is an undue interference with individual - liberty; that the Bill endeavours to take away from men the right to earn their living as best they can. In our opinion, the Bill gives to a section, and, as I have shown in the cases quoted, a small section, an undue advantage over men who are not members of an organization. A few months ago a special Commissioner from the Department of Commerce and Labour, Washington, USA., visited Australia, and wrote a report on the labour conditions and the Arbitration Act of New Zealand. He discussed that Act exhaustively, and wound up with these words, which seem to me words of common sense, applicable to the present circumstances:The right to remain at work where others have ceased to work, or to engage anew in work which others have abandoned, is part of the personal liberty of a citizen that can never be surrendered, and every infringement theri-of merits, and should receive, the stern denouncement of the law. All government implies restraint, and it is not less, but more, necessary in self-governed communities than in others, to compel restraint of the passions pf men which make for disorder and lawlessness. Our language is the language of a free people, and fails to furnish any form of speech by which the right of a citizen to work when he pleases, for whom he pleases, and on what terms he pleases, can be successfully denied. The common-sense of our people, as well as the common law, forbids that this right should be assailed with impunity. It is vain to say that the man who remains at work while others cease to work, or takes the place of one who has abandoned his work, helps to defeat the aspirations of men who seek to obtain better recompense for their labour, and better conditions of life. Approval. of the object of a strike, or persuasion that its purpose is high and noble cannot sanction an attempt to destroy the right of others to a different opinion in this respect, or to interfere their conduct in choosing to work upon what terms and at what time and for whom it may please them to do so. In discussing this very question as . to whether the unionist should have preference over the non-unionist, the Anthracite Coal Strike Commission, appointed by President Roosevelt to settle one of the most gigantic strikes in America, saidWe The right thus to work cannot be made to depend upon the approval or disapproval of the personal character and conduct of those who claim to exercise this right. If this were otherwise then those who remain at work might, if they were in the majority, have both the right and power to prevent others, who choose to work, from doing so. This all seems too plain for argument. Common-sense and common law alike denounce the conduct of those who interfere with this fundamental right of the citizen. The assertion of the right seems trite and common-place, but ,that land is blessed where the maxims of liberty are common-places. That is the position which I , and those who think with me, take up in this matter. We have no objection, at any rate, I can honestly say that I have no objection to unionism fer se. I like to see any organization of men, banded for the common object of improving their own condition and that of those around them, succeed. But I do object, and I enter my most fervent protestj against a proposal which seeks to give preference to one set of men over another, which says to a certain set of men, "" If you join a union, or an organization, we shall take care that you shall have the best chance of earning your bread; but if you remain outside that organization we shall make it hard for you tb earn vour bread."" He that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath. That is the principle underlying this compulsory preference to unionists- a principle which strikes at the individual liberty of the subject, gives a wicked and unjust preference to one class, makes it more difficult for another class to earn its living, and is not founded on justice or equity.",56
399,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"It seems to me that, after all the attention which the honourable and learned member for Wannon has devoted to this provision, his concluding remarks show that he does not understand it even now. He states that it proposes a compulsory preference to unionists. It proposes nothing of the sort.",56
400,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,I am quite aware of that.,56
401,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Why did the honourable with and learned member say that it proposes a compulsory preference to unionists if he did not think so, or was aware to the con-. trary ?",56
402,Mr KELLY,Unknown,What is it there for?,57
403,Mr WATSON,Unknown,What it proposes is that the Court shall have power to give preference to unionists.,57
404,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,That means just the same.,57
405,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"It does not mean just the same, and if any one has studied the operation of the Act in either New South Wales or New Zealand he knows that it does not mean just the same, because the Court has exercised discretion in regard tc the granting of preference to unionists.",57
406,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,But has it not been interpreted as a direction?,57
407,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,That is the whole point.,57
408,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"It has been departed from in a variety of instances. this as one of the most important features of the Bill. The' Minister of External Affairs said last evening that unionists were asked to give up the only weapon that they possess. They are prohibited by legislation of this sort from striking, and thereby being able to take advantage of economic conditions to promote their own welfare. They are asked to give up that weapon absolutely, and to consent to be prohibited from taking advantage it, even though circumstances might absolutely justify its use. other hand, is it not a fair thing, as the author of the New Zealand Act saw, to give to unionists in return for this surrender of a power at least a guarantee that, if they go before the Court, the men who have borne the heat and burden of the day, shall not be penalized at the sweet will of One individual ?",57
409,Mr KELLY,Unknown,That is provided for in clause 10.,57
410,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"No . We attempt to provide for that when we say that men shall not be dismissed because they are unionists. Any honourable member who knows anything about the relations between employers and employed must admit that it is the easiest thing in the world to manufacture a reason why a man should be dismissed. Take my own trade in Sydney. I know two or three men who have been victimized by employers. Although no better or more conscientious workmen exist in the trade, yet a variety of reasons have been found for dismissing them. The simple truth is that the employers looked upon these men as agitators, and did not desire their services. We may provide that an employer shall give a good and sufficient reason for dismissing a man, and he may be able to do so without acknowledging that the real reason is that the man is a unionist, and as it is called an agitator. At the same time this man may not be an aeitator at all, in the sense that our honourable members opposite understand the term, although he may be honestly fighting against oppression and injustice, and in favour of conditions which would be regarded as equitable by the community if they only understood the situation. We should give to such a man the only protection that can be given to him, and that is the protection of his fellow-workmen, who understand the position, and are able to say whether he is being victimized or not.",57
411,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,I thought that the I regard Court was to be his protection ?,57
412,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The Court will be a protection if it is given the necessary power, but some honourable members wish to take away from the Court that power.",57
413,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,No .,57
414,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The honourable member says ""No,"" but he is taking every step which works in the direction of taking from the Court the power to settle a dispute in that way. of Mr LONSDALE - To get the power for the Court to treat all alike. On the Mr WATSON - The honourable member can make all sorts of altruistic professions, but they work out to nothing.",57
415,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,"I have done as much for the workers as the honourable gentleman. MrWATSON - I have not alleged anything against the honourable member. So far as I know he has never given cause for the slightest reproach against himself. But I submit that all his professions of regard for the non-unionist are made at the expense of the man who is making the condition of the non-unionist bearable. To whom is the upraising of the workers as a class due? It is not due to the man who stands aloof from all reform and keeps away from his fellows, but to the man who sacrifices time, money, and prospects in order (hat some general good may be accomplished beyond even what might accrue to himself.",57
416,Mr SKENE,Unknown,How has the non-unionist benefited ?,57
417,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"In the general upraising of the workers as a class that has gone On throughout the old world, principally in England and in these States as well. Though it has been due to the unionist primarily and almost entirely, the non-unionist has benefited, and I do not begrudge him some benefit. MrSKENE - How is it that he has not found it out before?",57
418,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Because , like a large number of people who will always remain in the community, he has been absolutely blind to his own interests, because in many cases, the non-unionist has submitted to conditions not from choice but from necessity; his stomach has been a factor in the consideration and he has been compelled to accept terms that his reason told him were not sufficient for the service which he was rendering.",58

452,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The honourable and learned member for Wannon objects to the term which I applied to him a few moments ago, and I have, therefore, withdrawn it ; but I can substitute for it something equally expressive in defining my attitude towards him. He has freely insinuated against the supporters of the Government that they are actuated by ulterior motives in trying to pass the Bill, and that there are associated with the measure outside agitators, who are anxious for it to pass so that they may gain their own ends. it comes ill from him, as the hired watchdog of the law association, which, although it does not; perhaps, keep men from entering the legal profession",59

He Mr WATSON - The point I wish to drive home is that, without this clause giving preference to unionists where the Court considers necessary, the members of an organization who deem it necessary to take a certain attitude for the preservation of their own interests, or those of their fellowmen, would have no protection from the revenge of an unscrupulous employer.",59
458,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Is not sub-clause 3 of clause 9 sufficient?,59
459,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Althoug h we may require employers to show cause for dismissals, it is the easiest thing in the world for an employer to manufacture a dozen reasons for the dismissal of an employee, if he feels it necessary to do so. I have known of that being done. The Minister of External Affairs pointed out the other evening that upon only one occasion has a conviction been' secured in New South Wales under a provision similar to that referred to by the honourable member for Lang, and in that case the employer was innocent enough to plead guilty to the charge. The giving of preference to unionists was originally proposed by Mr Reeves in the legislation, he introduced in New Zealand, to compensate them for the .sacrifice they made in relinquishing the right to strike, and to protect prominent members of the unions from being punished by employers. He says, at page 111, of volume 2, of his State Experiments in Australia and New ZealandI think it enough to point out that, in New Zealand, the community, mainly for the purpose of self-protection, has deprived trade unionists But of the right of striking-of the sacred right of 'insurrection to which all workmen rightly or wrongly believe that they owe most of what l if ts them above serfdom. The Arbitration Act, moreover, deliberately encourages workmen to organize. When, in obedience to the law, they renounce striking, and register as industrial unions, it does not seem amiss that they should receive some special consideration. He goes on to show the exertions and outlay involved in securing the proper organization of a trade, and the proper observance of the awards of the Court. The latter is one of the most important duties cast upon unions by the arbitration law.",59
460,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,The measure will never be effective unless the unions act as watchdogs in regard to it.,59
461,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Quite so. I do not complain of the terms in which the honorhas able member for North Sydney puts forward his proposition. . I regard it as a sincere attempt to find a way out of a difficulty which has presented itself to mind. But we must remember that what is aimed at in the Bill, the casting sponsibility upon organizations, presumes cohesive bodies, not mere collections scattered units who may be separated by gether. distance, as well as in thought and aspiration, We must have cohesive bodies, poslong sessing sufficient influence who may be disposed to go to extremes, or to refuse to obey the awards of the enough.

I did not favour it until saw it was possible to use the unions influencing bodies, with a view to enforce ber for North Sydney. the awards of the Court. The Teralba case, which was referred to by the honorfore, able and learned member for Wannon, i l lustrates the position of the Government this matter. An award was New South Wales Court, largely reducing ths hewing rate in the Newcastle trict, and affecting 4,000 miners there, who accepted it without question, although there - may have been a' little grumbling. Ansion other award- a subsidiary one-wa s given, of by the unions to any large extent. affecting 200 miners employed at Teralba, in the same district, but they refused obey it, and went out on strike. doubtedly if there had been no Arbitration Court that strike would have spread.",59
462,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,There would a general strike.,60
463,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Yes , a strike extending throughout the Newcastle districtAny one who knows the volume of the coal trade there can imagine the amount of distress, and suffering and loss to-the State, and to the Bill. the whole Commonwealth, which would closed have ensued if that had happened. Teralba strike collapsed because of the steady pressure brought to bear by the union upon the recalcitrant miners. other organization could have brought such pressure to bear. The Teralba miners were forced to admit that the members the Miners' Union were men who looked lumpers once more closed their books. on their position with sympathy, and had every desire to help them. But these men were strongly and persistently counselling them to obey the award of the Court, and abide their time to have it reconsidered. Without a trades union, such as is templated by the Bill, and by the New departure South Wales and New Zealand Acts, it would be impossible to bring such pressure to bear. The organizations suggested by honourable member for North Sydney would his be useless.

After the strike of 1890 had collapsed, and the of unions had become strong again, the coal I was one who, in 1890, and subsequently, , protested against that phase of unionism which proposed to make close corporations to of the unions.

471,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I took the honourable the member as saying so. He said that the Government were prepared at this late hour to propose something which would lessen the possibility of the unions becoming close corporations. This is not a new departure; it is in consonance with what I have put forward for years past, and with what have declared to be the policy of the vernment ever since it came into existence. The instances referred to by the honourable ancl learned member do not affect, in the slightest degree, the case for or against Bill. Wherever a union is strong, and number of its members are very selfish, there will be attempts to make it a close corporation.",60

Therefore, their case affords no indictment of the Act. know of no other union, apart from those two, in New South Wales, which has atvictions tempted in this fashion to make its body a close corporation. Of course, nearly* gramme. every union of artisans insists that every member shall be a qualified workman, behas fore he is allowed to join, and that is a very proper principle. But, beyond that, with the exceptions mentioned, I do not think there is any condition imposed by anytrade union throughout Australia of the nature indicated in the present lation. The honourable member North Sydney, and subsequently the honourable and learned member for WanOf non, made a great deal of the fact that the unions, or some of them, go in for poliancl tics. Of course. I suppose, one of the worse features of that development is the fact that they have gone in for the wrong sort of politics. But the question whether they go in for politics has really to do with what we are now discussing; because they have just as much right to in for politics as individuals, or as bers of unions, as they have to join temperance crus'ade or an agitation compulsory vaccination, or any movement loyal', because he held aloof which is not usuallv included within sphere of party politics. We cannot ata tempt to limit the individual liberty of a man in that way; nor, if we cannot limit him as an individual, should we attempt to limit a number, who are members of an I organization, made up of individuals. GoWe - must be prepared to allow these people to take their own course. I might point to the fact that many of the most prominent trades unionists of Sydney are men the who have never worked with or voted for a the Labour Party. Quite a number of the most prominent men in the trades unions have been consistently against the Labour Party in politics. Mr Bavister, a strong of supporter of the Free-trade Party, with the honourable member for North Sydney is so honourably associated, is one instance of a man who has for years kept up his connection with a trades union, of which he is a trusted officer as well as being ten a member of lithe Trades Council and of In every way he '(js known to be a man out of harmony with', labour politics. But that that fact has not interfered with Mr Bavister's of election as an oflicer of his. union a in the slightest^ degree. . On the other side, There are Mr West and Mr Talbot, who are well I known as protectionists j and many others have similarlylrefused to give up their conin regard to protection, or free trade, in order; to advance the labour proThey put their general politics first, as they are entitled to do, and no one ever interfered with them for so doing. Mr KNOX.4-Is not that an argument for keeping the organizations under (his Bill perfectly distinct from the trades unions ? Mr WATS'ON - Not at all. It is an argument to show that there is nothing in rethe proposition that we should not recognise for the unions in'the Bill or give them preference, because they may go in for politics. course they may go in for politics as individuals, or even as members of unions; if they dp, is it not ridiculous for any one to assume; that the unions can constrain their memberstto act in any particular direction if they .do not want to do so ?",61
476,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,"The others will call nothing them "" blackle/gs "" for that.",61
477,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"They have not called go Mr Bavister a blackleg, have they? He memwas a member of Parliament with the honin a orable member for New England, and no against one has accused him of being disfrom the Labour Partv politics - I admit that union passed a rule, on one occasion in New South Wales, to the effect that its members should vote for 'the labour candidate. But it is manifestly ridiculous to pass any such rules, with the expectation that they can be made effective. The Court afterwards declared that that rule must come out, and it was dropped; buti even while it was in existence it was, in my view, the most absurd rule that could have been placed upon the books of a trades union. Every one knows that you cannot enforce a rule of that description; and if a thousand men who are today non-unionists, and who perhaps do not agree with Labour Party politics, were to join a union tomorrow, there would be nothing to coerce them iri regard to the exercise of their political rights.",61
478,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,Politica l action keeps some men from joining the unions.,62
479,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I am inclined to doubt that statement. I have had a very long experience, for my age, of trades unions. I joined a union when I was. 18 years of age, and I have been a member'lever since. I have had a great deal of I experience of trades unions in New South^Wales outside my o w n ' trade; and I hehrd. long before the unions went in for politics, just the same excuses made by individuals as to why they did not join a union. Many men do not join a union for feaii that if they do they will be marked men, and that it mav prevent their advancement at the hands of the employers, for hvhom they are working. Another class who do not join are those who are too mean to contribute the small weekly amount thatds necessary to keep the unions going. I have known men to be very efficient agitators and workers for a union until it obtained a certain concession, when they immediately withdrew even their paltry subscription, and left other men outside their own workshop to struggle as best they, could. Such men embrace another section of non-unionists. But I admit that there are many men who keep aloof from unions for conscientious reasons.",62
480,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,Sorti e of the free trade workmen iri Sydney certainly do.,62
481,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I am inclined to think that very few keep out of unions for that reason, though they may keep out of the Political Labour Leagues-and very properly so, if they do not approve of their methods. Of course, that is always a matter of opinion.",62
482,Mr KNOX,Unknown,Why should not this provision apply only to organizations as distinct from trades unions ?,62
483,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"All that this provision proposes to do is to endow the Court with power to declare a preference for trades unionists, or members of any organization, and subject always, be it remembered, to the amendment which the honourable and learned member for Ballarat and myself have evolved, which provides that nothing in the nature of a close corporation must be attempted, and that if it is the registration, and any benefits which' may have accrued uncler the award of the Court, shall immediately disappear, and be withdrawn from the union.",62
484,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"The distinction is that this Bill provides for an organization, and does not refer to a trades union at all.",62
485,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The honourable member is, of course, relying upon the technical phraseology of the Bill ; because, after all, any one who knows anything of legislation of this class, and who has followed its history, must have recognised by this time' that such legislation could never have been brought forward, or could not have been as successful as it has been, except for the fact that it is not founded on a skeleton organization or a chance working together of a number of dis-united individuals, but that unions exist which are made responsible - under the law-union s of men combined in one body, by ties of sentiment and loyalty one to another. And such unions are necessary to the successful working of this measure. The honourable member for Richmond, who is always sufficiently amusing, even if he is not instructive, tells us that in this Bill we are perpetrating the enormity of making 400,000 work people in New South Wales subject to the caprice of 66,000 unionists.",62
486,Mr EWING,Unknown,I do not think that I put it quite in that wav.,62
487,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Practicall y that was the effect of the honourable member's contention-that only 66,000 were enrolled as unionists, and that, by this preference, we shall make 400,000 work people depend<:at upon them.",62
488,Mr EWING,Unknown,I will see what the honourable gentleman makes out of that.,62
489,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I suppose that if I make too much out of it. the honourable member will say that he did not intend it to be understood in that wav. I have taken thetrouble to refer to Mr Coghlan's Statistical Register for New South Wales, and I find that there are employed in that State among the professional and mercantile classes, cluding dealers, telegraph assistants-wh o number 5,000 - doctors, lawyers and professional persons of that description, 187,000 people. Those, although they are workers, are not workers in the sense of being eligible for membership of any existing trades union.",62
490,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,Do they not include employers also ?,63
491,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"No ; they include people who are not eligible for membership of any existing union. They also include persons engaged in domestic servioe. I am subtracting from the 400,000 all those who are not eligible to join any existing union, and who are not engaged in any occupation to which any union relates. To give the figures in detail, there are 110,000 members of the professional, mercantile, and dealing classes; 72,000 engaged in domestic service and lodging; 5,000 post and telegraph assistants; 77.000 are engaged in agriculture; 18,000 are engaged in dairying; 3,000 are engaged in fisheries and forestry; 9,000 are people of independent means-makin g a total of 294,000 who are not eligible for membership of existing unions. Therefore, if the whole of the 66,000 work people who are members of unions were registered under the Court, and were granted preference, we should have to subtract from the number of those who, according to the honourable member's argument, would possiblv be subject to their control, 294,000 people.",63
492,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Le t me tell the honourable gentleman what I did say. I wrote to Mr. Coghlan, and asked him the number of unionists in New South Wales. The answer he returned was 66,900. I wrote to him again, and asked him the number of workers in New South Wales. The replywas 460,000-jus t as I stated it. The Prime Minister will find that Mr Coghlan is right.",63
493,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I am quite sure that Mr Coghlan is right on question as it was put to him by the honourable member. Even in that shape, however, it cannot convey any such impression as the honourable member evidently anticipated. He was trying to persuade the Committee that 66,000 men were dominating 400,000 men, and could compel them to join the unions, whereas all those who are engaged in occupations in which there are no unions should be subin- tracted from the latter number before the honourable member's arguments are applied.",63
494,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"Will not this Bill force those people, who are now outside the unions, to form such organizations?",63
495,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Onl y in those cases in which disputes arise. No persons can obtain any recognition from the Arbitration Court unless they are members of an organization. But, as has been proved in New Zealand and New South Wales, we may go on for years and years without having organizations formed in certain industries, because no dispute may arise. There are certain persons who follow callings in which no unions exist, and such persons could not be compelled to join the unions. That is where the arguments of the honourable member for Richmond were at fault. He was also in error in confusing the 66,000 persons in the unions registered under the Arbitration Act with the total number of uhionists in New South Wales. A very considerable number of unionists are not registered under the Act, and that fact involves another subtraction from the honourable member's figures.",63
496,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"But would they not be included in the 400,000 mentioned by the Minister ?",63
497,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Yes ; they would be included among the 400,000, but not among those I have deducted, because I have embraced only those engaged in industries in which no unions exist. I am not certain in regard to all the unions that are registered or unregistered, but I know of all the callings in which unions exist, and I subtracted those engaged in such callings from the numbers quoted by the honourable member for Richmond.",63
498,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The Minister is ""not questioning the figures, but explaining them.",63
499,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I am showing clearly that the deduction sought to be drawn by the honourable member is absolutely without foundation. If he will admit that, I shall be satisfied. I wish to impress upon honour the able members that, in the first place, this proposal is an integral portion of evenArbitration Act that has been brought into operation. Without it, it would be almost impossible, at any rate, in my view, to make this measure effective. The proposal put forward by the honourable member for North Sydney falls far short of providing for the kind of organization which alone could be held responsible for the successful working of the Act, and for the observance of the awards. The policing undei this measure must be carried on, not by an army of inspectors, but by the members of the unions, who will know, even down tc the smallest details, whether or not the awards are being observed. Without a provision of this kind it would be impossible to secure attention to details. I hope, therefore, that honourable members will hesitate before they strike out a provision which, according to the evidence of representative employers in New Zealand, has been found to work reasonably, which does not deprive the employers of the right tc pick and choose among the men who prer sent themselves, and which, in any case, is only to be applied after the Court has thoroughly gone into the question and has become convinced that it is necessary to have some such condition laid down.",63
500,Mr GLYNN,Unknown," After the very lengthy debate that has taken place upon this clause, I do not intend to detain the Committee at very great length. I wish, however, to direct attention to one or two matters which I think ought to have some effect in influencing honourable members. I shall not emulate the example of the Prime Minister, who has indulged in a somewhat heated exordium. It seemed almost as if he imagined that he was called upon to sway the emotions of a very large audience outside the House. After the first tumult had subsided, he returned to his old methods, and, although his manner was as of old, his logic was not so convincing as usual. He says that this provision is an integral part of every Arbitration Act that has been passed. I contend that it is not an essential part of any. I should not only omit the provision that the Court may give preference to members of organizations, and, by consequence, to unionists, but I should actually include within the four corners of the Bill an express provision that the Court shall under no circumstances give preference to members of organizations over non-members. I say that, though I quite recognise, with the Prime Minister, the splendid work that the trade unions have done in the emancipation of labour. At one time there was not one member of this Cojnmittee who would not sympathize with the efforts of the unions by any legitimate means-by any pressure that was short of criminal-to force nonmembers to join the unionThat, however, was in the days before Arbitration Acts were brought into operation. Then the unions had to fight for the reformation of the law, and to combat the power and prejudices of the capitalist classes. Their good work and the expenditure of the savings of the members of their organizations might then have been rendered altogether nugatory by men who entered into secret arrangements with their employers, or who accepted less than a fair wage. It was absolutely essential then that the unions should put down those men who were called, perhaps with some justification, "" black-legs."" The moment, however, that an Arbitration Act such as this is adopted the very functions of the unions are gone-the y no longer exist. It is impossible, under such legislation, for men who are not members of the unions to neutralize the good effect of the work done by the organizations.",64
501,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"What effect would this, or any other Bill of a similar character, have if there were no unions at the back of it?",64
502,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I am dealing with another point just now. So far from agreeing with the Prime Minister that the recognition of unionists as against non-unionists is an essential part of any Arbitration Bill, I contend that the justification for differentiation has absolutely passed away, because under the award of the Court, it is absolutely impossible for a man who is not a member of the union to destroy the effect of an award. He cannot take less than tilie prescribed wages, or work an hour, or even a minute, longer than is provided for under the award.",64
503,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Not until he is found out.,64
504,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,The Bill absolutely bristles with provisions which are intended to secure the enforcement of the awards of the Court.,64
505,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,There is nothing to prevent an employer from dismissing all his men for bringing a case before the Arbitration Court.,64
506,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The honourable member al- must forget that provision is made that the most severe penalties shall be inflicted upon employers who may attempt to interfere with the members of the union. Clause 9 contains a provision that a penaltv of £ 2 0 shall be imposed upon any employer who dismisses an employee by reason merely of the fact that he is an officer or a member of a union. Then again, in. clause 57, provision is made that if any employer is adjudged to be guilty of any contravention of part II . of the Bill, or of wilful default in regard to any award, he shall, in addition to the penalty imposed for the ottence, l e° sheeted* to aperies of serious d m g j tips He is to be deprived of all Jignts, SS i l e S , benefits, or ^ , ^ e r ^ k ill but at the same time is to be SUD ?ected to l l the liabilities imposed upon Em by ?he award of the Court. Provision s also made that in certain events imprisonment is to be the alternative to a monetary fine Therefore, so far as legislation can m o v i d e by imposing penalties upon em5 overs the Bill guards against an emZ e r victimizing any employ* merely because he is a member of a union.",64
507,Mr WITCHES,Unknown,Does the honourable and leaded member'think that under the terms of clause Q anv employee will have a reasons able charge of securing a conviction against an employer?,65
508,Mr CLYNN,Unknown,"I do. It should be ea v to prove in Court that an employer is1uiUy as it is to say, with P",65
509,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"It may be a matter of intention, which it is impossible to prove.",65
510,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"We know that there always a difficulty in proving an intention At the same time, I say that, so far can provide against such offences, we have done so in. this Bill , , and .that i necessary to pass this p r o to n . in nrevent an emplover from discriminating between unionists and non-unionists Our objection to the clause is that Our oojecnu t Members would be the f persons who would rigS Sir it ; Mothers would bj> ^ nihilities. The unions would have the under consideration. S ^ r f M t i at i o n . The only reasonable C u n d that may be advanced for the. tion of this clause is that if an orgamzation engaged in a big fight against an i o n of employers had only a small bership it might not have sufficient carry on the war.",65
511,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,That is a very important ground.,65
512,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"It is the only ground which this clause can be supported; has not vet been advanced by ? members opposite. It is the tion, if there can be any justification, the provision. It ^ that'this provision should be rnade^ adopted the suggestion of the honourable, member for North Sydney, and made all Concihation and L 22 22 J ^'^ * 1 J that were concerned members of an organisation, under the Bill , ev.ery one of them S d have to pay a share of the: costs of a successful or unsuccessful fight, would be a solution of the difficulty.",65
513,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The honourable and learned member means reconstruction.,65
514,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I do not mean anything of the kind. If the suggestion werecarr i e d To u t S , instead of allowing an orgamzation to be'confined to certain persons, we declared that all who were interested in a dispute should constitute the ojamzation necessary to put the machinery of the^ mea sure in motion-every one of them would be called upon to bear a share of the necessaiy costs. Itwill thus be seen that there in reality no justification for a Provision of this kind. It is not necessary, when it is open to us to provide otherwise, and on as much better grounds, for the division among those who would be benefited by an award ^ of some share of the cost of securing it . I should be prepared not only to excise this clause, but to justify the insertion of a p So n to p ^ e n t any dispute being raised on the question of P ^ ^ S ^ plovment. The clause goes beyond the N ew . is Zealand and the New South Wales Acts. I think that the New Zealand Consolidatas we ing Act of 1900 does not contain any express provision like this, but in the definit is not tion section there is a definition of in orde to dustrial matters,"" which declares in effect that that term shall include a claim for it is not preferential employment. The words preof unions ferential employment"" are not used^ but that is the effect of the provision. Ihere enjoy is no provision in .any subsequent part ot the measure that is analogous to that now The reason is that in New Zealand the provision was put in retenso that the power could be exercised only where the cause of the dispute was the emorganizaployment of men who were not members memof an organization, or, as such a body is funds to called there, an »industrial union. That was the reason alleged by Mr Wise, when speaking in the Legislative Council of ^ew South Wales, for the inclusion of a similar provision in the Arbitration Bill of that on State. I have here a report of the speech but * made by Mr Wise when moving the second h n o r a ° f reading of the Bill in the Legislative Coung f £ cil He pointed out that the employment tor of persons who were not members of an ^ ^ ^ l 7 w , organization might be the cause of a strike, If ^ v e and that it was therefore necessary to give the Court power in such a case to adjudicate between the claims of men who were members of the union and those who were not. He saidFurther, I point out that strikes have arisen from this cause. Now, how are they to be settled? They are settled at present in a way we know of- a settlement which nine times out of ten is no settlement at all. this clause the Court will have power to say - and this is the way in which the provision has been interpreted in New Zealand, ancl I suppose we snould follow the decisions of Mr Justice Williams and Mr Justice Edwards very much-that in certain cases where the custom of the trade is to employ unionists, other things being equal, preference shall be given to unionists. For example, supposing in any particular trade it had been the custom year after year lo employ unionists, and that in ninetyNew South Wales Bill . nine cases out of a hundred the men in the trade were unionists, and that the difficulty had arisen because three, four, or five non-unionists were employed, I quite admit that theoretically it cloes not matter whether they are unionists or not; but we have to deal with human nature as it is, and, although the arguments I put forward may not cummend themselves to everybody else as strongly as it appears to me they ought to, as to the reasonableness of objecting to non-unionists being employed, still the fact remains that that objection is raised; and' if it is an objection based on sentiment, because it rests on sentiment, it is all the stronger and more ineradicable. If , then, there is that fact ai ducing and most powerful cause of controversy - a cause that leads to difficulties that breed bitterness than almost any other difficulty-surel y it is not an unreasonable thing to say that the Court, having investigated it, may. say to any employer, if the declaration can be made without injustice being clone to anybody- I make lhat proviso- "" When you have your next vacancy, if there is an equally competent union man you shall employ him."" He referred only to cases in which the union. cause of dispute was the employment of was, men who were not members of ah organizaditions tion. He went on to mention by way further explanation, that in New Zealand, where applications for preference had made, but were not the initial cause of the dispute, the Courts had refused to exerin cise jurisdiction. He said- T have referred to one New Zealand case where the Court refused to give preference to unionists because, as a matter of fact, in that particular trade non-unionists had been employed-ther was no custom of the trade to employ unionists. It was further pointed out that it was the originating cause of dispute. tion that I read the debate on the amending Bill of 1903 in New Zealand, and found that in several of these cases the local Court had refused to exercise jurisdiction, the matter of preference was not the originating cause of the dispute. I say. thereto fore, that we are going beyond the declared. Mr Glynn. policy of the Bil l passed by the New South Wales Legislature, and, from an examination of the provisions of the New Zealand Act of 1900, that we propose to go beyond the apparent policy of that measure, because there is no express direction under the enactBut under ing sections of the Act of New Zealand, analogous to that contained in the clause before us. It has been said by the Prime Minister that this is an integral provision of every Arbitration Act that has hitherto been passed. It is not, however, a necessary one, ancl in support of that assertion I have as my authority a statement made by Mr. Wise in moving the second reading of the He pointed out that, even if the clause which dealt with the question of preference were lost, the main purpose of the Bil l would not be affectedI f the clause is omitted the Bill will still remain an instrument of great value, in my opinion, for the furtherance of industrial peace. That statement is borne out by an examination of the causes of disputes in the old country. I find from an article by Mr. Holt Schooling in the May number of the an inFortnightly Review, that in round numbers in only 6 per cent, of the disputes between more 1897 and 1901 was a question of trades unionism the originating cause, and that in only 13 per cent, of the total disputes was the originating matter the question of the employment of particular classes of persons. Even in those cases the dispute was not necessarily because the persons in. question were non-members of a The real cause of the disputes of course, the desire to better the conof the labourers. In 64 per cent, ofof the total disputes in England during the period named the cause of the disputes was been the alleged inadequacy of wages.",65
515,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,Is not that an argument favour of allowing this provision to remain as it stands ?,66
516,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"No ; it shows that it is not of the very essence of the Bill. As has been pointed out by several honourable meme bers, it would lead to indirect political effects, 'which should not be countenanced by Parliament, and as it is not a necessary part I may menof the Bill, we should strike it out.",66
517,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"If the disputes in regard to this question were so small in number, in what way is injury likely to result from because this provision ? . Mr Glynn - The injury that is likely occur has been pointed out. It is proposed that persons shall be made members of an organization for one purpose, and by joining that organization they must become members of a union for another purpose. The definition of "" association "" includes trades unions, and under clause 63 an association, on registration, would become an organization within the meaning of the Bill . A man may be deprived of the benefits of a friendly society on breach of an award. becoming a member of an organization he 'would really become a member of a union that had been transformed into an organization, and as such, as has been pointed out, might, by his subscriptions, support a policy the very opposite of his creed. His subscriptions might be diverted to a use which, as a private citizen, he would naturally condemn. An examination of the Bill, and the fact that only a small percentage .of disputes originate in England in connection with trades union matters, should convince us that w« ought not to j)as a provision of this kind, that would have such dangerous effects, more especially when it is not necessary for the general working of the measure. It would also interfere with the liberty of a very large section of the workers. I do not propose to follow the Prime Minister honourable member for 'Richmond in their examination of the figures relating to the number of workers in New South Wales - I dare say that some mistake has been made. Let me refer to the figures relating to the members of organizations, and workers who are not members of organizations in New Zealand. Taking Judge Backhouse's report of 1900, together with the figures quoted by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat in moving the second reading of this Bill",66
518,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,We have since heard from New Zealand that those figures are incorrect.,67
519,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I think that the honourable member must be in error, because Judge Backhouse, in his report for 1900, gives figures which show a disparity of only about 1,500, as compared with the figures given in a cablegram sent by Mr Seddon to the honourable and""learned member for Ballarat a few months ago",67
520,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"We telegraphed to Mr. Seddon asking whether they were correct, and he replied that there was a mistake.",67
521,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I know that there has been a mistake, but I would point out"" that as there is not a difference of 2,000 in a total of 48,000, the discrepancy cannot in0 terfere, to any great extent, with the percentage. According to Judge Backhouse's report, in 1900 there were 48,000 employees in New Zealand, and of that number 26,000 were members of organizations or industrial unions. In 1903, according to the cablegram from Mr Seddon. there were 57,000 workers, and of that number 23,000 were members of industrial unions, By so that, notwithstanding the many inducements held out by the New Zealand Act to persons to join these industrial unions, there does not. appear to be a desire on the part of a very large section of employees to become members of such organizations. .",67
522,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The figures also show that there is no danger to be apprehended in respect of this provision. ',67
523,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"B y forcing workers to become members of organizations we shall really be fettering their discretion and their liberty of action. I think that it was in 1900 that the statutory provision giving the New Zealand Court power to give a preference was passed. Judge Backhouse then thought that this would lead to a large increase in the number of members, .but, as the figures show, the very opposite has been and the the result. Judge Backhouse's words wereAlready the wider definition of the present Act has had its effect, and 1I have little doubt that the number of unionists will largely increase. I do not for one moment say that members of the Government party in the House have an ulterior motive in securing the retention of this paragraph. But I do say that the power, given can be used in the direction indicated-that is, it may be used in strengthening political organization. I do not say that that is the motive of honourable members in securing its retention, but that the provision may be so used is evidenced by the fact that there is an agitation in New Zealand to make preference to unions compulsory by statute. That is part of the Labour Party's programme in New Zealand. The honourable member for Wannon reminds me that there is no such provision in the Western Australian Act. - Mr Mauger - That is a very imperfect statute.",67
524,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,I accepted the statement of the Prime Minister as correct that such a provision was part of everv Arbitration Act which has hitherto been passed.,67
525,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The Prime Minister mentioned three Acts,67
526,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"That such a provision not essential is evidenced by the fact that it is not included in the Western AustraKingdom, lian Act. In the debate on the amending Bill of 1903 in the Legislative Council New Zealand, a proposal was made to carry out the Labour Party's programme, which included compulsory preference by the award-that is, the giving of compulsory preference to unionists. That proposal was rejected by forty-five votes to twenty-one; but it shows the trend of policy in New Zealand.",68
527,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown,A number of labour memtrial bers voted with the majority.,68
528,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"To show how extreme the demands are becoming, I may mention that the organizations wanted to have the power to submit disputes for reference without giving the general notice prescribed by the Act. The organizations desired, further, that, instead of all the members of an orKingdom. ganization being directly consulted as to whether a reference should take place, majority at a meeting, no matter how small in the strike. the meeting might be, should have the power to decide. That shows that more the organizations get, the more they ask for. In the award in the Auckland boot trade dispute, which was settled in 1900, there is in clause 2 a provision preference to unionists; and one would think that that would be enough. But shortly after the award was applied, an the agreement isagitation sprang up for an extension of in the direction of greater preference to unionists, and in April, 1901, the award was amended by the addition of the followsign ing provision: When a non-union workman is engaged employer in consequence of the union being able to supply a workman of equal ability willing to undertake the work, at any time within twelve months thereafter the union shall the right to supply a man capable of performing the work, provided the workman first declines to become a member of the union. - What does that mean? It means that, although a man may be in employment, unless he becomes a member of a union he may be dismissed, and at any time a member of a union may be substituted for him. The demand of the Labour Party for such a provision in the award relating to the boot trade, indicates the tendency of this provision, and it means that ultimately preference must be given to unionists. should like to refer honourable members to a voluntary industrial agreement which has been entered into in England. If it is essential here that men should be forced to is join unions, whether they like it or not, surely that is more essential in the United where there is no compulsory arbitration. As I pointed out, unions' are of protected here by the fact that there can be no blacklegs under the Bill, and an employer cannot be unjust to a man because that man is a member of an organization. All must be treated alike; the award cannot be frustrated, by the fact that men who are not members of a union refuse to accept its conditions. The engineering trade in England is carried on under an indusagreement, entered into at the end of the big strike of 1897-8, and the declaration with which that agreement starts isEvery workman shall be free to belong to a trade union or not, as he may think fit. That is the declaration of labour, because it is signed .by representatives of one of the biggest voluntary organizations in the United",68
529,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,But that agreement was a signed after the workmen had been beaten,68
530,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"That agreement was the signed at the end of the strike in 1897-8, ancl since then work has been carried on amicably under its provisions.",68
531,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"After'the y were beaten, for what could the workmen clo?",68
532,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,The next declaration of if Every employer shall be free to employ any man whether he belongs lo a trade union or not.,68
533,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Why did they want to that declaration, seeing that the law gave both sides the option? by an - Mr Glynn - If such a provision is unessential where trades unions are protected, surely it is more essential in the United have Kingdom, where the system is voluntary.",68
534,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,But in England the men could have gone on strike again next day.,68
535,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Surely , in the terms of settlement of a big strike, on which nearly a quarter of a million of money was spent, that provision wQjuld not have been inserted if the position of labour had been destroyed.",68
536,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Does the honourable and learned member not see that if men in Australia go on strike under the Bill, every I penny of their funds will be forfeited by the mere fact of their going on strike? The engineers who signed that agreement could have gone on 'strike without forfeiting anything.",68
537,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Hav e I not admitted that there. is one apology for the suggestion that non-unionists shall be forced to become members of unions? That apology is that, in the case of a successful strike, non-unionists ought not to have the advantage of, perhaps, better wages or shorter hours without contributing to the cost of the victory. But it is not essential to have the provision. If the suggestion' of the honourable member for North Sydney to make all persons in an industry an organization for the purpose of the Bill, or to have some limitation in that direction, were adopted, all would be responsible for the cost.",69

543,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,But it will matter whether they have any funds.,69
544,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,Cost s should not be asked against men who have no funds.,69

546,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"We have not yet reached schedule B, which prescribes what the rules are to be.",69
547,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Who is going to-' govern the association?,69
548,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,The committee. If the Minister will look at schedule find it there prescribed what are to be the rules of an organization for this very purpose.,69
549,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,What are the purposes of the organization?,69
550,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"We might give facilities for the collection of subscriptions for. purpose of meeting the costs of an award, or for any other purpose. Power could be Bill proposes. given to the secretary, committee, or whatever the management might be, from the members of the orgnization dues, for the purpose of meeting the expenses an award.",69
551,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,That is done now under trades unions.,69
552,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Of course it is ; and not only is it done under voluntary unions, but is actually provided for in the Bill in regard to any organization. However, I do not wish to labour the point. The fact that we may recognise an organization under the Bill , every member of which will be liable, without being a member of a trades union, to contribute to the costs of a fight against employers, removes the only possible reason for the inclusion of such a provision as that under discussion. This provision is not essential, and as it may lead to ulterior consequences which may have political effects we ought not to countenance it should be struck out.",69
553,Mr MAUG ER,Unknown," I take an altogether different view from that of the honourable and learned member for as to the necessity and value of the proposal we are now discussing. My exto perience of the Factories Act in Victoria B is that it is most effective, and continuously effective, when backed up by strong, active, vigilant trades unions. I am quitd sure that If we many of the advantages of that Act would f not be reaped by those in whose interests it was framed unless there were powerful trade organizations watching it closely. An army of inspectors would be required to make the Act effective were not trades unions zealously taking care that its provisions are carried into effect. The proposal of the honourable member for North Sydney would create machinery for collecting subscriptions from those directly in terested.",69
554,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Fro m all.,69
555,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"But beyond that there would not be any organization. MrDUGALD THOMSON.:-Oh . yes, there would.",69

561,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Hear, hear; to collect but only for one object.",69
562,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,How would the honorof able member confine such an organization to one object ?,69
563,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Of course, that could be done.",69
564,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"-Le t us suppose for a moment that the whole of the men in the engineering trade in New South Wales, or in Australia, were compelled to subscribe 6d. per week.",70
565,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Not 6d.; thing like that amount,70
566,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Then let us suppose that the men were compelled to pay i d . per week-for the purposes of this Bill. That i d . would not only provide means for carrying out the provisions of the measure, but would make those men members of the engineers' organization.",70
567,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,The money collected would go into Court.,70
568,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,What is to prevent the organization at any time resolving to use its power for any political or social purpose the majority of members may decide?,70
569,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Because the registration as an organization would be cancelled.,70
570,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,B y whom?,70
571,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,B y the Registrar.,70
572,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Would not the Registrar cancel an organization such as we are proposing if it were used for illegitimate purposes ?,70
573,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,No .,70
574,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Alread y the Arbitration Court in New South Wales has compelled one organization to strike out a rule which made the object of that organization political.,70
575,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,The struck out a rule which made it necessary to contribute to the election expenses liamentary candidates.,70
576,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"That shows plainly that the Court has supervision, and is likely to exercise it. I hold that the proposal of the honourable member for North Sydney is impracticable; it is useless for the objects of this Bill, and will prove a means of enabling employers to do for men what men ought to do for themselves. As to the objections raised in connection with the operation of the provision, I should like to direct attention to what Judge Backhouse said on the point. It is very remarkable that the striking report of Judge Backhouse has not been quoted before, but it is alluded to in Mr Wise's speech, which has been quoted in the course of the discussion. Mr Wise directed attention to the fact that Judge Backhouse lays it down distinctly that no harm has come from the provision, that many employers are in favour of it, and that the objections are only' sentimental objections on the part of a number of employers who are opposed to the principle. Judge Backhpuse saidno- An ordinary workman hesitates, moreover, to make an application which marks him as incompetent. It is always provided in awards that, where unionists ancl non-unionists are employed, they shall work in harmony. Safeguarded in these ways, the granting of preference, it may be said, can only be objected to, as one of the Judges put it to me, on sentimental grounds. Mr Clarke, a large employer of labour in Auckland, told me that, with these limitations, the difficulty was practically non-existent. What are the limitations? That the union must not be a close corporation, that every one who is willing to join must be afforded facilities for that purpose, and that there must be no subscription or entrance fee which is prohibitive. With these limitations, Judge Backhouse gives his opinion that there is nothing harmful, that there is a great deal which is beneficial in this provision, and that no one is injured in any way by the carrying out of the Act. M i . WATSON - Mi . Reeves quotes the President of the Wellington Employers' Association to the. same effect.",70
577,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Quite so. and I could cite other illustrations, all bearing out what I say.",70
578,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The Judge balances up very fairly-in the report, but he does not put it quite so strongly as the honourable member thinks. Court Mr Mauger --The honourable and learned member has brought out clearly the of parimportant fact that in New Zealand no minority has been coerced, that, notwithstanding that the provision has been in force for a number of years, the number of .trades unions has only increased at a very small ratio, and that the number of workers inside is far smaller than the number outside the unions. Such being the case, where does the cry of coercion come in, ancl how is it going to be effected ?",70
579,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,-It shows that men do not want to join the unions.,70
580,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I quite recognise that it does. But does not the honourable and learned member know that that is only human nature? Does he not know that in every walk of life the great brunt of the work is borne by a few, and that the largemajority are parasites who live on the fruits of the workers? Take any organization of a social or religious character. The great mass outside the organization are too ignorant, or too careless, or too thoughtless, to in any way contribute to the benefits whichthey are only too glad to receive and take advantage of at the very first opportunity.",70
581,Mr KELLY,Unknown,A r e non-unionists thoughtless and ignorant ?,71
582,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Does the honourable member assert that the whole body of workers outside unions are parasites?,71
583,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,I have not said so.,71
584,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The honourable member has said that they are ignorant.,71
585,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I said that the vast majority of people in connection with religious and social organizations are too ignorant and careless to do any of the work, or to bear the brunt of the battle, and yet only too ready to reap the benefits which aie gained. That is what I said, and what I repeat, and no one knows it better than the honourable member. He knows, too, that the condition of things in the world would be very different today if every man were doing his duty in the walk of life in which he finds himself, and it is because men in connection with trades and professions do not do their duty as citizens that that condition exists. Take the illustration affoided to us by the last general election in Western Australia, when only 27 electors out of every 100 voted - Does not that demonstrate that the vast majority are so taken up with their material interests or pleasures that they will not exercise the greatest right which has ever been bestowed on a free people? Surely my honourable friend will admit that. Surely he will not contend for a moment that because only 27 electors out of every 100 voted, therefore universal suffrage is wrong, vicious, selfish, exclusive? argument which he applies to trades unions is that, because the vast majority of the workers have not joined trades unions, their aims and objects are wrong.",71
586,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,A very large number of persons were prevented from exercising the franchise.,71
587,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,We admit that.,71
588,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order . The question before the Committee has nothing to do with the exercise of the franchise.,71
589,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"In New Zealand the Act has not forced men to join unions which they did not desire to join, or which it was not to their benefit to join. The Court has demonstrated that it can discriminate. For instance, it was asked to give unionists preference in connection with the engineering trade, and it refused. Again, it was asked to give unionists preference in regard to other trades, which could be mentioned, and it refused. All we ask is that the Court shall have the right, in circumstances which, in its wisdom, may justify such action, to compel men to become unionists.",71
590,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Is there a special section in the New Zealand Act granting preference to unionists ?,71
591,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Powe r is given to the Court to grant preference to unionists, and the Court has exercised it and refused to exercise it.",71
592,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Is it exactly the same power ?,71
593,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,It is.,71
594,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Is not the same power given in the interpretation clause of this Bill as is given in the interpretation section of the New Zealand Act?,71
595,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Ver y possibly, but that does not alter the position.",71
596,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Then this clause is superfluous ?,71
597,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I do not think so, but if it is superfluous, and the riower is granted in another part of the Bill, why this strenuous objection to the clause?",71
598,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Why admit it?,71
599,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Because I think it is necessary for the reasons I have indicated. To-night, and previously, we have heard a great deal about the liberty of the subject. The honourable member for Gippsland, who, as head of the. MCLean Government, did more than any two other Premiers in Victoria to bring into operation the Wages Board provision in the Factories Act, has been prattling about the liberty of the subThe ject.",71
600,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,That is a subject which the honourable member does not understand.,71
601,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"If I do not understand' the subject, Professor Herron. of the Harvard University, does. This is what he saysTlie truths that stood for liberty less than a centurv ago now fairly oppose the freedom of the sons of God. The tyranny of today was the liberty of yesterday. The old passion for independence (and liberty) is the new passion for gain, for the authority which money gives in state, church, and society. The men who are prattling about liberty are those who are opposing to the very death a measure which has for its object the bringing of liberty to the toiling masses of Australia.",71
602,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,He was referring to the tyranny of labour. 5 Conciliation and [REPRESENTATIVES.],71
603,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"He was referring to the tyranny of the so-called prattlers liberty. What does my honourable friend mean by that term? Does he refer to the negative liberty of the savage, or to positive liberty of seamstresses under the Factories Act in Victoria. We had a negawere tive liberty here and seamstresses made shirts for i£d. each, but when we were given that repressive measure, the Wages Board compelled the employers to pay the same persons 16s. a week for 48 hours' work. or corporations. Where is the liberty and where is the dom ? Is it to be found in the laissez faire policy of my honourable friend, or in the "" thou shalt not"" which is contained in a measure as we have before us? The men who in this Chamber prattle about liberty, and talk about the rights working man, know nothing about him his interests. They represent him in way, and are not in sympathy pirations and ideas. Honourable members who represent banking, insuring, and mining interests claim that this will be an pression to men who do not belong to trades unions, ancl yet they belong to the closest corporations and closest trades unions that it is possible to conceive. Take, stance, the insurance companies of Victoria, and treat as a unit one company. I will be found that it is absolutely imposdiscussed sible for one to inaugurate a new company here unless he belongs to the Underwriters' Association.",72
604,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The point is not closing them, but forcing them open.",72
605,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The organizations I am genius speaking of are closed. The Insurance In stitute here is such a close corporation, such a fearful trades union",72
606,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,Is that right?,72
607,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Thes e people think so, but they refuse to allow that right to to trades unionism. others.",72
608,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,But does the honourable member think it is right?,72
609,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"If I had tb choose behimself. tween the two evils of a monopoly or an organization, and unbridled and unrestricted competition. I should prefer the former by all means, and I should regulate am sure that it would be to the advantage of the community. .",72
610,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,The whole political hisof tory of the honourable member bears out that statement.,72
611,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I am not ashamed the of my political history in any spect. Let me tell the honourable member Arbitration Bill. that at the last Trades Union Congress, for held in Chicago, it was unanimously resolved that the trusts there had been, to a large degree, beneficial to the interests of the the trades unions and wage-earners of America, and that trusts properly regulated infinitely better than competition unbridled and unchecked. This proposal is opposed by the representatives of the most powerful and close corporations in Victoria. They know the value of these unions They compel every one freewho wishes to trade with them, whether lawyers, bankers, or insurance brokers, first to join their ranks. That being the case, such why should they be so apprehensive about the interests of the working men ?",72
612,Mr WILLIS,Unknown,"Does the honourable memof the ber approve of that? or Mr Mauger - Of the two evils, I preno fer the latter. I am not either approving with his asor disapproving of it.",72
613,Mr WILLIS,Unknown,What is the latter?,72
614,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,I am pointing out that opthey deny to others what they consider to be good for themselves.,72
615,Mr WILLIS,Unknown,Does the honourable memf o r i nber approve of it ?,72
616,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I will not enter into t that matter. It is too big a question to be now, and not relevant to the amendment. Not one representative of a large body of working men has been authorized to protest against this clause. With 4 some exceptions, those who oppose it are those who are opposed to the spirit and of the Bill , and to trades unionism.",72
617,Mr CHAPMAN,Unknown,That is most unfair.,72
618,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I have said that there are exceptions, and I will accept my honourable friend as one of them. . Mr GB EDWARDS - I am not opposed",72
619,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I accept my honourable friend's assurance; but he speaks only for What about the honourable and learned member for Wannon, and other honourable members sitting in the Opposition corner? Is it not notorious that they it, and I are opposed to the Bill?",72
620,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,Many of those .who opposed the clause have shown the sincerity their sympathies for labour to a greater extent than the honourable member has done.,72
621,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I am content to leave public to judge that. I hope that the reamendment will be rejected. I can regard those who vote for it only as voting against one of the main provisions of the Bill, and one of the leading principles of radicalism and trades unionism.",72
622,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown, I have opposed the Bill ; but not because I am opposed to unionism or am out of sympathy with the workers. My position should indicate that.  does not believe in trades unionism.,73
623,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,"I would not raise my finger to prevent a man from joining a trades union, nor would I refuse to employ a trades unionist. I believe that trades unionism has done a great deal for the labouring classes. In my opinion, no trades unionist should be black-balled; but, on the other hand, no legislative preference should be given to trades unionists. We are legislating, not for trades unionists, but for all sections of labour  ber ever know of a strike of any consequence in which a union was not concerned ?",73
624,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,"I myself went out on strike once, but I am not a union. I do not desire that any unionist shall be placed at a disadvantage; but, in passing a measure of this kind, we have no right to give unionists an advantage over non-unionists. The Prime Minister, has stated that the action of the Sydney Wharf Labourers' and other unions, in closing their books, was not the outcome of the 'New South Wales Arbitration Act. We all know that. But when he says that we have no right to complain of such occurrences under the Act, because they took place prior to its becoming law, I say that we have such a right, because we are being asked to give certain privileges to .unionists, and therefore it should be open to anyone to become members of. unions.",73
625,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,So it is.,73
626,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,"It required a decision of the Court to bring that about. The spirit and intention of unionism must - be judged by the acts of the unions, not by what their members say.",73
627,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,Onl y two unions out of hundreds have closed their books.,73
628,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,"Notwithstanding, the action shows the spirit of unionism. The members of those unions were willing to allow others to starve in order to keep work for themselves. I wish to put unionists and non-unionists on an equality.",73
629,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The honourable member is willing that the unionist should pay the cost of the advantages which the - non-unionist enjoys.,73
630,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,"No . The Minister of External Affairs said that the wharf labourers closed their books against his advice at a time when there were 3,000 men in the union, and employment for only 1,500. But if we are going to regulate employment in that way, let us provide that where there is not sufficient work one set of men shall be taken on for a month, and shall then give way to another set. Such a state of affairs shows the utter futility of legislation of this kind to prevent distress among the working population. I do not believe that all non-unionists are scabsThere are both good and bad men in unions, and both good and bad men outside unions. The unions cannot claim a monopoly of the good men. There must be organizations under the Bill, but they should be organizations formed only for the purposes of the measure, and those who wish to join them should be permitted to do so on payment of the smallest fees possible. Moreover, they should have nothing to do with any matter not arising under the measure. References have been made to the report of Judge Backhouse on the New Zealand legislation, but that report is a neutral one. The Judge does not go into ecstacies about the New Zealand system. We cannot say yet that the New Zealand system of giving preference to unionists has or has not worked badly, because the colony has been on the' up-grade ever since the Act was passed, and we do not know what its effect would be in times of depression. The Minister of External Affairs tried to make a joke of the proposition of the honourable member for North Sydney, that all those connected with an industry should be made members of an organization, whose funds should be under the control of the Coura The Minister said that if the masters were required to deduct from the wages of their employees the funds due to the organization, and to pay them into Court, they would be robbing their employees. That was a silly thing to say. A great deal of the time of the New South Wales Arbitration Court is now taken up in hearing cases dealing with the non-payment of subscriptions. There have been instances of extreme hardship, men having been, compelled to pay subscriptions out of very scanty earnings. Surely the action of the Court under these circumstances can 5 Conciliation and be termed robbery of the employees, if the action of the employers under the circumstances referred to by the Minister would justify the use of that word. The QT- ganizations under the Bill should not be allowed to become political organizations. We should not compel men to join organizations other than those formed purely to carry out the purposes of the Bill. ",73
631,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,If preference is given to unionists-and that has been done in New South Wales by order of the Court - othe r men in the same line of business will be unable to obtain work. They will thus be compelled to join a union or to starve.,74
632,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"No . Mr LONSDALE , - r The honourable member's mind runs on different lines from that on which mine works. Court makes an award giving a preference to unionists in any employment, a man who is a non-unionist cannot secure employment unless he joins a union. compelled by force of circumstances to join a union or to starve. I admit that the clause contains the words "" all things being equal."" But who is to judge of that? In a Sydney case the Judge said that the Court was to decide as to things being equal, and not the employer. his decisions the Judge in Sydney has said that an employer must go to a union when he requires the services of a man. employer mav want a workman within a day, and the Judge in some awards has given the union a week in which to supply an employ^, so that, by having to go to a union, the employer may have to wait a week. Surely we should provide that no such restrictions shall be placed upon employers of labour, who are developing ithe wealth of the country. At a later stage I intend to. move an amendment upon paragraph b, and if my proposal is carried, - it will remove the opportunity of doing any such injustice. propose to omit the word "" and,"" and to insert the following words:provided that an employer may employ a person or persons who are not members of an organization, but shall constitute them members by paying the fees of membership for any or all such persons to such organization. That is a fair proposal. If an employer desires .to employ certain persons let him do so by paying the membership fees to the [REPRESENTATIVES.] Arbitration Bill. union connected with the trade. I know numbers of cases in which men who have been for some time in the country have come down to Sydney, and have got work straight away; but if this Bill had been in force they could have obtained no employment, because they were non-unionists.",74
633,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,Where does the honourable member get that idea from?,74
634,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,"I quite recognise the kindly nature of my mild and amiable friend, the member for Darling, but surely he is aware that the Arbitration Court in Sydney has decided that an employer must employ a unionist or stand the risk of being fined ?",74
635,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Unionist s have preference; that is all. M i . LONSDALE - What is the use of talking nonsense? A saddler at Redfern If the employed an old mate who came to him and,,told him that he was in a difficult position; and expected to have the bailiffs in. He paid him a higher wage than the He will be award of the Court. The secretary of ' the union came along and said, "" You are employing a non-unionist,"" and the saddler was hauled before the Court for committing an offence, whereas he was simply employing a man out of pure benevolence. The honourable member for FreI n some of mantle laughs at this statement. But it is absolutely true, and the facts can be found in the records of the Court. An",74
636,Mr WATSON,Unknown,What is the name of the man?,74
637,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,"The name, I think, is Bpoth. I am not accusing unionists of trying to do hard things, but they will not believe that hard things have happened when they do not wish to believe them to be true.. They will not recognise'that any good can - come to a working man outside a union. Their outlook is narrowed by their surroundings. I am not here to fight against unions, but I am here to fight to put every I workman on an equal footing. Men like myself have been charged with being enemies to unionism, and never doing anything for working men. I am Drepared to set my career against that of any honourable member in the Labour Party in respect to what I have done in the interests of the workers. I have done things that this Bill would prevent me from doing again. Although I say it myself, I have done things which were actuated by the highest altruism. I have had a man come to me who had been working for three weeks for 30s. He was a farm hand, and 1 did not want a farm hand; so I employed him in building, and gave him 5s a day to start with. He was a man who had not handled a tool in his life, but I kept him so employed until he could earn a workman's wages. Let honourable members opposite, with all their boasts of what they do for the working classes, tell me of any man in their own ranks who has ever done anything of that kind. I oppose this Sill because I do not believe that it will help the masses. It will neither widen employment nor increase it ; nor will it increase wages. The Arbitration Act in New South Wales has done very little to help the masses.",74
638,Mr WATSON,Unknown,We admit that it does not increase employment.,75
639,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,"I do not think that my amendment is an unfair one, and I trust that the PrLne Minister will consider it carefully. It will give the employer power to employ whom he likes, so long as he pays the union fees. Of course he will be able to deduct those fees from the wages of the men, if he chooses.",75
