1,Mr GEORGE LAWSON,Unknown,"""Will the Minister for Trade and Customs have inquiries made, and advise me as to whether the following paragraph which appeared in last Friday's Sydney Daily Telegraph is based on fact? SHIP'S PETS KILLED. Officers and seamen of the freighter, King Neptune, refusing to destroy their pets, Customs officers went aboard and killed seven canaries. This was done because Captain R. Evans declined to enter into a bond' of £350 that the birds would not get loose in Australia. They were bought in Portuguese East Africa two months ago, and the owners were greatly indignant over their destruction!",12

The Government aims, in the first - place, at maintaining essential SECURITIES. imports from the United Kingdom",12
10,Mr CIIRTTN,Unknown,"I suggest that the Minister should ask for leave to make a statement. Sir B7EJTRY OUXLETT (HentyMinister directing negotiations for trade treaties) [3.8] - by leave- I was saying that there appears to be some misapprehension in the mind of the honourable gentleman as to the objectives of the GoWill vernment. Tn the first place, in connection with essential imports into Australia, the aim is to maintain imports from the United Kingdom at a level which w i ll enable the exports of primary produce from this country to the United Kingdom to be maintained at the present level, and even to be expanded. In the second place, the aim in connection with foreign goods is to provide for a well-balanced share from all good-customer foreign countries, including Japan. I may say that, at the present time, the balance of trade joyed by Japan with Australia is parably better than that enjoyed by any other country which is a good customer for Australian wool. So much for primary side. On the secondary side, the aim is to ensure that the standard of living of the 500,000 employees of the manufacturers of Australia shall be guarded against competition from very low-wage countries. There I leave the matter.",12
11,Mr CTJETTM,Unknown,"Fremantle) [3.9] - by leave-The Minister has not given a satisfactory answer to my question. He has said that it is undesirable in the public interest to disclose the various steps that have marked the negotiations beter tween the Government of the Commonopportunity wealth and the Government of Japan in respect of the tariff schedules that have lain on the table of this House for months. That may or may not be a justifiassurance able defence. But instead of answering question, the honourable gentleman ceeded to make an explanation additional to the many explanations which both he tralia giving way? and the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) have already made in justification of policy which this House has had an opportunity to discuss, let alone to decide. If the Government of Japan has submitted proposals to the Australian Government, this Parliament would like to know about them. If Parliament knew the nature of those proposals, it would be in a position to judge whether the Government was right or wrong in refusing to accept them. Moreover, if the Government would indicate what modifications, if any, of the tariff schedules which have been tabled it is prepared to make, Parfor liament would be in a position to know whether the Government of Japan was behaving reasonably towards Australia by rejecting them. ""Whilst it may be that too much public discussion is not desirable during delicate negotiations, I subject ? point out. that the whole of the public discussion which has taken place in AusGovernment tralia so far has been indulged in by Prime Minister and his colleagues. They have called on every other section of the community to be silent, and then, when honourable gentlemen on this side of House, including myself, have hearkened to their request, and remained silent, we enhave been rebuked for not having had incomanything to say on the subject.",13

I regard it from the viewpoint of the larger interest of Australia's present economic position and future outlook, - both nationally and industrially.

If so, will he indicate the nature of the debts which would be owing to the Commonwealth by farmers in Queensland?",14

Will the Minister say what qualifications such officials have'",15
26,Mr WHITE,CONSOLIDATION OF,"It is rather astonishing to find that neither the honourable member himself, nor Mr Norman Lindsay, knows that customs officials do not decide whether books shall be banned, or that a board was set up about three years ago to do this work. Its chairman is Sir Robert Garran, a distinguished citisen, who like all the other members, is qualified to decide whether a book comes within the meaning of the act as being blasphemous, indecent, or obscene.",15

28,Mr WHITE,CONSOLIDATION OF,"Probably an honourable member has the book out of the Library at present. The book is not on the banned list.

As the Minister for Health has already indicated publicly that he favours the regular medical examination of persons over the age of 35 years, and as more than 80,000 persons in the Commonwealth received an invalid pension last year, I ask whether early consideration will be given to the advisability of conducting annual medical examinations of citizens of the Commonwealth with a view to the prevention of diseases which could be prevented if the symptoms were discovered sufficiently early ?",16

The report suggested that a neglect of my customary caution might cause the doors to send me sprawling on the pavement, and that if any of my constituents saw me in such a position they might misunderstand the cause. I wish to say that I made no reference to the Launceston post office. I voiced no grievance except in respect of the negligence of the Government concerning the requirements of my own electorate.

Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended; resolution adopted. Ordered That Mr Thorby and Mr Menzies do prepare and bring in a bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. . Bill brought up by Mr THORBY, ana read a first time. SECOND READING.",19
81,Mr THORBY,APPLE AND PEAR BOUNTY BIL L,"(Calare-Assistant Minister for Commerce) [3.47] - I move That the bill be now road a second time. In 1933 the Government granted the sum of £125,000 to growers of apples and pears to compensate them for losses incurred on exports for that year. This amount was made available to the States in proportion to their share of the export trade, and payment to the growers actually took the form of a bounty on each case exported. The same amount and form of assistance was granted to apple and pear growers in respect of the 1934 season - Greatly improved prices, compared with those for 1933 and 1934, were obtained in the United Kingdom for i 1935 exports. It was, therefore, considered that a reduction of the grant was justified. The Government accordingly granted a bounty of 4d. a case on apples and pears exported during 1935. It was anticipated that this bounty would absorb approximately £SO,000. Distribution of the bounty for 1935 was arranged from through State authorities in accordance with section 11 of the Apple and Pear Bounty Act 1936. The amount of bounty payable in respect of each State is approximately as follows:New South Wales 3,198 Viotoria 14,130 Queensland 123 South Australia 5,094 Western Australia 14,873 Tasmania . . 44,132 In addition to the bounty paid growers, £20,000 was made available the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, in conjunction with State Departments of Agriculture for research in connection with the production of apples and pears and for the improveduring ment of apple and pear orchard praccult tices. The total amount of assistance granted to growers of apples and pears in respect of the year 1935 amounts to £101,551. The Government was requested by various organizations in the industry continue assistance in respect of the present year. It .was claimed that growers could not make both ends meet, and were in a desperate position because of the disappointing returns from sales of fruit in the United Kingdom market. The State Fruit Board of Tasmania estimates that orehardists in that State lost £194,000 on the season's operations, and claims that growers in the mainland States suffered in like manner. Another disturbing factor in the distribution the apple crop overseas is the inability, because of exchange difficulties, to place a fair proportion of the crop on the Gerthe man market. If this quantity, which normally might be estimated at 1,000,000 eases, were placed on the British market in addition to the present supplier, prices would further recede. The industry claims to have attacked its problems from every aspect, but it still finds itself a large quantity of prime fruit, and this is a disturbing factor in its marketing arrangements.",19
82,Mr BEASLEY,APPLE AND PEAR BOUNTY BIL L,What are the obstacles on the German market? ifr. Thorby,20
83,Mr THORBY,APPLE AND PEAR BOUNTY BIL L,"On e difficulty arises the exchange position, and another is that the German Government is not prepared to sanction importations of goods from countries in which Germany has no credit balance. To overcome the latter difficulty certain fruits were sent £ from Britain to Germany, via France, but, owing to the heavy costs involved in this transaction, it remained unprofitable to send fruit to Germany. I point out that, while apples intended for sale in Germany were bringing up to £1 sterling in France, owners were left with 81,551 a margin of only 2s., or 3s., a case, out of which they had to meet various charges to and discounts. An examination by the to Department of Commerce discloses that the financial returns for the 1986 apple export season fell considerably below those for 1935. Prices opened well in April this season, but rapidly declined the following months. It is diffito calculate definitely the average drop in price a case for 1936 as compared with the average price a case in 1935, but 2s. is considered to be a reasonable estimate.

(approximately) 3 6 Undoubtedly, fruit-growers have suffered through the fall of overseas prices of this year and, after fully considering the case presented by the representatives of the industry and carefully reviewing position, the Government has decided to pay a bounty of 4£d. a bushel case to growers in respect of apples and pears exported from Australia during the year ending the 31st December, 1936. Exports of apples and pears from the Commonwealth this year total 5,508,621 cases, with compared with 4,853,610 cases exported in 1935, or an increased export of 655,011 cares As the result of the increased export and the increase of i d . a case in the bounty, an expenditure of approximately £103,287 will be involved in respect of this year. The amounts allocated to the States will be, roughly, as follow:New South Wales 2,383 Victoria Queensland South Australia Western Australia Tasmania 53,700 Total ..",20
84,Mr CURTIN,APPLE AND PEAR BOUNTY BIL L,What was the amount paid in the previous year?,21
85,Mr THORBY,APPLE AND PEAR BOUNTY BIL L,"Eighty-on e thousand pounds. The amount to be provided this year represents an increase of about 27 per cent., or an increase of i d . a case, but on the average exporters have a greater export this year. This bill, which provides for the payment of the bounty this year, is an amendment of the Apple and Pear Bounty Act, No. 4 of 1936, which gave legislative approval to the bounty for the year 1935. The principal amendment relates to the closing date of applications for the bounty. Provision is being made that the Minister may accept ,elaims lodged after the due date, provided he is satisfied that the circumstances warrant such action. Our experience in the past in connection with bills of a similar character which fixed a closing date for applications was that the applications of certain producers who, through unforeseen circumstances, neglected to lodge their applications within the time specified, could not be granted until further legislation had been passed to extend date. In order to ensure that the bounty will be paid to growers in every case section 6 will be amended to make it clear that the bounty will be paid to growers only on apples or pears exported by them and only if the claim is certified to be correct by the prescribed authority within each State.",21
86,Mr BEASLEY,APPLE AND PEAR BOUNTY BIL L,Agent s cannot come in and collect this bounty?,21

98,Mr CASEY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Corio - Treasurer ) [4.6] - The honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) is seeking to give further relief from sales tax to governing bodies. In each of the last three years the Government has Goattempted progressively to lessen the burden of sales tax on local governing bodies. This bill contains a number of items which, though not designed specifically for that purpose, will have that effect. Local governing bodies will enjoy exemption in respect of goods on the general list of exemptions which applies to the whole community. They also complete exemption on all building (c), materials, and road-making material and, under this bill, on'pipes and piping of all descriptions whatsoever. They also to enjoy free and unconditional exemption in respect of bitumen and bituminous that emulsion. The Government has always been anxious to assist local governing bodies of all sorts, not only shires and municipalities, but all local governing inbodies which perform services, not for as profit, but for the benefit of the community in which' they are situated, and which obtain revenue by rates, &o. Bodies of that type are numerous in Australia, but I believe that the honourable aids member for Barker desires his amendment to apply only - to shires and",22
99,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"That is what I had in mind, but perhaps the Government desires to extend the exemption.",22
100,Mr CASEY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"The Government is of opinion that the term ""local governing "" should have a considerably wider application than the honourable member used intends. In the mind of the Governi t includes local governing bodies of all kinds, whether they be harbour boards, county councils, district councils, or similar bodies, and of these there are in Australia no fewer than 2,000. To to extend the exemption set forth in the honourable member's amendment to all these local bodies would cost the Treasury ARCHIE about £100,000, but if the definition were restricted to the narrow application intended by the honourable member, the cost would be only about £4,000 or £5,000. Again, the term "" tractor"" is not a satisfactory definition, unless it is taken to be the limited description of tractor which is now free for primary-producing purposes, and which is merely a mobile power unit. The Government has sought in this bill to bring before Parliament what it believes to be the most worthy list of items for exemption, and has devoted considerable time and money to its compilation. I can well believe that practically every honourable member could propose amendments to this bill in respect of items which have considerable merit, but I question whether they have as much merit as items already in this measure. The Government's attempt throughout has consistently been to place proposals for exemption in order of merit before Parliament. It has studiously attempted to lift the burden of the sales tax from those least able to bear it, and for that reason has remitted more than £500,000 in respect of footwear, tea, coffee, and cocoa. All additional exemptions proposed are intpossible for the reasons given generally in my second reading speech and for reasons which I shall give in detail when the items are being discussed. The Government could not possibly contend with the fresh lists of exemptions which every honourable member could submit. I myself could bring forward a fairly large list of exemptions which have merit. The proposal made by the honourable member for Barker is admittedly laudable, but the Government is limited in its ability to do without revenue from sales tax. The decision to reduce the rate of the tax from 5 per cent, to 4 per cent, and the exemptions already provided for in this bill will result in a loss of revenue amounting to £3,000,000 a year; but, as I mentioned in the budget speech, the Government will bear the loss for nine months of this year only. Next financial year the full burden of the sales tax remissions and exemptions will fall on the budget, and the Government is counting on a revival of trade in order to meet the additional burdens. The Government finds itself unable to accept further proposals for exemption as they would involve further loss of revenue. It has gone to considerable lengths to make remissions, not only of sales tax, but also of other taxes, and it regrets that it cannot go beyond what is now proposed. It will, however, further consider this matter in connection with any future lists of exemptions. As a matter of fact, the Government has in mind for the future many exemptions from sales tax; this is one of them. There is a wide range of foodstuffs still bearing taxes and it is the intention of the Government to free them from the tax burden at the earliest possible opportunity. ' Mr E. J. HARRISON - What about mining materials?",22
101,Mr CASEY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"It would take a fine tooth comb to find any mining material not exempted from sales tax. I appeal to honourable members to assist in the passage of this bill, and to realise that the Government has gone to the limit in this measure as in others for the remission of taxes. Although it is sympathetic with the aim of the honourable gentleman, it unfortunately is unable to see its way to accept his amendment.",23
102,Mr FORDE,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Capricornia) [4.14] - I do not often find myself in agreement with the motives of the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron), but in his amendment he has my full Bupport, because, as the Treasurer (Mr Casey) said, his attempt to exempt from sales tax burdens a large number of impecunious local-governing bodies in Australia is laudable. These bodies require tractors for road work, &c.",23
103,Mr CASEY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,What about the Sydney Harbour Trust?,23
104,Mr FORDE,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"I shall later have an amendment to cover the Sydney Harbour Trust, and the Rockhampton Harbour Board, and local governing bodies generally. It is not often that the honourable member for Barker is modest in his requests, but as the Treasurer has pointed out, to grant it would involve a loss, of revenue of only £4,000 a year. The Commonwealth Government boasted that it had a surplus of £3,500,000 at the end of last financial year.",23
105,Mr CASEY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,That is all gone now.,23
106,Mr FORDE,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"But £4,000 is a small amount when compared with the revenue of £81,000,000 a year, which this Government receives from all sources. I can understand reluctance on the part of the Treasurer to accept amendments involving large losses of revenue, but this amendment cannot be placed in that category. The Treasurer indicated that the Government was not able to receive suggestions for amendments to this bill. If it adopts that attitude, why waste the time of Parliament in discussing this matter? many decisions are made behind the back of Parliament by Cabinet, without honourable members being given an opportunity to present their views and to take full responsibility for the decisions made by Parliament. Surely the Treasurer will listen to the representations made by the honourable member for Barker. He listened to the representations made by the people interested in the timber industry with such sympathy that provision was made in this bill to exempt from sales tax tractors used in the hauling of log timber just as tractors used in primary industries are also to be exempted. That is a laudable decision, and to it I have no objection.",23
107,Mr CASEY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,The exemption of tractors used in the timber industry is a logical extension of the exemption of tractors used in primary industries.,24
108,Mr FORDE,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"That is so, but it would be still further logical to extend the exemption to tractors purchased by local governing bodies. As a matter of fact, transport generally is of much greater importance than any sectional primary industry, whether it be timber-getting, potato-growing, or sugar cultivation, and I hope for that reason that the Treasurer will accept the amendment. The honor and several other honourable members say that they have received telegrams from local governing bodies asking for relief from sales tax. At question time on the 24th instant the honourable member for Boothby said I.have received a telegram from the tary of the Miinicioal and District Council's Association of South Australia, which readsDisappointed no relief sales tax local government bodies; is this final ? The honourable member asked the Treasurer to explain the position, and if possible to give relief in the direction sought. I myself, received a number of telegrams on the same subject, and, in order to secure relief for the Rockhampton Harbour Board, a far-reaching amendment is necessary. I have circulated an amendment, which I intend to move to exempt machinery implements and apparatus for use by municipal corporations, or other local governing bodies, or by public authorities. If carried, that amendment would give relief Too to the extent of £100,000 a year, but in the meantime I do not intend to _ add a load to the very modest request submitted by the honourable member for Barker, which, if conceded, would cost only £4,000. The Treasurer said that a deputation from the local governing bodies waited on him and asked for this relief. He put this question to the deputation: "" In the event of this relief being granted, by how much will you reduce your rates ?"" It would not be possible .for the councils to reduce their rates by twopence or threepence in the £1 when, over the whole of Australia, the relief would amount to only £4,000. The granting of the honourable member's request, however, would enable the councils to keep men in employment for longer periods. At a time like this such a concession would be worthwhile.",24
109,Mr CASEY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,That is not peculiar to the honourable member's suggestion; it may be said of every proposal to give relief from taxation.,24
110,Mr FORDE,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"The committee is already considering a specific proposal to give relief from taxation to the extent of £4,000, but my amendment to take it a step further will have the approval of local governing bodies throughout Australia. Many of these authorities in remote country areas have very meagre revenues and at times experience great difficulty in raising sufficient revenue to pay the salaries of their small staffs consisting usually of a clerk and a few permanent road men. Meanwhile, I hope Secrethat the amendment of the honourable member for Barker will be carried.",24
111,Mr JOHN LAWSON,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Macquarie) [4.23] - I sympathize with the Treasurer (Mr Casey) in the dilemma in which he finds himself when requests are made for further exemptions from this very onerous sales tax which I regard as a vicious form of impost. I endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) and shall support his amendment, although I believe- I Bay this subject to correction-that a more comprehensive amendment submitted at a later stage would be equally effective and would obviate the necessity for two further amendments which may be necessary to achieve his purpose. I do not altogether agree with the observations of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Forde) who has suggested that harbour trusts, metropolitan water and sewerage boards and similar public bodies should be included. If the honourable member would limit his suggested amendment to municipal and .shire councils it would be more acceptable to the committee. If the amendment now before the committee is not carried, I shall later move to exempt all machinery, implements and apparatus used by municipal corporations or other local governing bodies. The claim of such authorities for relief from this form of tax is - probably stronger than that which can be submitted on behalf of any .section of the community. Metropolitan water and sewerage boards and harbour trust authorities have not quite the same claim because they have not suffered so severely from the financial stress which has handicapped municipal and shire councils during the last six or seven years, particularly those in rural areas. Mr LA.NE - Metropolita n local governsympathetic ing bodies have been obliged to spend very large sums to relieve unemployment. Mr JOHN"" LAWSON - The amendlocal ment does not propose to omit tan municipal councils; but I ' feel that whilst they, too, nave suffered during the depression, the burden has been heavier upon rural municipalities and shire councils which have .a relatively large mileage of roads to maintain and experience difficulty in collecting revenue from ratepapers without, in many cases, offering a service commensurate with the tax demand. On Friday the Treasurer intimated that the Government, under another measure passed recently, was contion tributing to the local governing bodies £100,000 a year, which was rather more than it collected from them in sales with a v ew to relieving them in respect ; to the interest burden on their liabilities. I hope that the honourable gentleman did not wish the committee to accept that as an argument against the remission of sales tax in respect of local governing bodies. The fact that assistance has been given to such authorities is, I think, conclusive evidence of their extreme financial need. If one required further evidence one has only to recall the large number of amalgamations of municipalities and shires which have been necessary in recent years, owing to the utter impossibility of them carrying on as separate entities. I hope that the Treasurer will realise that the amendment is not submitted in a hostile sp'rit. If such bodies as metropolitan water and sewerage boards and harbour trusts are excluded the demand upon .th» Treasury will not be nearly so heavy :a« the £100,000 which he suggested.",24
112,Mr SCHOLFIELD,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Wannon) [4.28] I have been asked to support the amendment .and other .requests for similar exemptions to give relief to municipalities as well as requests for .a reduction of sales tax generally, and I have made my representations in .the Droper quarter as forceful as possible. But I realise that responsibility for determining what exempt ions shall be made rests with the Treasurer.. The amendment, submitted by the honourable member for ""Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) to exempt tractors used by local governing bodies is worthy of careful and consideration. If , however, we exempt tractors and take no action to exempt stone'crushers, graders and many other types of machines that are used hy governing bodies, we shall create - a metropolivery serious anomaly.",25
113,Mr FORDE,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,Thos e items will he dealt much with in a subsequent amendment.,25
114,Mr SCHOLFIELD,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"If we were to exempt from sales tax all of the machinery used by local governing bodies, it would seriously .affect the finances of the Government, and for that reason I find myself unable to support such a proposal. I desire to make my position quite clear in this regard. The exempof tractors from sales tax appeals to me, and I should like .to be able to support such a proposal; but .at the same time. I tax, realise that the Government has made very many exemptions, and that it has in its judgment exempted those items which will be most beneficial to the community. Personally, I do not favor the imposition by one taxing authority of a tax upon another, but because the exemption from sales tax of tractors alone without the oxemption of other items of machinery would create a serious anomaly, I cannot agree to it.",25
115,Mr MAHONEY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Denison) [4.31] The time has arrived when the Government should exempt all municipal councils throughout the Commonwealth from the obligation to pay sale3 tax on their requirements. Why should the people who reside in metropolitan areas bo forced to carry the heaviest burden of taxation Already they pay exceedingly high municipal rates; butthis Government, which has recorded a substantial surplus and which has hidden reserves imposes a tax upon unfortunate local governing bodies, and in the final analysis this amounts to another levy upon the ratepayers. In my opinion, it is quite wrong for the Governand ment to tax the local governing bodies in the manner in which it is doing at the present time. I hope that the honourable member for.Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) will consent to extend the scope of his amendment, because not many rollers or stone crushers are used in the course of a year. Prom the remarks which have been made by some honourable members it might be thought that the machinery under discussion is worn, out every 24 hours. Materials which are most urgently required by local governing bodies exempted from sales tax. An important municipal council in the electorate of Denisdn, has requested me to make representations to the Treasurer with a view to having this hardship rectified, aud I promised to accede to its wish. I shall therefore support any action which has that object in view. Mr CASET: - What materials purchased by local governing bodies are still subject to sales tax?",26
116,Mr MAHONEY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Unfortunately , I have not a schedule showing that information, but I understand that there is a considerable number of articles which come within this category. I was not one of the favoured few honourable members who received from the Treasurer a book setting out the various exemptions, and I consider chat the proper course for him to adopt would have been to supply all honourable members with this information. It would not have been too much to expect. Honourable members must protect the ratepayers who have already suffered to a great extent from the increase of rates made /by municipalities in order to tide them over the depression years. The local governing bodies have received no assistance in any shape or form from the Commonwealth or State Governments, and they have experienced considerable difficulty in balancing their budgets without levying extra rates from the already harassed ratepayers. I appeal to the Treasurer ? to take into consideration that aspect of the matter because there is no doubt that a certain section of the people who own property are paying high rates to municipal councils, and, in. some cases, are not receiving rentals from that property. The sales tax is an added burden to the carrying out of the work of the municipality increases the cost of local government. The Treasurer is well aware of that fact. Sales tax in any shape or form increases the burden on municipalities to such an extent that sometimes they are compelled to revise their rates and place an additional charge upon the already heavily taxed citizens, which is far beyond their capacity to pay. I am aware that the Treasurer is unable to accept all of the amendments which are submitted to him because honourable members' demands might possibly be are not so extravagant as to require the exemption of practically every conceivable article and commodity from sales tax; I agree that the best solution of the difficulty would be to abolish it. If we are to be statesmen it is our duty to grant the necessary relief to those local governing bodies who look to us for this assistance. My only desire is to record my protest oti behalf of the municipal council of Hobart and the smaller shire councils who have been compelled to amalgamate in order to save themselves from bankruptcy. By voting for the amendment moved by the honourable member for Barker we can afford them considerable relief.",26
117,Mr NAIRN,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Perth) [4.38] - In principle I consider that the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) Las justification for his proposal if he could carry it out in fairness to all others who have similar claims. His proposal could be supported not because it is a concession to tractors or to shire councils, but ou the ground that a superior taxing body should not impose a tax upon an inferior body. That is a sound principle upon which we could act. But when private members bring forward special requests concerning the interests of every electorate we obtain no semblance of order if we attempt to formulate a schedule on those lines. In the electorate of Perth for example, therij is a municipal council, a roads board, a fire brigade board and a health board, all of which are local-governing bodies which impose taxation upon the ratepayers, and each and every one of them has an equal claim for the exemption from sales tax of the materials which it uses for public purposes. When the Treasurer is in a position to say that he will apply this prin. ciple on a general basis I shall be a advocate of the adoption of that course. At various times I have made a request for the application of such a general principle. I hope that an attempt will not be made to discuss this matter piecemeal. If the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) secures the acceptance of his amendment, even though the concession which it involves is only a slight one, the inducement will be offered to other members to bring forward requests which have been made to them. The acceptance of one request invariably engenders claims for equal consideration. I advise the Treasurer to stand firm in the matter. When he is able to grant exemption in the case of all local governing bodies, I shall support him.",26
118,Mr LAZZARINI,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Werriwa) [4.41] I intend to support the amendment, which aims at the exemption from sales tax of tractors used by municipal bodies. Basically, the principle enunciated by the honourable member for Perth (Mr question. Nairn), in regard to a superior power taxing an inferior one, may be all right. that I am. At the moment, however, the lot of municipalities and shires is a hard one. They are finding it more difficult every year to do the work which devolves upon them, and the taxation field in which they may operate is decidedly limited. The works in relief of unemployment in which they have now to engage are causing their expenditure to increase constantly. The Treasurer (Mr Casey), in opposing the amendment, took refuge in the process of reasoning which he generally adopts in regard to different items, namely, that the loss to the revenue would average about £20 per annum in the case of each municipality. But all municipalities do not purchase every year, a tractor or certain of their other requirements; consequently, the argument in regard to average loss is nonsense and in reality does not work out as the Treasurer has stated that it does. A municipality may spend a given sum on a certain requirement this year, and nothing next year. Sales tax is a burden on municipalities in the year in which they have to launch out on the purchase of expensive machinery. The other day I heard the mayor of a municipality stress the diffistrong culties experienced by it in providing implements and other equipment needed in connection with relief works, the assistance given by the Government boing sufficient only to defray the cost of wages. In whatever way we view the matter, the extensive relief works in New South Wales, and probably in other States also, definitely add to the cost of administering municipalities. Doubtless, the result is to improve the condition of the roads, aud in other respects is of advantage to the municipalities; but the point is, that some of these works would not he undertaken in ordinary circumstances, and because they are put in hand, necessary machinery, implements and tools of trade, have to be provided. A very small concession is being sought. It is not a matter of life or death to the finances of the Commonwealth, which the press that supports the Government party constantly boasts are in a prosperous condition. Tho CHAIRMAN - The honourable gentleman is getting rather wide of the",27
119,Mr LAZZARINI,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,I do not think,27
120,The CHAIRMAN,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,Order !,27
121,Mr LAZZARINI,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"I am merely pointing out that the Government claims .that its finances are sound, and that the alight loss occasioned by the granting of this concession 'would make no material difference to them. I therefore request the Treasurer to give further consideration to the matter.",27
122,Mr MCBRIDE,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Grey) [4.46] - I very much regret that the Treasurer has been unable to accede to the request which is made by the amendment. This is not the first occasion on which representations have been made for relief to be' given to municipalities and other bodies' in connection with the sales tax. Similar representations were made last year, but the Treasurer then declined to heed them mainly on the ground that (rhe state of the finances did not permit him to do so. The honourable gentleman definitely promised however, that he would give very careful consideration to them in the future. [Quorum formed.] Many honourable members considered on that oceasion that the revenue estimates were very conservatively based, and subsequent events have, proved that they were right. In my opinion the Government has again acted conservatively in its estimates ofrevenue. I feel that the small concession involved in this amendment would not seriously affect the budgetary position. I definitely hold the view that the amendment does not go as far as the requirements of the case demand. Consequently, if at a later stage other amendments are moved covering a wider field, but excluding-harbour trusts and other bodies which are not so greatly in need of assistance as are municipalities or shire - councils, I shall support them. We press for this exemption for the reason that, during the depression many municipalities refrained from purchasing new machinery and tractors. Because of the very real difficulties which confronted the local governing bodies during the depression years, they were forced to carry on with old machines, but the improved financial situation generally has enabled some of them to purchase new machines, and others are contemplating similar action. If no exemption from sales tax be made this year, those councils which purchase new machines will have to pay the tax, whereas it is possible that those delay their buying for twelve months will benefit from the reduction or abolition of the. tax. This subject was discussed at some length a year ago, and the committee is justified in asking that an exemption be' made in the interests of local governing bodies. I remind the honourable member for Perth (Mr. Nairn), who said that he could not support the amendment because it would mean that exemptions would be dealt with piecemeal, that all the exemptions from sales tax which have been made have been done in that way. In regard to foodstuffs, for instance, the list of exemptions has been increased from time to time. Eventually all the requirements of local governing bodies will be exempt from this tax. In view of the more satisfactory financial position of the Commonwealth, local governing bodies should be given special consideration. I shall support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Barker (MT. Archie Cameron).",28
123,Mr STREET,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Corangamite) [4.54] The' amendment of the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) is specific in that it applies only to tractors for use by local governing bodies, but although I favour the exemption from sales tax of all machinery used by such bodies I cannot support his somewhat invidious proposal. If it were carried, the committee would have to consider the exemption of other equally deserving items. The proposed amendment of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) and that foreshadowed by the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr John Lawson) would, if accepted, seriously dislocate Commonwealth finance, notwithstanding the contention of the honourable member for Grey (Mr MCBride) that the Treasurer's estimate of revenue from this source is conservative. A loss of revenue amounting to £100,000 as the result of an exemption from the sales tax of. the requirements of local governing bodies would force the Government, to revise the list of proposed exemptions now before the committee. I am unable to suggest any article which should be removed from that list in order to exempt machinery required by local governing bodies. Last year the Treasurer told us which that, although he could not agree to exempt such machinery, he would assist local governing bodies as far as possible. The list of exemptions now before the committee is a fulfilment of that promise, and we have the Treasurer's .assurance that the claims of local governing bodies will be given consideration when further exemptions are proposed. In my opinion, it is wrong to tax the requirements of local bodies, for it really means that the Grown is taxing itself. Nevertheless, I cannot support the amendment, although I hope that the Treasurer will be able to include these items in the next list of exemptions which he places before Parliament.",28
124,Mr FISKEN,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Ballarat) [4.57] - In speaking to the second reading I urged the Treasurer (Mr Casey) to give sympathetic consideration to the proposal that machinery for municipal bodies be exempt from the sales tax. In doing so, I spoke not only as a member of this chamber, but also, as one who is still an active municipal councillor, and realizes the burden that this tax places on municipalities. I do not suggest that it is an annually recurring burden on each municipality, because very few local governing bodies are continually buying new plant, but periodically the tax does place a burden on municipalities. I cannot agree with the Treasurer that the exemption of these articles might enable municipalities to reduce their rates.",29
125,Mr CASEY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"I do not think that I said that,",29
126,Mr FISKEN,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"No municipality would be able to reduce its rates merely because these articles were exempted from the sales tax; but if the tax were removed, local governing bodies would be able make more roads or, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) suggested, provide employment for additional men. If the amendment of the honourable membe ber for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) were agreed to, other exemptions would have to follow as a logical sequence; therefore, whilst I may be willing to port his .amendment, even if it would deplete the revenue by £4,000 a year, cannot vote for it because I cannot associate myself with other amendments which have been foreshadowed, and if agreed to, would reduce the by, possibly £100,000. I am not prepared to interfere with the budget to - I have much sympathy with the r> othat extent. Xike the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Street), 1 cannot think of any article included in the list of proposed exemptions which should be taxed in order to enable these articles to be exempt. 1 was delighted to see in this morning's newspaper that the prices of tea and coffee are likely to be reduced as a result of exemptions under this bill. I accept the Treasurer's assurance that the exemption sought by the honourable member for Barker will be given sympathetic consideration next year, .and although I am in .sympathy with the honourable gentleman's aim, I cannot support i is amendment.",29
127,Mr MAHONEY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,Denison) [5.0] The Treasurer (Mr Casey) challenged me to name any article used by local governing bodies which IB taxed under this legislation. Tools used :by relief workers,29

Mr MAHONEY. - The Treasurer said that I could not name anything now taxable and I informed him that the picks and shovels used by unemployed relief workers are subject to sales tax. The municipal council of Hobart, which has carried out extensive relief works, is being taxed on the tools purchased for use by the unemployed.  first imposed the sales tax?",29
129,Mr MAHONEY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"I am concerned not with the first imposition of this tax, but with its removal. Road-inaking plant and motor wagons are subject to sales tax, as is also office eqnipment, such as typewriters, ink and pencils used by local governing bodies. to 1 could give the Treasurer a long list of articles which are still subject to this tax. It is indeed hard that the tools required by unemployed workers should subject to a tax. Such articles should be entirely exempt from the tax, in order to keep the overhead expenses of municiand, pal councils as low as possible and give suprelief to ratepayers. Unlike the farmers, who come to the Government in every I difficulty, the municipal councils have not approached the Commonwealth for assistance. I shall support any amendment to exempt from this tax the requirements of revenue local governing bodies.  r posal before the committee, but I realiw that it is the responsibility of the Government to frame the budget of the country. If this amendment were carried, other requests for exemptions from the sales tax could scarcely be refused. I am not prepared to take the business out of the hands of the Government in that way, and, therefore, I shall not support the amendment. The Government has not overlooked the claims of the local governing bodies, and has promised to give caref u l consideration to the request that requirements be entirely exempt from the sales tax. I am content to trust the Government in the matter. I congratulate the Government on its budget, and particularly on the measure of relief being given from sales tax. I regret that the Treasurer is unable to accept this amendment. Had he been able to accept it I should have given it my wholehearted support, but, in the circumstances, I do not feel that I should .be justified in voting against the Government on it.",29
130,Mr FRANCIS,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Moreton) [5.8] - I have taken considerable interest in this f >roposal and have, both orally and by etter, made representations to the Government similar to those made this afternoon by the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) that tractors required by local authorities and public bodies should be exempt from sales tax. I had hoped that the Government would see its way clear to include in the budget the exemption now requested. When the Treasurer (Mr Casey) was making his second-reading speech on this bill I asked, by interjection, whether it would be possible to include an exemption such as we are now considering, and I regret that it has not been possible; but I remind honourable members that this is only one item in two groups of items of similar consequence, and I feel that as things are we must, for this year, accept the decision of the Government. Strong arguments could be advanced for the exemption of many other articles on which sales tax is still being collected. I mention, for example, biscuits, other foodstuffs, and clothing, on which .the is still being imposed as being desirable items for exemption. If all clothing not be exempted, the clothing of children and of workmen engaged in manual labour should be considered. It should be borne in mind, also, that photographers suffered severely during the recent depression. The photographic trade has not made the recovery that certain other businesses have made, with the result that today many photographers are in difficult circumstances, and are cutting prices and making profitable trading more diffitheir cult than ever. Scores of other items could be urged with equal force. I look forward to the time when the Government will be able to abandon the sales tax altogether, and hope that that day is not far distant. It is the policy of the Government to collect only sufficient money by taxation to enable it to meet the legitimate costs of Government, and we have seen in the last five years that every endeavour is being made to return to the people, in some form or another, the surpluses which have been accumulated. Honourable members who are strongly in favour of this amendment should remember that municipal councils, shire councils and other kindred bodies have already had substantial evidence of the sympathy of the Government, for ihe sales tax has been entirely removed from a great deal of the equipment that they use. I have in mind most road-making materials, all timber, and piping of every description. Moreover the reduction of the rate of sales tax represents a 20 per cent, remission. It should he borne in mind, too, that the Government is making available £100,000 each year for the next ten years, to assist in meeting interest and sinking fund payments on loans raised for certain public works constructed by local governing bodies, and this amount is being doubled by similar contributions from the State governments. The benefits of that arrangement will go principally to shire councils. As sales tax to the amount of £3,000,000 is being surrendered this year by the Government we have not much cause for complaint. Of the total remissions under this heading, £2,000,000 is accounted for by the reduction of the rate of tax by 1 per cent., £500,000 by the exemption of tax boots and shoes, and tea, coffee, and cocoa, and another £500,000 by canthe exemption of lubricating oils, &c, and goods used as aids to manufacture. Although I am particularly anxious for the exemption of the item referred to by the honourable member for Barker, I feel that I cannot at this stage support the amendment. I have every confidence, however, that when the next budget is being prepared, sympathetic consideration will be given to this request. I cannot imagine that a government which has had surpluses for five years, and which, in the same period, has made considerable annual reductions of taxes in which all sections of the community have participated, will, on probably the eve of a general election, find it impossible to grant the relief which the honourable member is now seeking.",30
131,Mr FORDE,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"We were promised last year that sympathetic consideration would be given to this request. M.r. FRANCIS - The Treasurer has assured us that the most sympathetic consideration has been given to it. Would the Deputy Leader of the Opposition prefer the sales tax to be continued on the boots and shoes, tea, coffee, and cocoa of the man on the basic wage, and on lubricating oils and aids to manufacture in order to secure the exemption now sought? This Government's administration has resulted in a remarkable recovery of our manufacturing industries. To-day more people are employed in these industries than ever before in our history. A national record has been made. Is it not imperative that we should give a fillip to the substantial recovery that has already taken place in employment' by granting to our manufacturing industries this further assistance of the removal of the irritating sales tax from aids to manufacture?",31
132,Mr FORDE,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"The Treasurer has told us that it would cost only £4,000 to grant this exemption.",31
133,Mr FRANCIS,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"If this amendment were agreed to it would be necessary, in the interests of consistency, to agree to other similar exemptions involving the Treasury in a loss of revenue to the amount of £100,000. Seeing that our local governing authorities have been granted substantial relief, and under the budget proposals will be granted further assistance, we may, with every confidence, accept the assurance of the Treasurer that, as soon as possible,' the relief now sought will be granted. [Quorum formed.] inr. A. GREEN (Kalgoorlie) [5.16] I heartily support the amendment of the honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron), but I shall not,"" at this stage, reiterate the arguments he used, for I made similar representations in the course of my second-reading speech on this bill. I rise principally to direct attention to what I regard as a grave anomaly in these proposals. 1 feel sure that this is due to oversight. It is proposed to exempt tractors for certain uses in the agricultural and timber-getting industries, but no exemption is proposed for tractors used in the mining industry. This lends additional support to the statements I made a few days ago, to the effect that the mining industry generally has not been given the consideration to which it is entitled.",31
134,Mr CASEV,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,I do not know that many tractors are used in the mining industry.,31
135,Mr A GREEN,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Surely the Treasurer will not need me to remind him that in many important mines, such as those of the Lake View and Star Company, and the Wiluna Mining Corporation, tractors are used underground to drag the waggons of ore from the face to the shaft.",31
136,Mr CASET,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,Are they not electri* locomotives?,31
137,Mr A GREEN,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"I cannot believe) that the Treasurer is serious in attempting to draw a distinction of that kind. Whether the vehicles are ordinary traetors of the diesel oil type, or electric tractors, or electric locomotives, is beside the point.",31
138,Mr CASEY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"The description "" traotor "" could not be applied to the vehicles which the honourable member has in mind.",31
139,Mr A GREEN,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"If that is the Treasurer's opinion, I ask him to exempt electric locomotives used in mining operations. As tractors used for agricultural purposes and timber-getting are to be exempt, tractors used in mines also are entitled to similar treatment.",31
140,Mr CASEY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,Tractor s or locomotive* used for hatding products of a mine are already exempt.,31
141,Mr A GREEN,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"I am glad to have that information, but I still ask that more favourable' consideration be given to the gold-mining industry generally, in so far as it is still affected by the sales, tax. I have today received a letter from the Mines and Metals Corporation- I understand that the Treasurer has also received a similar communicat-on-in which attention is drawn to the unfavorable position in which the gold-mining industry remainsin relation to sales taxation. A request is made in that communication that workshop and machinery tools used for mining be exempted. The Treasurer is well aware that adequately equipped workshops are necessary on all big mines. This is particularly so in respect of mining fields far removed from large centres of population where foundries and other engineering equipment is available in the ordinary way of business. The big mining companies engaged in pioneering new fields have to provide themselves with plant of this kind. It is vital to the success of the mining industry that costs be kept down. We know very well that if the price of gold should fall many mines at present operating on a satisfactory basis would be seriously affected. I therefore ask that workshop machinery, including forges, lathes, drills, and grinding and sharpening machines, be granted exemption in accordance with the request made By the Mines and Metals Corporation.",31
142,Mr JENNINGS,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Watson) [5.23],- I am glad that the Government finds itself in a positionthis year to grant sales tax relief to the amount of £3,000,000 by reducing the rate by 20 per cent. While I appreciate the arguments advanced by the mover in-support of the amendment, and I support the view that one taxing Body should not tax another, I must say that I cannot see, from my own civic experience, that any substantial saving would be made by municipal councils if it were agreed to.",32
143,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,Then the honourable member cannot have had much experience in country districts.,32
144,Mr JENNINGS,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"I have had a long experience in municipal affairs, and I am of the opinion that, although some of the larger public bodies might benefit appreciably if the amendment were agreed to, ordinary municipal bodies would not find much relief from it. Our acceptance of this proposal would bring us face to face with some extraordinary anomalies. I consider that many other items are at least as much entitled to consideration as is the item specifically mentioned by the honourable member for Barker. Eor instance, biscuits, which are regarded as a staple item of food in the homes of many people in Australia, should be free from sales tax, as is pastry and certain other similar items. In view of these circumstances, if we accept this amendment we should be prepared to accept others. I can quite appreciate the fact that that would place the Treasurer in an embarrassing position. I support the proposal, but I suggest that this item and others should be seriously considered when the next list of exemptions is being drawn up. Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [5.26] - There is a good deal of merit in the amendment moved by the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron), who has stressed the justice of the claim of shire councils for the exemption of certain machinery from sales tax. Before preferential treatment is extended to the requirements of shire and municipal councils, there are, however, quite a number of items still subject to the tax to which consideration might be given. The honourable member for Barker should not have been content to stop at the requirements of public authorities. The question with which we have to concern ourselves is whether we should attempt, in this way, to take from the Treasurer (Mr Casey) the eontrol of the finances of the country. After all, the Treasurer is responsible for protect1 ing the revenue in order to ensure that the budget will be balanced. Australia is now just emerging from a period of depression, and the Government has introduced what is probably the best budget we have had for many years. A certain amount of conservatism must be shown by a government, and the Treasurer must play safe in determining whether exemptions which may affect thp revenue to a considerable extent should be granted. There are many other items, including foodstuffs and clothing, unon which sales tax is now imposed, which might well be included' in anv list of exemptions. Doubtless any relief given to the shire councils will be ultimately reflected in the rates, but the benefit will accrue to only the limited class of ratepayers and not to the general body of consumers, who, after ail, are those whom the Treasurer is endeavouring to help. The necessity for granting relief in respect of the tax collected on foodstuffs and clothing should be given first consideration. Honourable members have stressed the fact that shire councils have been subjected to severe strains during the last few years. That has been due largely to the unfortunate conditions under which the primary producers have laboured; but those conditions are greatly improved, owing to the rise of the prices of primary products. That change must, to a great extent, minimize the extraordinary stresses imposed on shire councils. ' Already the Government has granted remissions of sales tax amounting to £3,000,000, and it quite rightly asks, if tractors are exempted, what item the honourable member for Barker would substitute in order to make good the loss of revenue. Because of the piecemeal incidence of the adjustments effected by the sales tax exemptions, honourable members cannot put their finger on any particular item and say, "" This should be given prior consideration to commodities which affect the consumers generally"". The Government has already made remissions of sales tax to local governing bodies in respect of their requirements of bitumen and road-making materials, and by the general reduction of the rate by 1 per cent, below the rate operating last year, and it has recently made available a sum of £100,000 a year towards the interest and sinking fund charges on approved new developmental works. This Government has been most liberal in its treatment of local governing bodies. Although there is a certain amount of merit in the amendment-,, other items which affect more closely the community generally should be given prior consideration. T, therefore, propose to support the Government in opposing the amendment. Mr E. F. HARBISON (Bendigo) [5.311 - I join with other honourable members in supporting the Government in this matter. Anybodv who has considered the list of exemnt ons era^^d in respect of sales tax during the life of this Government must realise that the task confronting it has been to lift the load from those most in need of the relief. Admittedly, shire councils and boroughs have had a difficult time during the last few years, but they have only shared in the difficulties borne by the whole community. The relief whichi would be afforded by the acceptance of this amendment would be negligible when spread among the various municipalities, councils and other local governing bodies throughout the Commonwealth. If the Government feels that it is in a position to make further remissions of sales tax, 1 urge very strongly that, instead of extending the list of exemptions, the"" rate should be reduced, even if only by - J per cent.,, to bring it down to a figure which would permit of more easy calculation of the tax. If we accept the amendment of the honourable member for Barker, we should, in common fairness, exempt every other item of mobile machinery used by local governing bodies. To make that possible it would be necessary to delete from the present list of exemptions several very big items. I leave honourable members to select and suggest what those items should be. The Government is doing the right thing. It has already exempted nearly all the necessaries of life, including foodstuffs, clothing and boots, and tea, coffee, and cocoa are included in the latest schedule. To grant the exemption sought by the amendment would cost £4,000, and that would substantially reduce the small estimated surplus of £12,000. I am satisfied that municipalities, shires, boroughs and roads boards throughout the Commonwealth are very satisfied with the progress being made in the Commonwealth at the present time, and that they do not want the Commonwealth Government to show a deficit at the end of the financial year.. I have not had requests for a reduction of the sales tax from shires in my constituency. They know what the Government is doing and are satisfied that, at the right time, it will exempt these very useful items of their equipment, or progressively. reduce the rate of tax to vanishing point. I oppose the amendment.",32
145,Mr GREGORY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Swan) [5.33] - I dis; cussed this matter with the honourable member for Barker a few days ago, and after he had pointed out the object he had in view in proposing this amendment, I promised to support him. Listening to the views expressed by some honourable members on this side of the chamber, however, one would think that he had done something wrong in daring to suggest that certain classes of machinery should be free from sales tax, and that the acceptance of his amendment would embarrass the Government. The honourable member had no intention to place the Government in an embarrassing position. Surely when a bill to amend the Sales Tax Act is introduced, honourable members are entitled to say ""whether they approve of the exemptions and to propose others. Are honourable members expected to accept, without question, any bill which the Government may introduce? Are they here to follow blindly any policy or restriction which the Government may wish to impose, or are they hero as representatives of the people. Too frequently we have had attempts by a single member of the Ministry to impose, without legislative authority, conditions affecting the lives and business of the people. Parliament should assert its right and, after giving certain powers to the Government, see that they are not transgressed. It is for Parliament to decide what remissions aud exemptions from sales tax should be granted. I have no desire to place difficulties in the way of the Government, J am sure, had the honourable member for Barker in proposing his amendment. Only the other day I referred to the desirability of exempting explosives need in . the manufacture of ammunition. A large sum of money is expended in Western Australia on ammunition' used for the killing of pests. The Treasuror, however, was unable to give my request favourable consideration. When requests of that sort are preferred, the Government should seriously consider the advisability of accepting them. I contend more strongly than ever that every honourable member should assert his rights and see that ing seriously affecting the people is done without the concurrence of the Parliament.",33
146,Mr CASEY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Corio - Treasurer) [5.34] - Thos e honourable gentlemen who spoke in favour of this amendmentsboth those who will vote for it, and those who will vote against it-uniforml y regarded it as being designed to be of assistance to the country districts. That, of course, is a fact, because the rates are paid by the people of the country districts. But have honourable members ever considered the manner in which this and previous governments have treated the people in the country districts in respect of the sales tax? Do they realise that, under the original sales tax legislation introduced by the Scullin Government, sales tax was not imposed on many commodities used by primary producers, and that this Government, and the preceding Lyons Government, exempted practically everything which primary producers require to carry on their operations? Do those who have spoken on behalf of country districts realise that the exemptions on goods used by primary producers amount to about £1.000,000?",34
147,Mr GREGORY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,The Government had to do it in any case.,34
148,Mr CASEY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"I do not contest that point. Tho Government has done it with its eyes open in order to assist country districts, because, as was stated by the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr John Lawson), in recent years primary producers hnvo had a gruelling time. The nor, object of the tax is well known. Exemptions have been granted on practically everything used by primary producers, to enable them to carry out their work. It should also be realized to a. greater extent than it is that most of the sales tax is being carried by those resident in the cities and towns, and not by persons living in country districts, who have, I think, little of which to complain in rcsnect of the sales tax.",34
149,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Barker) [5.42] - I realise some of the difficulties which confront the Treasurer (Mr. Casey) in this matter, but I am not quite sure whether he appreciates some of the noth- difficulties confronting me and other honourable members representing country constituencies.",34
150,Mr CASEY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,I represent a country constituency.,34
151,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"The difficulties of the people in the electorate which I represent are perhaps greater than those in the portion of Victoria represented by the Minister. The Commonwealth Government should not collect eustoms and excise duties on goods required for State works, and in that way divert loan money into Commonwealth revenue. I have always supported the principle that the right to impose taxes belongs to the lower House of the Parliament, and in resisting that principle even Charles I . got into difficulties. The Government should not think that its followers have to support whatever taxes it seeks to impose.",34
152,Mr CASEV,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,This bill sets out items on which taxes are not to be imposed.,35
153,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"I am endeavouring to add to the list. If Parliament is to be converted into a committee meeting' at which honourable members can merely register their votes on decisions arrived at previously by the Government, we shall have to consider where democracy is drifting. Some honourable members should compare the speeches tfhey delivered on Friday last with the vote they intend to record this afternoon. In studying this subject, we should peruse the evidence given before the Royal Commission on the Wheat Industry, and reports brought before the House setting out the difficulties under which those resident in country areas are labouring. Many local governing bodies have found it difficult, and in some cases impossible, to collect the rates due to them, and so, even without this tax, it is not easy for them to purchase equipment with which to construct roads or maintain those already in use. Heavy losses have been incurred by local authorities owing to drift sand, and in some instances-thousands of pounds have.been lost owing to roads being buried under several feet of sand, necessitating the purchase of additional land to make new roads. In many instances, the damage is so extensive that additional road-making plant has to be purchased. It is absurd to suggest that a government with a revenue estimated this year at £81,000,000 will be inconvenienced by remitting an additional £4,000 or £5,000 of sales tax on tractors. The Government should not take umbrage if requests are made for additional exemptions; if the members of the committee are not entitled to suggest further exemptions, discussion is worthless. Is it to be contended tha; the list of exemptions before us, like the laws of the Medes and Persians, is unalterable? So long as I remain a member of this chamber, I shall move amendments I consider necessary, and fight in the best interests of the community. I trust that a majority of the committee will support my amendment.",35
154,Mr BERNARD CORSER,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Wide Bay; [5.48] - I sympathize with those who desire to relieve local governing bodies of as many taxes as possible, but I feel that if further consideration were given to the subject it would be found that, if tractors were exempted, other types of machinery and plant used by local authorities should also be exempted. The Government has considered the claims of local governing bodies, and has made exemptions wherever possible. The honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) said that a further remission involving £3,000 or £4,000 a year cannot affect the budget seriously, but a good case could also be made out for a remission of taxes on many commodities used, by the poorer sections of the community. The people generally give the Government credit for reducing the sales tax by £3,000,000 during this financial year, and in so doing, attempting to benefit all sections of the community. I intend to oppose the amendment, but I am not opposed to further remissions of the sales tax whenever practicable. A genuine attempt has been made by the Government to lighten the burden of all sections, and I believe that local governing bodies realise that further assistance will be given as soon as possible. I intend to support the Government.",35
155,Mr STACEY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Adelaide) [5.53] - As I was the first honourable member to bring this subject under the notice of the Treasurer (Mr Casey), I do not propose to record a silent vote on the amendment moved by the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron). Some time ago I asked the Minister if it were possible to assist local governing bodies by making the exemption now proposed, and I followed closely his explanation of the attitude of the Government. If this concession were granted, further exemptions would be sought which, if agreed to, would seriously interfere with the budget.

My proposal will involve a small 5 - loss of revenue. The Treasurer previously informed us that the loss would be AYES. £80,000 but as in the meantime, the rate of sales tax has been reduced from 5 per cent, to 4 per cent., the loss should be not more than £65,000.

Each year stock claim. there is consumed in Australia biscuits to the value of at wholesale values, and as there are about 1,500,000 families in Australia the expenditure on biscuits for each family is about £ 1 . Sales tax this expenditure, therefore, works out at about l»d. a family each year, an amount which I do not think any honourable memnot ber would say was a burden. Also, the figures 1I have quoted go far to disprove the honourable member's contention that biscuits form an important part of the lowing terms:ordinary family diet, seeing that, on an average, so few are consumed by each family. There is still a number of foodanomalies, stuffs subject to sales tax, such as miscertain cellaneous groceries, biscuits, tinned fish, same iee cream, and condiments of various foodstuffs, kinds. While those items continue to be subject to tax, it would be anomalous to pick out one item such as biscuits, and ing remit the tax on that.

We would draw attention to the fact that biscuits are manufactured from the same ingredients as pastry, scones, buns and cakes, which are exempt (see sales tax exemption items-Div .

The local manufacturers of macaroni tried last year to have this article placed on the exempt list, but, whilst similar foodstuffs have been freed from sales tax, this commodity has continued to carry the impost. The manufacture of macaroni is a useful secondary industry which should be encouraged, because the raw material is produced by a primary industry of this Macaroni is in the same position as maize and rice were some years 23 ago, when they were not considered to be 33 worth protecting, yet in a few years the fostering of those industries has put them 10 in their present position. The Treasurer (Mr Casey) surprised me by the smallAXES. ness of the figures which he cited as to the consumption of this commodity for each family. Between 400 and 500 persons are directly employed in the manufacture of this commodity in three factories in Melbourne, three in Sydney and one in Perth. Many other persons are, of course, indirectly employed through the industry. Macaroni is sold in 1-lb. packets at a cost of about 4d. per lb., and about 94 per cent, of all the macaroni used in Australia is now made in this country. NOES.",38

Until a few years ago this article was Tellers : rarely seen, except in restaurants, but today it is used in nearly every household, beiug a wholesome food for both children and adults. Other foodstuffs in common use have been exempt from the tax, and I cannot understand why macaroni has been overlooked. In view of the small amount of revenue involved, the Government might well grant the exemption. If the amendment is not accepted I ask the Treasurer to . give further consideration to these items with a view to their exemption in the very near future.",38
174,Mr HOLT,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Fawkner) [8.12] --This amendment shows, as must now be apparent to all honourable members of the committee, that there still remains a large number of commodities which logically ihould be included in the list of exemptions. A discussion took place regarding the removal of the sales tax from machinery required by local governing bodies, and in the discussion on other items, including foodstuffs, it has been made clear that next year, if the financial position permits, the Treasurer (Mr. Casey) will have every opportunity to widen the scope of the exemptions in a manner consistent with the policy already adopted. If the committee is to be consistent, it will have to follow the course marked out at the outset by declaring that there shall be no exemptions at all, or that all those commodities for exemption of which a strong case can be put forward shall be placed on the exempt list. Probably every honourable member of the committee could submit a strong claim for the exemption of one or more articles that now bear the tax. Personally, I strongly support the representations made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr. Holloway) in moving his amendment. Although the Treasurer may with truth be able to suggest that over a year, the cost to the average family of vermicelli, macaroni and spaghetti is not heavy, there some families-souther n Europeans, for example-in whose diet the three foodstuffs are staple items. Furthermore, macaroni and vermicelli, when used in puddings, play an important part in the diet of children. It could, therefore, be logically contended that they should be added to the foodstuffs which have already been exempted. The majority of the committee, however, has taken the stand that if we permit one exemption, we cannot withstand the force of arguments that may be adduced in favour of the exemption of many other commodities. The Treasurer should give earnest consideration to these three commodities when next he has exemptions from the sales tax under review. He has stated that any large additions to the list at the present time might interfere considerably with the budget proposals for the current year, but if he finds during the year that the receipts are in excess of the Estimate, he should not wait for the full year to expire before increasing the list of exemptions. If he finds that he is able to do this, the three commodities I have mentioned should be amongst the first to receive consideration.",39

Vermicelli, macaroni and spaghetti are staple items of food amongst the poorer classes. The aspect of this discussion which has struck mo most forcibly is the nauseous reiterathe tion of what the Treasurer might do next year. It seems that honourable gentlemen opposite are pleased that the Treasurer is keeping certain articles out of the list of exemptions this year in order to include them next year and so give to his party an effective electioneering appeal. The Government, however, should eschew such tactics and do now what it will be able to do next year when an election will be looming. In view of the Government's boasting about its surpluses, it cannot be said that the Treasurer wants the few pence which he extracts from the workers by taxing their are food.",39

181,Mr MENZIES,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [8.31] - ib y leave-Wit h the development of the dominions and the rapid increase in recent years of their status in international affairs, tke formulation of a common foreign policy, commanding the confidence and support of all members of the British Commonwealth of Nations becomes increasingly desirable. In this, respect, the League of Nations and the principles embodied in the Covenant have provided a focal point for a joint British Commonwealth policy, and lately the declared policy of each individual member of the British Commonwealth has been based on League principles involving collective action, arbitration, conciliation and peace. These principles, world-wide in their scope, facilitated a consistent and uniform outlook for the British peoples. Unfortunately, the events of the last twelve months, more particularly in relation to the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, it must be admitted, tended to weaken the prestige and authority of the League, and, in consequence an examination of the whole League system becomes imperative. Honourable members will remember that on the 18th June, in declaring the Commonwealth policy in regard to the raising of sanctions, the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) also indicated the Government's views on the need for this examination. On the 4th July the League Assembly adopted a recommendation of the Council that the States Members of the League should put forward any proposals they might wish to make to improve the application of the principles of the Covenant. The Commonwealth Government immediately began a careful examination of various suggestions for a reform of the Covenant in the light of recent experience. The matter was considered one of such great importance as to demand the most careful study and consideration; moreover the Government felt that, in view of the widely conlutions flicting opinions about League reform whioh had been expressed, not only at Geneva, but also within the individual States themselves, the meeting of the League Assembly at Geneva in the last week of September would be the earliest desirable time for announcing its proposals. The High Commissioner, Mr Bruce, will accordingly state the views of the Commonwealth Government at today'a sitting of the Assembly. Of the numerous conflicting opinions on League reform which we have examined, I first mention the two extremes. On the one hand are the views of those who urge a tightening-up of the obligations under the coercive articles of the Covenant, particularly in respect of their automatic application, and including not only financial and economic sanctions, such as were applied against Italy, but also military sanctions. At the other extreme have are the opinions of those who would weaken the obligations by eliminating all coercive and repressive articles from the Covenant; in other words, those who would rely on the League as a conhave, sultative body and as a purely moral force. As the Minister for External Affairs (Senator Pearce) indicated in a recent statement, the Commonwealth Government has endeavoured to avoid both of these extremes, believing that the urging of either view might well bring about the end of the League. After careful consideration the Government has decided to make the following suggestions for League reform, through the delegation at the present meeting of the Assembly:The first proposal relates to Article XVI . , which deals with sanctions. That article provides that in the event of a resort to war in violation of previous Articles of the Covenant, States Members of the League are bound to apply immediately and automatically certain sanctions severing financial, economic and personal intercourse with the State which has been, declared to have broken the Covenant. The effect of the article was, however, subsequently modified in practice by theadoption hy the Assembly in October, 1921, of a long series of "" Resoconcerning the Economic Weapon."" These interpretative resolutions, as they become known, were to constitute rules for guidance, mainly procedural in character, as to how the obligations of States under Article XVI . were to be discharged. They were actually followed in the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. Article XVI . also provides for military sanctions which,, however, are permissive and not mandatory in character, as it is the duty of the Council only to recommend to States id embers what effective ar/ned forces shall be contributed to protect the Covenant. With regard to financial and economic sanctions, the Government feels that, upon a declaration by the Council that a Member State is an aggressor, the following sanctions should be automatic:(a) Prohibition of export of arms and munitions of war of all descriptions; (b) Prohibition of export of raw materials used for military operations and manufacture of war material including metals and oil; or alternatively to (a) and (o)Prohibition of all exports to the aggressor State; (c) Refusal of all loans and credits facilities; (d) Prohibition of all imports from the aggressor State. With the exception of the prohibition of oil exports, (a), (b), (c), and to a substantial extent (<£), were the main sanctions, which were applied in the recent Abyssinian dispute, and which, from the statistics collated by the Co-ordination Committee, had a constant and cumulative effect on Italian economic life. They were, however, not long enough in operation for their effect to be decisive. The Commonwealth Government feels that if a would be aggressor knows beforehand that in the event of aggression, he will automatically become subject to these financial and economic sanctions, such knowledge will constitute a powerful deterrent in the interests of peaceful settlement of the dispute. The Government fully realizes that in a democracy there will be objections by reason of the Government of the day having to carry out a national obligation if it has had no say in its acceptance. It therefore proposes to recommend the incorporation into the Covenant of No. 4 of the interpretative resolutions of 1921. The resolution is as follows:It is the duty of each to decide for itself whether a breach of the Covenant has been committed. The fulfilment of their duties under article 1(1 is required from Members of the League by the express terms of .the Covenant, and they cannot nesrlect them without breach of their Treaty obligations. Mr Mamies. Each Member State will be entirely free to determine whether, in its opinion, there has been a breach of the Covenant. At that point there is complete discretion, as there was in practice under the resolution of 1921; but once there has been a determination that a particular country is an aggressor, and that there has been a breach of the Covenant, the obligation, under Article XVI . will remain as it is today.",40
182,Mr BEASLEY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,Would a majority decision have the same effect on Member States ?,42
183,Mr MENZIES,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"I shall have something to say later about the point which the honourable member has raised. Each Member State must make up its own mind; but, if it decides that a certain country is the aggressor, then it cannot ignore .its obligations under Article XVI . without breaking the Covenant of the League, in which case the proper course, though I suggest not the satisfactory legal course, would be for it to leave the League. With regard to military sanctions, the Government feels that no amendment of the Covenant is necessary, as these are not automatic, but are subject to recommendation by the Council, and the adoption of any recommendation is left to the individual government's 'decision. The Commonwealth Government also believes that an effective contribution to the general principle of collective security contained in the League would be for States, in regions where their national interests are directly involved, to agree to some form of regional pact, subsidiary to the Covenant, by which they would be obliged to render military assistance, in circumstances laid down by the agreement, if one or more of them should be attacked by an aggressor.",42
184,Mr CURTIN,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Are we to understand that a regional pact, subsidiary to the Covenant, means that it must be entirely in keeping with the Covenant, or may it mean a distinct agreement, irrelevant to Member of the League the Covenant?",42
185,Mr MENZIES,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"It means that while the agreement itself may be distinct, imposing a very definite and special obligation on the signatories to it, it mu3t be consistent with the Covenant, and there must be some machinery to associate it with, the League. As the Leader of the Opposition probably knows, there are alternative suggestions, as to which we did not commit ourselves. One is that the agreements be required to be recorded with the League; the other is that they be required to be approved by the League. In any event, we are not suggesting the recognition of regional pacts if they are inconsistent with the general obligations to be imposed on all Member States by the Covenant itself.",42
186,Mr OUBTIK,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,May regional pacts be entered into by Member States with nonMember States?,43
187,Mr MENZIES,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"There is that possibility, to which I shall refer later. Article XVI . , it is believed, forms a reasonable basis for such agreements, which would be devised to strengthen general security, and would also be strictly within the framework of the League, and subject to the spirit and provisions of the Covenant. It cannot be emphasized too strongly that such agreements must be supplementary to, and not in substitution for, any of the vital provisions of the Covenant. Furthermore, the Government's view is that, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, the Pacific is the area in which we are most vitally interested in the maintenance of peace. With the United States of America and Japan outside the League, provision for a regional agreement of the particular kind mentioned could hardly be applicable, but the promotion of a regional understanding and pact of non-aggre3sion for Pacific countries, in the spirit of the League undertakings, should not be beyond the bounds of possibility. The second Commonwealth proposal is with regard to Article XI . , which declares that any war or threat of war between Members or non-Members is a matter of concern to the whole League, and lays down that "" the League shall take any action that may be deemed wise and effeotual to safeguard the peace of nations"". As it stands at present, Article XI . is subject to the unanimity rule, and mediatory action by the cil can be blocked by the votes of States which are parties to the dispute, or the vote of a State contemplating sion. The Government feels that the Council should be enabled to make recommendations under Article XI . without the consent of the States who are parties to the dispute; this will involve consequential amendment of Article V., which deals with questions of procedure. The third proposal is with regard to Article XIX . , which provides that the Assembly may, from time to time, advise the reconsideration by Members of the League of treaties which have become inapplicable, and the consideration of international conditions whose continuance might endanger the peace of the world. The Commonwealth Government's view is that in a world with rapidly-changing conditions this article is too uncertain. It believes that Article XIX . should be regarded as a specific article for the remedying of grievances, and that provision should be made for periodical investigation of, and report on, alleged grievances. That, as honourable members will see, has particular relevance to such matters as have been put forward from time to time by the Government of Germanysuggestions that there are injustices in existing treaties and obligations. In order to meet such contingencies, Australia has suggested that there should be, in the machinery of the League, provision for periodic investigation of these matters, so as to avoid a state of affairs in which some nations may indefinitely postpone investigation, and so indefinitely aggravate the grievances. Fourthly, the Commonwealth Government feels that support should be given to a proposal for the severance of the Covenant from the Peace Treaty of 1919. If the League is to become universal, and to act as an instrument for the preservation of peace, rather than be linked to a period of past history which directly concerned only a certain number of Member States, then the Covenant should be divorced from the Treaty of Versailles. Finally, the Government is of opinion that before proceeding to deal at all Counwith amendments to the Covenant, the League should consider inviting non-Memby ber States to confer with it or any comaggresmission which it might set up to consider the proposed reform, as to the nature and form of desirable amendments. The Government feels that the non-Member States, and in particular the United States of America, Germany, and Japan, should be fully consulted, with a view to having their representatives present to discuss the proposals with Members of the League. Such a course, it is felt, would give to non-Member States a full opportunity to state their views as to what ultimate form of Covenant would be acceptable. If unanimity on the proposal to hold such a consultation can be secured, we believe that there will be a reasonable chance of obtaining a Covenant of a kind which would bring about universal membership, without which the League cannot fulfil the functions which its framers originally contemplated, and which are so essential to the peace and security of a troubled world.",43
188,Mr CURTIN,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Fremantle) [8.49] - by leave-The statement which the Attorney General (Mr Menzies) has just read to the House will be acknowledged by all honourable members to be of outstanding importance. It indicates the general port of the instructions given to the High Commissioner, Mr S. M . Bruce, who is Australia's delegate at the Assembly of the League of Nations, which is meeting at Geneva today. Mr Bruce will indicate ,to the representatives of the Member States of the League what are the views of the Commonwealth Government. How far those views may be the views of this Parliament can, at this stage, be no more than a matter of conjecture. The proposals which have been given to Mr. Bruce to put forward are in themselves controversial, and their practicability to safeguard Australia effectively is dependent upon considerations which are mentioned in the final passages of the Attorney-General's statement. It would have been reasonable for the Government to have first permitted Parliament to express its mind upon the general character of the instructions to be given to Mr Bruce, for, although the Government is regarded as the proper instrument for the expression of Australian opinion in respect of the work of the League, nonetheless this Parliament has an even greater responsibility for the peace of Australia than has any government, and the rights of Parliament in this connection ought to be safeguarded. I believe that it would have been proper for the honourable gentleman to have, in some way, made it possible for .Parliament to discuss the statement of policy which he has just presented to this House. Alternative proposals are contained in that statement, a copy of which was given to me no sooner than the Attorney-General rose to make it, so that I have had no opportunity to consider it with any degree of comprehension. I ask the Attorney-General if he will not, before it is too late, allow the important proposals which are being submitted on behalf of the Commonwealth for the reformation of the League of Nations, to be the subject of debate and decision by this Parliament. The Government may command majorities in regard to cement duties and a variety of other items of less importance; it maj also be able to secure complete support from its own supporters in respect of this particular programme; but I believe that the peace of the world and Australia's pursecurity are matters which might be considered by this Parliament entirely in a constructive way, and that honourable gentlemen on both sides of the House might be able to assist the Government more adequately to interpret the hopes and opinions of the Australian people.",44

He stated that he would carefully examine the reprethat sentations of these bodies for exemption of the goods required by them; but, during unfortunately, his decision was adverse. At the present time a harbour board, which is controlled by the Government, such as the Brisbane Harbour Board, exempted from the obligation to pay sales wealth revenues. tax on materials for its own use because it is a government body; but the hampton Harbour Board, or any other which is controlled by a locally1936. elected body, is not granted that concession.

196,Mr HOLLOWAY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Melbourne Ports) [9.0] - Tb e Government has largely met the troubles of municipalities in certain directions. I do not, however, believe we have yet considered full y what we owe to those bodies for what they did the period of the depression. It is not sound or scientific government to i m pose taxation upon municipalities which are largely employing labour with money is that has been provided out of CommonThe fact that this assistance is given goes to prove that the Rockmunicipalities are carrying on work which is helpful to the governments of the Commonwealth and States. In examining the situation we must realise that, whether we like it or not, private enterprise cannot and never will he able to employ anything like the whole of the labour which from time to time is available in any highly developed community. Whether the period be one of depression or of boom, there will always be a surplus of labour which will have to be employed on what is now known as "" mado "" works. The municipalities are becoming more largely employers of labour as one year succeeds another, and are being so used by the governments of the Commonwealth and the States because those authorities cannot themselves employ the labour. When that occurs, a field is provided for the collecsider tion by those governments of additional revenues by means of taxation. In every big municipality the Commonwealth Government has all kinds of works and activities, yet it pays no rates aud taxes with respect to them; it is regarded as a dead-head. The electorate which I represent has in it many large drill halls, a rifle range, and extensive postal workshops, none of which pays rates to a municipality. That is quite all but the principle should operate also in the other direction. During the last five or six years the municipalities have not only conducted their ordinary operations, but have also employed much more labour than they would normally employ, because they were able to provide the only avenues in which the unemployed could be absorbed. Surely it is not either sound or scientific to tax what the municipalities require in order to carry out works practically at the dictation of the Commonwealth Government, or in conjunction with the Commonwealth and the States, in order to enlarge the spending power of the nation and thus lead to the raising of greater revenues! ' The situation ought to be reviewed, and sales tax as well as every other form of tax should be removed from municipal bodies which, by carrying on public works, help the government of the country to absorb the unemployed. The Treasurer should be asked to ascertain the number of items required by municipalities from which the sales tax has not yet been removed. The Commonwealth Government has advanced millions of pounds Mr HoUoway. to the governments of the States for the relief of unemployment, and those authorities, not having had the necessary avenues for the employment of the labour offering, have made"" loans on a £1 for £1 basis to the municipalities for the purpose. Only a few months ago the Commonwealth,, recognizing the difficulties of the municipalities and desiring that they should continue to employ surplus labour, passed legislation for the making of advances free of interest, with repayment over a period of ten years, not because of sympathy for the municipalities or out of largeness of heart, but because the municipalities are serving a purpose which the Commonwealth cannot itself perform. I urge honourable members to conseriously the acceptance of the amendment which would remove sales tax from all tools and other plant used by municipal councils.",45
197,Mr JOHN LAWSON,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Macquarie) [9.7] - I move That the proposed amendment be amended by omitting the words "", or by public authorities "". I do this, not because I am opposed in principle to the exemption from right:"" sales tax of apparatus or implements used by the publio bodies which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) has sought to benefit, but because I can see quite clearly that his amendment will not be carried and this is the only opportunity which I shall have to substitute for it the amendment that I originally proposed to move. I also hope to secure the support of some honourable members who, while fervently advocating the exemption from sales tax of .the machinery and implements in question, would hesitate to involve the Government in revenue loss in the vicinity of £100,000. I hold the view that too many members who have spoken from the Government benches this afternoon and evening have been inclined to regard the Commonwealth Treasurer as a Santa Claus, for whose favours we ought to feel devoutly and profoundly grateful, entirely regardless of whether they are adequate to the people's needs, or of the extent to which they might even be tinged with parsimony. Eather should we regard the honourable gentleman as a - Minister of the Crown who is charged with the very great responsibility of straining every nerve to lighten, as far as possible, the onerous burden of taxation that is carried today by probably the most heavily taxed people in the world. The honourable member for Wontworth (Mr. E. J'. Harrison) suggested to the present Treasurer (Mr Casey) and the members of this committee that they should play for safety- a wholly unnecessary piece of advice. If any man has ever played for safety, the Treasurer has done so in this year'3 budget. To those who have expressed a fear of upsetting the calculations of the Treasurer, and the national finances, by causing the revenue to be depleted to an amount of £100,000, I suggest a scrutiny of the record of this Government and the budget predictions of both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer during the last four or five years. They should ask themselves whether, in any one of those years, the Government would have failed to more than offset an additional remission of tax of approximately £100,000. Yet the amendment that I have moved would reduce the probable loss of revenue by something in. the region of 50 per cent., and, so far as I can gather, the loss under it would aggregate approximately £50,000 instead of £100,000.",46
198,Mr FORDE,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"What does the amendment of the honourable member exclude? Mr JOHN"" LAWSON"" - I aim at excluding harbour boards, harbour trusts, metropolitan water and sewerage boards, fire brigades, and bodies of that character, thus confining the exemptions to municipal and shire councils.",47
199,Mr FORDE,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,But many harbour boards are also in a very bad way financially.,47
200,Mr JOHN LAWSON,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"I admit that they are, but not in as bad a way as are the vast majority of municipal and shire councils, particularly those which are functioning in rural areas. I make the further point, .which has not so far been mentioned, that probably the most striking anomaly in the incidence of the sales tax is to be found in the fact that, whereas it does not apply to maohinery and implements used by bodies such as the Main Roads Board of New South Wales, which operates exclusively on main roads, it does apply to machinery and implements used by shires and municipal corporations which operate only on subsidiary roads. I ask the committee to consider that aspect of the case. Is it not a very grave anomaly that machinery, imple# ments and tools used by a financially strong body such as the Main Roads Board should be free from sales tax while municipal and shire councils, which are not nearly so strong financially and operate on subsidiary roads, have to pay the tax? No more grossly unfair treatment has ever resulted from the imposition of a tax. If the municipalities and shire councils were strong financially, and better able to bear the tax than is the Main Roads Board, the attitude of the Government might be defended; but, for a number of years they have had great difficulty in obtaining from farmers and others who themselves have been in financial straits, the wherewithal to maintain great lengths of subsidiary roads. Seeing that there is no chance of the amendment of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition being agreed to, I suggest that he accept the amendment which I have foreshadowed.",47
201,Mr FORDE,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Capricornia) [9.16] - I should like the Treasurer (Mr Casey) to correct me if I am wrong in applying to my amendment an argument that he advanced in connection with a previous amendment, when he saidThe Government is of the opinion that the term "" local governing body"" Bhould have a considerably wider application than the honourable member intends. In the mind of the Government it includes local governing bodies of all kinds, whether they be harbour boards, county councils, district councils or similar bodies, and of these there are in Australia no fewer than 2,000. To extend the exemption set forth in the honourable member's amendment to all these local bodies, would cost the 'treasury about £100,000, but if the definition were restricted to the narrow application intended by the honourable member, the cost we'uld be only about £4,000 or £5,000. in view of that statement, I take it that the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr John Lawson) would exempt articles purchased by harbour boards.",47
202,Mr CASEY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,I am not aware of the full scope of the proposed amendment.,47
203,Mr FORDE,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"The honourable member for Macquarie proposes to exclude all the words af ter "" other than local governing bodies"".",47
204,Mr CABBY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Tk e term "" public authority"" has a wider significance.",48
205,Mr FORDE,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"I am desirous that the requirements of not only»the bodies provide posed by the honourable member for Macployed quarie, but also harbour boards and local bodies trusts shall be exempt from sales tax. assure the honourable gentleman that in the outlying ports of Australia, where there is not an immense amount of shipbodies ping, the harbour boards and trusts are experiencing difficulties, and are overof whelmed with debts. Many of them find it almost impossible to meet their interest payments. These bodies carry out such works as the building of retaining to walls, as in the Rockhampton district, and the development of harbours, as at Gladstone. For the carrying out of these undertakings they have expensive plant and machinery. Many such authorities in Queensland survive only because of the generosity of the State government, which, in turn, great difficulty in obtaining money from Macquarie. the Commonwealth Government for these works. It is anomalous that the Commonwealth Government should tax these semi-governmental bodies. All the arguwhen ments advanced so ably by the honourable member fOT Macquarie in relation to municipal corporations, apply with equal, or even greater, force to harbour boards and trusts. Whilst I am not personally acquainted with the financial position of harbour boards outside Queensland, I know that many of them in central and northern Queensland find it difficult pay their way. I should like the amendI ment to be carried in the form in which I moved it . The honourable member for Macquarie says that acceptance of proposed amendment would affect the estimated revenue by abotit £50,000 instead of £100,000. Yet in the course cf his remarks he said that the Treaschances urer's estimates were on a conservathe tive basis. It is, therefore, reasonable a'ssume that, at the end of the present financial year, the revenue will have exoperation ceeded the Treasurer's estimate by more than £100,000. With a revenue of £81,000,000 for the year, the Treasurer need not be afraid to grant relief amountrevenue ing to £100,000 to deserving local bodies, including harbour boards and trusts. agree with the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway) that these local bodies are doing valuab.e work for the country. The Commonwealth Government would find it difficult to prorelief for the large army of.unemwere it not for the assistance of throughout Australia. I Moreover, the public-spirited men who carry out these undertakings receive no remuneration for their services. These resent the taxing of the equipment necessary to carry out public undertakings great value to the community. I cannot agree to exclude harbour boards and trusts from my amendment, and would like the honourable member for Macquarie support it in the form in which it was moved.

The budget is far from being a conservative one. I hope that the will improve, and that the Government will have a surplus at the end I of the year, but I am not at all certain about it. A surplus this year would make the position a good deal more certain for the following year than it now appears to be.",48
208,Mr FROST,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Franklin) [9.26] - I support the amendment of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde), because I believe that as far as possible the Government should relieve local govern'ng bodies from the payment of taxes. The sales tax was first imposed as an emergency measure when the country was in sore financial straits. All parties were agreed that it should be one of the first taxes to be removed when conditions improved. The local bodies throughout Australia were of great assistance to the Go- Fisken, A . C. W. vernment during the depression years, and now that the Commonwealth finances are buoyant, the Government should grant them some relief. As has already been stated, the members of these public bodies whose work is of great value give their services free. The Commonwealth Government does not pay rates or taxes on land held by it within municipalities and shire councils notwithstanding that frequently these bodies are involved in great expense in providing roads to serve Government properties. I have in mind a municipality which made about two miles of road to serve a government institution within its borders which pays no rates. The upkeep of that road is a continual source of expense to the ratepayers. The request of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition should be conceded by the Government. If the Treasurer has made up his mind not to grant further exemptions, then ne'ther the amendment now before the committee nor that foreshadowed by the honourable member for M-acquarie is likely to be acceptable. The shire councils have rendered great service to this country, particularly in providing work for the unemployed, and the Government should do all it can to assist them. - Question-That the words proposed to other local governing bodies. be omitted (Mr JOHN LAWSON'S amendamount ment) stand part of the proposed amendment)-put .

213,Mr GARDEN,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Cook) move That the following item be added:131-Perambulators-Nos . 1 to 9. When the sales tax was under consideration last year I raised the question of the desirability of excluding perambulators from the incidence of the tax. The Treasurer (Mr Casey) then said he would give consideration to my request, but nothing has since been heard of it . I regret to find that they are not included in the new list of exemptions. In Australia, there are thirteen factories engaged in the manufacture of perambulators, employing 140 hands and distributing in wages £18,929 annually. These factories supply the whole of the Australian requirements. Perambulators are very necessary articles, which are purchased mainly by working-class people. The amount of capital invested in land, buildings,, plant and machinery in their manufacture is estimated at £47,193. In its report on this industry, the T a r if f Board stated that it had, in common with other industries in Australia, been adversely affected by the restricted spending power of the people. The official statistics show vats that the declined value of the output of Australian manufacturers of perambulators was as follows:£ 1930-31 . . .. 100.000 193132 . . 70,000 1932-33 . . 74,000 It will thus be seen that there was a steady decline of value due, in my opinion, to the reduced purchasing power of the working-class people, who are the main purchasers of perambulators. I feel sure that the Minister for Health (Mr Hughes) would support my request for the removal of the tax on perambulators, because the right honourable gentleman has been advocating all over the Commonwealth the need for an in creased population. The whole of the material used in the construction of perambulators is of Australian origin, so that a considerable amount of indirect employment is provided by this small industry. The loss of revenue involved in the exemption of perambulators would be very small; and although the Treasurer has already said that there is no possi- » bilit y of further concessions being given, [9.51] - I I appeal to hi m ' to give favourable consideration to this request, because of the small amount involved. If it is not possible for the Government to accept amendments, of what use is it for the committee to continue discussing this bill.",51
214,Mr MCCAT,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,L - What amount of revenue would be involved.,51
215,Mr GARDEN,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Not more than £400. Surely that small sum would not affect budget equilibrium. The manufacturers of perambulators are unable to pass on the tax because most of the purchases are made on the time-payment system. Owing to the decreased purchasing power of the people, the value of output of the factories has been reduced from £100,000 to £'74,000. Notwithstanding that reduction, heavy overhead charges have to be met. I trust that the Treasurer will comply with the reasonable request I have made.",51
216,Mr CASEY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Corio - Treasurer) [10.1] - About a year ago the honourable member for Cook (Mr Garden) made similar representations cerning the tax imposed on perambulators and similar vehicles. Briefly speaking, perambulators, basinettes, high and low chairs-, push carts, go-carts and wicker carts are included in the same category. The factories producing these goods also manufacture invalids' chairs. The total production in Australia is valued at £80,000. E understand that perambulators valued at £50,000 are manufactured in the electorate of the honourable member for Cook.",52
217,Mr MCCALL,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,What would the remission of the tax on perambulators amount to?,52
218,Mr CASEY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"It might amount to £2,000 or £3,000 a year. The cheapest type of push carts are those with a single handle similar to that of a lawnmower. These are sold at about 30s. each, but other varieties cost much more. If the cheaper vehicles were exempt, the more expensive ones would also exempt. Usually a good perambulator serves all the children of a family, and, consequently, the outlay is not heavy. I do not think that the honourable member for Cook will contend that the purchase of a perambulator imposes a very heavy burden on the average breadwinner. Consideration has been extended to men on the basic wage by removing the tax on footwear, tea, and other articles used extensively by every family. The small amount that would be saved by remitting the tax on perambulators would not be of great benefit. Amendment negatived.",52
219,Mr MAKIN,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Hindmarsh) [10.4] - I move That the following item be added:No. 131. Photographs - Nos . 1 to 9. Two years ago I brought under the notice of the Treasurer (Mr Casey) the claims of photographers for exemption from claims sales tax. On that occasion I directed his attention to the anomalous position which exists owing to the tax being imposed on ordinary photographs, whilst those produced by newspaper proprietors for publication are exempt. If photographers are compelled to pay the tax why should newspaper proprietors be exempt? The newspapers' organizations have established their own studios, and, con- in addition to using the prints produced, enter into serious competition with photographers who have to depend on their product for a livelihood. In Canada and New Zealand, the exemption applies to all photographs, and as our sales tax legislation is based upon the Canadian Act, a similar exemption should apply here. Some may say that photographs are luxuries, and should be taxable, but the products of florists are exempt, and photographs should be treated similarly. The Treasurer cannot justify the discriminatory action of the Government in this respect. Two years ago, the Minister said that he would give the matter his earnest attention, and I trust that he will now accept the amendment I have moved.",52
220,Mr JENNINGS,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Watson) [10.9] There is no need to traverse the arguments adduced from time to time in support of the exemption of photographs from sales tax. All photographs are not be luxuries, because passpoTt pictures and wedding, family and sporting groups are records, and therefore essential, while personal photographs are in many instances a business necessity. It is correct that in Canada and New Zealand photographic material is exempt from sales tax. In view of the anomaly which exists, I trust that the Treasurer (Mr. Casey) will agree to include photographs in the next list of exemptions.",52
221,Mr CASEY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Corio - Treasurer) [10.10] - As the honourable members for H'ndmarsh (Mr Makin) and Watson (Mr Jennings) have remarked, this matter has been discussed in this House over the last two years at least. I point out that when exemptions from sales tax are being considered by the Government in conjunction with the framing of the budget, every item for which exemption is claimed has to compete with many ot.bers. The Government considers the in respect of all of the items, and places the items most deserving of attention in order of merit. Then the amount to be remitted by way of relief from sales tax is decided upon, and provision is made to exempt items as they appear in the order of merit which I have indicated. Photographs have not yet managed by that process to come within the list of exemptions. I maintain, however, that photographers are not treated harshly under this tax, because they are charged sales tax on only 40 per cent, of the sale value of their goods, the tax being equivalent to 4d. for every £1 worth of photo- - Nos . 1 to 9. graphs sold.",52
222,Mr MAKIN,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,The Treasurer advanced that argument two years ago. How is it that photographs produced by newspaper companies have been exempted ?,53
223,Mr CASEY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Photograph s sold by newspaper companies in competition with ordinary photographs are taxable. There are three principal classes of persons taxable under this heading: first, the professional portrait photographer, who takes photographs to special order; secondly, persons, usually chemists, who develop and print photographs taken by amateurs; and, thirdly, commercial photographers. All three are obl ged to pay sales tax. To exempt this item would mean a loss of between £12,000 and £18,000 annually to revenue. All I can say at the moment is that the Government has been more impressed with the claims for exemption of other items in preference to those for the exemption of photographs.

225,Mr CASEY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,Grader s for the grading of apples have been exempt for some time.,53
226,Mr FROST,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,I understood that such graders were still subject to sales tax?,53
227,Mr CASEY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,They have been exempt for some time. Graders mentioned in this instance are those used for the grading of dried fruits.,53
228,Mr FROST,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,That is the point I wished to have clarified. [22],53
229,Mr FORDE,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Capricornia) [10.15] I moveTliat the following item be added:131 - Machinery , implements and apparatus for use in the repair or maintenance of goods covered by item 14 in this schedule-Nos . 1 to 9. Item 14, which deals with mining machinery and equipment, readsMachinery, implements and apparatus (aud parts there for), for use in the milling industry in carrying out mining operations ana in the treatment of the products of those operations At present division 2 of the schedule to the Sales Tax Exemptions Act 1935, exempts a number of items of mining machinery and equipment; but it will be observed that the exemptions are so worded as to'exclude all equipment and supplies for mining companies' workshops. It is essential that mining operations under modern conditions must be constantly maintained, not only in order to avoid excessive costs of production, but also to provide constant employment for all those who depend upon the mine. It is necessary, therefore, that the mines should have directly under their control and devoted entirely to their own purposes workshops in which machinery or : equipment can be repaired at the shortest possible notice, and, if possible, without a stoppage of operations. Moreover, mining operations are very, often carried on in places remote from industrial and engineering centres. For these reasons it is essential for mining companies to equip their own workshops on the mines. All the machinery used in such workshops is as much used in the mining industry as is the equipment used underground. A distinction cannot naturally be drawn between actual mining and treatment operations and the maintenance of machinery and equipment used in such operations; such a distinction bears heavily upon the mines not only by reason of the taxation involved, but also in respect of the cost of accountancy work which is necessary for the proper observance of the Sales Tax Acts. The line of distinction between mining and workshop operations is not always easy to demonstrate with satisfaction to the Commissioner of Taxation, and, in the past, mining companies have been put to much expense in maintaining what they consider are their rights under this legislation. In addition to the amount of tax involved, the cost of keeping records and furnishing accurate returns to the department, as well as the cost to the department of checking and investigating these returns, have to be considered. I believe that the distinction between mining and treatment operations and the operations of workshops on the mines serves no useful purpose, and, as it is obviously the intention of the Government to relieve the mining industry from as much taxation as possible, I hope that all equipment used in workshops situated on mining properties and used solely for the purpose of' maintaining and repairing the equipment used in actual mining and treatment operations, will be exempted from sales tax, a3 I now propose. It is unnecessary to elaborate upon the importance of mining activity of all kinds from the point of view of creating employment. A number of the mines operated today are being worked under great difficulty; from time to time many have been closed down because it has not paid to operate them. The articles covered in item 34 are used not only in gold-mining, but also in mining for copper, silver, lead, and coal. Any action which the Treasurer can take to relieve the burden of taxation on these enterprises, which are important agencies of employment, should be taken. Perhaps ""he may be able to refer to certain mines which today are making a profit; but I suggest that, in the majority of cases, such prosperity is only of a temporary nature. A mine is a wasting asset. We know that a very sad story can be told in respect of the coal mining industry in New South Wales and Queensland; in fact, owing to the loss of export trade, quite a number of mines> in New South Wales have been closed down. It has been possible to open some of these, but every assistance which governments can possibly give will be necessary to enable them to continue operating. Any relief that can be given to these great enterprises tends to create further employment. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) has received teleand grams urging him to press for this concession, and representations have also J/r. Forde. been made to me from Queensland in the same vein. This is a reasonable request, and I urge the. Treasurer to give it favourable consideration.",53
230,Mr A GREEN,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Kalgoorlie) [10.21]. - The proposal of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Eorde) is in line with representations which I made in this chamber last week. Since then I have received communications from various mining organizations, including the Chamber of Mines in Kalgoorlie, asking me to press for this concession. There is a general feeling among mining men that the Government should give way on this point.",54
231,Mr CASEY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Corio-Treasurer ) [10.22] - The case put by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Eorde), and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A. Green) is well known to me. The facts are that practically all the essential items, such as machinery, implements, apparatus and parts thereof used in the carrying out of mining operations, and in the treating of the product of mining operations, are entirely free of sales tax. This leaves a very narrow range of machinery subject to the tax, including such machines as are used in tool shops, &c. The argument of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition might be sound if it were admitted that the mining industry had a valid claim to complete exemption from sales tax in respect of all its operations wheresoever conducted, but that is not so. In my opinion, the Government has done a fair thing by the mining industry. If workshop tools, drill sharpening tools, &c, were exempt, it would be a conditional exemption of a pronounced type, and one extremely difficult to administer. Also, it would attract similar claims in respect of every machine shop in secondary industries throughout the country. Actually, workshop machinery used strictly in conre- nexion with mining pays tax of from only £5,000 to £10,000 a year. I am not impressed by the argument that accountancy difficulties arise in keeping traok of tax payments in connection with mining machinery, because tax is payable only when new machinery is purchased, that is not done every day. I promise honourable members that this matter will be looked into by the Government when future adjustments are being made, but I ask that the request be not pressed at this time.

Motion (by Dr EARLE PAGE) proposed - That the House do now adjourn. PROWSE.) Mr Holloway (Melbourne Ports) 21 [10.32] - For a considerable period there 33 has been a good deal of unrest among the men employed on the waterfront in 12 the various States, and in Melbourne, particularly, the trouble has again become Ancs. acute. An understanding was reached some years ago that no new labour would be introduced for the work required by ship-owners on the waterfront until the men who had been doing the work in the past had been absorbed and granted firstpreference licences, but this arrangement uas not been taithtully observed. In fact, for years past the ship-owners have been recruiting fresh labour. One picking- >«'0BS. up place was agreed to, and there appeared to be a prospect of the conflicting parties working in harmony. If the committee appointed by the Government had kept its promise, and had not introduced fresh labour when many members of the two original groups of men were out of work, the harmonious relations which had been developing would not have been disturbed; but neither the members of the Waterside Workers Federation, nor the original volnnteers are given the whole of the first preference, as members of the new group are often engaged. 'Recently there was PAIRS. a rush of shipping work, and, as there was insufficient labour available at the Archdale moment owing to the fact that the men had not congregated in one place, outside labour was engaged, and these men now constitute a third group. The Melbourne branch of the Waterside Workers Federation then agreed to the request of the committee which allocates the work to open its door3 to a niunber of younger men, the complaint having been made that the members were getting old, and that there was a scarcity of labour to do to have certain work, such as that required in of cold chambers, & c , work which should and could be clone by younger men. I believe that if the Attorney-General (Mr . Menzies) investigated the matter he would be able to overcome the friction that has arisen. The Melbourne branch of the federation was promised that, if it opened its doors to a number of younger men, its members would be granted firstpreference licences, but the licences are to be given for only six months at a time. 'The members of the union feel that they have been unjustly treated, in that, after paying their union fees, they are now to receive only temporary licences. cannot understand this change of attitude on the part of the picking-up authorities.",54
232,Mr MENZIES,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,Eo r what period is a temporary licence given?,56
233,Mr HOLLOWAY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"F o r seven months, at the most. If a member of the union misbehaves himself in the slightest degree, his licence is taken from him.",56
234,Mr BEENNAN,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,The discipline is very severe.,56
235,Mr HOLLOWAY,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Yes , and therefore there is no reason why first-preference licences could not be granted permanently. I should like the Attorney General to inquire into the matter, and ascertain the reason for the change of policy. For three or four months in the year, on the average, several hundred trained men find themselves out of employment. I trust that the Minister will endeavour to arrange that the members of the union shall receive first preference for the future, and that their licences shall not be merely temporary.",56
236,Mr MAKIN,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"Hindmarsh) [10.40] I also direct the attention of the Attorney-General (Mr Menzies) to the position of the seamen at Port Adelaide. Honourable members will recall that I mentioned this matter in the House on Thursday last, intimating that there was considerable dissatisfaction among the seamen at that port, because of the unwillingness of the licensing committee to facilitate the transfer of men holding second preference licences to the rank3 of holders of first preferences.",56
237,Mr MENZIES,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"I was in Adelaide last week, and so was out of touch with the proceedings at Canberra.",56
238,Mr MAKIN,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,"I hope, now that the honourable gentleman has returned, he will give his earnest attention to the matter, and see that the licensing system is so administered as to ensure justice to the seamen concerned.",56
239,Mr MENZIES,SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS BIL L,I shall give the matters mentioned by the honourable member for Port Melbourne (Mr Holloway) and the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr M a k in ) my attention. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.42 p.m. I ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS. The following answers to questions were circulated:NA STAFFS.,56
240,Mr SPEAKER,APPOINTMENTS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"On the 24th September, the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) asked the following questions, without notice:1. Has a competitive examination ever been held for any position on the staff of Parliament House? If sO, what were the occasions? 2. If there is no competitive examination, will he supply the reasons why such a method of filling staff vacancies is not adopted? 3. Will he supply the names of the persons appointed, and the nature of the positions to which appointments have been made since the 1st January, 1931? I am now in a position to furnish the honourable member with the following replies:1. No. 2. On account of the smallness of the parliamentary staff and consequent infrequency of vacancies, it is not considered practicable to hold separate examinations, but the position is met either by the transfer of officers from other departments or by the. appointment of persons who have passed the examinations held by the Public Service Board. In a few instances, certain officers have been appointed who had passed an examination of a nature satisfactory to the parliamentary head. Reporters appointed to the Parliamentary Reporting Staff are drawn from the ranks of journalists or from members of State Hansard ^taffs, it being considered of vital importance that appointees should be possessed of experience of reporting in parliamentary galleries. For certain positions in the Library, a university degree is considered desirable, and appointees are, therefore, selected from university graduates or those who have matriculated and are proceeding to a degree. Appointments to the non-clerical staff are made without examination. Preference is given to returned soldiers wherever possible. 3. SenateT. Williams-Junio r Attendant. House of RepresentativesW. C.

Did the Commonwealth Government's representative vote for this Convention?",57
250,Mr LYONS,APPOINTMENTS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows :-1. I would refer the honourable member to answer I gave in Parliament on the 10th September to this question, when I stated that the Commonwealth Government had already decided that it would leave the final decision of this matter to the tribunals properly constituted to deal with it . 2. Yes, subjectto the undermentioned views of the Commonwealth Government, which were indicated by the Government delegate at the Conference:The Government delegate was authorized to vote in favour of the 40-hour Conventions, provided he set out the following views of the Commonwealth Government:(a) The proposal for 40 hours is made aa a remedy for unemployment. (6) In Australia large numbers of employees are already working -10 hours or less, and separate action in Australia by way of adopting 40 hours as a general standard would not assist towards any remedy for unemployment. (e) It is not practicable to adopt 40 hours as the standard in Australia unless the leading nations of the world whose products are competitive wit h those of Australia take similar action. (<f) If those nations agree to adopt a uniform and reduced standard of hours, Australia w i ll join in international agreement and action for that purpose. (e) The proposal for reduced hours does not make any contribution to the solution of the problem of the differences between industrial workers and those engaged in country industries. Considerations of justice require that the proposal should be associated with measures to improve the position of rural producers and workers generally. The Commonwealth Parliament can legislate as to the working hours in the Commonwealth Public Service, and the Commonwealth Arbitration Court (but not the Commonwealth Parliament) can deal with the question of working hours when it is raised .in an indust r i a l dispute. The State Parliaments, however, can legislate upon this matter.",57

252,Mr CASEY,APPOINTMENTS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. 'The information - asked for is not available. The statement made by me in the budget speech is based on conclusions reached after close discussion of the matter with the Commonwealth Statistician and with the Commonwealth Bank. 2. The Bank Board's report statedLondon funds at present are sufficient for normal requirements, but are not sufficiently high to provide an adequate reserve against adverse circumstances. We should aim at a favourable balance of oversea payments for a number of years with a view to building up our London funds and maintaining them at a higher level. I am in general agreement with these views.. 3. Comparable figures to those published for 1934 are not yet available for 1936. 4. In round figures, the outflow and inflow of tourist money for 1936-37 may be estimated at £4,500.000 to £ii.000,000 for outflow and £1,500,000 to £1,750,000 for inflow. 6. f t is anticipated that the value of exports w i ll exceed the value of imports by an amount more than sufficient to cover all oversea payments.
