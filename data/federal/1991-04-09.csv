2,Mr HAWKE,DEATH OF THE RIGHT,"I move: That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on 24 March 1991 of the Right Honourable Sir John Robert Kerr, AK, GCMG, GCVO, QC, a former Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia from 1974 to 1977 and Chief Justice of New South Wales from 1972 to 1974, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. John Robert Kerr was born on 24 September 1914 at Balmain, New South Wales and was educated at Fort Street High School. He studied law at Sydney University and had a brilliant academic record. He was admitted to the New South Wales Bar in 1938, but temporarily suspended his legal career in 1942 when he joined the Army. Until 1945 he was involved in intelligence work with the wartime Directorate of Research and Civil Affairs. Nineteen forty-six saw John Kerr appointed first Principal of the Australian School of Pacific Administration, then Organising Secretary of the South Pacific Commission. He resumed his legal career in Sydney in 1948, specialising in industrial law. I had the opportunity on some occasions of having Sir John as an opponent at the bar table. His career continued to prosper and he took silk in 1953. During the sixties he held several public offices, including President of the New South Wales Bar Association, President of the Law Council of Australia and President of the Law Association for Asia and the Western Pacific. He transferred to Canberra in 1966, and until 1972 was a judge in the Commonwealth Industrial Court and the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. He was also a judge in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory from 1970 to 1972. His distinguished tenure as Chief Justice of New South Wales from 1972 to 1974 included a review and update of the New South Wales court structure. In 1973 he was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of New South Wales, and on 27 February 1974 he was appointed Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia. Sir John Kerr was an active and energetic Governor General who took a genuine interest in people from all walks of life. He travelled widely throughout the country and promoted vigorously Australia's interests abroad. As I have said previously, his dismissal of the Whitlam Government in 1975 will remain a matter of debate in this country for as long as politics is discussed. Sir John was a very prominent Australian, whose interests were diverse and varied. Outside the legal profession, he was involved with organisations dealing with subjects such as copyright, medicine and the armed services. He also took a personal interest in, and had a strong concern for, Aboriginal issues. Throughout his public life, Sir John maintained an active interest and involvement in the Asia-Pacific region, especially in Papua New Guinea. He made a positive contribution towards enhancing Australia's role in the region and will certainly be missed by his many friends in the region. Sir John received numerous overseas distinctions, including honorary life membership of the Law Society of England and Wales and honorary membership of the American Bar Association. The high regard in which he was held was also reflected in the many honours bestowed upon him throughout his long career in public service. He was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1966, a Knight Commander of that Order in 1974 and a Knight Grand Cross in 1976. He was also made a Knight of the Order of Australia in 1976. Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Government, I extend our sincere sympathy to his wife, Anne, and to his family in their bereavement.",12
3,Dr HEWSON,DEATH OF THE RIGHT,"The death of the Right Honourable Sir John Kerr on 24 March marked the passing of a great Australian. His greatness will be measured not by the verdicts of his contemporaries nor by our words here today but by history's judgment of the breadth of his achievements and on his quiet but unmistakable moral courage. That is exactly the way Sir John would have wanted it. At his memorial service last Saturday, one of his sons, Philip, recalled his deep love of history. It is appropriate, therefore, that history will be the judge and will, I believe, judge him favourably. Mr Speaker, I do not intend to record the detail of Sir John Kerr's many achievements in his academic, professional and public life. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has already cited many of them and others will undoubtedly recall even more. My purpose today is a quite different one. I want to set out briefly what seemed to me to be the attributes that made Sir John Kerr a great Australian and that explain why he was held in such great affection by those who knew him well. There is no such thing as an ordinary Governor General. But of all the extraordinary men who have held that high office in Australia, Sir John Kerr stands out. He stands out because of his extraordinary achievements prior to his viceregal career; he stands out because he was Governor General during an extraordinary period in Australia's political history, and he stands out because he brought such extraordinary insight and courage to the discharge of his duties. Let me say at the outset that it would be a travesty of Sir John's life and his achievements in so many fields if our reflections on him become little more than an excuse to try to rewrite the history of the 1975 constitutional crisis. Sir John's actions in November 1975 are, of course, a source of continuing debate and, regrettably, still some rancour. Certainly no assessment of Sir John Kerr's life and his achievements can neglect the high drama of late 1975, but his greatness is not dependent on his actions at that time. His greatness was, I believe, enhanced by the moral courage he sl)Owed in 1975. But it is not those events alone that mark him as a great Australian. It is his achievements throughout his life and his basic human qualities that are the true measure of the man and the true mark of his greatness. First, Sir John Kerr was a true nationalist who loved his country without deluding himself about its shortcomings. He described himself in later years as a Europhil who still calls Australia home. His achievements were the product of his own hard work; he owed nothing to patronage or to favour or to privilege. The achievements of his life, therefore, were the product of a country that gave him a fair go and that allowed him to fulfil his extraordinary talent. In turn,' he never forgot what Australia had made possible for him. He remained throughout his life distinctly and proudly Australian. Second, Sir John was an internationalist ahead of his time. He recognised long before most others and quite early in his own life that Australia could never have an effective foreign policy if it failed to perceive the winds of change in its own regional neighbourhood. For example, as early as his time at Fort Street Boys High School he won the Evatt Memorial Prize for the best essay on the subject, 'Should Australia become more enterprising in the Pacific?' His wartime service in the Army's Directorate of Research and Civil Affairs created an intense interest and expertise in the processes of decolonisation. He became principal of the Australian School of Pacific Administration from 1945 to 1948 and implemented far-sighted and very progressive views on what was needed to achieve effective autonomy and independence in the Pacific territories, and Papua New Guinea in particular. In the late 1950s Sir John became energetically involved in planning for the future of Papua New Guinea, and it was fitting that in September 1975 he was present as Governor General at Papua New Guinea's independence celebrations. Third, Sir John provided the Australian legal profession with a unique quality of leadership born of his outstanding legal knowledge, his willingness to promote sensible change and his capacity to galvanise potentially divided opinions in a common cause. His brilliant university career was followed by a distinguished period as a barrister, as a legal administrator, as a judge, as Chief Justice and as Governor General. In all these phases he was a towering and inspiring figure in the profession. He was at various times President of the Law Council of Australia, foundation President of the Law Association for Asia and the Western Pacific, and President of the New South Wales Bar Association. In all these leadership roles he challenged his own professional colleagues, insisting that standards be maintained but never afraid to promote the cause of reform, especially in administrative law and judicial reform. In both areas he has left an indelible mark. Fourth, Sir John Kerr had an intellectual fearlessness and a moral courage which few Australians have surpassed. His intellectualism was not of the ivory tower kind; it was intensely practical. It was concerned in particular with how the administration of law affected ordinary people, their rights, their aspirations, their values. Sir John's clear sense of duty and moral courage was evident throughout his career. It was evident in his struggle against communism in the trade union movement during the 1950s; it was evident in his work as a judge on the Commonwealth Industrial Court; it was evident in his law reform work; it was, above all, evident in the constitutional crisis of 1975. I said earlier that Sir John Kerr's actions in November 1975 enhanced his greatness but did not alone create it. This is not the occasion to debate in depth the rights and wrongs of the decision made on 11 November 1975. But, in so far as they involve Sir John Kerr, the following needs to be said: Sir John Kerr was required to involve himself in a crisis that was not of his making. At a critical moment in our history, no Governor General was better qualified in terms of legal expertise and practice to cope with such a constitutional crisis than was Sir John Kerr. He did his duty well as he saw it, knowing full well that many of his oldest friends would revile him for it. He acted properly and courageously in the discharge of his duties. It is most revealing to note that two of the most important writers on the reserve powers of the Crown under the Westminster system were men of the Left: Dr H. V. Evatt in Australia, with whom Sir John Kerr shared a close personal and professional relationship, and the Canadian socialist and constitutional expert Dr Eugene Forsey. Dr Evatt was not alive to comment on Sir John Kerr's action. Dr Forsey was, and his verdict was clear. Dr Forsey wrote in the epilogue to Sir John's book Matters for Judgment: Never for a moment did I doubt the correctness of the action Sir John took. For the life of me, I could not see, and still cannot see, what else he could have done in the circumstances. The constitutional right of the Senate to refuse, or defer, supply seems to me incontestable. Perhaps it should never have been given that right. But it was. Dr Forsey's conclusion is one I heartily share. His verdict was that Sir John-Kerr's actions in November 1975 were 'constitutionally correct, necessary and inescapable'. The French put it well when they say, 'We owe respect to the living and to the dead nothing but truth'. In his lifetime Sir John Kerr did not always get the respect that his talents and public service deserved. In death, this Parliament and all Australians owe it to him to record the truth about his life and not to indulge in myth making. Let us be honest about a few things. Let us acknowledge openly that Sir John Kerr became the easy target for many whose personal ambitions for power were frustrated by his action. It was easier to blame the umpire than to try to understand why the Australian people voted as they did in December 1975. It was easier for politicians at the time to make Sir John Kerr the issue than to admit their own failings. Let us recognise that for too long there was an excessive focus on how the 1975 constitutional crisis was resolved-not on how it arose and how it escalated. Without that escalation there would have been no constitutional crisis in 1975. It escalated because a Prime Minister, denied Supply by an upper House, failed to do his constitutional duty of either resigning or advising a dissolution of the lower House. Yet it was Sir John Kerr alone who became the focus of the blame for the crisis. Let us concede that if there are defects in our Constitution, it is our responsibility to fix them and not to blame honest men and women who implement the Constitution as it stands. Above all, let us consign for ever to the dustbin of history all those myths that embittered opponents of Sir John's actions have created or have encouraged over the years-myths such as that Sir John acted without legal authority, or that he deliberately acted in a politically partisan way, or that he alone was responsible for dividing the nation, or the familiar but irrational taunt that he was somehow a traitor to his class. If ever there was a case of embittered men and women playing the man and not the ball, it was the case of Sir John Kerr and his role in the 1975 crisis. The myths about 1975 that some people still try to cultivate reflect only on them, and not on the integrity and not on the contribution of Sir John Kerr. ' Sir John Kerr was a great Australian, not just because of the qualities and achievements I have touched on: his patriotism, his foresight about our region, his legal career and his moral courage. He will also be remembered as a great Australian because of his human qualities: his love for his family, his joy in living, his sense of humour, his capacity for warmth and friendship, his kindness and compassion, and his humility-all the qualities so movingly referred to by his friends and family at his memorial service last Saturday. Two of them referred in particular to the words of one of Sir John's friends, the poet James MCAuley, who wrote of him: He is in fact a soft-hearted person who greatly dislikes taking part in the infliction of hurt on anyone, though in the end he will do what a common sense practical judgement seems to require as right and necessary. That is an epitaph that most of us would happily settle for. Of all Sir John Kerr's great human qualities, however, none was greater than his lack of bitterness and his basic humanity. Few Australians in our history have been the subject of such an intense personal vilification as that directed at Sir John Kerr. None has been as dignified as he in his refusal to respond in kind. Indeed, he relied on the power of rational and substantive argument. Those who vilified him· in such a personal and vindictive way or who insisted that we all maintain our rage against him will have to live with their own conscience. But Sir John's conscience was always clear and he never stooped to returning their bitter words. In Sir John Kerr's passing Australia has lost one of its most outstanding citizens. Lesser people have tried to tear him down. Some will continue to try. But they will not succeed, because in the cool light of history Sir John Kerr's achievements and human qualities will be seen for what they truly were. Sir John began his book Matters of Judgment with a quote from the American Declaration of Independence, which reads: Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. Sir John Kerr's private life and public career were inspired by that ideal. To Sir John's wife and children, who were the real centre of his life, I (convey the deep sympathy of all members on this side of the House and our admiration for his distinguished contribution to Australian life.",13
4,Mr KEATING,DEATH OF THE RIGHT,"I would also like to pass on my condolences to Sir John Kerr's wife and family and lament the fact that he died a controversial figure in what has become generally recognised as a tragic completion of a very promising career. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has just made a very partisan and milita-t speech, without which I probably would not have spoken on the condolence motion. However, I think a few things need to be said as a result of his remarks. The Leader of the Opposition was not here in those times, and one needed to be here then to understand the ambience and the sequence of the events. Sir John Kerr was a person of substance. He· was very interested in public affairs and public 'life. He is like a lot of frustrated people of quality: they want to be in public life, but never ever make the jump; they never quite take the chance. He was such a person. For him it was always a dalliance at the edge of public affairs. He became Governor General on the recommendation of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam because he was known to him and known also for his interest in public life and public affairs. It was with that in mind that I think the government of the day had great expectations of him at least having a role in public life, a role which otherwise had been denied to him over the course of his career. It was not that it had been a public life without distinction, because his service as the Chief Justice of New South Wales and as a barrister of note meant that he was a very well regarded person. As the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said earlier, he was well regarded legally in all quarters. He had a reasonably close affinity with the labour movement; that is why he was trusted by the Australian Labor Party. The fact of the matter is that the Labor Party makes the political heroes in this country. When people cross the Labor Party they wear the crosses it puts on them, whether it be Billy Hughes or Joe Lyons-that is the truth of it. Sir John Kerr has worn the admonition of the Labor Party. That is really what the Opposition is talking about now. He does so for one reason-he deceived his Prime Minister. He did not tell him that he was prepared to sack him. I was at Government House with the then Prime Minister on the last occasion he saw Sir John Kerr, at an Executive Council meeting of three to appoint the Chairman of the Darwin Reconstruction Authority. The meeting was filled with bonhomie, cordiality and the like. As we left and walked down that long corridor at Government House, the Prime Minister was saying complimentary things to the Governor General. The Prime Minister intimated to me that the Governor General was a very proper person who would observe the constitutional position and prerogatives, including telling the Prime Minister what he intended for him. Had the Prime Minister known that he intended to deceive him and dismiss him, another course of action would have been available to him. That is the nub of Sir John Kerr's prob,lem with the Labor movement and those who support it, and it will last forever. It is a sad thing for him, but it is a fact. Anyone who has made a contribution to this country is to be admired. In a personal sense, Sir John Kerr did not come from privileged circumstances, but he surmounted any difficulties in those circumstances. He was a person of substance. But, in the end, one has to follow that substance with integrity. He lacked the integrity in dealing politically with the Prime Minister and he has suffered history's admonition as a result.",15
5,Mr TIM FISCHER,DEATH OF THE RIGHT,"I am tempted to deal in detail with the comments made by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Keating), but I choose not to dignify those comments. I rise to support the condolence motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). I support the comments of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. So far no-one else has taken part in this debate. In my view, few people in Australia's history have been treated more shabbily than Sir John Kerr-demonstrated again here today by the non-attendance of a large number of members of the Government back bench. Sir John Kerr's abilities and commitments have already been spoken of by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. From the time he was at school, words such as 'outstanding' and 'brilliant' were frequently used as descriptions of this extraordinary man. I am more familiar with military matters than legal matters, and I therefore have found his service career particularly interesting as a reflection of the man himself. Having been admitted to the New South Wales Bar in 1938, he joined the Army as a private in the early part of the Second World War. In an extremely short period of time he was appointed to the Directorate of Research and Civil Affairs under the legendary Mr Alf Conlon, and subsequently fulfilled the role of advising the Commander-in-Chief, the redoubtable General Sir Thomas Blamey. By 1944 Sir John Kerr was accompanying General Blamey to the Prime Ministers conference in London, and representing General Blamey at the highest levels as a lieutenant colonel. So having joined the forces as a private, in a few short years he had risen to the rank of lieutenant colonel, and that mercurial rise is proof positive of the sheer ability of one John Kerr. In 1948 Sir John decided to return to the legal profession after his period of activity associated with the School of Pacific Administration, about which the Leader of the Opposition commented. Ahead of his time, he had already begun to focus on the Pacific and the Asian region, and of course that was tremendously important for Australia. Sir John's appointment as Governor General in 1974, having been Chief Justice of New South Wales, was a correct appointment and one supported generally across Australia. Perhaps the appointment says more about one Gough Whitlam than it does about Sir John Kerr. It has to be said that it was the culmination of Sir John Kerr's public life, but it gave no intimation of the placid, conventional, quiet family man that I am advised he was, and that was highlighted in a brilliant address by Sir John Kerr's son, Philip Kerr, at that magnificent memorial service in St James church in Sydney last Saturday. With regard to the events of 1975, let me simply say it will take perhaps even more years before there is general concurrence on all aspects of those events, and perhaps a more accurate assessment of the key and correct role played by Sir John Kerr. The Leader of the Opposition touched on those events briefly. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Sir John Kerr consistently acted in good faith as Governor General of Australia. It is for that reason that I find the antagonism towards this man over the many years since 1975 to be an indictment of both the individuals concerned and, in some respects, the whole Australian political culture. I particularly take this opportunity to praise the present Prime Minister for the comments which he made late on 11 November 1975 when, as President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and President of the Australian Labor Party, he said there was no doubt Sir John Kerr had the power to make the decision. Mr Hawke went on to call on the Australian trade union movement to refrain from violence and from 'taking to the streets'. On the sacking, Mr Hawke thought Mr Whitlam had to accept the Governor General's decision. I quote him directly: If the Governor General adheres to his position, then Mr Whitlam and the Parliamentary Labor Party have no alternative but to accept . . . Again, I concur with the comments of the Prime Minister,made both then and earlier today, in respect of Sir John Kerr. On behalf of the parliamentary National Party I extend sympathy to Lady Kerr and the Kerr family. I add, Mr Speaker, that Sir John Kerr was a great Australian, and it is my sincere hope that as the years go by it will be possible to have a truly balanced discussion about not only the events of 1975 but also the great contribution of this man across many areasmilitary, diplomatic, legal, and vice-regal.",16
6,Mr SCHOLES,DEATH OF THE RIGHT,"I pass on my condolences to the family of Sir John Kerr. I did not know him as a private person; I knew him as a public person. I would have preferred not to have taken part in this debate because my knowledge of him in public life was 1975 and the events of 11 November. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) chose to use this occasion to make a blatant and cheap political speech to to justify the conservative parties in this Parliament. It is a tradition, unfortuthis nately, that those who act properly or improperly to advantage the conservative parties are accepted as having been highly proper. Sir John Kerr's career is beyond questime. tion. That he believed he acted properly on 11 November is· also, I believe, above question. I was in Papua New Guinea at the time of Independence and I think the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) was too. The ceremony of the handing over of power was one of the most moving ceremonies I have ever tended: the flags were lowered and flags were raised, and there was no cour. But 11 November 1975 was a political occasion. It arose from political events and it arose because of improper and proper actions. I dispute that the before Governor General at the time had other course of action. He did. I dispute that Supply was blocked. It was never voted on. I believe that even though the p-wer existed and it may have been proper-and that is a matter we can all disagree on-for the Governor General to insist on the dissolution of the Parliaand ment, it was proper that that dissolution be conveyed to the Prime Minister, the person enjoying a majority in this House, the elected leader of this nation as Minister, and that a subterfuge not used in order to achieve a political situahave tion where advice for an election could be given by a Prime Minister who could not and did not enjoy the confidence this House and had not been elected to that office. I think that is the nub of question. There was considerable doubt as to whether the Senate would have voted block Supply. I would contend-I am the aware that there are others who dispute this-that the Governor General, given there were two weeks left before Supply expired, had it within his reserve to ask the Senate to consider the Supply Bills and express an opinion upon them; to take those Bills into the Senate vote on them. It was a political decision seek of the Opposition, not announced by a senator, I might add, but by Mr Fraser in place-such is the independence of the Senate-not to have those Bills voted on in the Senate. It was a decision of a political party because it suited its convenience and its political needs at the It was not beyond the powers of the Governor General to request the Senate to vote on those Bills and, had it rejected the Supply Bills-and that is a matter of conjecture-then and only then would it have been justified to dissolve this House and send it to the people. It was also atwithin the powers of the Governor the General-and there were people in our ranparty room who suggested the course of action-to advise the Prime Minister that the course of action which he had advised-and the Prime Minister did in fact tell the Governor General some two hours he saw him of the course of action no he was going to advise; he rang the Governor General-was not one which he saw as appropriate nor as resolving the problem. It was within the powers of the Governor General to advise the Prime Minister that he felt there had to-be an election for the House of Representatives that it would be preferable if he advised a double dissolution. I have no doubt at the time, given that Prime Gough Whitlam believed he could win be under any circumstances, that he would taken that advice. It was not proper to enter into an agreement with the Leader of the Opposition to appoint him as Prime of Minister if he could guarantee that the Supply Bills would be passed by the Senthe ate-an action which required a course of action to be kept secret from the Prime Minister and for the Governor General to act in a way which I consider was not into accordance with the proper function of office of representing the Crown. It is foolish beyond imagination to suggestas I have seen it suggested-that the Prime Minister at the time could have acted to powers dismiss the Governor General.",17
7,Mr SPEAKER,DEATH OF THE RIGHT,Order! The honourand able member for Corio might come back to the broader life of Sir John Kerr.,18
8,Mr SCHOLES,DEATH OF THE RIGHT,"I am sorry, but the Leader of the Opposition did wander very, very widely. I will not pursue the question, but I must say that it was within the powers of the Governor General to have an election, if he so desired, and for the Prime Minister of the day to be Prime Minister at the time of that election. It is important that these events be properly debated in a proper place and at a proper time: this is not that time. It is unfortunate that the Leader of the Opposition, because of his inability to rise to such an occasion and because of his cheap politicking, has forced me to enter this debate at all. I do not believe the events of 1975 were proper. I do not think they were inevitable, although I would acknowledge that the defeat of the Whitlam Government probably was; that is a political question. The time of the passing of any person who has added throughout his life to the best of his ability to the wealth, knowledge and achievements of his nation is a sad occasion indeed. I believe that, allowing for my differences with his judgments and his actions on one occasion, Sir John Kerr, as an Australian, did· add to the totality of Australia as we know it.",19
9,Mr HOWARD,DEATH OF THE RIGHT,"I first met Sir John Kerr in November 1956 when, having left school for a period of two months, I had a job as an assistant to a barrister's clerk in the old Denman Chambers in Phillip Street, Sydney. On that particular occasion, Sir John Kerr occupied chambers in conjunction, ironically enough, with the late Clive Evatt and the late Dr H. Y. Evatt. As a very young and impressionable person, I was struck by the great presence, the obvious intellect and the obviously voracious interest that the man displayed in public affairs. I have not come to the dispatch box today, nor did I intend to come to the dispatch box today, to traverse the minutiae of what happened on 11 November 1975. I will say one thing, though, about the conduct of some people on that day, and I say it notwithstanding the fact that I disagree with some of the things that the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) has just said. As the then Speaker, he displayed enormous control and displayed the very best traditions of the Westminster Speaker in the amount of control that he exercised over those people who then sat on his right side. I 'would not want the opportunity to go by without acknowledging that fact. Nor would I let the opportunity go by without acknowledging the tasteful remarks that have been made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) today, in contrast to some other remarks that have been made today. I have always held the view that, if there were guilty men and women in 1975, the guilty men and women were the politicians and not the occupant of Yarralumla. I have held that view since November 1975, and the passage of time has strengthened that view. I do not think any objective reflection on 1975 can absolve either side of politics from some share of the blame for the wrenching impact of those events on the fabric of political life in Australia. As the year- have gone by, I have learnt to understand the natural frustration felt by many people in the Labor Party. They were denied office for 23 years, gained office for a brief period of three years, saw it politically disintegrate before their eyes, and then in their eyes the final coup de grace was delivered by somebody they continued to claim in their tradition as their own-and that tradition seems to live long, as evidenced by the comments of the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) today. I understand that, and I think anybody who seeks to see Australian politics as a continuity and to understand the folklore of both sides of politics would have to recognise and understand that. As I have reflected in another place on other occasions, as time goes by the circumstances in which any political party assumes power in terms of the consent of the minority as well as the votes of the majority do have an impact on the conduct of that political party in office. That is a lesson our side of politics learnt from the events of 1975. I simply want to record again my continuing deep regret that a man who I believe was placed in an impossibly invidious position suffered so much personally as a consequence of having been placed in that position. We can argue until we are grey and until we drop. Nobody who holds strong views that Sir John Kerr was right in 1975 is likely, almost 17 years after the event, to have his or her views changed, and nobody who believes powerfully and passionately to the contrary is likely to have his or her views changed. We can perhaps understand the relevance of those events to the two political parties; we can understand the lessons that we both ought to learn; and we also ought to rejoice in some sense in the fact that our basic institutions survived those events. And they did survive those events. Although some would see them as damaged and diminished, I think as time went by people were damaged and diminished rather than those particular institutions. Finally, I want to record the pleasure mid satisfaction I personally derived from a number of personal associations with Sir John Kerr after he left Yarralumla. Whenever I was in England on a ministerial visit in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when Sir John Kerr was there, I took the opportunity of looking him up and talking, as he inevitably wanted to, about Australian political affairs. I also enjoyed several very eclectic political gatherings organised in Sydney by some of his old friends from both sides of politics after he returned to Sydney in 1984. I regarded him as a powerful, honest and robust Australian, given an awesome responsibility by the circumstances of history; I admired the fortitude he displayed; I deeply resented and regretted the personal attacks to which he was subjected. I believe he takes not only a very honoured place in the history of Australian Governors-General but also a very honoured place in the history of gutsy, robust Australian figures.",19
10,Mr KERR,DEATH OF THE RIGHT,"I rise in this debate with no sense or trace of bitterness but rather with immense admiration for the life of a man who I think the Australian Labor Party (ALP) would concede was great. However, I think members of the ALP would concede him to be great in the Shakespearian sense: that is, a man who was affected by a tragic flaw, whose life was damaged and whose reputation was traduced by an event into which he was placed by circumstances but which we on this side of the House will continue to believe involved an error of judgment. In saying that Sir John Kerr was a great man, let me first reflect on my own very limited experience of that greatness. I took up a position of lecturer at the University of Papua New Guinea and was later dean of its law school. There is no doubt that the collection of essays which Sir John inspired dating from the early 1950s founded a jurisprudence in that country. That collection of essays underpinned a new way of Australian thinking about relations with the Pacific, and Sir John Kerr was very much a person who helped to shape the way in which we as Australians saw our role in our region. . Although that is a fairly limited contact, let me say that, as a person who has served at the Bar and has argued cases before our High Court, I have nothing but respect for the role of Sir John Kerr, particularly as a writer in the area of constitutional development in the Pacific region, and also in his work in the High Court and as Chief Justice of New South Wales. Of course, we have to place his life in balance. We come to a condolence debate today in which we cannot escape the events of 1975. I, too, regard the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) as unfortunately partisan, but that is the nature of our response to those events. I thank the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) for remarks which I think place this matter in far more appropriate context than those of the Leader of the Opposition. Sir John's was a life which, under any other circumstances, one would have seen as a total vindication of greatness. He was a man who drew himself up from extremely humble beginnings, surmounted those beginnings, led at the Bar and achieved, at a young age, public office as Chief Justice of New South Wales. At the pinnacle of his career, he was appointed to the office of Governor General of this nation. There are many parallels to Shakespeare and the tragedy of Lear. I find it sad that Sir John Kerr, like Lear in the wilderness with the wind whipping around, did not appear to understand the significance of his actions and the response to those actions which occurred. Few of us would not be troubled by the dialogue that occurred some years after the dissolution of the Parliament in 1975 when Sir John Kerr, confronted by an Australian Broadcasting Corporation journalist, said, 'All I really did was to give the people within Australia an opportunity to express an opinion'. It seemed to me that that simplistic misunderstanding of the significance of his actions tarnished and diminished what, until that point, had been a life which all would have regarded as one of excellence. There is also, of course, the role and vindication of this House. It is not appropriate for this debate to pass without also noting the matters which the former Speaker, the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), put to the House. I will mention one matter that was not mentioned by the former Speaker, which is that he attended upon Sir John Kerr on behalf of this House to pass to the Governor General the opinion of this House that the man he had commissioned to hold the office of Prime Minister no longer held the confidence of the House; that on that occasion the Governor General did not permit that attendance to be made. In that regard, this House was diminished, plainly, by the actions of the former Governor General. This is not the point where we can canvass all the rights and wrongs of what occurred, but in conclusion, I refer to Bagehot, the most famous constitutional writer, who set out viceregal responsibility and set out what he regarded as the three principal remaining prerogatives of the Crown. They were to be advised, to counsel and to warn. Even if it be conceded that the right to dissolve existed-and there are still constitutional lawyers of great eminence who do not concede that-then certainly it is the case that Sir John Kerr did not exercise what Bagehot and most other constitutional experts would have seen as his appropriate responsibility. He was advised, but did he counselor did he warn? I think that explains and underlines the continuing reason why, within a very substantial range of Australian public opinion, there is disquiet and a mixture of feelings surrounding the death of a man about whom we otherwise would have had a unanimous view. There is no doubt that Sir John Kerr will remain a figure of substantial controversy. Whatever we say in this place now should not conclude that debate because it is important for our nation that we do not deal with this debate in a simple, partisan way, but that we address the principled issues of how we deal in future with these questions of reserve powers. I am pleased to note that just recently a constitutional conference started to confront those issues. We do not wish, I am sure, on either side of this House, to go back to a circumstance where those kinds of immensely emotional and racking events can occur again. I conclude my remarks by saying that I certainly do not wish ,to appear in any way begrudging in my respect for a life which I regard as great. I am sure that every member of this House would extend sympathies to Sir John's family. History will judge the matters which are still in debate.",20
11,Mr SINCLAIR,DEATH OF THE RIGHT,"To draw a distinction between the private and the public man is never more difficult than in the instance of the late Governor General, Sir John Kerr. Born the son of a Balmain miner and boilermaker, he was a member of the Australian Labor Party for much of his life. He had a distinguished childhood, and academically he won or shared in all the prizes that were available in the Faculty of Law in the University of Sydney. He was a man who rose through the processes of law to considerable distinction. Contrary to the understanding of the honourable member , for Blaxland (Mr Keating), let me explain to him that the Chief Justice, under our constitutional hierarchy, is at the peak of one of the three elements of the AustraIi an constitutional system-the legislature, the administration and the judiciary. Sir John Kerr, prior to his appointment as Governor General, was a very distinguished Chief Justice of New South Wales. I will say a few things about the three aspects of Sir John that have been debated in the House this afternoon and that I think are so important. The first is the private man. Of the private man, there is no doubt that he was quite an outstanding Australian. Those of us who were at his memorial service were taken not only by the quality and sincerity of the remarks by his son, by one of his daughters and by his grandson, but also by the remarks of the Chief Justice of the High Court and those by Mr Donald Markwell, a Fellow of Merton College and a Rhodes Scholar of 1980 who, of course, met Sir John long after the events of 1975 and who knew him as an individual, a great Australian and a thinking Australian. There is little doubt that he was a man of intellectual greatness and of great moral courage, and of that type of individual there are too few in Australia. I would like to pay my own respects to the memory of the greatness of that man. The second aspect, and the one that inevitably dominated this debate and the remarks since Sir John's death, has been that of the public figure. It is, of course, an unusual debate in this Parliament when we can talk about the Australian head of state. I think it is an indictment of the smallness of our society or, perhaps I should say, the small-mindedness of some of those who are members of it, that they find it difficult to accept the judgment of a man who acted, as he believed, with total propriety. I do not want to touch on it to any great degree, but I think he acted in a way that caused most Australians at the time to feel relieved. I think it is important that we remember that our Constitution is derived from the Bill of Rights, the Magna Carta and the transfer of powers of the British monarchy to the British House of Westminster' from which we derive our concept of a Westminster democracy. Of course, there are flaws in it, but I think it is remarkable that this afternoon we are to have not only this obituary, but shortly one for a person who one would expect was the last British Governor General. One of the products of the evolution of the head of state in this country has been the way in which in the short period since 1901 practices and precedents have grown not only as far as the legislature and government are concerned, but also as far as the head of state is concerned. We would do well to remember that, while we are young as a society, we are extraordinarily fortunate that we have not had the revolutions and the divisions that have taken place in all the other major democracies in the world. The United Kingdom and the United States have been wracked by civil war; they have had enormous internal conflicts. Here we have been void of them, thank God. Let us trust it shall always be so. But that does not mean that in the evolution of the systems within our nation there will not be stresses. I commend the analysis of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) of the events of 11 November 1975. I think it is important. I wish to refer only to the fact that, when we talk about the failure to consult-the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) referred to Bagot-I suggest that the responsibility of the Governor General is not just to advise, nor just to consult, nor just to warn; it is also to uphold the Constitution. At that time we all remember, or we all should remember-if we were not here we should recall the facts of history-that the Government was seeking to fund the services of government outside the Constitution. It is important for us to recall that the Governor General had an obligation to maintain the Constitution. I suggest to the honourable member for Denison that that is a fourth responsibility that most constitutional analysts would accept as being equally the responsibility of the head of state. The nature and character of the role of Governor General is far different from that of the British monarchy. At a time when there is some analysis of the Australian Constitution yet again, while in Europe they say, 'Le roi est mort, vive Ie roi', I suggest that here in Australia we say, 'This Governor General is dead but long live that institution'. I would like to join in extending perofKerr sonal sympathy to Sir John's widow, to his children and to his grandchildren for an outstanding Australian's life. He was great individual, stimulating company and questions in the provocative personally. I do not think that many of us would have shared some of his views, yet he was one who as certain Governor General above all contributed greatly to the maturity of our nation. I respect his memory, I endorse his ment and I believe that Australia has been the richer for his life.",21
12,Dr THEOPHANOUS,DEATH OF THE RIGHT,"I also wish to pass on my sympathies to the ground family of Sir John Kerr and to say that I resignation feel a great sadness in terms of what has ing happened in his life. As chairman of the lency committee inquiring into Papua New seek Guinea, let me say that we have become aware of the role which he played in terms of setting up and supporting the constithe tutional and legal system of Papua New would Guinea. As many people have mentioned, funds he had a distinguished career, certainly through most of his life. I guess it is sad that the events of 1975 led to a situation in which the whole perception of him and of his work changed in this nation, or least in a large section of this nation. I did not intend to speak very much that, except to make those comments, but I was amazed to hear the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) make a number of claims and statements concerning the 1975 crisis and the actions of Sir John Kerr. As a person who has written extenand sively on this topic and whose work has been debated in universities and colleges, I can only say the following about what person. the Leader of the Opposition said: he was wrong on every point and every claim. was wrong for him to introduce these matters in the way in which he did. Let me point to a couple of very imOpposition portant things that the Leader of the Opposition said. For example, he said constitutional experts agreed that the ate clearly had the power to block Supply. As the former Speaker, the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), has pointed out, Supply had not actually been blocked at the time at which Sir John acted. There had been no blocking Supply, merely the deferral of Supply by the Senate. That was a very important question. a actually been The fact that Supply had not blocked was one of the key constitutional crisis. The Leader of the Opposition quoted experts. Let me quote expert advice that was given to Sir John Kerr, several days before the action, by the then judgsenior legal counsel of the Commonwealth of Australia, the Solicitor-General, Mr Byers. He said: The point of this is that section 61 affords no for the conclusion that upon the Senate deferring or rejecting Supply solely to procure the or dismissal of the Ministry possessa majority in the Representatiyes, His Excelis constitutionally obliged immediately to an explanation of the Prime Minister of how he proposes to overcome that situation. Nor do we agree with the suggestion that were Prime Minister unable to suggest means which solve the disagreement between the Houses . . . and left the Government without to carry on, it would be His Excellency's duty to dismiss his Ministers. Senior legal counsel in the Commonwealth sent this advice seven days before at Sir John Kerr acted. In addition to that, as the honourable member for Corio has pointed out, there was not merely the on question of the dismissal of the Government; there was what I consider to be a clearly unconstitutional act, that is, the appointment of a Prime Minister who did not have, and clearly did not have, the majority in the House of Representatives the refusal to acknowledge that that person did not have the majority after the House had voted no confidence in that To suggest that these matters do not It have implications for the very fabric of democracy is quite wrong. They do have implications. The Leader of the has brought these matters before the House, and the sad thing is that that we as a nation still have not resolved Senthese issues. We do not know what would happen in a similar crisis. Is it within the power of a Governor General to dismiss any House of Representatives and to appoint as Prime Minister for an indefinite period whoever is in the Representatives, with whatever minority he or she might have, and then to reject the determination of the Parliament against that particular person? Have these questions been addressed? They certainly have not. There is no doubt that the life of Sir John Kerr-especially that aspect of his life-has brought to the forefront a number of key constitutional issues for this country in terms of the powers of the Governor General. In the last 15 years we have swept those issues under the carpet-far from seeing that these were not structural issues but merely issues concerning individuals, as the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has suggested. We have not resolved those questions. I suggest that the best possible thing that we could do in memory of Sir John Kerr would be for both Opposition and Government to get together to hold a constitutional conference to resolve some of these fundamental questions which remain outstanding. I want to pass my personal sympathies to Sir John Kerr's family. I have dealt simply with the issues raised by the Leader of the Opposition. Irrespective of the rights and wrongs of this matter, we need to get together as a nation and resolve the constitutional issues which arose as a result of the 1975 crisis.",23
13,Mr TUCKEY,DEATH OF THE RIGHT,"Prior to coming to Canberra this week, I made a commitment to myself to speak in favour and defence of Sir John Kerr, anticipating the comments that might be made in his place. However, having listened to my Leader, Dr Hewson, and the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), I find that they have expressed very adequately many of the thoughts that I wished to express personally. I had personal contact with Sir John Kerr during his lifetime when for one day he made an official visit to Carnarvon while he was Governor General and when I was Shire President of Carnarvon. I found him very decent, interesting and likeable, as I did his wife, Lady Kerr. That would have .been sufficient reason for my standing today. But I really stand because I want to say that he was the only Governor General in 70 years of Federation who was ever called upon to make a decision of substance. He did it notwithstanding that he had to act against people with whom he had been politically aligned and notwithstanding that he had to do it against people he no doubt considered his friends. In fact, he was a man who did his duty as he saw it, and nobody should criticise such a person. No doubt Sir John Kerr would have loved to have been anywhere else but in that position at that time. Had I had his position, I too would have wished to have been somewhere else. He just happened to be the individual in Australia who had to resolve the situation. He took a decision, and it is one on which he must be congratulated, if only for taking it. Honourable members should never think that that was easy for Sir John Kerr; they should never think that the man revelled in having to tell people with whom he was both politically and personallyassociated that they were no longer in government, that they no longer had a position of power. This is the making of a great man. All the other attributes pointed to by the Leader· of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and other speakers from this side of the House, even those made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), who was at pains to point out Sir John's distinguished career in many areas, made him a great man. But the day that he took the decision which he probably did not want to take made him a very great man. Australia must be grateful that he had the ability to take a decision and not dither and leave everything as it would have been had that not happened. In closing, I have a message for the Deputy Prime Minister, the Treasurer (Mr Keating), and that is: forget the eleventh commandment of the Australian Labor Party, which is, 'Thou shalt hate thine enemy beyond his grave'. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. NA NA DE L'ISLE, VC, KG, GCMG, GCVO",24
14,Mr HAWKE,HONOURABLE VISCOUNT,"I move: That the House expresses its deep regret at the death of the Right Honourable Viscount De YC, KG, GCMG, GCYO, a former Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia 1961 to 1965, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service tenders its profound sympathy to his family their bereavement. First Viscount De L'lsle was born liam Philip Sidney on 23 May 1909 in England, son of the fifth Baron De L'lsle and Dudley. He was educated at Eton and at Cambridge University and became chartered accountant after graduating university. At around the same time he joined the Grenadier Guards Reserve of Officers. During World War II Major Sidfifth ney, as he was then, led a handful of in the defence of the Anzio beachhead in Italy, for which he was awarded the toria Cross. Eight months after Anzio and while still in the Army, he was elected unopposed to the House of Commons as Conservademocracy tive member for Chelsea. It was not until after his father's death the following year that he took his seat in the House Lords as the sixth Baron De L'lsle. In 1951 he was appointed Secretary of State for. Air under Prime Minister Churchill and held office until 1955. Viscount De L'IsI- then turned increasingly to business interests. He held several appointments, and among them were Managing Director of Schweppes (Home) Ltd and director of Lloyds Bank. In 1961 Viscount De L'lsle came to Canberra as the fifteenth Governorin General of the Commonwealth of Ausas tralia. He was an enthusiastic and active Governor General who travelled widely within Australia. A feature of his term was that he was the last Governor General who was a non-resident of Australia on his appointment. His fondness for Aushistorical tralia was apparent when he returned Australia for a visit in the late 1960s. Viscount De L'lsle's continuing affection for Australia was demonstrated in 1988 when he presented a bronze statue for Australia's bicentenary, which now stands in the grounds of Government House in Canberra. On behalf of the Government, our most sincere sympathy to his family in their bereavement.",25
15,Dr HEWSON,HONOURABLE VISCOUNT,"Like Sir John Kerr, from whom we have just honoured, Lord De L'Isle lived a life of high achievement and and public service, crowning it with his tenure in of the office of Governor General of Australia. Although they shared the distincWiltion of appointment to the governorgeneralship, Sir John Kerr and Lord De L'lsle had vastly different personal backgrounds. As we have heard, Sir John Kerr a was the son of a Balmain boilermaker from who attended Fort Street Boys High and won a scholarship to Sydney University. The first Viscount De L'lsle, son of the Baron De L'lsle, went to Eton and men Cambridge. An Englishman of impeccable heritage, he was able to trace his family Vicback to the Norman Conquest of 1066. Clearly, Lord De L'lsle had a clear sense of public duty, a commitment to justice under law and a belief in the stability and that the Westminster system enshrined. I was not privileged to know Lord De L'lsle. Indeed, I think there is of only one member now in this chamber who served in the Parliament during the period he was Governor General, that being the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). I believe that he will also contribute to the debate on the condolence motion. Lord De L'Isle's personal attributes of affability and openness have been attested to by many and explain the popularity and the respect he won during his term office. Even more than that, his period Governor General further enhanced the stature of that position, largely as a result of the dignified way in which he carried out his duties. One of the most notable aspects of Lord De L'Isle's governorgeneralship is, of course, that it marked a watershed. He was the last viceto regal appointment from Britain. He was succeeded by Richard Casey. Ever since, Governors-General have been Australian-and rightly so. That is not to downplay the contribution which Lord De L'lsle and his predecessors made to Australian public life. They were men of quality, sincerity and dedication. Lord De L'lsle's period as Governor General marked a turning point in viceregal. history in Australia, not because of the nature of his tenure of the office but because by 1965 Australia had become a much more confident, independent and self-assertive nation than it had been before. Lord De L'lsle's career was marked by personal courage and high achievement. His family had a long military association and Lord De L'lsle also distinguished himself in battle, winning the Victoria Cross while leading his company of the Grenadier Guards at the Anzio landings in 1944. It is said that he continued to direct the fight as he lay wounded on a stretcher. He shared the honour of wearing the highest medal for gallantry with another Governor General, Lord Gowrie, and the former Governor of New South Wales, Sir Roden Cutler. Lord De L'lsle was also successful in politics and business. In 1944 he was elected to the House of Commons for the .seat of Chelsea. He served briefly as a junior Minister in Churchill's wartime government. On his father's death in 1945, he moved to the House of Lords where he served on the Opposition front bench. In 1951 when Churchill was re-elect ed, Lord De L'lsle was appointed Minister for Air and served in that position until 1955. It was during this time that he first visited Australia, travelling to Woomera to examine weapons research and meeting Sir Robert Menzies, during whose prime ministership he was later to become Governor General. Following his parliamentary career, Lord De L'lsle went into business and served for a time as Managing Director of Schweppes (Home) Ltd. He developed his deep interest in public life and community affairs, serving as President of the Freedom Association, Chairman of Trustees of the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust and a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery and the British Museum. Lord De L'lsle's period as Governor General was marked by personal tragedy in late 1962 when his wife Margaret, to whom he was devoted, died in Canberra after a long illness. It was a measure of his dedication to his public duties that after this sad event he remained at Yarralumla for another 21/2 years before relinquishing his position in mid-1965 and returning to England. The death of Lord De L'lsle last Friday marks the passing of an era when Australia looked automatically to Britain for those who it felt suitable to serve as Australia's head of State. Since Lord De L'lsle, distinguished Australians have filled that role with distinction. That fact should be a source of pride to all Australians, but it should not be the cause of some shrill and empty nationalism. Still less should it diminish the contribution of British Governors-General such as Lord De L'lsle who carried out their duties with such commitment, and who had such a deep affection for Australia and Australians. In the circumstances of his time Lord De L'lsle brought to the office of Governor General a quiet dignity and a strong sense of duty. On behalf of Opposition members, I extend to the family of Lord De L'lsle and to the many friends· he made in Australia our sincere condolences at the passing of a fine man who served Australia well.",25
16,Mr TIM FISCHER,HONOURABLE VISCOUNT,"I rise to support the Prime M-nister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) with regard to this condolence motion in honour of Lord De L'lsle, who was of course the last British Governor General to come to Australia to fill the important obligations of Governor General and then return to Great Britain. In saying that, I in no way detract from the significant contribution to both Britain and Australia made by Lord De L'lsle in his wide ranging life. I will not reiterate all the details which have been covered by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition; rather I will focus on the particular chapter of his life when, in service with the Grenadier Guards, he was awarded the Victoria Cross. As others have mentioned, that was in 1944. It is interesting to focus on· the backin ground of that particular action. The Gervarious mans had attacked a British division February 1944 with elements of six differ1961 ent divisions, and a continuous series fierce hand-to-band battles were fought, each one of which had its immediate action on the position of other troops the neighbourhood, and on the action a whole. It was of supreme importance attempted. that every inch of ground should be doggedly, stubbornly and tenaciously held. It was in this context that Captain-temparliamentary porary Major-William Philip Sidney, later Lord De L'Isle, of the Grenadier Guards won his Victoria Cross. On the nights of 7 and 8 February, Major Sidney was commanding the supCrown; port company of a battalion of the adier Guards. Enemy infantry attacked heavily in the vicinity of his headquarters and penetrated into the wadi south-west of Carrocetto Bridge. He collected the crew of a three-inch mortar firing nearby, and personally led an attack with Tommy gun and hand grenade, driving the enemy out of the gully. He then led another party in a successful counterattack in which engaged the enemy with his Tommy gun at point-blank range. The enemy renewed their attack, and a grenade struck Major Sidney in the face, wounding him and one guardsman, and killing another. Despite being weak from loss of blood and scarcely able to walk, he continued to encourage his men with the result the battalion's position was re-established with far-reaching consequences for the battle as a whole. He was decorated with the ribbon of the Victoria Cross by none other than General Alexander at the zio beachhead in Italy on Palm Sunday, accepted offi·ce. 2 April 1944-in the presence of his father-in-law, I might add, who must surely have been very proud on that day; none other than Viscount Gort, a VC himself, who was then Governor of Malta. To win a Victoria Cross is indeed an extraordinary feat. Lord De L'Isle is deserving of full commendation in relation to that action which led to his being awarded a Victoria Cross. I salute that particular singular action of great bravery, as I salute the contribution he made both Great Britain and in Australia in the roles he played, and particularly in in his role as Governor General between and 1965. He was not in any way, of shape or form a controversial Governor General. He made a positive and capable recontribution to the high office of in Governor General. I might say that he as was highly competent in everything he I extend condolences on behalf of the National Party to members of his family and to his friends. I again commend and salute the contribution he made as a soldier; as a parliamentarian, both in the House of Commons and the House of Lords; as a Minister of the as a businessman; and also as a GrenGovernor-General of Australia.",26
17,Mr SINCLAIR,HONOURABLE VISCOUNT," Mr Speaker, the occasions on which we speak about the Governor General, as I remarked in respect of the last valedictory, are rare; how much more so is it when we talk about two of the bereaved? The death of Lord De L'Isle is something that probably does not mean a great deal perhe sonally to many of us. Yet not only were those of us who were members of this place at that time very conscious of his outstanding career in the Army and in the British Parliament, and of course his general background as a member of the British aristocracy, but also we knew him very much as a warm, kind, delightful that man. In fact, he had such common sense that he even bought a property in New England. I do not know whether his family still holds that property, but that action reflected very much the intent of Lord De AnL'lsle to become an Australian once he I did not know him well. I was a very junior Minister, having been sworn in as Minister for Social Services back in February 1965, and I confess that I did not spend that much time in his company. But when I appeared at Executive Council and on other occasions, I found him a delightful man. Of course, I met him subsequently in New England. I know that he also became a very significant businessman. I think at one stage he might well have been one of the highest paid of all the British business leaders after his period here as Governor General. Like Sir John Kerr, in my view, Lord De L'lsle leaves a very notable mark in history. As I have suggested, I suspect he will be the last British Governor General. He was one who brought with him something of the heritage of the past. He came in a period after the illness and subsequent death of Lord Morrison; he came in a period when it was still fashionable to be British to the boot heels; he came in a period when Australia was still slowly relinquishing those British ties. They have now gone and I think, in the nature of Lord De L'lsle's contribution, it was not that they should go because of his term as Governor General but in spite of it, for he did make a personal and public contribution that was exemplary, albeit uncontroversial. I think that he was a person who Australia can regard as having filled a position in a succession of governors and governors-general who came from the United Kingdom, who represented that former colonial parent and who transferred to us, we hope, many of the better elements of democracy which we see in this system and which are now part of our House of Representatives and Senate system. To his widow and to his family, I extend my deep personal sympathy and that of my wife. He was a great soldier, a great Englishman and also, I believe, a great Australian.",27
18,Mr DOWNER,HONOURABLE VISCOUNT,"I would like to join in the motion commemorating the life of an outstanding man who contributed a great deal to the United Kingdom and also, as others have said, to Australia during his period as Governor General. Many have made the point that one of the notable aspects of his period here was that he was the last British Governor General of Australia. By 1961, when he was appointed, I think there was probably a fairly broad view in Australia that that tradition was one which had pretty much served its time. Indeed, I understand that, following his appointment, there was some community controversy about an Englishman filling that role. Despite that controversy and the occasional barbs that were directed towards him, not surprisingly Lord De L'lsle conducted himself in the role of Governor General with great distinction and, perhaps more than that, a sense of propriety and a sense of dignity. As the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) pointed out, Lord De L'lsle went through a very difficult personal time during his period as. Gover-or-General when his wife died, yet he continued to serve for another 21/2 years. But it was to his credit that he developed such a great affection for Australia in his time as Governor General. As the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) said, he bought a property in Australia, in New England. He subsequently visited Australia many times after his retirement as Governor General. Some people characterised him during his period here as a sort of upper class fop or Colonel Blimp but, as we have heard already, he was certainly none of those things. He was a man who won a Victoria Cross in the heroic way that we have heard this afternoon; a man, too, who had a range of unusual political views. For example, at a time in Australia when the whole issue of British membership of the European Community, or the prospect of membership of the European Community, was regarded most unfavourably, Lord De L'lsle on one occasion spoke out in support of British membership of the Community and aroused a great deal of controversy in Australia as a result of doing that. But it has to be said that, despite the disadvantages we as a nation have suffered because of that membership, Lord De L'lsle was right in pointing to what was inevitably part of Britain's subsequent destiny. He was also a man who held the view, despite being a member of the House of Lords, that the House of Lords should be abolished and replaced by a senate. Perhaps people on the other side of the House would find the idea of a senate not a great deal more attractive than the House of Lords. But the fact is that he had, by British standards, very progressive views on that sort of issue and certainly never took the view that the sun would never set on the British - mpire. He was somebody who understood the inevitability of history. Lord De L'lsle was very kind to my family, and to my father in particular, who was friendly with him. On many occasions we as a family enjoyed his hospitality at his wonderful home-almost a palace-Penshurst Place in Kent. In conclusion, I extend my sympathy to his wife and to his children.

24,Mr DAWKINS,EMPLOYMENT,"I have on many occasions declined to make any speculation about the level of unemployment which is before us. I have indicated, however, that the employment figures tend to be the last to move during a slowdown. They are also the last to pick up during the period when the economy will come out of its current decline. So I will not be making any speculation about that. As far as the first part of the question is concerned, I want to reiterate what I said to the Prime Minister: that there is no difference between me and him, or the Treasurer, on the question of the way in which the Government is running the exchange rate policy. We are, of course, well aware of the relevance of the exchange rate to the broad, competitive ecopolicies of Australian industry, and is constantly under the attention of the Government. I want to say particularly that the statewhich the Government made on 12 March was, by any standards, an historic statement. It was one which I am happy to have been associated with, and indeed happy to have been a joint architect of. The statement of 12 March finally off the poison of protection inflicted on Australia through the poston World War II policies of those who are giggling opposite. More than anything, those poisonous policies held back the of a competitive Australia. is the fact that only this Government and only Labor governments generally in the postwar period have been prepared to act to reduce the level of protection, therefore moving Australia towards a more competitive position. I want to make it perfectly clear that nothing I said on the weekend was a commentary on past or current policies. I have been intimately involved in the development of those policies and resile from nothing. However we have to recognise that when we look towards an Australia which will essentially be tariff-free and which will be uncluttered by the kind of protective prescriptions which the Opposition has had for Australia for almost the entire postwar period, we have to do it with a view to developing the competitiveness and trade performance of Australia. One important thing which the Opposition has to understand is that it is led by a man who takes for his inspiration the far right zealots from north America and from Britain, both of whose economies are no model for Australia whatsoever. Those right wing zealots have prescribed policies that not only are damaging for Britain and the United States of America but also would be even more damaging for Australia if they were ever embraced. We in Australia must engineer the kind of policies appropriate for a competitive Australia, an Australia which has shrugged off the poison of protection and which has an overwhelming requirement to improve its competitiveness and trade performance. For that reason I am pleased that the Government will keep these matters under review, as the Prime Minister has indicated to me, and that will be a continuing matter of concern to this Government.

26,Mr DAWKINS,EMPLOYMENT,"However, there is no comfort to be drawn by those opposite from anything I have said. In fact those who are beguiled by the orthodoxy in this country are mainly on the other side of this House. Of course, they are the ones who are in the process of developing policies which would be highly destructive for Australia. They believe in change at the point of a gun, trying to gun-butt Australian workers into the kind of change which we recognise is necessary for this country. On the other hand, we have pursued policies of orderly change, which can be embraced by the work force and by management in this country, a process of change which we intend to superintend for many years to come. MIDDLE EAST: KURDS",30
27,Dr THEOPHANOUS,EMPLOYMENT,I address my questIon to the Prime Minister. What is the Government doing to help the Kurdish people who are now the victims of the brutality of the regime of Saddam Hussein?,30
28,Mr HAWKE,EMPLOYMENT,"Mr Speaker, the Government-Mr Downer-Now you are crying for the Kurds.",30
29,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYMENT,Order! The honourable member for Mayo will cease interjecting.,30
30,Mr HAWKE,EMPLOYMENT,"The Government has been, as I would imagine all members of this House have been, appalled by the plight of the Kurdish people fleeing from the brutality which they fear-obviously with great justification-from the army of Sad dam Hussein. We support the United Nations Security Council resolution No. 688, which condemns Iraq's repression of its citizens and calls on the United Nations and its member states to support humanitarian relief efforts. The resolution insists that Iraq allow access by humanitarian organisations to monitor the situation and it asks the Secretary-General to investigate and to report. As an international community we must make it plain to Saddam Hussein that the rehabilitation of his country will depend entirely - m ho,:"" he acts towards his own people, mcludmg the Kurds. The international community should obviously do everything practicable to persuade or compel Saddam Hussein to fulfil his promises to allow Iraq's Kurds to return peacefully to their homes. As some honourable members will have noti-ed, suggestions have been made by PreSIdent Ozal of Turkey and by Prime Minister Major of Great Britain that an internationally protected sanctuary for Kurds be established in Iraq. Quite clearly, a lot of issues would have to be resolved before the practicability of those sorts of proposals could be established. As an Australian government, we would certainly support any practical and internationally acceptable proposals to help the Kurds in their present desperate situation. Of course, the immediate priority is to alleviate the plight of those Kurds who have fled their homes in fear. My colleague, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, will be announcing today that Australia will contribute $1 m to help these people. Mr Downer-He has just taken the announcement away from him.",30
31,Mr HAWKE,EMPLOYMENT,"It seems that nothing is beneath the capacity of those opposite to reduce an important issue to a cheap political interchange. I would have thought that if there were one issue on which they would be able to restrain themselves it would be in regard to this desperate plight. The miserable interjections from the honourable member for Mayo do nothing but reflect total discredit upon him. The money will be passed through the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. We trust that other nations will join with Australia in making sucIi contributions and that, both in this way and by the pressure of international opinion, the continuing tragedy of these people will be brought to an end.",31
32,Dr HEWSON,EMPLOYMENT,"Mr Speaker, with your indulgence I would like to associate this side of politics with the remarks made by the Prime Minister as to the plight of the Kurds. We emphasise the need for urgency in dealing with various proposals that are coming forward relating to their plight and to reduce the pain and hardship that they are now suffering. NA",31
33,Mr TIM FISCHER,EMPLOYMENT,"I concur with those remarks. I direct my question to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. In order to maximise employment prospects for all Australians, should the accord be modified to take in the employer's side of the industry equation? If there is no difference between the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister, why was he carpeted yesterday in Cabinet?",31
34,Mr DAWKINS,EMPLOYMENT,"It is a bit of a joke for the Opposition to be asking questions about the accord, a document which has been supremely successful in developing not only an approach to wage fixation in this country but also an approach to overall economic development in changing the profit shares, allowing for the capacity for investment, and so on. Of course, it is this accord which, under any guise, the Opposition is committed to abolish and replace with a quite chaotic system where it would, quite deliberately, set about on a process of confrontation within the entire industrial sector-employers and employees alike. Members of the Opposition cannot reach agreement with anyone in this country about the kind of industrial relations policy they would pursue. On the other hand, we have a policy which has been more successful in dealing with wages than any other policy that has operated in Australia or any other policy that has operated in the free world, in the industrial world. The fact of the matter is that our performance on wages has been better than almost any other country in the industrialised world. It is this successful policy, along with many of our other successful policies, that the Opposition can only choose to sneer at. The future development of the accord is something which will be for us to develop. Many of my colleagues have indicated the way in which the accord can be developed to take account of emerging circumstances, including the incorporation of the employers where that seems desirable and appropriate. NA NA",31
35,Mr COURTICE,ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM,"Has the Prime Minister received a response to his letter to President Bush concerning the effect of the United States export enhancement program (EEP) on Australian farmers? If so, in the light of the United States President's response, is the Government concerned about calls to link the ioint facilities with United States trade policy?",31
36,Mr HAWKE,ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM,"I have received a response from President Bush in which he assured me that: All possible care will be taken to avoid disruption of traditional markets, where Australia, as a nonsubsidising exporter, has significant interests. This includes Middle Eastern markets in the post-war period. These assurances from the highest level in the United States are, of course, a welcome reinforcement of the undertakings that were given to the bilateral mission to the United States in March led by Dr Blewett and graced by members of the Opposition. While, of course, what we have received in those assurances does not meet all our concerns about the export enhancement program, the assurances do clearly represent a significant response by the United States Government to the concerns we have raised about the EEP. One can imagine, therefore, our surprise that the Leader of the National Party of Australia should have attempted to escalate the issue by suggesting the possibility that the Australian-United States joint facilities might be closed in retaliation against United States trade policies. I was even more surprised, of course, by the Opposition Leader's reaction to his colleague's suggestion. But, after what we have come to see from the leadership of the Leader of the Opposition, perhaps I should not have been so surprised. I remind the Leader of the Opposition after all of what his coalition colleague has called for. The Leader of the National Party has called into question the future of our most important bilateral relationship and of our most significant strategic alliance. What has the Opposition Leader done? He has responded to this proposal by giving us his personal views. He has told us-this is Dr Hewson, the great, strong, hairy-chested, tough Leader of the Opposition: My position is that I do not make any linkage We know the Leader of the Opposition's position; but I think he should tell us what the Opposition policy is. We are not concerned with knowing what his position is. We would like to know what the Opposition policy is. We want to know whether the L-ader of the Opposition has the leadership to establish his predisposition, his predilection-the latest little bubblegum that he has blown out into the air. Is it more than a predilection-more than a personal position-or is he going to smack down the Leader of the National Party and say, 'This man does not make policy. My position as the Leader of the Opposition is that we will not under any circumstances as an opposition countenance the introduction of that element of the United States-Australian joint facilities into this issue'. NA",32
37,Mr REITH,EXCHANGE RATE,"I ask the Minister for Employment, Education and Training: in order to maximise employment prospects for all Australians, does the Government need to be prepared to sacrifice other macro-economic objectives to ensure that the exchange rate is not seriously out of alignment for any sustained period of time? If there is no difference between him and the Prime Minister on this issue, why was he so delighted that the exchange rate issue would be placed on the Cabinet agenda?",32
38,Mr DAWKINS,EXCHANGE RATE,"What I said was that the issue of competitiveness and trade development generally would be placed on the Cabinet agenda and that there was a recognition within the Government that, of course, the exchange rate is a relevant consideration to broad competitive economic policies for Australian industry. It does not take much wit to recognise that point, particularly in a circumstance where the Australian economy is more exposed to the world. The problem with the Opposition is that it is so replete with its simplistic solutions and its simplistic prescriptions which it has imported from North America, and from Britain particularly, that it has not given an ounce of consideration to the way in which policies should be developed here in Australia. What I was doing was looking forward to a period when the Australian economy would be quite different-when the economic imperatives would be quite different as a result of the historic decision we took to dismantle the protective barriers which the Opposition's predecessors so gleefully put in place during the postwar period. These are matters which are properly before the Government. They will continue to be before the Governmen'tand I will have much pleasure in participating in those discussions. NA",32
39,Mr ONEIL,WHEAT INDUSTRY,"My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Over recent weeks the Minister has received submissions from various States to assist wheat farmers via a guaranteed minimum price (GMP), with Western Australia moving to institute its own scheme. Can the Minister outline the problems with this approach and indicate any better alternatives for State governments to assist their farmers?",33
40,Mr KERIN,WHEAT INDUSTRY,"I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. First of all, with respect to the Western Australian guaranteed minimum price, I will not go into the possible constitutional and legal impediments to this. We will await a detailed proposal from Western Australia. I do not know how it would work in with the Australian Wheat Board's arrangements, but the Western Australian Farmers Federation should be well pleased with the Western Australian Premier and should now exercise a bit of leadership and control its own members. . The honourable gentleman asked about problems in giving a GMP. The main problem is that this is not the correct approach to the situation now in the wheat industry. It would be handy if we got a few facts on the table. Rain-and the time of rain-would be the main determinant of the size and composition of the winter crop. Secondly, the price picture today is rather different from when the agricultural hype started. I will take the Wheat Board's weekly figures on prices of 10 per cent Australian standard white wheat. On 8 February that price was quoted as $151.98. Since then it has gone up every week. At 2 April the price stood' at $169.70. So what we have been sayingthat there could be a very short downturn that in the fortunes of the wheat industrymay well prove true. We also now have a far better estimate of the world wheat crop. In the year ahead that will be about 40 million tonnes down on last year. The stock to use ratio is good. Trade is up. The United States is dry, where plantings are down 11 per cent; they are also down 9 per cent in Canada. Plantings of soya bean and maize are also down, which have implications for the stock feeding industry. At the end of January the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) said that there was a 50 per cent probability of the price being $150 or more. The figures I have just cited lend evidence to that view. The third thing we have to look at is the international market and understand that the world wheat market is far different from, particularly, 10 years ago when the US market propped up that market with the loan rate, and since the US and the European Community have got into export subsidisation in a big way. The international market now is high risk. Two-thirds of it for Australia represents credit markets, and we already have $1.1 billion at risk in terms of credit facilitation by the Government. As well as that, we underwrite the Wheat Board's borrowings-by about $1 billion of the 1990-91 crop. That allows the Wheat Board to borrow and that gives advantages to the wheat industry in savings and costs. We have also recently provided additional credit for the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which has enabled us to get a contract of one million tonnes. The agricultural hype is a demand for a guaranteed minimum price of $151. With the situation in the wool industry, if it rains, the Government's assessment is that that would have been too much. If it had been $122, it would have been too little. If we had split the difference, that would have been cynical. The fact is that only two or three times since World War II has the crop been 20 per cent lower than the prevailing average-and the price was not the cause on those two or three occasions. Actually, with the more volatile cropping situation, production of other crops may be sensible. The fourth thing is that the guaranteed minimum price approach does not target those in need of assistance. If we just look at some of the figures-I accept that the figures are not perfect and that some are mainly as a result of past years' poolsthe farm cash operating surplus for wheat this year, 1990-91, is about $53,000, compared with $22,000 for all farming, and $5,700 for sheep. Most of the noise is coming from Western Australia. The farm cash operating surplus there for the average wheat farm is $87,000 in 1990-91 compared with minus $6,000 for sheep. Year by year these figures change. In New South Wales the average wheat farmer had a farm cash operating surplus of $70,000 in 1989-90, but this year only $27,000. As I have said, the figures are not perfect but, if one takes them year by year-these are ABARE figures-one can plot the changes in the direction of farm incomes. Another thing is that $190m was offered by the Wheat Board for the 198889 pool at $30 per tonne and only $50m of that was picked up by the industry. That does not indicate that all the farmers are strapped for cash. If we look at the debt structure of the wheat industry-this is where the problem is-we see that at one end of the scale, the bottom 25 per cent of farmers who normally have negati ve income on the estimates by ABARE, it was actually worse than some two years ago. We have been speaking to officials, including rural adjustment scheme (RAS) officials in the States, the banks and the finance people. Taking just Western Australia and South Australia, in Western Australia, people with 70 per cent plus debt to equity ratio are in trouble. The rest are being supported by the banks. In South Australia, 70 per cent are assessed as being in credit. Of the remaining 30 per cent, 10 per cent are in trouble. We can look at these figures and at regions and, again, it always comes down to the fact that the rural adjustment scheme is the best way to help these wheat farmers. The final point is that we cannot beat the treasuries of the US and the EEC and we do have a position in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, but that is not the main reason we have taken the decision we have. The other thing I need to point out to the farmers who are lobbying so heavily is that a guaranteed minimum price will not help farmers who need increased cash flow to plant. If there is any pay-out it will be in 1993-94. It may, however, encourage the banks to expand credit. It has been put to me that the banks are not lending to wheat growers because of the uncertainty about rural adjustment scheme funds. Again, there can be only the most general relationship between a decision on RAS part B and bank lending, for only the individual rural adjustment State authorities can decide which clients will receive assistance. On a final point, rural adjustment part A, which is about farm rehabilitation, farm build-up and so on, and part C, which is by way of an income support measure, are funded totally by the Commonwealth. Part B is funded on a dollar for dollar basis by the Commonwealth Government and the States. That answers the final part of the honourable gentleman's question. It is usual for the State governments to approach the Commonwealth. No approach has been made. At 31 December 1990, New South Wales had $38m in rural adjustment scheme reserves, so there is a capacity for the States to act if they want to do so, rather than grandstanding and trying to blame the Commonwealth. The submission I will be taking forward to Cabinet will deal with funding for 199192. The State authorities assure me that there is no need for funds in the present financial year. I am not going to go into the details of that. I am sure honourable members will appreciate, given the gravity of the situation in the wool industry, that it is sensible to put up both the adjustment scheme and the wool industry submission at the same time. The Cabinet decisions will not involve immediate assistance. Therefore, they cannot be related to any individual planting decision. That is why I say, finally, that rain and the business decisions in light of the now available evidence by farmers and banksnot old information that some of the agricultural politicians are trading on-will determine how much wheat goes in the ground.

41,Mr DOWNER,EXCHANGE RATE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training.

43,Mr SNOWDON,HEALTH AND SOCIAL WELFARE,Can the Minister for Community Services and Health inform the House of the significance of the outcomes of the recent joint meeting of health and social welfare Ministers?,35
44,Mr HOWE,HEALTH AND SOCIAL WELFARE,"I thank the honourable member for the Northern Territory for his question. Arising from the Premiers Conferences, particularly last November's Special Premiers Conference dealing with the question of Federal-State relations, there has developed a joint Commonwealth-State agenda which clearly relates to a number of issues relevant to my portfolio, particularly the links between the Commonwealth, the States and local government and their implications for health and welfare. The agenda arising from the Premiers Conference and in these areas is significant because it recognises the essential need for connections to be made between areas of service delivery in health and welfare-that is, to see the various programs as linked programs and looked at in policy terms, rather than seeing aged rural care and health as areas that have no intrinsic policy relationship, to recognise that there is a policy relationship and then in the light of that policy relationship to go on to examine it as between the Commonwealth and the States. It is an approach which is visionary in that it aims to forge those links by ensuring an effective inter-relationship between the functional reviews of health and aged care and take into account at the same time relevant housing and other related issues. It cuts across some of the functional divisions which exist not only within portfolios but alsQ between portfolios and enables us to look at the relationship between those functions as between levels of government. In order to achieve this objective, at a joint ministerial conference last month health and welfare Ministers agreed to establish an overarching committee of Commonwealth and State officers to report to health and welfare Ministers at another joint meeting in early September. This positive agenda arose from the goodwill and enthusiasm .of all participants. The process has been afforded a precise and constructive form. Its general objective to streamline responsibilities and functions between levels of government will be achieved in the interests of cooperative and complementary government process. Its specific goal to take a broader view of those opportunities afforded by the reviews is solely possible on the basis of looking separately at health and aged care and will be achieved in the interests of all Australians. The tangible benefit will be enhanced delivery of health and community care. "" In addition, the overarching committee, which meets for the first time tomorrow, will commission task forces on health and aged care and commission work looking at program linkages, including home and community care, disability and housing related issues. The committee will liaise with the national health strategy, the Macklin review, and the mid-term aged care review to ensure that the committee's work is driven by sound policy decisions. Consistent with a partnership approach, the task force will be chaired by the States and Territories as well as the Commonwealth. In conclusion, I indicate that this process is one that I believe can meet the expectations of State governments as well as those of the Commonwealth. It is one that proceeds from policy but goes on to examine in some detail the various administrative arrangements. It is impossible to achieve significant reform in this area without looking at the detail of programs. I think we have already seen that, in terms of disability, where Ministers responsible at Commonwealth and State levels have been able to achieve art understanding of how they can divide their responsibilities to both improve levels of equity, as well as efficiency, and establish the appropriate linkages that can be formed at both Commonwealth and State levels. This area of reform is not an easy one. It is certainly not going to be achieved by some stroke of a magic wand. It will be achieved only by very detailed examination of how programs work, particularly the interfaces that exist between the Commonwealth and the States, so that in the end we get much better programs delivered in a much more effectively coordinated way to achieve much greater equity and fairness and better outcomes for people in the health and welfare systems.

45,Mr HOWARD,EXCHANGE RATE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education· and Training and is supplementary to those already asked of the Minister. When he spoke at the weekend of intervention in relation to the exchange rate, did he have in mind what is known in central bank parlance as a smoothing operation by the Reserve Bank or did he have in mind intervention to affect the longer term trend of the rate?",36
46,Mr DA WKINS,EXCHANGE RATE,"The honourable member has listened to the answers that I have given. I have said already that I was not making a commentary on \Jast or current practice of policy; I hav- said that in relation to the running of the exchange rate I have no dispute with the Treasurer or the Prime Minister. The honourable member for Bennelong will know, if he has read the speech, as I assume he has, that I was not talking in specific terms about deliberate intervention in this area; I was talking about the relationship between the exchange rate and Australia's competitiveness generally, particularly in relation to industry policy. Those are the matters that are on the Government's agenda and will continue to be so, and that is where I will confine my remarks about these matters. I can tell the honourable member one thing: if there is someone who is linked to the most discredited policy in relation to exchange rate invention, it is he, because he, along with the Leader of the Opposition-who was then one of his acolytes and, apparently, an adviser-were the ones who apparently used to sit around in the Cabinet room devising how they would manipulate the exchange rate of Australia in a way that was so damaging and so destructive to Australia's economic fortunes. Mr Downer-What is the answer to the question about intervention?",36
47,Mr SPEAKER,EXCHANGE RATE,Order! The honourable member for Mayo!,36
48,Mr DAWKINS,EXCHANGE RATE,"The reason they had to resort to that policy was that they had no wages policy and no inflation policy. So the only thing that they could do was try to manipulate and, in a way, grossly inflate the value of the Australian dollar, with awful consequences for employment in this country. If there is one person who is totally discredited in terms of exchange rate policy, it is the honourable member for Bennelong; and there is not the faintest chance that we would ever take any notice of what he had to say on this or, indeed, on anything else.

55,Dr HEWSON,EXCHANGE RATE,"My question-in view of the Prime Minister's last remark that I am not doing much with it-is addressed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister agree that Ministers should not speak outside their portfolios and that, in doing so, they breach the basic principle of collective decision making in Cabinet? Further, what measures is the Prime Minister going to take in future against Ministers who breach Cabinet solidarity? Why has the Prime Minister not taken such measures in the past?",37
56,Mr HAWKE,EXCHANGE RATE,"I appreciate this tough question from the tough Leader of the Opposition, who in respect of his own people has exercised such dramatic, draconian and dictatorial leadership. I am in the fortunate position of being able to say, without any contradiction from the Leader of the Opposition, that the great strength of this Government from 1983 up to and including the present time has been the strength of its front bench-aided, of course, I might say, by a magnificent back bench. This is not merely my judgment, as honourable members opposite will recall. None other than the Leader of the Opposition himself, as recently as 1987, speaking basically of the same people, paid us the well-deserved compliment-and it cannot be repeated too often: The Hawke Government is very professional, and is probably the best front bench since World War II. To that we can only say, 'Hear, hear!'. Mr Snowdon-Who said that?",37
57,Mr HAWKE,EXCHANGE RATE,"Dr HEWSON - Business Review Weekly, 15 May 1987. There are benefits that come from having such a talented Ministry as I have. It is inevitable, of course, when one has a Ministry with the talents that I enjoy that at times, with such strong thinking and strong acting people, there will emerge some slight difference of emphasis on particular directions of policy. When that emerges, I try to see what I can do to harness their enthusiasm. I have done that effectively since 1983. To coin a phrase, the test of the pudding is in the eating. In 1983, 1984, 1987 and 1990 the people made the choice as to what sort of leadership, what sort of performance, they liked by choosing between my leadership and the harnessing .of my talents and what those opposite have tried to put up in successive elections. Those opposite have not done too well and, on the evidence of the present efforts of the current Leader of the Opposition, they will not do any better in 1993. Dr Bob Woods-Look at the polls.",37
58,Mr HAWKE,EXCHANGE RATE,"We hear the plaintive cry, 'Look at the polls'. Those opposite should start looking at the poll that counts in 1993. They will be back where they have been put every time by the Australian people, and they have been put back there every time because, firstly, they have been lacking in leadership and, secondly, they have been lacking in any capacity on the front bench at all. Look at them. Let us look at the alternative Government. Whom would we have as the alternative Treasurer? We would have that intellectual vacuum, the honourable member for Flinders. But we must say this for the honourable member for Flinders: he is the only man to have spent 12 months in the job and know less than Andrew Peacock when he was shadow Treasurer. Not a bad performance! What about the shadow Minister for resources? We have just had to deal with him. This is the man who would put in jeopardy our basic relationship with the United States. It would be an absolute disaster. And so we can go through them. Let us look at the shadow Minister for trade, the honourable member for Mayo. He is well known for his grasp of trade issues and his ability to place foot in mouth without displacing the silver spoon. He has a tremendous capacity! I am treating this matter, in a sense, with the levity it deserves. It is a matter of record since 1983 that this Government is blessed with an array of talent. At times I have been slightly embarrassed by their exuberance when they have gone a little bit beyond their allotted path of portfolio. But if I have to pay the price of that talent straying at times on this side, that is a price I am mightily prepared to pay-compared with the barrenness that stares at us from the Opposition. WOOL: GENE SHEARS NA",37
59,Mr LEE,TECHNOLOGY,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Science and Technology. It refers to the development of gene shears technology by the Commonwealth Scienvast tific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), which, the Minister would be aware, was the subject of a recent proAustralia's gram on the Australian Broadcasting Cornot poration. Is the Minister aware of claims that Australia has missed out on reaping the benefits of this technology? Can the Minister advise the House whether these claims are correct?",38
60,Mr CREAN,TECHNOLOGY,"I thank the honourable if member for his question. I am aware the claims. Of course, they are wrong. The arrangement entered into by the CSIRO, short of being able to obtain an Australian equity partner, will ensure that the bulk of the research that has led to the discovery of the breakthrough in respect of gene shears will continue to be conducted in Australia, despite what many reports have said. The second point that should be noted is that, should an Australian partner subsequently find that it is interested-and I believe that will happen-there is flexibility in the arrangement entered into, there is the opportunity for a rearrangement of the agreement to enable that equity partner to enter. The third point I make, because it really goes to the nub of this question, is that Australia has to be about not just making the discovery but ensuring that we get the benefit of the discovery in terms of our trade balance position. That means that we have to place greater emphasis on ensuring that we control the capacity by which the benefit is commercialised for this country. In that regard, if there are no Australian partners prepared to take up the challenge, then I do not fund-amentally disagree with the view that we seek foreign partners in circumstances in which we attach conditionality to those foreign partners entering. In the case of the gene shears agreement it should be noted that there are in fact two foreign partners, one of which has been involved since 1988. This is a French company called Groupe Limagrain, which has extensive international experience in agricultural activities. Johnson and Johnson, which is the new partner about to join, is an international company that has experience in the pharmaceutical industries. Gene shears provides the basis upon which both of these industries, for benefit, can grow. We must shun the international arrangements that are presented by companies that have the international networks and the marketing expertise. In fact, we have to embrace those approaches where they are lacking here. Of course, it would be better we were able to do it with Australianof grown companies. But if we cannot, and if we simply ignore it and whinge without recognising the opportunities that are presented by strategic international alliances, we will simply miss the boat altogether.

NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",39
63,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTRY,"I have received a letter from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The consistent failure of the Prime Minister to exercise leadership and discipline over his Ministry in the face of Australia's current economic crisis. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places .. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",39
64,Dr HEWSON,MINISTRY,"Today the Ausfive tralian economy is in the midst of worse recession in 60 years. There are record levels of personal bankruptcies, cord levels of small, medium and probais bly large sized business failures, and people are being driven from their farms in increasing numbers as a result of worse rural crisis since the 19 30s. We are threatened with rapidly rising unemployquite ment of perhaps 9 per cent later this year and 10 per cent early next year. Some private forecasters in universities have going as high as 12 per cent. Yet in the midst of those difficult cumstances-the most difficult in the memory of anybody in this Parliamentnow we have a completely directionless and leaderless government. The Prime Minisand ter (Mr Hawke) has sh.own an absolutely appalling, and indeed an alarming, lack of leadership in the midst of that crisis. He cannot provide any sense of policy education. direction at all. He has no capacity, despite· his often heard boasts, to take tough decisions needed to turn this counspeech try around. Perhaps, most importantly, the concern we have that in the continurection ing and increasingly public debates among his Ministers, which go to the very heart of the so-called economic strategy of this Government, there are fundamental, irreconcilable differences. Yet the Prime Minister cannot bring them into line. When a policy decision is taken, it is the third or fourth best option that manages to get put up. The Prime Minister shows no leadership and no sense of direction in most of this. He sits back and lets Ministers run amuck and increasingly nigrate our international reputation because of the Government's economic management and because of their behavface iour. Ever since the last election this ernment has limped from one crisis to the next without any sense of direction. The latest breach of Cabinet solidarity which shows the depths of the differences in thinking within the Government was of course the speech last weekend of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) to a factional meeting in Victoria. This is the third such Dawkins speech in the space of the last months. We should not forget that at the one stage-no longer now-John Dawkins was the self-appointed campaign manreager for the Treasurer (Mr Keating). He also the fellow who went into the Prime Minister's office in 1988 and told him that it was time to move on; that his days the were numbered. He is also the Minister who has bungled his portfolio of education dramatically. The most recent example of that has been the English language intensive courses for overseas it students (ELICOS) debacle, which the Prime Minister has known about but done cirnothing about. The Minister has bungled the education policy to the point that we face a lack of excellence in education, a decline in the standards in education a decline because of the ELICOS-cumeducation debacle-a decline in what was potentially a significant export industry for this country, namely, the export of The Minister consistently speaks out the and criticises the Government. In his last weekend he criticised just is about the lot-the overall thrust and diof the Government's economic policies. He particularly singled out three or four key bits: industry policy, wages policy and, most notably, exchange rate policy. He has this simple minded concept that he is attacking market interventionists in defence of interventionist policies and he has used the exchange rate as an example. It is instructive to show honourable members the tenor and the academic quality of the man. In the behis ginning of his speech he refers· to the deradical French Prime Minister of the both 1950s, Mendes-France, who once observed that 'to govern is to choose'. At value, one would think that perhaps Govhe is heading down the same path; he is going to compare interventionist policies, market policies and so on. The Minister said: However, the characteristic of Australian govern- when ments in the post-war era . . . has been to dither or do nothing much at all . . . He said that the Labor Party has not been faced with that choice and cannot be ject to the charge of being timid ditherers. coalition. It bothered me as to where Mr Dawkins got the quote 'to govern is to choose'. it happened, when we read the Economist we found the complete quote from which that small section was taken. The Econotake mist of 30 March 1991 quoted the radical former French Prime Minister Pierre Mendes-Farance as stating 'to govern is to choose'. I agree with that. 'To appear to be unable to choose is to appear to unable to govern'. He left off the last part of the quote-which is, after all, exactly what we have observed this Government doing in the course of the last 12 months. Remember the election campaign slogan, 'If you can't govern yourselves, you can't govern the country'? That has an eerie similarity to the statement Farance, has it not? It has also been consistently proved by the Prime Minister and his Government ever since 24 March last year when they won government. They did not expect to win government. They had no sense of direction and no sense vision beyond 24 March. So we have lived from one crisis to another and we are in the midst of the worse recession that this country has seen in 60 years. In those circumstances the Government can only be considered as out of control with a Prime Minister simply incapable of exercising the necessary leadership. Prime Minister's idea of leadership is bringing people together, as he said 1983. He brings them together now quite often in his room under the axe-minister system. He tries to talk to them about point of view versus their point of view. He thinks that is leadership. That might have worked at the Australian Council Trade Unions (ACTU) when he was waitits ing for the last day of a dispute for a solution to become evident before he grabbed it with both hands, ran out public and took credit for it. It may have worked when the Prime Minister was Mr Seventy-three Per Cent in the polls, but it does not work any more; it does riot work he is Mr Thirty-eight Per Cent. Acto choose cording to the Roy Morgan polls, his Government is at 33 per cent; the Saulwick poll has the Government down at sub30 per cent, some 24 points behind the For the first time in his life, the Prime As Minister has to choose: does he want to be loved or does he want to be respected as the sort of Prime Minister who can the decisions that this country needs? Is this a government run by' Bob Hawke, or is this a government where, whenever a Minister decides to take a pot shot at the Government on any particular day, he be will go ahead and do it anyway? Today could be the first day since the electionsthe Prime Minister can stand up and prove me wrong-where the Prime Minister can show that he has the capacity to provide the leadership that this country needs. He can begin by sacking both of the Ministers sitting immediately behind by Mendeshim on the front bench. Let us just go back to the last election campaign and think of what we have seen. It started soon after the election campaign when Senator Peter Walsh, who had been left out of the Cabinet, immediately conof demned the Government. For what? For lying about the recession. Even on elecnow tion day the Prime Minister s(:lid, 'We need not fear a recession'. He was either incredibly ignorant or incredibly dishonest. I will leave it to honourable members to choose because we have now slipped into the worse recession that this country The has seen in 60 years. Senator Walsh was soon followed by a in host of other Ministers who have spoken out consistently against government policy. For example, in May Senator Button his publicly admitted that Australia's economic prospects were grim, that the Government had missed vital opportunities of for micro-reform, and that it had wasted third term. I could not agree more. That is a very accurate assessment of what we had seen in the course of the third in term of the Hawke-Keating Government. That prompted the now famous, 'Blast at Button by Keating', where Keating took it upon himself to do the Prime Minister's job. In the process he declared that he was the real hairy-chested reformer of the Hawke-Keating Government; he was the guy responsible for all the policies, not the Prime Minister. In doing that he, too, breached Cabinet solidarity because in his attack on Senator Button he revealed details of car industry plan discussions in Cabinet in defence of his position. This was another breach of Cabinet solidarity. What happened? The Prime Minister failed to act. That did not stop Senator Button. On each occasion Senator Button has spoken, the Prime Minister has failed to act. However, the Prime Minister did publicly warn Senator Button that there should be no repeat performances. Obviously, Senator Button listened because he kept them down to about once a month after that. At the time, the Prime Minister said that the Minister had shown too much self-indulgence and that was why in the future they would be sacked for speaking out of turn. I can hardly climb over the pile of names of Ministers who have since spoken out of turn and beyond their portfolio responsibilities, and yet not one has been sacked. In June we heard John Dawkins, in his first foray into the field, attacking the Government for jeopardising the economy through clumsy handling of environmental guidelines. Again, the Prime Minister did nothing. In August Ros Kelly and Alan Griffiths, in the first of one of the great forays-",40
65,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTRY,Order! I ask the Leader of the Opposition to refer to Ministers by their appropriate titles.,42
66,Dr HEWSON,MINISTRY,"The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) began their long running, still simmering feud over forests and environmental considerations. Again, the Prime Minister did nothing. When the Treasurer's minders started floating the idea that there was a Keating takeover in the offing at about the time of the last Budget, again the Prime Minister did nothing. On the Telecom issue which blew up back in September, the Treasurer's minders started counter leaks to the leaks from the office of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) concerning the Prime Minister's failure to show any leadership. There were more public views on that issue than there were options being discussed in the Cabinet at· that time. Again, the Prime Minister failed to do anything. In a brilliant display of leadership at that time what did he do? He settled for the third best option-he decided to take the efficient Overseas Telecommunications Commission vehicle, bury it in Telecom, .and try to unload Aussat to some unsuspecting buyer as the basis of a second player in the telecommunications industry. We can go on through to the end of the year. In November the Minister for Employment, Education and Training started his attack on the need for an interventionist industry policy. He criticised the Prime Minister. In December the Treasurer, in that now incredibly famous speech to the Press Club, attacked us for never liaving seen any leadership in this country. He chose to mount that attack at about the time of the Prime Minister's sixty-first birthday. The Treasurer said, 'Leadership is not wandering around shopping centres tripping over TV cords'. I wonder who he had in mind? Mr Keating said, 'Leadership is the one thing that this country has never had, and it shows'. This time the Prime Minister was genuinely spurred into action-vigorous action. What did he do? He called a summit meeting between himself and the Treasurer. They agreed to disagree about their irreconcilable differences. So the process has gone on every month where some Minister has broken ranks. Most recently, in the course of the last week, after warnings by the Prime Minister, we not only had the Minister for Employment, . Education and Training, but also the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), the Treasurer and others all entering the uranium debate in a very public way. Here we are in the midst of the worse recession this country has seen in 60 years with a Prime Minister who is incapable and unable to provide leadercial ship. When we think back over time of some of the assessments that have been made about the Prime Minister we see that the true significance of his position is underever stood. I believe that the tragedy man is that history-we have talked a lot about history today-will judge him the basis of one fundamental fact. On face value, one would think that he was as uniquely placed, uniquely qualified, with many problems that exist in this country which are labour market related. They relate to union power. They relate to problems on the waterfront, in teleto communications, in the public sector in public ownership-wherever one goes. This man has been uniquely placedissue he had a long career as President of the ACTU for about 11 or 12 years-to deal with the fundamental problem that conhe fronts this country, the problem of strucover. tural reform, many elements of which simply the result of the excessive use union power. What has the Prime Minisworry ter achieved? He has achieved virtually nothing. Indeed, the one thing that claimed as the jewel in the Government's crown-the tremendous structural reform package of 1983, the decision to float currency which, by the way, himself in early 1983 did not support but ultimately he apparently saw some dom in a move in that direction-was the target of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training last weekend. From his point of view the Government had even got that one wrong too. So are left with the situation of no leadership and no hope when this country desperthe ately needs a clear sense of direction. As I have suggested to the Prime ister many times, he should get out of answer is nothing. Canberra and go and talk with some of the people who are struggling under consequences of Government policiesOpposition those who have been driven from their farms, those who have just been thrown on the unemployment scrap-heap, those who have had to sell their homes in order to pay off the debt incurred in running their small businesses, those families who have broken up under the strains of finanpressure that came from high interest rates, and now unemployment. They are the people who are paying the price for the most appalling lack of leadership and lack of direction that this country pas seen over the 60-year period that I of this have been describing.",42
67,Mr HAWKE,MINISTRY," Mr Deputy Speaker, the speech we have just heard would have to go down the most pathetic speech that has ever to deal been delivered by a Leader of the Opposition. Let me go straight to the beginning. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said there was no capacity take the tough decisions. This comes and from a man who has been consistently rolled in his shadow Cabinet on every on which he has taken a stated position. On the family allowance assets test, he went in and not only was he rolledrolled over. No fight-he just rolled It is the same with the Australian are War Memorial charge-no fight. What has of he said to Dame Beryl Beaurepaire? 'Don't about Jocelyn Newman. Don't worry about her-I'll look after Newhe man'. What did he do? He did not even go in and fight-he rolled over. If there were exemptions for roll-overs, this bloke the would never pay any tax. He is rolling the Treasurer over all the time. Let me get down to the substance of wiswhat the Leader of the Opposition is about. The question is whether there are policies emerging under my leadership which deal with the issues confronting this country. By that very test-the forwe mulation of policies-which he seeks to apply to me and this side of the House, Leader of the Opposition and those behind him abysmally fail. Where are the Minpolicies? What has been produced? The Of course, this debate is even more the exquisite in view of its timing. The accuses me and the Government of a lack of leadership at the very time when-as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, and as every person in this country knows-we are deeply and totally engaged in fundamental reform. Last month I brought down the statement Building a Competitive Australia, which further slashed tariffs, dramatically reformed wholesale sales taxes and simplified depreciation provisions. That was last month. Next month I have scheduled another Special Premiers Conference where we can take forward the vital task of a more efficient federation in this country. Behind those things we have been totally and consistently engaged, to use the words of the Leader of the Opposition, in the long, hard slog of structural reform. That is what we have been about. Let us just go to where we have been acting, to where we have been making decisions. In 1991 alone we are improving productivity on the wharves, reducing crew levels on our ships, introducing a second telecommunications carrier, seeing the benefits of open competition in domestic aviation, establishing a National Rail Freight Corporation, introducing uniform charges on road users, and witnessing historic reforms of the work force through union amalgamation, award restructuring and enterprise bargaining. That is a list of what we are doing in 1991, at this stage. We are doing all those things in regard to structural reform, and I remind the House of what the Opposition spokesman has had to do in this area. I remember I quoted from the Australian. The honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) was asked whether they would have the guts to do these things. The inimitable, immortal reply was: I don't know. George Bush said, 'read my lips' . . . I can only say you're going. to have to either trust people or keep voting Labor. That is the indication of the commitment Opposition members have in these matters. Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that he is a kindergarten fellow in the area of politics. Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that he makes the fundamental error of confusing leadership with dictatorship, of failing to recognise that the problems confronting this country today require all the imagination, the energy and the commitment that an able Cabinet, which I have, can muster. I lead a Cabinet in which every single Minister. is dedicated to tackling these problems that I have referred to. I am proud of that. As I said at Questibn Time, if in fact at times I get embarrassed, as I do occasionally, by the exuberance of some of these Ministers, that is a price I am happy to pay given their commitment and the quality of their contribution. The industry statement that I delivered in this place not quite a month ago is merely the most recent example of the breadth, the coherency and the consistency of the policy strategy that this Government has deployed in answering the very real problems that this country faces. Many of those problems, of course, have their roots in that period, in that lost generation of conservative rule where those opposite never had the guts, the wit, the wisdom, the courage to face up to these fundamental issues. The role of a leader is to set a clear direction and provide a framework within which policy development across the whole range of government activity can proceed. That is what the real business of government is about, and that is what is so little understood on the Opposition benches. I hope the Leader of the Opposition, if he has any real interest, will listen to this. Let me illustrate by showing how some of the diverse threads of policy contribute to basic objectives and are inspired by basic insights. The Leader of the Opposition referred to the period when I was leader of the trade union movement, and I am very proud of the opportunity I was given by successive governments-first by the Whitlam Government and then by the Fraser Government, as a result of my involvement in the trade union movement-to sit on the Jackson committee and the Crawford committee. Successive governments recognised that my position as leader of the trade union movement equipped me to go in and work with representatives of leaders of government and of business to address the fundamental problems of manufacturing industry in this country. From my knowledge of the trade union movement, and as a result of that experithe ence, I came to one very profound concluing sion, and that is this: it is legitimate working men and women to try to imof prove their wages and their standard conditions. That is a perfectly legitimate aspiration, as it is a perfectly legitimate aspiration for people in business to seek to increase their profitability as a basis for growth. Both of those aspirations are entirely legitimate. But I came to the conclusion that infinitely more likely that workers and businessmen are going to achieve those legitimate aspirations if they cooperate, rather than exist in an atmosphere of frontation. I learned that from my period in the trade union movement and from getting to know, on a basis of friendship and of constructive cooperation, the leadper ers of industry in this country. That was a unique experience which I brought to the prime ministership-my experience not just in the trade union movement, but my knowledge of and respect for, reciprocated respect I might say, leaders in this country. That was a fundamental principle I learned, and may I say that when I besion we are in? came Prime Minister I determined that that principle that I profoundly believed in was going to be carried into practice under my Government-and it has been, member for Corinella. through successive Ministers for industrial relations and others who have dealt with the trade union movement, includwould ing particularly my friend and colleague the Treasurer (Mr Keating). We have fleshed out into practice the belief, fundamental and profound conviction, not that I brought to the leadership of this Government in 1983. Let us test what has been achieved giving effect to that principle in pracsurge tice-the principle that I, as leader of Government, and Ministers under me domestic product. have worked to give effect to. But before I go to those achievements, let me remind this House once again, and the people this country, of the tired old confrontaOpposition tionist approach which this Leader of the Opposition brings to his position here today. One would have thought, after all period of confrontation, of the arousof opposition of trade unionists, workfor ers against employers, that this professor economics would have been able to of bring some new insights to this matter, but all he does is trot out the tired old union-bashing tactic-put the troops into the wharves. They have learned nothing in 50 years. But we have learned, and this country has learned, about the benefits of applying in practice the principle and the profound conviction that I as Prime Minit is ister brought to this Government. Let me list these benefits. Just listen to them. These are not opinions; these are facts of achievement of the operation of conthe accord under this Government. Let us remember that these are not opinions. These are facts; this is what has been achieved. First of all, we have had an 11 cent reduction in real non-farm unit labour costs since 1983. One understands, if one begins to have any sense at all, that that was not an accident. It happened because the trade union movement was a prepared to accept lower money wage increases in return for the application of the social wage. Mr Broadbent-What about the reces",43
68,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTRY,Order! I warn the honourable,45
69,Mr HAWKE,MINISTRY,"This Government, through the social wage, picked up what otherwise have been some of the money wages bill of the employers of this country and, in the result, we have had a the move from wages to profits. Those are opinions; those are facts: the restoration of the profit share from the historically low level of 12.4 per cent it reached by in September 1982 with the concurrent in investment which in 1988-89 took this it to a record proportion of the gross Turning to unemployment, the Opposition has heard 'it before and it will of not cop it, but I will give it to the again. I remind it that under this Government, we have created million new jobs, which is four times rate of employment growth that it that. achieved. Putting it another way, it is a simple fact that if I and my Ministers under my leadership had simply replithe cated the Opposition's rate of employgiving ment growth, there would be 1.2 million fewer Australians in employment today than there are. That is the fact. We inherited from the Opposition an inflation rate of 11 per cent. Due to restraint exercised by the trade union movement, we have now brought that down to a situation where the inflation rate in this country is lower than the ganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average and is falling further. Those are the achievements. In regard to industrial disputes, which the Opposition wants to keep hammering and saying are the exercise of union power, one would have tended to believe, in those circumstances, that there would have been an increase in industrial disJournalist: putation.

But let me say that against thatleadership that I have provided, the of effect to a fundamental principle that I brought to this Government-we must look at the hypocrisy of this man who gets up and talks about leadership. I have referred to the assets test. Here was the a man who said he was going to save $3 billion in government expenditure. But he did not have the guts to go in and fight for a position which said that families Orwith assets of $500,000, net of debt, excluding the family home, or an income of $60,000, should not receive the family allowance. He believed in our position, but he did not have the guts to go in and fight for it in his party room. I remind this House again of that magnificent press interview in which we see the spirit of tough leadership from this man opposite: 'Do you think there should be more Hewson: 'I'm not going to express a policy 'Do you or your party have a definiHewson: 'We, you know, I'm not going to give you a definition of welfare either . . .'

The fact is that I have led this Government successfully on four occasions: we have won in 1983; we have won in 1984; in a we have won in 1987; we have won in 1990-because I am a good leader, and I But have the great good fortune to have a Ministry of talent as well as a back bench of great commitment. Until, Mr Deputy Speaker, that mob opposite can get, firstly, good leader and, secondly, decent talent among the front bench and a back bench with some gumption, some principle, some commitment, none of which it has got, it will stay where it is and where it deserves to be-in permanent opposition.",45
70,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTRY,Order! The Prime Minister's time has expired.,47
71,Mr TIM FISCHER,MINISTRY,"Farrer-Leader of the National Party of Australia) (4.46)Only a Prime Minister and a Treasurer totally out of touch with the economic reality existing in rural and regional Australia and in the suburbs of many of our capital cities could come in here and argue for the re-establishment of an assets test on family allowance in a way which would wreak havoc on the well-being of thousands of Australians. I rise to support this matter of public importance and to reject the comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), who spoke of his able Cabinet and his able back bench. I remind the House, in the presence of some of these people I am about to refer to, of what happened to the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), that able Minister who was on the front bench. Where is he sitting now? One might describe it as the middle benches. What happened to the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West), that great ace on th- front bench? He has gone. What happened to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding)? He has gone too. He was not going to be allowed to continue on the front bench. What happened to the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan)? We rarely see him in the House. He also was dumped from the front bench. Above all else, I will concede-he is sitting in the National Party corner as I speak-that the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) has talent. But what happened to him? Notwithstanding his scientific capability, the honourable member for Lalor has also been dumped from the front bench. The sin of the honourable member for Lalor was that he had too much talent and his Party could not tolerate it. To get to the nub of this matter of public importance, let us look at the uranium debate. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) dealt very capably with the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins). I now will deal with the uranium Ministers, the bevy of Ministers who have entered the uranium debate over the last few weeks totally in breach of Cabinet solidarity. They include Ministers Bolkus and Tate. Indeed, let us go another way. I ask the House how many Ministers have not participated in the uranium debate. I say to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), 'Well done, Ben; you're one who hasn't participated, to my knowledge, in the uranium debate'. When I look around for some of the other Ministers who have not participated in the uranium debate, I find there are very few indeed who have not launched into the public domain on this key matter. Whilst we could expect a comment from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) in relation to uranium and how the three-mine policy has hampered development, Minister after Minister in every other portfolio has launched into the uranium debate in a way which is an absolute disgrace and which reflects little credit on the leadership of Prime Minister Hawke and his ability to control his Ministers. We had, for example, Minister Bolkus enterihg the fray and saying about uranium: There are no social or economic arguments .in favour of itthat is, uranium policy. Mr John Scott-Hear, hear!",47
72,Mr TIM FISCHER,MINISTRY,"The retiring honourable member for Hindmarsh says, 'Hear, hear!'. He has given up the fight. He has had enough of this Labor Government. He has announced his retirement two years ahead of the next elections. We heard the comments from the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand). He has also given up the fight, I point out to the House, and has announced that he is retiring at the next elections too. Just recently he said: You've got to read the papers and if you read between the lines you'll see that there is a degree of caution creeping into the debatethe uranium debateabout whether:-ve need to extend the policy . And I think more and more as people examine the economic issues and other factors . . not think the numbers will be there on theALPconference floor . . . Uranium mining was a dangerous industry which had unresolved problems such as disposal and the potential for accidents . . . I quote the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe)-I know not what uranium policy has to do with his particular portfolio-who was re Minister ported as follows in the Sunday Age: . ',. . no way could any member of the Left port a relaxation of the policy. He said it be a terrible let down of ALP rank and bers. ""What that leads to is a big confrontation national conference around uranium, which we've mg. seen at previous national conferences,"" . . . ""Then it becomes something that has to be conceded because no-one's going to bargain it. It',s not an issue that people would say, trade off something'. It's just not there then poisons the atmosphere at national conference;"" Minister Howe was way outside his portister folio. Then the Minister for Justice Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) launched into it, and said: I think the points of tolerance have been and if the party is to. retain a, wide spectrum its embrace then I think it's important to these people in, even at the price of logic . . . That brings me to no less a person than the Prime Minister, surely duty bound argue for Government policy. But, course, he has been honest enough on 'question to say repeatedly, in answer my questions and elsewhere, that in fact the policy is illogical. The Prime Minister challenged us today and said that we had no policy. We have clear cut policies on a range of issues, and that is one of them: an absolutely clear cut policy on nium-to abolish Labor's artificial, illogihours-on cal three-mine uranium policy restriction, and to do that swiftly on gaining governtrol ment. That is not where the quotes finish. What did Minister Collins, a senator for the Northern Territory, responsible for waterfront reform and a bit closer to the action, say on the Sunday program about uranium? He said that the uranium de. I do bate was only disruptive in the eyes of the Canberra press gallery, and he did not think all the 'hype' about the issue in recent weeks would occur at all at the Party's June national conference. Then we have Treasurer and Deputy of waste Prime Minister Keating having two bob each way, but more recently saying that there is nothing magic about three mines as distinct 'from four mines or five mines. And so it goes on, with Minister after launching into debate in a public domain in a divisive way on a key policy supissue. It is clearly the proof positive that would the Prime Minister has lost control of the file memagenda of his Government and has lost control of his Ministers. What action do at we have from the Prime Minister? NothSo the Treasurer then indicates that he about would support the liberalisation of the 'we'll ALP's uranium policy, just to give that and that debate a kick along. What action do we have from the Prime Minister about the Treasurer? Again nothing. Then the Minfor Justice and Consumer Affairs has and his say. Again no action. Then the Minister for Community Services and Health. Again, no action from the Prime Minisreached ter. Even then, when the Prime Minister in does get the courage to call the Deputy hold Prime Minister into say, 'No, don't get excited, lad. I am going to stay on as Prime Minister of this country. Go back to to your box', he cannot even be trusted of to do that. Graham Richardson has to this come around to look through the teleto vision monitor to see what is going on in the Prime Minister's office and to spy on the Prime Minister in the circumstances involved. It did not take Prime Minister Hawke one hour to tell him, 'No, it is not on, Paul. Go back to your box'. It did not uratake him two hours. It took him three two separate occasions. Some dialogue! Some commentary on the conof the Prime Minister over the Deputy Prime Minister! So we have a situation where the Prime Minister is out of control. He does not control his own Ministers and did not even have the courage to rebuke, in a fundamental way, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), who once had the courage to walk around to the Prime Minister's office and to say to the Prime Minister, in chilling terms, 'Name the date, Bob. Name the date of departure'. What an insult to a Prime Minister who, after that little episode, then went on to win the next election. This matter of public importance stands fair and square on its merits. The Government has failed this country with regard to the economy at large and has failed because of the total lack of leadership afforded by the Prime Minister. His loose leadership has seen the foreign debt quadruple over this Government's period in office, and a real decline in wages under the much vaunted accord. Go out and ask the real people at the grass what they think about their standard of living, what they think about the accord. They will give the answer clear and loud that they have had enough of Labor, of the lacklustre leadership of Prime Minister Hawke and his Cabinet. They have a particular hatred for the Deputy Prime Minister, Treasurer Keating-or is it going to be President Keating? They feel very much that this Government has run its time. In short, if the Prime Minister cannot run his Party, he cannot run the country. Prime Minister Hawke cannot run his Party and he certainly cannot run this country.",47
73,Mr KEATING,MINISTRY," Mr Deputy Speaker, I notice that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is always about to leave when the heat starts. The charge made by the Leader of the Opposition against the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is an absence of leadership. Yet the Prime Minister has presided over the establishment of a new international model for Australia, a new international role for this country. The very essence of leadership has been provided to provide for Australia not the role of a closed, frightened country living behind tariff barriers and managed exchange rates, but an open society-Mr Tim Fischer-Is that the case?",49
74,Mr KEATING,MINISTRY,"The honourable member for Farrer was heard in peace. It is an open society where one can make one's way in the world and where the talent of the country is harnessed to something better, something more robust, something more interesting than the closed place we were before 1983. That is what the Prime Minister has done. That is the sort of policy he has presided over; he has presided over the Government which has established it. I will refer in a few minutes to . the elements of that internationalisation. But what do we hear from the Leader of the Opposition? A very weak speech, a political speech; never any substance. There was no framework of reference in the delivery of his speech. There were only mealy-mouthed political charges levied against the Government or the roots level Prime Minister. The Leader of the Opposition is very smug. He is ahead in the polls and so is his Party. It has affected him in a way which produces this smugness of view from him. He cannot believe his luck. I do not doubt he does not believe his luck: he has come to the leadership of the Opposition because of the talent vacuum within the Liberal Party. Obviously, with his relatively junior membership of the Parliament and of his Party, he would not be the leader of the Liberal Party were it not for the fact that there is a policy and talent vacuum inside that Party. So all of a sudden he has got the leadership of the Liberal Party. But what do we hear from him in the supposedly key attempts to make a case against the Government? In the censure motion before the last break and in this discussion against the Prime Minister today, this is not an Opposition leader with a frame of reference, with.a mission in life, with any compelling sense of urgency about policy. I have been here to see Whitlam in opposition,· Fraser in opposition, and Hayden in opposition. These are people who could marshall an argument-as could, to give him his due, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), when he was Leader of the Opposition. They are people who had a framework. But there is no framework from the Leader of the Opposition. This is the sum total of his contribution: he wants a consumption tax, ill-defined as to application and as to rates; a State income tax; health vouchers; education vouchers; the abolition of company tax; $3 billion in tax cuts; and, if necessary, to put the troops onto the wharves. How does that come together as a coherent whole, as a policy which continues the internationalisation of Australia? How does it? It does not; it does not amount to anything which is coherent or vaguely relevant. But what do we hear from him? We never hear any specification as to those policies or any framework from them. In contrast this is what the Government has been able to produce: firstly, there was the courageous decision of floating the dollar, which left us in the position of having the world market set the exchange rate, and the 30 per cent fall in the exchange rate, the very large fall, after 1985 produced a five percentage point increase in inflation. That required real wage cuts, which the Government was able to produce. We also removed exchange controls, which left Australian business free to invest abroad if it wished and people free to invest in this - ountry. At the time no-one was certain how this would emerge in terms of our balance of payments or our investment and savings. In fact it has produced a great stock-a constellation-of international Australian companies offshore, where we now have $60 billion worth of assets offshore and growing offshore businesses. In the further opening of Australia we are the only party that has removed the tariff wall-in 1988 and more recently in the Prime Minister's speech-to see it go to 5 per cent, to see it abolished and to see a free flow of goods as well as a fre€ flow of funds in this country. If that is not leadership-taking the courageous decisions to open the place up as to funds and goods-I do not know what is. On top of that, we have tackled the hard issues, such as the structural Budget deficit, the investment imbalance, getting investment going again, getting the profit share up, getting exports growing and improving the position of import competing industry, and dealing in a fundamental way through award restructuring with productivity changes and other microeconomic changes in all areas, such as the wharves, power generation, transport and rail freight. These are the things the coalition has just forgotten-not even thought about-as being issues in Australian economic life. This is the frame of reference the Government is working in. If that is not a product of leadership, I do not know what is. What have we heard back? Can we refer to any speech where the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) or his Deputy say, 'We want to continue the internationalisation. This is how we are going to continue to improve productivity. This is the way we are going to deal with our import competing sectors. This is the way we are going to deal with micro change. '? No. We have a whole lot of grab-bag policies which are not even policies; they are just things dropped in the public ciebate, as I said, by the visiting professor, who visits the issues and drops them. He does not even flesh them out to be policies, and then says that his charge against the Prime Minister is that he has no capacity for tough decisions when he let Senator Newman roll him on a fee for the Australian War Memorial, for God's sake, or when he failed to get through his caucus its support for the assets test on the family allowance, of all things. Mr Reith interjecting",49
75,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTRY,Order! I warn the honourable member for Flinders.,50
76,Mr KEATING,MINISTRY,"The thing is, the Leader of the Opposition has been pathetic as a leader whenever he has run into any opposition within his own party. He has no framework of reference to work in or to proselytise his Party's views. He is sitting there smugly taking comfort from the recession, hoping that he will drift into office when, as the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong, said in some celebrated remarks in a New York hotel, 'The times suit me.'. Well, they did not suit him, any more than they will suit the present Leader of the Opposition or those smug people sitting with him. I have often said that we have a policy ferment on this side of the House, and we have. As the Prime Minister said, he is glad that we have, and so am I because I would rather have a discussion about issues of emphasis or indeed issues of difference than deal with people like those opposite. Imagine turning up to a meeting with the Opposition front, bench! It would break one's heart to say, 'Well, here they are, these intellectual slugs; we are going to try to make a government from them.' It would break the heart of anyone interested in changing a place. That is not the position on our side of the House. Members opposite may sit and say, 'Oh well, we have the Government on an issue'whether it is the recession or something else-and rub their hands together, thinking they might slide back into public office. The fact of the matter is that they <will not; we will catch up with them as we have on four occasions past. We will catch up with honourable members opposite simply because we are better-much better-and person for person on our side we are simply better. That is why we will be back and that is why the Opposition's hollow attack on the Prime Minister about leadership is nothing more than that-an empty attack, the seriousness of which is illustrated by the fact that the Leader of the Opposition left the House even before the debate was concluded. I said to the Prime Minister earlier in private, and I will say it again: matters of public importance from the characters opposite are not worth responding to. I will be counselling him not to do it any more in the future.",50

78,Mr BEDDALL,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"I move: Customs Tariff Proposals Nos. 3 and 4 (1991) and Excise Tariff Proposal No. 1 (1991). The tariff proposals which I have just tabled relate to proposed alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1987 and the Excise Tariff Act 1921. Customs Tariff Proposal No.3 (1991) will operate on and from tomorrow. It inserts a new additional note to chapter 20 which will amend the tariff classification of orange pulpwash concentrate, a by-product of the juicing industry. The effect of this change will be to raise the rate of duty of this concentrate from 5 per cent to 21 per cent. This alteration is in line with the Industries Assistance Commission's recommendation contained in its report on the fresh fruit and fruit products industries and is the correct level of assistance intended by the Government. Customs Tariff Proposal No.4 (1991), operative on and from the first day of January 1991, inserts a free rate of duty for parts of wheelchairs of tariff subheading 8714.20.00. Excise Tariff Proposal No.1 (1991) formally places before Parliament, as required by law, a tariff alteration made by notice published in the Gazette during the recent recess. The proposal, operative on and from the first day of April 1991, increases the excise duty on naturally occurring liquefied petroleum gas from a rate of $5.78 per kilolitre to a rate of $35.94 per kilolitre. This change was announced by the Minister for Resources on the twenty-fifth day of March 1991. Summaries of alterations contained in these proposals have been prepared and are being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposals to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Beale) adjourned. NA BARRACKS,CABARLAH, NA Approval of Work: Public Works Committee Act",51
79,Mr BEDDALL,QUEENSLAND,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Redevelopment of Borneo Barracks, Cabarlah, Queensland. The Borneo Barracks at Cabarlah near Toowoomba in Queensland were established in World War II for the use of the 11 th Light Horse and various military schools and depots. Since then a variety of regiments and squadrons have operated from the Borneo Barracks and today it is home to the 7th Signal Regiment, an Army Reserve Troop of 140th Signal Squadron and the Defence Joint Telecommunications School. The proposed redevelopment of the base is aimed at upgrading existing facilities to provide sufficient and appropriate training, working and living accommodation for functions currently undertaken at the base, and to accommodate the anticipated increase in staff and students expected between now and 1995. Specifically the works will involve the provision of purpose-designed training facilities for the schools and upgrading of working facilities for support functions. Initial living accommodation for all ranks, as well as rank and file, and dining and recreation facilities are also included. The limit of cost estimate for these works is $12.7m at August 1990 prices. It is planned that the work will go to tender in 1992, with completion expected in 1995. In its report the Public Works Committee determined that a need exists to redevelop these facilities but the Committee raised two specific issues. The Committee was concerned about the quality of water supplied to Cabarlah and has recommended that discussions continue with the Crows Nest Shire Council about providing better quality water. Defence and Australian Construction Services will continue these discussions and the Committee recommended that all projects referred to it be analysed to ensure the most efficient use of energy in the completed buildings, and that it receive copies of these analyses. The Australian Construction Service will make these arrangements in all future projects for which it has responsibility. I would like to thanK the Committee for its support and commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING AMENDMENT BILL 1991 Consideration resumed from 13 March. In Committee Consideration of Senate's new clause and ainendment. Senate's new clause and amendment(l) Page 1, after clause 1, insert the following new clause: Reports ""1A. Section 9 of the Principal Act is amended by omitting from sub-section (8) '15 sitting days' and substituting '5 sitting days',"" (2) Clause 2, page 1, at end of clause, add the following sub-clause: ""(2) Section 25 of the Principal Act is amended by omitting from sub-section (3) '15 sitting days' and substituting '5 sittirig days',""",52
80,Mr BALDWIN,QUEENSLAND,"I move: That the new clause and amendment be greed to. The new clause and amendment propose that the deadline for tabling in Parliament reports. of certain reports of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training and the Higher Education Council be duced from 15 sitting days after receipt by the Minister with portfolio responsibilwould ities to five sitting days after receipt. The Government rejects this new clause and amendment. The standard time allowed for tabling in Parliament of reports such as those of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training and the Higher Education Council is 15 sitting days from the date of receipt by the Minister. It not unreasonable to allow the receiving Minister time to seek clarification of brieftime ing or specific points raised within the and tabling. reports. This period also reflects the time necessary to arrange for reports to be printed. I refer the Opposition to the President's report on annual reports of February 1991 which lists all reports of departments statutory authorities of a periodic or anlaying nual nature that were tabled in the during the Budget sittings of 1990. Of 180 or so reports listed with a specific tabling requirement, not one is subject a tabling deadline of less than 15 sitting days after receipt by the Minister. The Opposition has advanced no compelling reason why an exception to the standard tabling requirement should be made in the case of reports of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training amendment. and the Higher Education Council. In total, the Board and the Higher Education Council have presented six ports to the Minister for tabling under sections proposed for amendment. In a single instance has such a report tabled late; that is, after 15 sitting days have elapsed. The average time between receipt of these reports by the Minister and tabling in the House is 42 calendar days. Contrary to Opposition assertions, to the community. this does not represent an unreasonably long delay and, in comparison with similar reports of other government departdisaments and agencies, is not unusual. There is, therefore, no support for the Opposition's claim that a pattern is evident of deliberate delays in tabling these The Government also rejects the new reclause and amendment because of the practical administrative difficulties they create. Simply put, it would often not be logistically possible to have reports printed within the tabling period proposed. This would be particularly so in the case of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training annual report. It is very likely that the effect of the proposed new clause and amendment would be for the National Board of Employment, Education and Training to deis lay formal transmission of reports to the Minister in order to allow the necessary for ministerial approval for printing Currently these activities occur after the Minister receives the reports, and hence the need for 15 sitting days grace before tabling must occur. Only by undertaking these activities prior to transmitting the and reports to the Minister, and thereby detheir formal transmission, could the Senate National Board of Employment, the Education and Training be confident that the Minister would be in a position to to avoid breaching the legislation by tabling within five sitting days. So, in all probability, the end result would be that tabling in the Parliament would occur no earlier overall and the Parliament would be no better served. Against this background the Government rejects the new clause and",53
81,Dr KEMP,QUEENSLAND,"I rise to speak on the amendment to the Employrement, Education and Training Amend the ment Bill passed in the Senate with the not agreement votes of the Opposition and been the Australian Democrats, which expresses the very widespread concern that. exists in the education community over the lack of satisfactory explanation of policies being provided by the Government The Bill is designed to amend the reporting . requirements of the Higher Education Council and the procedures concerning acting appointments to the National Board of Employment, Education and Training and its councils. As honourable members will be aware, under the Employment, Education and Training Act, the Higher Education Council is required to report in February and August of each year on the educational profiles processed on the operation of the higher education contribution scheme. The Bill will reduce the number of times the Council need report on these matters to once a year: namely, March. The Opposition put forward no objection to that. The amendment that the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) has once again put before this chamber was initiated by the Opposition to reduce the time between the Minister's receipt of the reports of the Higher Education Council and the National Board of Employment, Education and Training and the tabling of these reports irl the Parliament. The effort to minimise or remove the requirement on the Government to report publicly on its policies has been indicative of the administration of higher education under the current Government. It has long been the case that the Government's policy and its decisions were presented openly to this Parliament under legislation in the area of education. It is unfortunate that the legislative framework provided by the Government seeks to afford the Minister the most far-reaching discretion in relation to individual institutions and research funding, yet the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 places no such statutory reporting requirements on the Minister. The whole fabric of higher education in this country can be reconstituted and the Minister is under no statutory obligation to report to the Parliament. That is the prerequisite for the havoc that the Government is carrying out in higher education at present and the reason why morale amongst academic staff in higher education is at an all-time low. It is under such very broad discretions that we see chaos across the field of higher education and education in general. I have had the responsibility in recent weeks of drawing the attention of the community to the mismanagement of the overseas student programs and the export of education, the extent of which it became possible to determine only through freedom of information legislation. This degree of unaccountability continues to raise concerns as to the reasons for government decision making and the Government's obvious reluctance to make satisfactory reports to the Parliament. We are still waiting on significant statements from the Government on higher education which were promised months ago and which are supposed to be presented to us by the middle of the year. The reports from these advisory bodies are, nevertheless, welcome to the Parliament. We are keen that these reports come forward within a timetable which allows them to be debated as rapidly as possible by the Parliament. The Government has argued the practical difficulties of collating andprocessing the information. As I said, we have accepted that it need not report twice during the year but that a report on these matters be available in: March of each year. Our concern continues over the period that it continues to take for reports to reach the Parliament. We are concerned that the report of the Higher Education Council, which was presented to the Board in August, was not made public by the Minister until November last year. There was a period of six weeks between the presentation of the report by the Higher Education Council to the National Board of Employment, Education and Training and the forwarding of that report to the Minister. The report was not made available to the Parliament until November. Our concern lies with the present requirement that the Minister has 15 sitting days during which he is able to make a report available to Parliament. It is of concern to the Opposition that the Minister has this time, because this can lead to a delay of up to several months from the time the report is issued. The amendments that the Opposition proposed, and which were accepted in the Senate, are an attempt to shorten this delay by reducing the period from 15 to five days. The Minister complains in the second reading speech that this is exceptional; that it is not applicable to other reports. I must say that the Opposition is not impressed with this. We believe it is important that the concern of the community-that this information be made available to the Parliament in the possible time-be signified by an amendment to the legislation of the kind that we have put forward. As I said when I addressed this issue when it first came before this House, we do not believe this change is going to be of more than limited advantage because there still remain considerable avenues for delays in procedures, and some of those avenues were flagged in the Minister's speech that we have just heard. There may be administrative actions taken to delay the bringing of the report before the Parliament but we believe that it is practicable to implement sion. Consequently, we do not support the Government's position on this; we support the amendments as they were brought forward in the Senate.",53
82,Mr BALDWIN,QUEENSLAND,"I rise very briefly in response. The honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) talked about widespread concern. There is no widespread concern; it is simply untrue. Where does he say this widespread concern is coming from? The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee has just produced a very substantial statement on what it sees as the problems and perspectives· for higher education. There is no reference to any of this. It is non-existent. There is no concern about the tabling time for reports of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, or of the Higher Education Council. The thing that disturbs me about this particular amendment is that it represents a decline into sheer silliness in terms of the quality of amendments being moved by the Opposition. I would expect the Opposition to move substantive policy amendments where it has a substantive disagreement with the Government. But I think the silliness of this particular proposal is obvious on a very short period of reflection. The honourable member for Goldstein would have us accept that it is feasible for the Government to print a highly complex document full of highly complex tables at short notice. For example, if there were two consecutive sitshortest ting weeks and I received it on Wednesday, it would be required to be tabled the following Thursday. The Department and common sense would dictate that it would simply not be possible to print a complex document in that time. It is absurd, and I am really at a loss as to why the Opposition is persisting with it. "" The only reason the Australian Democrats supported it in the Senate was that they saw it as a way of retaliating against the Government over its resource security legislation-a reason which rivals in silliness the rationale put forward by the this provi- Opposition spokesperson.

Committee of Reasons Motion by (Mr Baldwin) agreed to: That Mr Gear, Mr Harry Woods and the mover be appointed a committee to draw up reasons for the House of Representatives disagreeing to the amendments of the Senate.",55
83,Mr BALDWIN,QUEENSLAND,"On behalf of the committee appointed to draw up reasons for the House disagreeing to the amendments of the Senate, I present the reasons, which are being circulated to honourable members. The reasons read as followsReasons of the House of Representatives for disagreeing to the new clause and amendment of the SenateThe new clause and amendment made by the Senate are not acceptable because: (1) The standard time allowed for tabling annual or periodic reports of departments and statutory bodies is 15 sitting days from the date of receipt of reports by the Minister. There is no reason why an exception should be made in the case of reports of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training and the Higher Education Council. (2) Logistically, it would often not be possible for reports to be printed within the reduced tabling period proposed. Motion (by Mr Baldwin) agreed to: That the committee's reasons be adopted. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1991 [COGNATE BILL: STATES GRANTS (TAFE ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 March, on motion by Mr Baldwin: That the Bill be now read a second time. upon which Dr Kemp has, moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House deplores the Government's continued mismanagement of higher education, and, in particular, it deplores the Government's failure to provide the sector with the flexibility and incehtives it needs to address the academic staff shortage, and to provide for adequate opportunities to meet the diverse educational needs of students"".",55
84,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Mr Nehl)Before the debate resumes on this Bill, I remind the House that it has been agreed that a general debate be allowed covering this Bill and the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill 1991.",56
85,Mr MILES,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I rise to speak in this cognate debate on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill and the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill. I do so following on from an excellent speech given by the shadow Minister for education, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), in a wide-ranging discussion on education matters. We have just had a debate here-very briefly I might say-in regard to education in which the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) said that th(amendment proposed by the Senate was only trivial. In regard to this debate, Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to draw your attention to the fact that we as an opposition have moved an amendment to these proposals. I want to go over the amendment, which is certainly not trivial and is at the heart of the Opposition's concern about education at all levels in this country. The sentences here will illustrate to people listening that our concern is wide ranging in regard to education. We put this amendment to the House: that, whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, 1991] this House deplores the Government's continued mismanagement of higher education. In particular, this House deplores the Government's increasing interference in higher education, as facilitated by the intrusive educational profiles process; its failure to provide a proper framework for accountability with respect to the exercise of ministerial discretion; its failure to provide adequately for independent policy advice; its policy of forced amalgamations, the disruption that is presently causing in Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory and the damaging pressures it has created towards institutional uniformity; its failure to provide institutions with the freedom and flexibility needed to address the impending shortage of academic staff; the unsatisfactory imposition of the higher education contribution charge on full fee postgraduate courses; and, lastly, its failure to make inroads into the level of unmet demand. There is a list-a litany, one might say-of the failures of this Government in regard to education. Only today in this House the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) defended comments he made publicly about Government policy. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) had to actually carpet the Minister for his public comments in regard to Government policy at a time when he is failing to administer his Department effectively. The great tragedy of that is that this Minister is failing to handle the education issues, whether they be in technical and further education, in schools or wherever. It does not matter which area of education we look at-whether it is the unmet demand of thousands of young people who would like to go to university but for whom there are no places, whether it is the ficulties which the professorial and other people in our universities are facing into do it. regard to the changes resulting from amalgamation, or whether it is in regard independent policy advice-we find that people are concerned. They are disturbed about where education is going. At a time when the Prime Minister comes out and says that we ought to be the clever try, we find the Minister responsible education deciding to go public in tally different area and not even concenreappoint trating on his own policy area. The Minister's record is clearly one a trail of devastation. He bungled and mismanaged the Education Services (Expackages. port Regulation) Bill as late as November last year, and his interventionist policies in regard to higher education in this try are causing considerable concern. It does not matter which paper one or on which day one picks up a paper; one will find comments about the way in Do which the Government is mishandling education. I was interested in an article by Professor Penington, the Vice-Chancountry. cellor of the University of Melbourne, page 24 of today's Australian Financial Review in which he said: But Dawkins' unified national system seems bent on becoming a uniform national system. There is no doubt that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training concerned about having a uniform syswherever tem. He does not want people to think laterally, to be creative and to be dytions namic. He does not want that type of institution to develop in Australia. Yet that is the very type of institution that need in this country to face the difficulties which we are now faced with, the overseas debt crisis and high interest rates. On .the social side, young people not able to get into our universities. are high unemployment rates. This week we are waiting to see whether the figure will rise to 9 per cent or more. There the unmet financing of the retention rates into years 11 and 12 around this country. The Government makes a lot of the fact that there are a lot more year 11 and year 12 students going into our colleges. I agree that it is a great thing that that has ocdifcurred. But the simple fact is that the Government has not provided the money In my State of Tasmania it is even to more incredible to see what the Labor Party has done there. It had the idea that it ought to get rid of a lot of people in the Public Service, particularly about 1,000 teachers. So it developed a $100m counredundancy package plan. Yesterday it for came out that it got redundancy plans a tofrom 30 principals and it has had to 34 principals. It sacked more science teachers than it should have and of now it has had to re-employ people or get new teachers in after paying redundancy That is the type of administration which is going on by the Labor Party throughout Australia in regard to couneducation. It is a great tragedy. Professor Penington goes on to say, in picks up regard to higher education: not treat us like service stations of education He is referring to the universities in this A vice-chancellor of one of our on very good universities is saying to the Minister, 'Don't treat us like a service station where the kids roll up like cars, hell where we pump a bit of information into them and send them out. It is the same supergrade petrol or unleaded petrol and is away they go. They get the same thing they go'. It is a great tragedy that this Minister has an industrial relaapproach to education, where everybody has to be herded into the same sort of process and channelled out in the same we way. We as an opposition are opposed to that position and that formulation of polincluding icy by this Government. We find that the Minister is not trusted are by his own colleagues. I remind people of There the types of comments which are made by some of his own friends in the States. Mr Goss is reported to have accused the is Minister in regard to the Premiers and the Ministers for education around the States coming together, saying that the Minister is one of 'bungling and arrogance'. He went on to say: . .. the Premiers weren't prepared to accept that sort of slapdash, late attempt to push something through that had not been the subject of discussion and negotiation. The States have a very strong suspicion that John Dawkins is more on about central control '. . . than national standards. Not only that, he was also criticised by the Premiers of Victoria and Western Australia in regard to these matters. It is not just the Opposition which is criticising the way in which this Government is running education in Australia; it is also the Premiers in three of the States. They are criticising the way the Minister is going about handling many of these education matters. To top all of this off, just as this Bill was introduced into the Parliament we had the industry statement by the Prime Minister. What was the new whiz-bang idea in regard to schools and education in this country? The idea was to spend something in the vicinity of $1 Om to determine what makes a good school. Hundreds of reports and studies have probably been done on what makes a good school. Before I go into some of those, I will illustrate the nonsense of spending $10m on research which has already been documented over and over again. What makes a good school is having motivated teachers, motivated students and motivated parents for good education. When we get those three things together we will get a good school because the rest will follow. I have taught in several schools, particularly government schools. When we get that form of motivation we will get an excellent result from the young people who come through and we will get a good education system as well. Let us go back to the idea of the Government spending $10m to find out what makes a good school. I have one of the monograph series of the Australian Council for Educational Administration. It goes through indicators of school effectiveness; in other words, the real details of making good schools. There have been five overseas studies and three Australian studies. What is this Government doing when we are absolutely crying out, particularly in the TAFE sector, for more money so there can be more teachers and so more students can participate in training and so forth? We have $ 10m being spent on finding out what a good school is. There have been five overseas studies and three Australian studies. They are quite detailed studies. They are not something which anybody with some understanding of education would say has no depth. We already know these things. The details are set out not only in this monograph series by the Australian Council for Educational Administration but in several other documents which are available to all of us here.' The Minister ought to know about it. He should have told the Prime Minister that that $lOm in regard to education could have been spent far more effectively somewhere else. One of the areas which we are debating here is the T AFE sector. The T AFE sector of this country is very important because it provides for many of those students who do not want to go on with their academic studies but who want to be trained in a particularly practical way in a trade or for their own personal advancement. We should be particularly encouraging that sector in this country so that we can gear up our skill level so we can become a clever country. Interestingly, about six weeks ago there was an advertisement in my local newspaper in regard to TAFE. Again it illustrates the rhetoric of the Government. It talks about doing all sorts of great things for education when down at the grass roots level things are closing down. The advertisement is headed 'Major TAFE Plant and Equipment Auction'. It runs through a whole list of things which are going to be auctioned off. Why? Because at the State level, the State Labor Administration is closing down literally several halves of sections of T AFE colleges throughout the State. Thousands of square metres of floors of TAFE colleges in my area are . vacant. We find that the items being sold offjust to give people an idea of the range of things which are being closed down-include mobile plant and vehicles, industrial engines and generators, engineering and woodworking machinery, engine analysing and vehicle testing equipment, car engines and parts, welders and compressors, small engines, outboards and motorbikes, agricultural equipment and additional sundry items. The advertisement goes on for a whole page listing all the items that are being sold off. Young people cannot get into these colleges. They cannot get adequate training because at the grass roots level the whole thing is falling apart. It is a great tragedy that, when this country is faced with the economic crisis of an overseas debt and with high unemployment rates, the Government does not show a much deeper concern for education and a concern for the future. Where will we get our academic staff in five or 10 years time, with the crisis that is now faced in the higher education institutions? One only has to talk with the vice-chancellors around Australia and with other people in the academic area to hear them voicing their concerns about their future and about holding quality people here in Australia. We are not being a clever country in the way in which we are handling education. There is no way in which we will get an effective education system which is straitjacketed. The Minister is trying to straitjacket education in Australia, trying to control it. The Government wants to use education essentially as part of its economic policy. There is much more to education than getting economic benefits. There are the social implications of education. Having very well educated fathers and mothers just to bring up our families is very important. But the Government wants to straitjacket our higher education and make higher education institutions go down the same tram lines, the same track, so that students are taught the same way in virtuallyevery institution. If we want effective education in this country what we need is freedom, 'choice and dpportunity. It is when we get those that we will get young ,people choosing the courses they want to go to. The young people are the ones who will determine which subjects ought to be taught and which ones are relevant to Australia-not a single Minister sitting in Canberra trying to determine what technical and further education college will be beneficial over in Geraldton, up in Cairns or down in Hobart. We want flexibility so that people at the local level can make the decisions which they know are relevant for their young people. It would be great to have many more boards at the local level that 'were able to determine much of the material and curricula and the qualifications of teachers and people who ought to be there. If we want to move down the line of national standards or national curricula, it is far better to have some sort of national instrument set at a certain' standard, for which everybody could sit-maybe produced by the Australian Council for Educational Research people. If we had a common instrument for people to sit their exams or tests, we could allow people to teach in the way in which they want to come up to those standards. We should not be dictating to people who are very creative and should be allowed the academic freedom-particularly in our tertiary institutions-to develop the courses and strategies whereby they can best educate Australia's young people. It is for those reasons, and many' other reasons which have been documented very well by the shadow Minister for education, the honourable member for Goldstein, that we have moved the amendment to the motion for the second reading of these Bills. In these times there is a great demand out there for education and, as I have mentioned, with regard to high unemployment and people searching for a future in Australia, many families are doing everything to give their young people an education. But this Government is failing.",56
86,Mrs CROSIO,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Before rising to support the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill and the States Grants (T AFE Assistance) Amendment Bill, I was intently listening to the previous speaker, the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles). I question how our history books have been written. If one reads the records of debates on Bills before this House, in no way can one get the belief or the type of conception that has been expressed in this House by the previous speaker. I agree with him that the funding for our higher education institutions is of the utmost importance-not only in encouraging Australia to be the clever country but also in creating a higher education system that is fair and equitable. One section of the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill aims to allow for the increased funding for higher education institutions totalling $171 m over the 1991-1993 triennium. As stated in the December 1990 report from the National Board of Employment, Education and Training entitled Higher Education: The Challenges Ahead: There is no cheap way to safeguard quality in an efficient higher education system. When all is considered, the request for an extra $171 m is but a drop in the ocean, particularly when one contemplates the cost involved in the establishment and administration of higher education institutions. The region of western Sydney, of which my electorate is a part, has long been disadvantaged by not having a university to service its substantial local population. Fortunately, under the Hawke Labor Government the University of Western Sydney has now been established within our region. Enormous amounts of money are needed to establish and maintain a new university, and through this Government's commitment the University of Western Sydney has been able to cultivate a working order. To give the House an idea of what it costs the Government to establish a new university, I will present it with the most recent figures available regarding funding of the University of Western Sydney. The University of Western Sydney is in receipt of an operating grant of $76.741m for 1991, which will increase to $99.72m by 1993. These figures reflect the importance that this Government is now placing on opportunities for the people of western Sydney. This 1991 operating grant funds 9,945 students, a figure which is expected to increase to 12,585 in 1993, 35 per cent of the total student increase expected throughout New South Wales. The University of Western Sydney will receive $107m in capital funds for the three years 1991-1993, which is 29 per cent of the total capital funding figure for the nine universities situated in New South Wales. It has also received the relatively small amount of $349,000 for Australian Research Council funding for 1991, with $231,000 of that going towards research infrastructure to enable the university to build up its research capacity. I say that this figure is relatively small because in comparison with the Research Council funding figure for Sydney University, for example, which totals $13.681m, it is small. Other grants to our University of West': ern Sydney include $180,000 under the equity program, which also includes the tertiary awareness program; $500,000 per year for three years for the new teaching infrastructure program; and various allocations from the reserve fund. Despite the fact that this university receives less funding than many of the other larger and more established universities or higher education institutions, these figures seem to be very hefty and extremely generous. As I said at the beginning of my speech, however, quality higher education does not come cheaply. The report from which I quoted earlier, Higher Education: The Challenges Ahead, says: There is a relationship between the level of funding of higher education and its quality. The closer the funding base is to the margin, the more difficult it is for the system to be able to deliver the qualityand flexibility, I might addof education that is required. The report continues: The problem is compounded by the reduced capability of the system in other areas; to compensate for the paucity of funds, the time available for other activities is reduced to the point where reasonable community expectations of the higher education system cannot be met. In a system funded near the minimum, for example, the quality of research, teaching, consultancies and professional leadership all diminish and so does the central role institutions play in their community. The report stresses: The expectation of the Australian people will be for the country to become cleverer and hence more prosperous. They will wish to have an accessible higher education system, open to the community as a whole and committed to providing opportunities for lifelong education, to retraining and to the upgrading of skills. The major challenge facing the higher education system will be to adapt to the raised expectations of the community and to provide relevant higher education of undisputed quality to a growing and increasingly diverse student body. Such actions require money. According this report, funding options available Australia to maintain its higher education system include increased funding from both the public purse and the private tor. The dilemma of where to get the versity money for increased funding to cope with the expansion of our higher education tems was partly solved with the introducwhich tion of the higher education contribution scheme, better known as HECS. This was introduced on 1 January 1989. To achieve growth and equity to meet the needs students and the labour market, extra century. sources of higher education funding had to be found. Hence, HECS was introduced. Under the HECS program, students and graduates are required to contribute wards some of the cost of the provision of their studies. These contributions made by full time, part time and external stuhe dents go towards only a small part total cost of providing higher education. Students can choose to pay their contrithe bution up front and consequently be gible for a 15 per cent discount or they can choose to defer any payment contribution until their taxable income reaches an amount which is about the ments same as average annual earnings. In this case contributions are made through the nantly taxation system. Amounts owed and the majority income threshold are indexed to keep pace higher education. with inflation. All the funds raised by HECS are used come to help finance further expansion of the higher education system and are paid into a separate trust fund. An estimated 63,000 additional places for Australian students will be created by 1992 as a result of the income derived from HECS. An additional $1.6 billion will have been injected into the system, also by 1992, partially funded by HECS. Each year $1 Om is paid to assist higher education institutions in meeting their administrative cost in implementing the HECS program. Another provision in this Bill aims to take account of revised amounts for reimbursement of HECS revenue to the States in relation to State-funded places. These revisions have been made on the basis of updated information obtained from the to States on the number of such places eliin gible for reimbursement. In simple terms, this means that the Bill has been designed to reimburse, through HECS, various State secgovernments that have been funding uniplaces following the availability of increased information on the number of sysState-funded higher education places exist. Some $7m in additional expenditure will be provided for this purpose over the 1991-93 triennium. HECS is expected to raise some $126m in 1991 of and more than $500m by the turn of the HECS has been specifically designed to protect the interests of people with low incorries or no personal incomes who are toin higher education or who are considering enrolment. With HECS a person can choose to study and delay payment until or she has the personal means to afford of a the contribution required. Higher education should not be the preserve of relatively privileged in the commuelinity. According to another report commissioned, called A New Commitment to of the Higher Education in Australia: Prior to the introduction of HECS, the arrangefor the funding of higher education were inequitable because that system was predomifinanced by Australian taxpayers, the vast of whom did not directly benefit from People who make the most use of the Australian higher education system are more likely to from high-income backgrounds, to ha'(e attended a private School, to have parents who are higher education graduates or to work in managerial or professional occupations. The report further stated that a fairer system of higher education was required in Australia and greater access to higher e'ducation by people from financially and other disadvantaged backgrounds was needed. Additional funding was therefore needed to provide extra places and supplementary measures to increase the access of these people. However, Australian taxpayers, as the report stated, should not be expected to carry the whole burden of providing the additional resources needed. Consequently, HECS was born. As a result, the Government requires people who use and benefit from higher education to contribute towards some of its cost. To require users to pay all or most of the cost of provision would be as inequitable as the old system, which required them to meet almost none of their cost. HECS is a more equitable system than our previous one. With its inception came the abolition of the higher education administration charge of $280, which was required to be paid up-front at the time of enrolment. With HECS, any student who cannot afford payment at the time of enrolment will not be prevented from participating in higher education. The financiaL circumstances of a student's family are irrelevant when determining liability under HECS. Students with no ""income or incomes of less than $22,000 per year can undertake education studies without any immediate payment, thus breaking the cycle of dependence on spouses' or parents' income. Although relatively recently established, HECS has been and is continually being revised and assessed. Already changes resulting from these revisions have occurred, showing that this policy is constantly keeping up with the changes within our society. For instance, the payment options form was redesigned for 1990 with information about the form and how it should be completed on one page and the payment option selection on another page. Both the HECS information booklet and pamphlet were extensively revised on the basis of market research conducted in 1989. The revised pamphlet was specifically directed at new students enrolling in higher education institutions in 1990. A revised administrative guidelines manual was produced by the Department of Employment, Education and Training to assist institutions in administering the scheme during 1990. Following its inception, there was criticism of HECS by student representatives who did not fully understand the implications of the scheme and who said it would prevent many people from undertaking higher education. However, according to the third report by the Higher Education Council to the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, released in May 1990: . .. HECS does not appear to have had a major impact on access to higher education in its first year of operation. The report stated: The Council believes it is very important to maintain access to higher education by disadvantaged groups and will consider what steps can be taken to assess over time any change in the socio-economic mix of the student population and the clarification of the position relating to Aboriginal students. To help keep track of the impact HECS is having on various groups which may be adversely affected by it, a professor from the Department of Social Work and Social Policy at the University of Sydney has been commissioned to prepare a proposal for a survey of thqse groups. The groups to be surveyed will include part time and external students, older people who are not recent school Ie avers, people living in rural areas, people with a nonEnglish speaking background, people with disadvantaged educational backgrounds and people of low socio-economic status. Income earners with dependants may also be studied. According to an article in the spring 1990 edition of The Australian Quarterly entitled 'Labor's economic policies in higher education': Economic thinking is visible . . . in the Government's-, higher educationpolicies. Higher education is treated as a sub-set of the economy. . There is some evidence that in terms of the labour markets, the approach is a viable one. Graduate employment data issued by the University of Sydney Careers and Appointments Service shows that 43.1 per cent of those university uates in the humanities who entered the workforce in 1988 went to industry and commerce, compared to 39.1 per cent of all graduates. While the average salaries of all graduates increased 140 per cent in money terms between 1977 and 1988, the average starting sa,lary of humanities graduates employed in industry and commerce rose by 160 per cent. The article continued: The Government's intention is to strengthen the vocational nature of fee-based courses. It wants market-based courses to be sites of student investment . . . The underlying economic theory is that if the processes of education and training are given a market form this will both produce greater efficiency, and create a direct relationship between the output of higher education and the training and research needs of private industry. Clearly, our Government's actions in higher education are being commended not only by people. who are directly affected by higher education policies, but also by others in the community with some knowledge of the education system. It is being recognised by the public at large that the Hawke Labor Government is encouraging and installing higher education policies which are more equitable and more economically viable. One particular higher education policy which is designed to make higher education institutions more accountable for the grants and funding they receive arid which has recently received criticism from ill-informed representatives of the Opposition, is the educational profiles system. Under this system, a higher education institution must now submit to the Commonwealth Government an outline of its broad mission"" together with its teaching and research responsibilities and its particular areas of activity and specified goals. This will become the basis on which the institution will receive Commonwealth funding. Educational profiles therefore allow the institution the freedom to manage its own affairs with the need for public accountability. The educational profiles process is, like HECS, constantly reviewed and assessed. The Higher Education Council, which is an independent body, must report regularly to the Parliament on the success of the system. In these reports to Parliament gradthe Higher Education Council has said that the educational profiles system i& working well. To prove this to the House by and to honourable members opposite I will quote from the Council's third and fourth reports, its most recent reports, to the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. It was stated: The Council considers that the development of the educational profiles process has been satisfactory. In its February report to the Board, the Council gave a detailed account of the profiles process in 1989 and expressed its general satisfaction with the development of the process. Early in 1990 the educational profiles system was reviewed by the Higher Education Council. It has been proved that it is working and is successful. Again, this is an initiative which is designed to increase efficiency in the higher education system and to launch Australia into being the clever country. It will not be easy establishing Australia as the clever country, but we can do it with the types of policies and initiatives that this Government is enforcing. We will become the clever country.",59
87,Mr CHARLES,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"1 will confine my remarks today in this cognate debate on the education Bills to the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill 1991, as I dealt rather comprehens!yely with the issue of higher education in debate last month on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1991. This Bill is largely an account keeping exercise to bring education accounting into line with practice. While having no significant objection to the technical money transfer, I would like to use this opportunity to debate further an issue that is critical to the concepts of micro-economic reform, equity in education opportunity and useable outcomes. That issue is skills training. In the last few years we have witnessed a dramatic increase in retention rates of students continuing to year 12 in secondary schools. That increase is surely the result of a whole host of factors which include: firstly, a shift away from skills training; secondly, high youth unemployment rates; thirdly, a change in community attitudes; and, fourthly, Austudy for secondary students from the age of 16. To the extent that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) has been responsible for that increase, I offer him my clear congratulations. But the question must be asked: for what reason have we increased retention rates? Is it because we want to keep students off the street, because there is no longer work available for unskilled and untrained people, because we have decided that academic achievement ultimately produces social goals in its own right or because we really want to be the clever country that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) so frequently talks about? Has consideration been given to surveying the academic results of Austudy recipients? If the students in receipt of Austudy were' on unemployment benefits they would have to satisfy a work seeking test to retain the benefit. Perhaps the real story would then unfold as to whether students are staying at school longer in order to improve their educational standards or whether it is simply a mechanism to keep them out of the dole queues which grow longer every day. In mentioning the Prime Minister, I cannot help noting that in his recent industry statement entitled Building a competitive Australia, he stated: I have repeatedly stated my pride in our achieve the ments in virtually doubling the school retention rate and expanding the number of tertiary places. That is a bit of hyperbole that I cannot wear because we have not doubled school retention rates at all. Since the introduction of Austudy, which corresponds with the Minister's increasing emphasis on increasing retention rates, the real figures have risen from 48.7 per cent to approximately 61 per cent. Based on the Prime Minister's hyperbole we would have percentage retention rates today in the high 90s. Clearly, we are a long way from that result. While increasing numbers of our youth are staying on to year 12 in secondary school, technical and further· education (TAFE) populations are expanding and our universities are seeing an unprecedented demand for places. The dynamics of this increase in education have set in train a series of real problems. Industry in general believes that it is experiencing a decrease in attainment level by those youths presenting today for apprenticeships. One might say that that is not a problem if, correspondingly, the increase in education attainment by those going on from year 12 to some tertiary training ultimately provides industry with better quality inputs overall. The immediate problem, however, which is unlikely to be solved in the near future, is that in certain specific skills areas, such as electronics, electrics and mechanics, the number of youths seeking apprenticeships and the apprenticeship training in those specific work classifications has not reduced in number but has reduced in terms of capability. We are experiencing a shortfall in actual training outputs for apprentices in those skill need areas. Industry in general believes that changing community atti· tudes suggest that work with clean hands is somehow more desirable and somehow more socially acceptable. That is a real problem. Community attitudes are always important and, ultimately, are critical to any attempt that we might make to become the more clever country. We might want to be clever, but if our youth believe that jobs in the bureaucracy, the arts or social services have higher status than those in industry, then we might do a better job ultimately in providing social services while failing industry, which provides the real economic benefit that allows us to pay for the social services in the first place. Changing attitudes is a difficult problem, but one that we must urgently address. In the electorate, a member of parliament constantly hears reference to schools and teachers that do not understand industry and, therefore, do not direct their students in an industrial direction. Somehow, we seem to value the social sciences more than we do the technical sciences. I would suggest to the Minister that government emphasis and direction should be towards dramatically changing community attitudes in that respect if we really want to develop modern, high technology, highly productive industry to give us the value added that we keep talking about, and allow us to maintain our standard of, living. Another problem that government is faced with today, w,ith the increase in retention rates, is increasing pressure on universities, colleges of advanced education and technical and further education. These sorts of pressures require additional funding. They also require teachers or trainers. There is a great deal of evidence that suggests that teacher training requires urgent attention. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has launched one more board, called the national project on the quality of teaching and learning. This particular little bureaucracy is now to look into ways of improving the status of teaching as a profession, and enhancing the quality of teaching in the classroom. I have spoken before about this little exercise, which is made up of 12 members from the educational bureaucracy and 12 members from the teacher unions. I tell the Minister once again that if he really wants to find out how to improve the status of teaching in the community, and how to improve the quality of teaching in the classroom, he could find more appropriate representatives. If the community ultimately decides the status of teaching as a profession, then' the community deserves to have the right to have major input into any such inquiry. In any case, the point is that we have a problem with teacher training, and we have a dramatic shortfall in the number of qualified teachers across all sectors of education-from primary and secondary to tertiary and technical training. In some respects that is a good problem to have in that it indicates that we are headed in a direction of increase in education and training, which must overall, ultimately, be positive for Australia. On the other hand, we musttirgently find the resources to improve teacher salaries and education paths so that we can attract into the profession top quality, dedicated individuals who want to learn how to teach our youth. I find it ironic that teacher unions, which claim to want the best for their members, to a large extent are responsible for the decline in the status of our teachers. Uniformity leads to mediocrity, and mediocrity breeds community contempt. A major industry leader in the United States recently called on the school system there to produce students who are educated to high academic standards with excellent literacy skills. He believes that if industry is given inputs who are able to think critically, have good reading, writing and mathematical skills, and have the ability to learn, industry can impart to those inputs the skills they need to work in any particular industrial situation. Others, however, are calling for discrete skills training at a reasonably young' age for some substantial proportion of youth who will work in industry at a wages level. Regardless of which direction is best, we must decide what is most appropriate for Australia. We need the best deal for our youth, the best chance for their ultimate useful employment, and the best chance for increasing national productivity. Once upon a time we had a system of technical high schools which operated in parallel with the central general academic high school system. In the past decade we have dispensed with those technical high schools because community attitudes have changed. The community or the educational bureaucracy-or both-came to the conclusion that training to be a plumber or a carpenter or a motor mechanic or a spray painter or an electrician did not offer the social or economic benefits afforded to those in government bureaucracy or social services. It is an enigma, is it not, that a good plumber today earns at least twice what a good teacher can earn, and yet we do little to encourage young people to become plumbers. As our manufacturing moves through this decade towards more intensive production and more technologically based production, the skills training level of people involved in those manufacturing At processes will need to be raised substanperforming tially. It is clear that education has bein come an ongoing process for everyone in acterises society. Technology is changing rapidly, tations ensuring that skills training will become an ongoing experience, and one which is Excellence highly necessary. The real decision that we have to make is the balance of skills training provision between the private sector, the public tor and our schools system. At the moour ment we seem hell-bent on increasing retention rates in secondary schools for academic training, without regard for the ultimate work situation destination of students. What we need is a balanced proach which will include a multiplicity of providers of skills training qualifications. Clearly, private industry has jor role to play in the future of skills training provision in our country. National and State training board iniperhaps tiatives towards transportable and nationally recognised certification must encouraged. For too long we have allowed the situation where the skills of an indiper vidual, qualified by industry or by the armed forces, go unrecognised outside their specific areas. Our population and our work force have become much more mobile in the last decade, and we must allow individuals the opportunity to take certification of their qualifications with them. It is also imperative that TAFE not be the only provider of skills training, that we encourage the investment by inyear 12. dustry in skills qualifications. It is my view that we will solve many of our problems in the skills training area by reducing the bureaucratic stranglehold of skills training provision responsibility to allow a multiplicity of providers. There is no doubt that T AFE has done a mammoth job, but in some respects its general attempt to be all things honourable member to all people has stifled real, innovative development in skills training provision. In 1983 the report of the National Commission on Excellence in Education higher in the United States defined excellence follows: the level of the individual learner, it means on the boundary of individual ability in ways that test and push back personal limits, school and in the work place. Excellence chara school or college that sets high expecand goals for all learners, then tries in every way possible to help students reach them. characterises a society that has adopted these policies, for it will then be prepared through the education and skill of its people to respond to the challenges of a rapidly changing world. Surely we should set no lesser goal for seceducation in Australia, whether it be in schools, our skills training institutions or our universities of higher learning. It is impossible, I would argue, to attain that goal of excellence by regulation or bureauthe cratic control. The goal will be reached aponly through allowing a multiplicity of providers freely competing. To some extent it would be desirable if a maindustry could define exactly what it expects from the education system. If industry only wants well-educated inputs, we can leave it to TAFE, industry providers and other private providers to be undertake the skills training. Unfortunately there is no such thing as 'industry' se, and obtaining uniform agreement across all industry, business and commerce in Australia would be impossible. So the chances are that we need a balance between general academic schooling and specific skills training. I believe that balance will ultimately include skills training provision within our secondary schools, or at least within the state sysand tem, and commencing much earlier than",63

89,Mr TAYLOR,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Delighted, Mr Deputy Speaker. I wholeheartedly support the comments of the for La Trobe (Mr Charles), and in my contribution I will expand on one or two of those points as well. I would like to concentrate on the education aspects of these two Bills, as the Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill and the Higher EClucation Funding Amendment Bill, and in so doing would like, firstly, to speak briefly on the philosophy of Australian higher education and, secondly, to explode some of the myths about the general acceptance of the associated Dawkins concepts. Firstly, I refer the House to some criticisms that the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) made about educational profiles during the last sitting period and, in particular, his criticism of the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) on that point. I would just say to the Minister and to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon), who is at the table, that the honourable member for Goldstein is not alone in his criticisms of this aspect of the higher education system. Indeed, my local feedback is much the same and it continues to be an administrative nightmare, which of course continues to smack of undue central control. As I recall it, the Minister made a point about the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee (AVCC) and said that profiles were a good thing. Perhaps they are, but I would only say to the Minister that it seems to me and to a lot of other people that the AVCC is increasingly becoming part of the Government's decision-making process. Whilst I am reluctant to use the word 'politicisation', I can only conclude that it seems that that particular body is becoming an increasing captive of government policy. Turning to the philosophical aspects of higher education, let me repeat in part what I said in this place about 18 months ago. I said that Australia is a modern industrial nation with the potential to develop into a leading technologically advanced society with enhanced economic, social and cultural prospects for all its citizens. However, this progress will not occur automatically, nor is there unlimited time, I would suggest, for its pursuit and successful achievement. Australia's future prosperity will depend on our willingness to push back the frontiers of knowledge, to exploit new alternatives, to experiment with new solutions and to adopt proven advancements. However, economic advancement is not in itself enough, I would suggest. The extent to which we use our prosperity to widen and deepen our culture and to improve the quality of our lives will depend greatly on our capacity to provide our youth with a sound, liberal education at school level and beyond. A strong, dynamic, expanding and forward-looking higher education system is therefore central to Australia's chances of realising its proper destiny into the twenty-first century. Higher education in Australia remains at the crossroads. In terms of a broader national interest, such an educational system should contribute to our economic development through growth of exploitable knowledge, stimulation of imagination, innovation, entrepreneurship and, indeed, industry. It should contribute to our social development by helping to nurture mutual respect amongst free individuals, to safeguard personal freedoms and to promote tolerance and to champion excellence in human endeavour. Finally, it· should contribute to our cultural enhancement or enrichment through the study of our intellectual and artistic heritage and the advancement of knowledge and achievement in the humanities, in the arts, in the sciences and in the technologies. For the higher education system to meet these expectations, it must enjoy the confidence of its students, the academic staff and the community as a whole. It must also have assured sources of funds for expansion where appropriate and for continuing improvements in quality. Each institution should have sufficient freedom to determine its own direction and goals, subject to reasonable systems of public accountability for the use of taxpayers' funds. A more effective higher education system is central to efforts to innovate industry, to raise the work force. abilities and to guarantee rising living standards in the future. Higher education must therefore provide an environment of expanding opportunity to satisfy the demands of young people and others seeking to enhance their careers and to broaden assert their knowledge. The great challenge is to expand that e-ery capacity and to improve the quality. The cause capacity of institutions to respond flexibly to changes in the external environment the and to upgrade their standards of acapursuit demic and administrative performance has been reduced by, in my view, inapproAustralia priate internal structures and excessive governmental regulation, as indeed the honourable member for La Trobe stated previously. The present Government's solution lies principally in what some have referred as 'the iron fist in the velvet glove apever, proach' of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) wherein public tertiary institutions join new unified system which largely removes the distinction between colleges and versities and wherein all public institumented tions are invited to submit educational profiles setting out their broad plus a whole range of details on student Not loads, intakes, teaching duties and a willone ingness to achieve national priorities, innot cluding equity. Predictably there is a well-trained, plethora of views on this so-called Dawkand ins model. About 50 years ago a famous American educator, Abraham Flexner, reviewed the social role of universities in three different countries: Britain, Germany and the United States. He distinguished two it,. .. extreme views of university education: the rule service station concept and the concept. Since the Second Wodd War the importance of science and technology the modern economy has promoted the popularity of a third model which might be called the powerhouse concept. The principal ambition of Ministers Dawkins and Baldwin appears to be to enhance powerhouse aspect of Australian universgovernment ities. Regrettably, they take the service tion. He said: station function for granted and, seemingly, they neglect the ivory tower or culsuitneither tural function of university education. As Professor Sol Encel said a couple of years ago: Any substantial improvement in the sItuation of universities should be based on an attempt to that their functions are autonomous and cultural as well as purely instrumental. The distinction is, of course, largely artificial. In practice, institution of higher education exists beof social demands. Its quality depends not only on how well it fulfils those demands but on the extent, it can at the same time, and within frame work of its social purpose, develop the of learning for its own sake. has demonstrated over many decades that it possesses a strong native inventive genius and has produced very many academics of distinction, though perhaps this has taken place somewhat against the grain, in spite of rather than because of our institutional structures. We to are arguably an egalitarian society. HowI suggest there has been a hindrance in Australia's intellectual growth primarily because this egalitarianism has had a a soft shadow of anti-intellectualism. Elitism has remained a highly politicised and unicoloured concept. As Andrew Field comin part in the April 1989 edition of Quadrant in an article titled 'The objectives Dawkins Disaster': everyone should be at university, but everyat university should be there on ability and because of social advantage and should emerge just as it is a good thing f()r them for us to have our bakers well-trained rather than people opening pre-mixed sacks from a centralised supplier. Cardinal Newman, that well-known theologian, once described the role of universvery ities in the following terms: to open the mind, to correct it, to refine to enable it to know and to digest, to master and use its knowledge, and to give it power ivory tower over its own faculties. in Most recently, at the beginning of the academic year at Queensland University, the Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane, the well-known Archbishop Peter Hollingworth, said that in Australia universities the are being endangered by unwarranted and bureaucratic interven. . . the special business of a liberal education is business nor bureaucracy, but the purof truth. He finished by saying: The emphasis is-as the jargon has it-on product accountability, performance-based evaluation, and measurable outcomes, rather than on truth, pursued for its own sake, in a free environment. It seems to me therefore that all government policy with respect to higher education must be assessed against the criteria of quality and opportunity. We on this side of the House reject the idea that higher education has only one uniform rule-that is, training. Higher education in Australia at this moment is suffering the consequences of a forced industry restructuring in which the system is being brought under increasing and direct political control from Canberra.",66
90,Unknown,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.,69
91,Mr TAYLOR,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"As I was saying before the break, it seems to me that higher education in Australia at the moment is suffering the consequences of a forced industry restructuring instead of attempting to provide a stimulating and motivating environment which would encourage managerial initiative, planning and academic excellence. Instead, the Government has sought to force change by bureaucratic intervention and central dictation. Many of the real issues of higher education remain either unaddressed or have been exacerbated by the undermining of institutional autonomy; for example, the ensuring of an expanded flow of graduates of the highest quality, the maintenance of a first-class effort in basic research, a more effective commercialisation of the results of research, and access for students to a wide and diverse range of opportunities for vocational training. No reasonable person would dispute that tertiary education was in need of change. The basic issue is how change should have been brought about-in other words, the process of educational microreform and what changes should have been sought through this process. It would ·be fair to say that the Government has forced some changes which were neither desirable nor necessary. On the question of student numbers, we have seen the number of students passing through the system in 1990 increase by 75,000 compared with 1983, but with reduced funding per effective full time student by about 12 per cent. In the area of research, it has been pursued erratically and this is threatening the quality of much of the national research effort. In the case of staffing, staff salaries have declined by up to a third relative to average earnings since 1974, whereas at the same time staff workloads have increased, promotional opportunities have been reduced and research funding is more difficult to obtain. Some will argue that there is a projected shortage of some 25,000 staff by the year 2000 in the absence of significant and positive changes in staff . conditions. Since 1973, when the Whitlam Government abolished fees and established the so-called free tertiary education, higher education in Australia has been financially bound, like the States, to the chariot wheels of the Commonwealth. It has operated within a rigid framework of regulation which has restricted and frustrated the capacity of tertiary institutions to compete for staff, students and resources. It is this framework and the more recent experience of change by political fiat which lies at the heart of many of the problems· of higher education of today. The Government, in my view, has failed to give institutions the flexibility to offer Australian students additional places on terms acceptable to both. It is not surprising, therefore, that a Government senator, Senator Aulich, as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, was forced by evidence presented to his Committee to acknowledge that Minister Dawkins was so absorbed in financial and structural change that he was neglecting the really fundamental issue of quality. In fact, Dr Runcie, an academic, in an article to the Australian Financial Review on 26 March this year, said, in part: . . . the universities are suffering from more than administrative overkill. They are suffering from Canberra bureaucrats and politicians who fancy themselves as philosophers and have thought up the clever analogy between a university and a business corporation. He goes on to say: . . . university staffs are being hustled and hurried, while the government steals academic time by making academics fill in forms and fill out i CVs and, as members of the peer group assessment schemes, unduly peer at each other. He continued: . . . universities must always be places where wildcards are possible and cannot be ""routinised"". He concluded: Pseudo-thinking from Canberra is stealing both time and academic integrity from the nation's universities. The verdict of Professor Peter Karmel in August 1989 on the Dawkins reforms was mixed. He questioned the need for such wide ranging changes, given the excellence of the higher education system, and was highly critical of some of the developments. On the question of universities versus technical and further education, he questioned whether the expansion in postschool education should occur primarily in universities or at the skills level through T AFE, and argued that more investigation was needed on this issue. On deregulation or control, he argued that the Federal Government is now intervening more in the institutions and warned that the bureaucratic tendency to coordinatea euphemism for control, he said-must be watched closely. With the end of the binary system, he said that there were dangers in the abolition of colleges because of the potential loss of diversity of courses. He also warned against spreading research resources over the whole system in a way which would prejudice the scholarly and research capacity of major institutions. He said that the search for an artificial equality across the system would only prejudice the performance of the top institutions. On amalgamations, he argued that the changes have produced a cult of the big. While some amalgamations made sense, others did not. He said that there was no virtue in size for its own sake and a risk that the whole system would become homogenised with the special characteristics of universities and colleges of advanced education being lost. On the knowledge business, he rejected the notion that universities have to run like businesses but suggested that the il1stitutions must adopt a more managerial approach, become more performance oriented, and seek alternative sources of money. Finally, he said: We need to proclaim loud and clear that the institutions have served Australia well over a long period. We need to insist that the special characteristics of institutions of higher education must be recognised and that they are neither business nor bureaucracy. We must assert that they are engaged in the pursuit of truth in the widest sense and their ethos cannot be one of a . narrow instrumentalism. We must avoid artificial and contrived structural changes. Finally, and perhaps above all, we must resist unwarranted political and bureaucratic intervention and argue for a return to the days when the institutions were at arms length from the Government. The late Professor John Ward was also very critical in the last article that he wrote in the Australian of 16 May last year, when he said: The present insistence on making educational policy part of a national strategy aiming for prosperity and national development has much to be said in its favour in the hard conditions of economic life. But it is a policy which, if pursued with too much singleness of purpose as it sometimes has been in recent years, can only weaken higher education and begin to deprive Australia of the benefits of universities serving knowledge with high standards both in research and in teaching. As John Ward did, I oppose moves in the educational sphere inherent in these Bills that result in-and I use his description'strangulation by regulation'. On the other hand, I welcome those aspects of the so called Dawkins model which will bring higher education in Australia into a .more modern era. However, the fundamental issues for debate remain both practical and philosophical. It seems to me that there is a serious danger that an undiluted dose of the Dawkins-Baldwin higher educational cure has the potential to be more painful than the disease and, in the extreme, may even kill the patient.",69
92,Mr SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,I call the honourable member for Cowper.,70
93,Mr NEHL,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING," Mr Speaker, I am gratified that you are able to recognise the honourable member for Cowper and give me the call.",70
94,Mr SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,It is always a pleasure to recognise the honourable member for Cowper.,70
95,Mr NEHL,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I am sure, Mr Speaker, you will always find it so, and I trust and hope that you will continue to find it a pleasure to see me in this place and in any other place as well. That being the case, you will readily acknowledge that Australia and indeed the world are becoming rapidly involved in what is properly called the information society. In fact, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Long Term Strategies, chaired by the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones)-of which Committee I have the pleasure of being a member-is conducting a public inquiry into the position of Australia as an information society. I suppose that when one is looking at information an,d education, whether it be at a university, a TAFE college or a school, each could be described as a conduit of knowledge and information. We have changed and grown so much in a matter of decades or centuries; the changes have been enormous. One of the major steps forward in the conduct of information and education, if honourable members accept the extrapolation, was in 1850 when the first cable was installed from Britain to France. In 1858 Australia was right up there with the rest; the cable was installed from Melbourne to Tasmania to provide that flow of information. In 1866 cable communication was established between Britain and north America. John McDouall Stuart crossed Australia in 1860. Mr Biiney-'MCDool', we say in South Australia.",71
96,Mr NEHL,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I accept the direction from the Minister at the table. Stuart crossed Australia in 1860, and between 1870 and 1872 the overland telegraph was installed between Port Augusta and Darwin-a significant growth in the flow of information and knowledge, and in the expansion of education. Just to conclude this little introductory comment-the cable was installed from Perth to Adelaide between 1875 and 1877. I use the analogy of those cables, which were such a breakthrough, to really describe what education should be. It should be an exciting, vital breakthrough for every individual who comes in contact with the education process at whatever level. Education is the key to the future success, not just of Australia but also of the whole world and its economy, and for individuals. If one looks at disadvantaged people, such as Aboriginals, within our community one sees that for them the key has to be education. The honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) spoke earlier about motivation and the need for motivation. Of course he is totally right. He spoke about the need to have teachers motivated to teach and parents motivated to have their kids receive an education. Of course the kids themselves-and I use the term loosely for young Australian boys and girls and men and women-need to be motivated to see the value and benefit of pursuing knowledge and education. In a way that means we still have to undertake a major change of attitude in our society. We have to change attitudes so that people respect achievement and admire ability, and we have to stop knocking success because all too often that is what we have done. We have to have a society where achievement is recognised. One of the achievements I would like to speak about in this debate tonight is the achievement of a new campus for the University of New England, which is situated at Coifs Harbour. I am particularly pleased that this has come to fruition after a great deal of hard work by a very large number of people, in particular Alderman Mamie Yeates, who is the head of the Coifs Harbour City Council's university committee. I think it is worth noting that in October 1990 the University of New England's Coifs Harbour centre had its status altered to make it a constituent part of the University itself. The opportunity for the development of a new campus has been enthusiastically addressed by the local community. I will not go into the details, but the provision of a magnificent site has come about because of cooperation between the Coifs Harbour City Council and the Coifs Harbour Returned Services Club. The triennium funding at present will provide $2.1m in 1993 for that site development and the master plan envisages joint use of the facilities not only by the University but also by TAFE and hopefully a high-tech high school, which we expect will be established there as well. Teaching began in Coffs Harbour at the beginning of 1989 with an enrolment of 48 students in the degrees of Bachelor of Financial Administration and Bachelor of EconomiCs. I know from the earlier debate that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) will not necessarily see it as being relevant to the development and benefit of a community, but even 48 students to start with is a major development and a major step forward. A further 16 students began similar programs in July. In 1990 the teaching of second year courses in these degrees, with an intake of 100 new students, raised the number in the institution to 150. In 1991, the total student number is around 300. It is a major step in the development of educational facilities in that area. I am pleased to report to the Parliament that Dr Susan Bambrick has been appointed the first Director of the University of New England, Coffs Harbour. Already there are 10 resident academic staff, and when library administrative staff and part time tutors are included, there are 30 staff involved at the University of New England at Coffs Harbour. As I said, the proposed capital program for Coffs Harbour will begin in 1993 and it is expected that it will grow to a total of $77m by the year 2004, when we expect to have 5,000 students. By then academic and administrative staff should number over 1,000, with a weekly payroll in today's terms in excess of some $500,000. This is a significant step forward not just in education terms but also in economic terms for the community it will serve. At the other end of my electorate, right in the beautiful Hastings Valley, there is another exciting project where a group of local people have worked for some years on the proposal to have a Hastings International University. They hope and expect that it will certainly come to fruition in the 1990s. I would like to commend them for their enthusiasm because it is too easy when one talks about having a private university for people to look at the Bond University experience and just become knockers. The reality is that while the Bond University has had some financial difficulties-for obvious reasons-and has had to close its science faculty, in terms of pursuing the purpose of a university and doing the job of a university it has been very successful indeed. The Hastings International University has been on the drawing board for two years and recently it was handed over to a community committee for further development and it means to pursue funding for the university. It is going to raise $100,000 within six months to finance the preparation of an investment prospectus, complete all documentation and legal structure for the university as well as to prepare a formal submission to the State Government to get the institution off the ground. I think it is very interesting to note that among the people backing this move are the former Chief Executive of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Dr Keith Boardman; the former Vice Chancellor of Sydney University, Sir Bruce Williams; the Deputy Chancellor of Sydney University and former Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Dame Leonie Kramer; the Dean of the School of Agricultural Economics, Professor Warren Musgrave; the corporate planner. of the CSIRO, Mr Don MACRae; and many others. The University expects to take in its first students in June next year, and I look forward to that coming to fruition. As I said, education is vital. 'It is the key to success for Australia. I am very delighted that people in my own electorate are actually taking the initiative to make sure we get universities moving on. I was interested to read in the editorial in yesterday's Australian: University enrolments are soaring, and even with the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, resources are stretched to breaking point. It is not enough even to reintroduce fees supported by generous Commonwealth scholarships and grants. The whole purpose of higher education has to be fundamentally re-examined. It went on to say: In his thought-provoking essay-Do We Need Universities?-Pierre Ryckmans, Professor of Chinese at Sydney University, states the concept of a university simply. It is ""a place where as seek truth, pursue and transmit knowledge for knowledge's sake-irrespective of the consequences, implications and utility of the endeavour"". Of course, that is a very pure view of the role of a university. I am not such purist. I believe that a university certainly has a major role to play in the training undergraduates. I do not accept the argulated ment of the Australian's editorial that, apart from such faculties as medicine, and dentistry, all vocational training should be taken away from universities and placed in other institutions. I do not believe that is the way to go. It is interesting to consider what honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) said earlier in this debate. She said: Higher education should not be the preserve the relatively privileged in the community. That is a sentiment with which I, and I am sure every member in this place, would agree wholeheartedly. The honourable member for Prospect was talking about wealth, I guess, but I am prompted to think of the discrimination that takes against people living in country Australia, people residing in rural, provincial and non-metropolitan Australia. I heard it this morning that only 9 per cent of coun580-of try people go on to tertiary education rolments. compared to 27 per cent of city people. I think that is evidence of great discrimihas nation, which is why I am so overjoyed that the University of New England is expanding out of Armidale, is associated with what used to be the Richmond Aboriginal College of Advanced Education and is now establishing a campus in Coffs Harapplies bour and that it is proposed to have an international university in Port Macquarie-Mr Bilney-It's almost as bad in outer suburbs as well.",71
97,Mr NEHL,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"What the Minister says apprenticeships may be so, except that the statistics apply to those metropolitan areas. There may be variations between them, but with the University of Western Sydney being esearlier tablished, certainly at least in metropolinumbered tan Sydney, there is going to be a vast ceed last year's. and major correction of any imbalance scholthat may have occurred within that metropolitan area. The funding for 1991 for that university is $76.471m to cater for about 5,000 students; in 1993 that will grow to $99.72m to cater for about 5,000 a students. I do not knock that at all. I think that is a major step forward, but I of want to see it emulated in the more isoareas of Australia as well, so that people on the north coast of New South law Wales and in similar areas can have access to that very important opportunity of a university education. At least they already have excellent technical and further education facilities. the I place on record my great pride in the various T AFE colleges throughout my electorate. The Coffs Harbour TAFE college, which has a new school of rural of studies and which had almost a 100 per cent increase in joint TAPE school· courses from 90 to 172 in. 1990, is going from strength to strength. The effective full time student numbers rose from 830 in 1988 to 849 in 1989 and to 865 in 1990. Again, the Macksville T AFE college, which is in place the Nambucca Valley with an annexe at Bowraville, has gone from strength to strength. Enrolments in March last year said were 460; in March this year they were course, that was 'not for full enEven in the Nambucca Valley, which a small community, the TAFE college is offering courses in office administration, fashion, computer studies, and special courses, I am pleased to see, on education, Japanese language, broadcasting and stained glass. The same to the Kempsey T AFE college in the Maclean Valley, which has a special Aboriginal education unit conducting courses for a large number of students. It has special labour market programs, courses for students with disabilities, trade for school leavers and a retraining and new skills program. The growth there is of the same order: in 1990 there was a total enrolment of 1,350 and, on this year, enrolments already 1,150 and were expected to exIn Port Macquarie the T AFE college in 1990 employed more than 226 part time and full time staff in both teaching and non-teaching areas. To stress the value of education not only to the individual but also to the community in terms of the economics, there is a salary of more than $4.5m, providing another important resource for the local economy. Enrolments were up 5 per cent last year on the 19.89 figure to 2,635; the 1990 students Increased the participation rate by 21 per cent. So it goes on with the TAFE college in Wauchope, also in the Hastings Valley. Tonight is the night of presentation of awards and academic certificates at the Wauchope TAFE, so it is appropriate that I pay tribute to it with its total enrolments of 756 and its courses in office administration, typewriting, teaching and building. The pre-apprenticeship students actually built two cottages and handed them over to the department of housing. I think that it is easy to disregard what people. are doing at this level. I am a tremendous advocate of university education, but at the same time. I think somebody said this earlier in the debate-there also has to be a place for people who are prepared to get cement on their hands or work with dirty hands. We cannot all sit in air conditioned environments and probably most of us who do would' be better if we did not. We would certainly be healthier. I conclude by making reference to what I see as a third level-people would probably sneer if I said that this was .higher education-that is, further educatIon. It is extremely valuable. I am speaking about Skillshare. This is another activity going on in the electorate-in the country right around Australia-and I know that there are some places where it has not worked well. In the last election the coalition icy was to abolish Skillshare. I place on record that the Skillshare operations that I know are first rate and they would be the examples that I would hope might see us revise that policy. The Hastings Skillshare is a joint venture involving the St Joseph's Vocational College. I have spoken to the Parliament before about that college and the tremendous job that it is doing. In Hastings the total number of people involved in Skillshare was 269, with a placement rate of 34.5 per cent. That is pretty good. I will move further back up the electorate to Kempsey. Kempsey Advisory Training Enterprises is not a government department, it tenders for funding to provide these services. In 1990 it had approximately $600,000 to administer eight major programs of which Skillshare was the first and most important. In 1990 a total of 440 people participated in training programs conducted at - eJ!lpsey Skillshare. Over 850 people partICIpated in the full range, 30 per cent above what was anticipated. It had tremendous community support and-",73

99,Mr BRADFORD,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"MCPherson) (8.29)Tonight we are dealing with two Bills: the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1991 and the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill 1991. The purpose of the first mentioned Bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 in order to provide cost supplementation fundings for States, Territories and higher education facilities. The purpose of the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill is to provide supplementation funding for technical and further education for 1991 and to make adjustments for the transfer of funding from the technical and further education (TAFE) sector to the higher education sector. Neither of these Bills is, of itself, particularly exciting in its content. In fact, as far as the Opposition is concerned, in neither case are the measures proposed by the Government in any particular sense objectionable. The honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) has moved an polamendment to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill, which reads, inter alia: . . . the House deplores the Government's continued mismanagement of higher education, an-, in particular, it deplores the Government's failure to provide the sector with the flexibili,ty and incentives it needs to address the academIC staff shortage, and to provide for adequate opportunities to meet the diverse educational needs students. I would have thought that, whilst the Bills themselves are not particularly contenthe tious, the amendment moved by the ister Opposition is certainly worthy of debate; yet I note that only one Government pivotal speaker in the course of this debate been prepared to address any of the issues at all. I am the sixth member of the have Opposition to speak-we have had six a row st.and to speak-in support of our amendment. I wonder whether the GovGovernment's ernment is going to concede the points that we are making here. We have heard nothing to the contrary from it, and I wonder how seriously it takes this whole issue of higher education. Certainly, on our side of the House we take it seriously. When Bills such as these are before us for debate-particularly when we move an amendment such as we have moved which is of some substance-we expect Government ment members to respond by debating these issues with us. Where are they? The respects. only Government member in the House is the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney).

I am aware that he is an knowledge that fact. educated man, but I am not sure whether he is ready or prepared to make a contriwhich bution in this debate. Perhaps being only Government member in the House he may see fit to do so at a later stage. number of speakers on this side in the debate have already said that the issue education and training for the Australian work force is very important. It has ticularly come into focus in the last to five years as it has finally dawned upon us here in Australia that we can nQ longer rely upon luck for our future prosperity. I suppose it could be said that our ran out when we were forced to recognise the facts of economic life in the context of a new world economic order, if you ability like, which demands of us that we actually earn our living. It became apparent-it ther their studies. of has been alluded to a number of times in this debate already-that, if we were to do this, we would have to become, to use now famous words of the Prime Min(Mr Hawke), a 'clever country'. Of course, education and training will playa role in this process of Australia's has becoming a clever country. I rise here tonight, as others have done, to address both the amendment that we moved and some particular aspects in of the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill. I wish to point to the incompetence in this pivotal area. It gives me no great pleasure to do so for, as I have said, we on this side do take the issues of education and training particularly seriously. I do not believe it is a coincidence that the dire economic circumstances in which Australia now finds itself are actually within the context, if you like, of a poorly trained and, I admit-lest somebody from the Governdoes come into debate the issuea poorly managed work force in many The Opposition has been prepared to be even-handed about this issue in the number of opportunities that we have had talk about it here in this place. We recognise that the work force is lacking; but so is management in many respects as its level of training and expertise concerned, and we are prepared to acI support very strongly the amendment I read earlier and which the the honourable member for Goldstein moved earlier in this debate. I do not think it A really takes a particularly close examination of the Government's performance of to come to the conclusion, as we on this side have done, that the Government is parseriously lacking in the area of higher three education policy. The honourable member for Goldstein, during his contribution, pointed out the problems that the Australian tertiary institutions have faced with luck the Government's imposed amalgamation procedures, its rigid and oppressive profile funding mechanisms and its total into provide tertiary places for those Australians who desperately want to furThe irony of the Government's inability to provide those tertiary places is that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) gets up and gloats 'about his achievements and points-quite correctly, I suppose-to increased participation rates in secondary education. There are a number of reasons why that has occurred. Obviously, kids are staying at school because they cannot get jobs if they leave. To some extent, the pressure is on them to stay at school so that they can be better educated and have a better chance of getting a job. There is no doubt that the provision of Austudy to secondary students has also encouraged them to stay at school. But what the Government has failed to do, in terms of managing the situation, has been to recognise that these increased participation rates would heighten the expectations of children leaving school in terms of where they would want to go. Obviously they now want to go on-in much greater numbers than was the case in the past-to tertiary education. That may mean that they choose to go to university or to a technical and further education college. But in both cases many of them now find, having had their expectations for their education increased by being encouraged to stay at school for those extra two years, that they are being met with a 'no vacancy' sign outside the universities and the T AFE colleges. I think this is a terrible indictment. I am thinking in particular tonight about my own State of Queensland, where probably the worse situation in Australia exists in terms of unavailability of tertiary education places both at universities and at T AFE colleges. The Government deserves to be condemned entirely and I do it tonight on behalf of those many students around Australia who have missed out on going on to tertiary education because of the Government's ineptitude in this particular area. I spoke a few weeks ago about the university college that is in my own backyard, in my electorate-the university college of Griffith University, formerly the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education. It had a quota for new student places this year, 1991, of 737. Let me put that in this context: the first preference demand for these places through the Queensland Tertiary Admissions Centre was 2,131. I will not attempt to do a bit of quick maths but, roughly, 1,300 or so students missed out. That is only the first preference demand that I am talking about. The situation gets even worse when one considers. that the current student population of 2,405 at the Gold Coast college of Griffith University is being housed in totally inadequate facilities awaiting the completion of stage two, which was promised by the Minister when he opened stage one a couple of years ago. So we have 2,405 students at the Gold Coast college of Griffith University crowded into facilities suitable for less than 1,000. One might ask where they all are. They are in portable buildings, in the church hall across the road and in showground buildings two kilometres down the road. What sort of mickey mouse operation is this? Mr Bilney-It is called a BJelke-Petersen operation.",75
101,Mr BRADFORD,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I will choose to ignore that comment by the Minister. The funding for this university was a Commonwealth responsibility; it had nothing to do with the former Premier. We have kids leaving school expecting to be taken up in a university and they are being turned away because of lack of planning. To top it all-if things at Griffith College were not bad enough-the Department announced recently that there would be no allocation of extra funds for buildings or expansion of courses or facilities until at least 1994. That is three years away. I am talking about two local government areas here-the Albert Shire and the Gold Coast City. The Albert Shire is the fastest growing local government area in Australia and one of the fastest growing local government areas in the world. The population projected for the Gold CoastBrisbane corridor between now and the year 2000 represents a growth factor of two or three times. This is absolutely enormous growth, yet we have this university college which is totally inadequate and there is no visible plan in place to address that particular need. Tonight I ask-or I would ask if there were Government members here interested enough to listen-whether this is what the Government's dream of bigger institutions and better education is all about. If it is, I must have missed the point somewhere along the line. Even the Queensland Premier, the Honourable Wayne Goss, member of the Australian Labor Party, is fed up. The other day he said-I have quoted him before on this issue-that his 'patience had run out' with the Federal Minister. He was talking about the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Clearly, the flaws of the Government's higher education policy are being felt around the nation but nowhere is it more prevalent than in Queensland. I find it very difficult to sit here sometimes and hear the Minister telling us daily about his achievements in education. He is now exhibiting some expertise in economics and other matters but generally he talks about education and what a great job he has done. We would find those assertions rather comical if they were not so serious. Let me turn my attention briefly in the time. I have remaining to the situation in _ T AFE colleges in particular and address some comments in the context of the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill. T AFE remains a rapidly growing area in education, having increased by some 250,000 enrolments in the last decade. The Commonwealth contributes 9 per cent of recurrent expenditure and 68 per cent of capital expenditure. This gives the Government a considerable amount of pull in terms of what the States do in respect of running the T AFE system, which is essentially a State responsibility. The Commonwealth's significant contributions allow it to impose regulations on the States and to maintain an increasingly regulatory approach to TAFE. I want to underline those words. We talk about increasing regulation. It seems to me that this Minister in particular-he could be renamed the Minister for intervention or regulation after the sorts of things he is coming out with now about economics, which he probably knows a little about-is heading down the same track because this Government has a predilection towards regulation. It wants to get involved and control everything; it wants to centralise everything. I would say it probably wants to go in just about the opposite direction to the direction that we on this side of the House would philosophically want to move, and for a lot . of good reasons which if I had a lot more time. I would go into. That is my main concern with this Government's approach to higher education. Everything has been about centralising, regulating, interfering and intervening, and that is why the Government is failing in this area. Sadly, the Government has failed in many respects to bring T AFE into line with the needs of Australian industry. In defending T AFE, I ought to say that I do not believe it is without fault. I have been quite closely involved in TAFE, particularly in New South Wales prior to moving to Queensland. I do not pretend for a moment that the T AFE system is perfect or that the people who run T AFE are perfect or without fault. We can look at some of the recent studies that have been done, the most enlightening being the so called Deveson report entitled Training Costs ofAward Restructuring. It addressed a number of concerns with T AFE and was an excellent report. The Government's response has been to accept it and take it on board. I hope that it has benefited from it and will implement some its recommendations, although I do not believe at this stage there is any indication of what the Government's response will be in detail. Mr Deveson and his committee in part pointed out that there was a need to move towards more open and flexible training markets. In other words, flexibility was one of the real issues that came out here. We now find ourselves, as the committee recognised, in a situation where over the decades-I guess we can go back a fair way-insufficient attention has been paid to the important area of skills development and the enhancement of expertise. One of the Government's main policy initiatives-I use that phrase a little loosely; I do not want to get too much into the industrial relations side of it, although it does impinge on this-has been in the whole area of award restructuring. We on this side of the House would have no problem at all with that concept, for it recognises a very real problem in the whole organisation of unions and awards. It recognises what we on this side are saying everyday is one of the fundamental flaws in the way Australians attempt to do business. In embarking on this great program of award restructuring, which seems to have stalled-but it got going with a bit of a flourish; it has not gone very far since, but at least the concept was right-the Government has identified the problem but has not been able to solve it. The Deveson report comments on it. It makes this very good point: Award restructuring has been proceeding faster in some industdes than others, with modest progress being made overall to date. That 'modest progress' would be overall because a lot of the unions are not that keen on cooperating in award restructuring. We have seen plenty of examples of that in some industries, such as the waterfront industry where the quid pro quo for award restructuring is so high that the product of award restructuring may turn out to be worse than what we had in the first place. I quote further from the Deveson report: Nevertheless, as the restructuring of industrial awards links skills levels with pay rates, training will increasingly become an industrial relations issue. Indeed training is likely to become a key agenda item in future negotiations between employers and unions about conditions of employment. As I say, in its approach to award restructuring and the training needs that flow directly from that, the Government has recognised the problem, but it does not appear to be solving it. Instead of looking closely at T AFE and what it has to offer and examining ways in which it might be improved to better suit the needs of industry, the Government's contribution has been to come up with a heavy-handed training guarantee levy.",76
102,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,Order! ·The honourable member's time has expired.,78
103,Mr TUCKEY,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"It is with some pleasure that I join this debate on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill and the States Grants (T AFE Assistance) Amendment Bill. I think.it is worth noting that one of the Bills we are debating grants an additional $171m to the tertiary sector or to higher education funding, .as it is referred to. It is nevertheless also worth noting that this is not $171m this year; it is $54m in 1991, $58m in 1992 and $59m in 1993. Obviously, the Hawke Government will not be paying that last amount of money . because it will be out of office by then, but I am sure that I can make a promise to the people that we in government will keep that particular payment up. They will be pleased to hear that. The reality is that this is a very common practice of this Government. It always throws very big numbers into the air. It does not matter whether it is at Budget time or anything else; very large numbers are thrown around. Then,-when one reads the fine print, one finds, for example, that pensioners have to wait up to 1995, I think, for some of the benefits. This is not the right way to go. I think we should be debating what is being done now. Of course, those amounts of money might be totally inadequate in years to come. Nevertheless, one of the issues that I want to address as regards this matter tonight-and I think it falls adequately within the Opposition's amendment-is the plight of rural students and the sort of funding that is being offered to them, particularly under Austudy, which is now the subject of both means or income testing and asset testing. I made a comment in our party room today that, in relation to access to accommodation and education in the tertiary sector, there is a gigantic inequity between rural remote area and metropolitan students. The fact that that inequity exists is best evidenced by the statistics that show us that 7 per cent of country male student.s and 10 per cent of country female students go· on to higher education as compared with 27 per cent of metropolitan dwellers. There is a simple reason for that: it just happens to cost those parents from country areas who wish to assist their children to go on to higher education about twice as much. It so happens that the richer residents in the metropolitan area are, the closer they are likely to live to an institute of higher education, particularly a university. It is fashionable to live near universities and it is a fact that, if one is extremely wealthy and one lives in the metropolitan area, one's children are able to get to the university from home; there is no additional cost to the family. Once one lives more than 50 or 60 miles away from a university, that option no longt<r exists; that child has to be relocated. In the· case of many wage and salary earners in country districts, that means packing up, leaving long term employment and relocating the whole family. For those who are tied to property and business interests, that is not an option; they just have to find the money-and they frequently cannot. It is ridiculous to say that an assets is applicable across the board unless there is some special assistance available for the accommodation and relocation costs that apply when a young person in the country aspires to tertiary education. It is as simple as that. It has nothing to do with how much money one has. As I have pointed out, the richest person living in the metropolitan area has not got the problem; it just does not exist. The system is highly inequitable and it is wrong. This Government should be doing something about h and not throwing up the sorts of impediments it tried this year .when it actually lowered the threshold of the asset test, when it has an asset test that does not take account of the fact that· there could be more than one child. At least the income test progresses, r think, from $1,200 for the first additional child to $2,500 thereafter. When one applies a reasonable income over assets ratio to the assets test, one finds that it should be at least $800,000 anyway, and it should grow with additional children, which it does not. They are the additional impediments, but at least they are common to everybody. But one difference between living in the city and the country is that it is hugely more expensive to send a country child to university. Why do we have to do this? One would think from this Government's attitude that everybody who lived in a rural or provincial centre voted Liberal. Of course, they do. not. One would think that everybody in those areas was a wealthy farmer or businessman. Of course, they are not. There are a heap of wage and salary earners living in our country and provincial centres who suffer the same difficulties as others in remote areas. They have not got an asset problem, but they are probably earning about $25,000 a year, which would give their children at least some Austudy. But, of course, $25,000 a year income-probably with another couple of kids at home-is just not enough money to be able to accommodate junior down in the big city. What is the first decision such people test make? They say, 'Mum can go back to work'. The wife will go out and take a second family job so that they have enough money collectively to fund the cost of sending their child to university. What happens then? Their family income exceeds the total threshold of nearly $33,000 and there is no Austudy. Not only do they have the problem of the $150 or $200 a week to relocate their child, but suddenly they have no living money for that child, no Austudy. Someone has to stop and realise that that is for real. Of course, it is reflected in the fact that probably 9 per cent of country kids go to university or other higher education institutions as compared with 27 per cent in the metropolitan area. That is the first point I want to make, and I hope that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), who is at the table, might relay it to the Minister responsible, the Minister for Education, Training and Employment (Mr Dawkins). Mr Bilney-With pleasure.",78
104,Mr TUCKEY,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I hope he will, because it is a very real issue, and, funnily enough, it is one the Minister for Employment, Education and Training should underin stand, because his relatives on the Steere side, as honourable members would know, are people who live in the country. I think he has been out there; I think has some idea what happens out there. I think his good mother came from that the background, the blue-bloods of Western Australia. I was a little surprised today when he or the Prime Minister (Mr that Hawke) had a flick at one of our by talking about blue-bloods and the aristocracy. The Minister for Employment, to Education and Training has the backprovide ground of the Lee-Steere family, the O'Connor family and so on, if he wants to complain about that. But he should understand. The Minister would not want to bring his academic credentials before this Parliament. I think it took him nine years to get his economics degree.",80
105,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,The honourable member for O'Connor should return to the subject before the Chair.,80
106,Mr TUCKEY,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"It is education. I am just pointing out that the Minister who now controlling education has a very academic standard. Of course, honourable members would know that he had to be sent over to Roseworthy College to try, get some letters behind his name. He came to work for them. eventually got a diploma.",80
107,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,Order! The some member for O'Connor will return to the substance of the matter before the House.,80
108,Mr TUCKEY,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,I am talking about a Minister who gets a little sarcastic at times.,80
109,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,I remind the education member for O'Connor that he should only fix that. Whilst proceed to discuss members of this place by substantive motion; one should not make inferences about them.,80
110,Mr TUCKEY,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I am not criticising; am just saying that he is not very bright. Of course, he chooses to advise the Prime Minister and Treasurer (Mr Keating) the matter of the exchange rate. He has also, of course-and this is in the education arena-practised a highly centralist approach to education. This is contrast with the Opposition's apLeeproach. Whether it be in the higher education sector or in the primary or secondary area, we believe that parents are he very good judges of the needs and aspirations of their children, particularly at higher education level, where the children become involved also. The amendment that we have proposed points out the Government has failed to provide members the higher education sector: . . . with the flexibility and incentives it needs address the academic staff shortage, and to for adequate opportunities to meet the diverse educational needs of students. When we fund institutions, as compared with people, we get the institution setting the agenda. In this case it has gone even further; we now have the Minister and his little centralised bureaucracy wanting to set the agenda. Firstly, that might not be the individual parents and students would require and, secondly, it is frequently not even what industry would require. When I was shadow Minister for small business, I implored the chambers of commerce and others to have a work is entrance exam, to have an examination, low independent of the secondary schools examinations, which set an agenda of the things they would like to think students to might know and understand before they Over time no doubt that would put pressure on the institutions to meet that particular education requirement. It is an indictment of the organisations such as the chambers of commerce that it all . got too hard for them. Yet they complain considerably about the low standards of. to employ. of the people they are obliged Of course, centralism will not the education system dictates the pace, we will not get the sorts of improvements we need. There will be improvements when parents have some buyI ing power. The word 'voucher' has a dreadful connotation. But I do not know why, because basically it says to parents, on 'We will give to parents some buying power for their children's education'. That sounds like a hell of a good idea to me. I hope it will happen in the future. Whether it be higher education or something else, when the industry, in this case education, is responsible to the customer, in this case the parents and students, we will get flexibility and the responses we need. Take it from me, parents and students will very quickly work it out. Look at that in contrast to what we have. An entrepreneur, Mr Bond, went to the Gold Coast to build a university. We have an interesting situation, because in Western Australia it is the reverse. The Western Australian State Government gave 150 acres, I think it was, of land to t-e proposed Notre Dame University. Liberals and Labor people alike descended upon it. I tried to get on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to say that I wanted to back this. If I were a leader of government and could get a uniyersity for 150 acres of land, I would grab It. It makes sense to get private funding for these things. Having had private enterprise-be it religious, charitable or - tr-ight out for profit-provide a facility, It IS absolutely dopey for the Minister to stand up and say, 'But if you go to that nasty free enterprise place you will get no Austudy'. Who is the recipient of Austudy? Is it the university or the student? I always thought it was the student. If a student qualifies for Austudy under the various tests that apply and is prepared to work nights or mornings or whatever else to get some money to pay the fees at say, Bond University, why should he she not be eligible for Austudy? It is a student grant. Is it bad if, as a result of that process, there is a vacancy at a public university so that one of the 20,000 students who each year pass the exams but cami.ot find places gets into university? people had read the maiden speech of the current Minister for Employment, Education and Training when he was the honourable member for Tangney, they would know why this is happening. Talk about giving advice to the Prime Minister on the exchange rate and wanting to reregulate our financial system! Back in those days the Minister was going to socialise everything. He did not believe that private enterprise could run a flea market. Mr Bilney-Some quotes, Wilson.",80
111,Mr TUCKEY,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I will send the Minister a copy of the speech; it will be illuminating. The Prime Minister should have read it to him when he carpeted him the other day. It is not socialist; it is communist. But of course, that is what comes from having rich parents and a socialist mother. I think it was Dame Edna Everage who once said, 'Isn't it lovely to be a socialist in a free enterprise economy?,. The reality is that Austudy is for students. The more money we are able to direct to students and the quicker that the institutions, be they private or public, have to compete for that money, the quicker we will get better education. We will get flexibility because they will cater for the market. Anybody who suggests that it is not an education market is wrong. The other matter that I will raise in my last five minutes-again it relates to Austudy-is the massive increase in unemployment in recent times, particularly amongst young people. Those coming out of the secondary school system are finding it very difficult to get a job. Some have the academic skills to go on and improve their work opportunities by getting higher education. I have no objection when people make that choice and apply themselves. However, with government encouragement there is another group who are going back to school simply because 0; they cannot get a job and they have nothing else to do. This is saving the Government some embarrassment because it is lowering the unemployment numbers. This Government is boasting about those people when in fact it is a waste because If they are not learning. It is a further problem because Austudy is being abused. In Western Australia. I am constantly running into people telling me about young people going back to school, getting Austudy and then not going to school any more. If they were to apply for the dole conditions would have to be met. They would have to report back and actively seek employment, et cetera. The funny thing about Austudy is that once the stugetting dent gets it, he or she does not even have to go to school. I am told that there are no requirements, no tests-no proof. Some go and sign on in the morning and buzz off straight away; others do not bother to front. At this stage of the game the education system is not equipped police that situation. I put the Government on notice that it had better do something about this. It is a tragedy. It is bringing Austudy, which basically a good system, into disrepute. There are those who are using it as a to higher education. replacement for the dole because, in many ways, it is easier to get. That should stopped, just as other abuses of the Ausexpired. tudy program should be. The Government should look at that matter very quickly. Nobody on either side of House, approves of those sorts of pracBill, tices. In closing, there is another aspect rural situation I want to raise, that is, we now have a very severe decline in incomes in the bush and in property values. There are people still suffering from asset testing and· who cannot get sufficient assistance for their children when they desperately need it. There should be mediate revaluations or, for that matter, a blanket revaluation of all farming proparguments erties. The Government could lop 30 per cent or 50 per cent off their values at stage of the game. That is a temporary whatsoever. situation. The matter of access to higher education for rural students is a permatention nent problem. It applies to many who not farmers and many who do not have problems with assets testing; they just not have enough income to meet the ditional costs. I would like to see an mediate revaluation. The Opposition's policy is to have much broader hardship provisions and immediate application for those people whose incomes have literally disappeared so that they can keep their children at school. It is a tragedy to think that children are not going back to school simply because their parents can no longer afford it. Some of them have two or three years. These matters should be addressed. There is no doubt about it; people no money at all. They are trying to carry very high interest rates on prices that are ridiculously low for the two major agricultural commodities of wheat and wool. These issues are important. If we even believe in making Australia a smarter nation, we have to ensure that all sections to of our community have the financial wherewithal to have their children attend school. There is a vast difference between the cost of sending a child in a rural area is on to higher education and the cost of sending a child in a metropolitan area on",81
112,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,Mr Hollis).be Order! The honourable member's time has,82
113,Mr FITZGIBBON,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,1 had no intention of speaking on the the Higher Education Funding Amendment but while I was sitting in my room 1 heard a succession of speakers from the of the other side of the House speaking such that drivel or piffle that 1 decided to come along and say a few words on the topic.,82
114,Mr CADMAN,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,It proves you are not interested in higher education on that side.,82
115,Mr FITZGIBBON,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"It is very pleasing imto hear the honourable member opposite object. So often when people cannot win on substantive facts they engage in histrionics, interjections and things this of that nature, which do them no credit I sat here quietly, prepared to pay atto what was being said by the are honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and the speakers before him. do However, what they said moved me to adrise to my feet to say a few things in imreply. The whole point of the Bill is to provide additional funds for technical and further education (T AFE) and higher education. The best that the Opposition has been able to come up with is an amendment which is quite irrational. All it is designed to do is provide an oppor. tunity for the Opposition to launch a diatribe of accusations and criticisms of this already done Government's efforts. In regard to education, the junior Minister for Higher Education and Employare ment Services (Mr Baldwin) has performed outstandingly. I said to the Minister that never in the history of the Parliament has a Minister made a more auspicious debut than he did when he replied to a question asked by the Opposition spokesman for higher education. His reply was devastating. In one fell swoop the Minister established his supremacy over the Opposition spokesman. He has not kept a short half head in front but has kept many lengths in front. Mr Bilney-I don't recall the Opposition spokesman asking a question subsequently.",82
116,Mr FITZGIBBON,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,I think it silenced him.,83
117,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,Mr Hollis)Order! I think we might do away with the interjections and allow the honourable member for Hunter to continue.,83
118,Mr FITZGIBBON,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not mind interjections.",83
119,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,I do. I ask the honourable member for Hunter to continue his speech without responding to interjections.,83
120,Mr FITZGIBBON,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The first thing that caused me to pay closer attention to this debate was when I heard an honourable member opposite say that many T AFE colleges did not have the enrolments that they had previously. I am not going to speak about the situation in Queensland or any other State, but let me tell honourcase able members about the situation in New South Wales. I had at least 50 students visit my office in Maitland. Their chief complaint was that following the Labor Government's loss of office they could no longer afford to attend T AFE college courses because Mr Greiner, the Leader of the Liberal Government, had imposed such draconian fees that they could not afford to go to TAFE colleges. The principals of all those T AFE colleges really had to scratch around for innovative methods of boosting their college attendance figures. The honourable member for O'Connor has always been a master of destructionI think it is fair to say that he has never come up with a constructive idea in his life; he. is very good at putting the slipper in,.. --and has no constructive ideas whatsoever. All of the things that I hear from honourable members opposite remind me of a meeting I recently had as a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts with the Metal Trades Industry Association. That organisation laid before us a number of demands that it thought the Government should attend to. The first demand was that we should cut government expenditure. Of course, I asked the members of that organisation whether they would like to give some advice as to where we should cut Government expenditure. The leader of the delegation said, 'Oh no, we won't fall into that trap again. We did that when' Mr Fraser asked the same question in 1983 and it brought us quite a deal of publicity'. We, on this side of the House, know where honourable members opposite would like us to cut government expenditure. It would be in the areas of health, education, welfare-all those areas which would be to the greatest disadvantage of the middle and lower income classes. Of course, we do not hear honourable members opposite speak very often of the need to draw in the reins; for those board members and executives who are gaining quite shameful salary increases to exercise some restraint. The honourable member for O'Connor spoke about Austudy. He instanced the of the poor struggling farmer having a problem keeping his kids at school, university or T AFE college. In order to relieve the situation, mum has to go out to work. Because of the subsequent escalation in the family's income the children then cease to be eligible for Austudy. That is fair enough. What the honourable member for O'Connor is saying, in a logical extension of his argument, is that we should give Austudy to everyone. That would suit honourable members opposite. There would not be one honourable member opposite who was short of a quid. There would not be many Opposition supporters who are not awash with money. Consequently, the crowd that supports those opposite would benefit from such a proposal. That would mean less money for the really needy. Are those opposite saying that millionaires should get Austudy? They should have the courage to get up on their feet and say, 'Yes, that is what we are saying'. Honourable members opposite are very selective in their arguments. They talk about the shameful performance of this Government in the field of education. wonder why we have not heard one menearning tion from those opposite of the higher retention rates of students achieved since we have been in government. I admit that under the Liberals there was no over the crowding in our schools because too few students were encouraged to stay on to complete their secondary education. Of course, if students do not receive some encouragement to complete secondary who education they are not going to develop thirst for tertiary education. I think anyone who knows anything about not education in this country would admit that what this Government has achieved has been far in advance of the puny efforts of conservative governments. This. Government made a change to education which did not make it very ress popular-we did away with free tertiary education. That did not worry me too much because I was aware that this counrural try was not in a position where it could afford free tertiary education. I remember being at a conference in 1974 at which I think I was a lone voice opposing the introduction of free tertiary education. did that because I believed there were higher priorities in term- of where ernment money should go. I spoke about the need for better classrooms where stuwas dents did not freeze in the winter months and swelter in the summer months. I spoke also about the need for imhad proved libraries. I spoke about the need for better home science departments. spoke, too, about the need for better ing. I taught in high schools in New South Wales for more than 20 years, and I was well aware of some of the deficiencies which existed in high school education that State. When free tertiary education was done away with, my office once again was inundated by students who came to me to protest. I soon settled most of their fears, because at that stage they were paying an administration fee which amounted to about $5.50 per week. I said to each and every one of them, 'Would you rather pay $5.50 per week now when you have the backside out of your trousers, at the most necessitous time of your life, or would I you rather pay, say, $8 when you are $23,000 a year?'. There cannot possibly be any opposition to that argument. So they were satisfied, or I feel that they were, because I managed to quell all protests about the abolition of free tertiary education within my electorate. One other thing that surprised me was the claim that somehow or other students live in rural areas have suffered fura ther disadvantage since the advent of the that Hawke Labor Government. That is just true. Everyone opposite, or at least those honourable members who represent rural constituencies, would know that this Government has targeted students who live in rural Australia. I have received many letters from rural producers congratulating this Government on the progit has made in that area. I would say, and it would be an objective assessment, that this Government has done more for students, for those students who live in isolated areas, than any other government in the history of this nation; I was also rather bemused to hear one I speaker criticise the fact that some students are staying at school even though govthey have no great enthusiasm for education. This takes me back to when I on a county council. The bureaucracy at the county council made a decision that it was not going to train any further apprentices, because those apprentices it trained could not get a job at the end of their apprenticeships. I opposed that I decision .vigorously. Even if a student seatundergoes an apprenticeship and· then cannot find a job, it is still better to keep taking on new apprentices because if these young people do an apprenticeship for in two or three years they are unquestionably going to derive benefit later in life. ""Furthermore, if a 16-year-old lad does an apprenticeship, he is going to be gainfully employed for two or three years, and at the end of those two or three years he will be more mature and better able to cope with the trauma of unemployment than he would have been as a 16-year-old person who had had no opportunities to learn or to develop that maturity. There was also a claim made by the honourable member for O'Connor that Austudy in many instances is a joke, and that it is some form of sham unemployment benefit. He said that there are many people who stay on at school because they cannot get a job, and they fake their attendance-they come along to a school or a TAFE college in the morning, sign on, and then depart in peace. That is just a ludicrous assertion. If it were true, we would not blame the Federal Government anyhow. Schools and TAFE colleges are operated by the State governments, so if that were to occur, any responsible principal would surely draw that practice to a conclusion. Some amazing statements have been made here this evening, all of them hypercritical-and that is a wonderful word because it matches so closely the word 'hypocritical'. Surely there are some areas where they could congratulate this Government, but with their jaundiced views, their blinkered vision, they make no attempt to do that. There is just a litany of criticisms, and 1I have become sick and tired of criticisms. 1 do not mind criticisms when there is some justification for them, but when they are completely destructive, 1 think honourable members opposite do themselves a disfavour, and they certainly lose face in the minds of the wider electorate.",83
121,Mr BALDWIN,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"1 do not intend to respond at length as what we have heard today is a fairly standard sort of broad brush debate on higher educational issues and, to some extent, on technical and further education (T AFE) issues. The Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill and the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill are essentially non-controversial in nature. They are largely machinery matters designed to make adjustments in the funding to take account of the movement of cost indices in the higher education and TAFE areas respectively. There is one striking feature of the debate, however, and that relates to the amendment moved by the Opposition spokesperson, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp). 1 had a read of it, and 1 thought, 'Here we go-yet another amendment which will condemn us for this and that'. But then 1 noticed a striking omission, and it was a truly extraordinary omission. There is no reference to the profiles process-this iniquitous, terrible monstrosity that we are alleged to have created, in comparison to which the most authoritarian of eastern Europe's centrally planned economies is a model of liberality. This is what the honourable member for Goldstein has been telling us for the last year or so, and even longer. Yet there is no reference to it in this amendment to the second reading motion. That is rather striking, rather surprising. The thought occurred to me, could it be possible that the message is finally getting through that the system likes the profiles process, that the higher education sector is enthusiastic about the profiles process? Dr Kemp-No, it is not.",85
122,Mr BALDWIN,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"The honourable member for Goldstein denies that proposition, but 1 would refer him once again to the submission of the Australian ViceChancellors Committee (AVCC) to the joint Commonwealth-State working party on higher education, in which it is said that the profiles process provides an excellent-and 1 emphasise the word 'excellent' - accountability mechanism. Why is it that the Opposition spokesperson has been so obsessed for so long with destroying excellence in the area of accountability mechanisms in higher education? Given that the Opposition constantly prates about the need for more excellence in our education system, why would it want to destroy something which is excellent and acknowledged to be so by the key peak organisation representing the higher education sector? That has always puzzled me. The very same document talked about how the profiles process was now extremely well received in the higher education sector. This is not a new statement; this is not some new information. The AVCC, in its pre-1990 election statement on higher education, said essentially the same sorts of things-that it finds the profiles process, as refined, to be a good system and certainly preferable to what preceded it. These statements have been made repeatedly. The Higher Education Council, in its regular reports to Parliament, has said the same thingthat the profiles process, despite some initial problems in the nature and composition of the data that was required from institutions, really has come to be well accepted and is now working well. This has been said repeatedly. Of course, the honourable member for Goldstein made reference to the most recent AVCC higher education policy document and seemed to think that that contravened what I have just said. But I would refer· him to the recommendations in that document-and a key recommendation in relation to profiles is, again, that the AVCC recommends continuation of the profiles mechanism, and it also calls for continued efforts to sort out the difficulties in the data that the institutions are required to provide. But again, it acknowledges that we have made some significant headway in simplifying and easing the burden on institutions in providing that data. The bottom line is that in statement after statement after statement, the sector has said it favours the higher education profiles process. It does seem that this message has finally got through to the honourable member for Goldstein. I see no reference in this second reading amendment to the iniquitous profiles process. Maybe, just maybe, the message has got through and one can be thankful. There is hope for humanity in that somewhere, I think. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative.

123,Dr KEMP,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House deplores the Government's: (a) failure to consider adequately the role of T AFE in its reform of the higher education sector; (b) failure to take adequate steps to encourage the development of an open and flexible training market; and (c) neglect of the warning of the Training Costs Review Committee that training must not become excessively burdened with the rigidities of the industrial relations system"".

125,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION SUPERVISORY," I understand that it is the wish of the House to debate the Occupational Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill concurrently with the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill. There being no objection, the Chair will allow that course to be followed.",87
126,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,SUPERANNUATION SUPERVISORY,"Dawson) (9.37)I have pleasure, on behalf of the coalition and Opposition, to speak on these occupational superannuation laws, the purpose of which is to introduce supervisory levies. These supervisory levies will be on the annual return lodgement by superannuation funds, approved deposit funds and pool superannuation trusts for the purpose of supervising the superannuation industry by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. The levy is the means by which cost recovery is effected for that supervision and it will bring into the Commission a figure of between $6m and $8m annually, whereas the current fee at this stage is a $40 annual fee which collects about $3.6m. The penalties are set out for late lodgement and of course the late lodgement amounts themselves are ·not tax deductable. The systems of appeal for the levy are such that there is a review by the Minister and then the appeal can be heard before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Minister advises that a simple ready reckoner for the calculation of this levy will be made available. If such a simple ready reckoner is available, it will be about the only thing about the superannuation industry and the program of the legislation that is simple. So congratulations: I look forward to receiving that particular reckoner. Since the Government set out to make the superannuation industry the flagship for Australian savings, understanding superannuation is at the very best difficult and at the worse impossible. If we just look at one complexity alone-and that is the taxation of superannuation-there is, firstly, the manner of taxing contributions, which one might say is a set-off to some degree to the amount of savings of tax effected by the corporations and the companies making those contributions; there is the actual taxation of profits of the superannuation funds; there is also a capital gains tax involved; and then of course, upon receipt, there is a taxing mechanism for recipients. If it is in a lump sum, there is a calculation to provide for taxation to the recipient and, if it is in the form of a pension, there is also another form of taxation which takes into account quite a few different formulas and calculations. On top of all of this, of course, we now have this levy-and I just go out of my way to say that, while it is not taxation, it is another imposition in connection with the administration of superannuation funds. What we have seen over the last six years is not only the whole concept of superannuation taken as a flagship for Australian savings but also a complex arrangement of making taxation in advance of receipt by the superannuant. This meant that in 1989-90, in the calculation in the Budget, the Government intended to receive $885m from this source. That is quite a sizeable amount when one considers the length of time involved. Unfortunately, only $376m was realised, and one wonders what the shortfall was. Was there actually an incorrect calculation in the Budget that did not foresee the type of savings envisaged through, particularly, the occupational schemes that have been promoted in the last few years? In the 1990-91 year, $820m is now on public record as the collection of that tax from this source. One wonders at this stage whether that figure will be realised. Those figures do not include the capital gains tax-that is, the personal taxation on particular lump sums and capital gains within the superannuation funds themselves. The tax implications of superannuation are fairly mammoth. They have increased quite out of proportion to what they were before. Again, the frightening aspect of these taxation requirements is that they are not fully understood. I believe that, just in that element alone, many people who might well commit themselves and invest in a superannuation fund are frightened off by the implications and complexity of it. I have noticed that within the field itself there is a big gap of understanding by the professionals themselves who sell it and advise on it. These are the financial advisers who do not really understand what they are selling. On the other hand, people who are buying do not really understand what they are buying. To try to come to some understanding of this matter, about 12 months ago I set about the task of understanding my own Commonwealth superannuation. I received three pages of explanation from the Taxation Office which took some weeks to be delivered to me. I am not saying that all the delay was necessarily because of the Tax Office trying to put it into some sort of English that I would understand, but it goes to show that in one individual case it took three pages of explanation and a lot of my time poring over it, with some idea of what I was reading, to come to grips with what my own superannuation worth would be and what the taxation requirements were along the way and at the end-whether taken in a lump sum or in the form of a pension. It is quite unnatural that this complexity of taxation requirements should be there, particularly when it is dealing with such a very important requirement. The levy itself is not necessarily regarded as another aspect of taxation or additional taxation, but it is an additional cost and an additional expense against the funds and consequently diminishes the return to the superannuant. This is fairly important and fairly significant because surely what we are' about in this country is providing people at their retirement with a sum sufficient for them to be fairly certain of being able to provide for their various requirements; firstly, an income and, secondly, a capital sum to provide for those things that maybe they did not do during their working life. I think there is now a third requirement of superani1Uation: as people are going to live longer-as the statistics indicate-they need to be able to fund for themselves in their old age their health care requirement, whether it be home and community care or institutional care. In the number of years that I have been dealing with it, I understand that there have been 25 or more changes just to the taxation base and the rates. The great difficulty here has been in the past that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has legislated by press release. Consequently, when the legislation has been produced, it has not matched the press release. I remember that about four years ago many constituents came to my office because the funds, which were providing for schemes on the basis of the press release, found that when the legislation came into effect they did not comply with its requirements and there was 12 months activity by some people in superannuation that was null and void; So one wonders at this stage whether it is the Treasurer's plan to provide an avenue for further savings through superannuation or whether it is just to draw in more taxation in advance of the receipt. Because of my own lack of knowledge of what was going on in superannuation, about 18 months ago I set about to provide a booklet for constituents explaining what superannuation was about. In this booklet I have posed about 40 questions and answers. Half of them refer to the requirements of taxation. When I went to the Taxation Office to try to make sure that what I was saying was correct, it' came back to me with pages and pages of convoluted formulas and answers on the taxation question that I could not understand. Then I had to whittle that down to an appropriate form. This booklet gives only the basic idea of superannuation. It does not give the real nitty gritty that applies to each individual. I think where the Government fails is that it lays down all the laws and regulations, expecting that every Australian can be encompassed under the one umbrella, whereas superannuation is a very individual matter. The requirement is individual; the income commitment is individual. This is the great difficulty. At least I derstand something about superannuation, but it does take a determined effort to do it and one has to be strong willed to be able to accomplish that understanding. Most of the questions we get on superannuation refer to its lack of clarity and the anomalies in the present taxation arrangements. I might say again that the simple ready reckoner might also be accompanied by a simple explanation of what superannuation is about in total. I would like to look particularly at the supervisory role of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC), for which,this levy is to be paid. It is obvious that there is a failure of this Government in supervising or acting on prudential standards of banks, particularly the State Bank of South Australia, Western Australia Inc, and the State Bank of Victoria. One wonders about the prudential requirements that are required within the superannuation funds and whether this will be another matter which the Government will fail to address. This particular aspect gives great concern and insecurity to the Australian investors. I would suggest that in the current climate many people in superannuation will expect as a guarantee that this prudential requirement will be somehow or other attached to a Commonwealth guarantee. Certainly, the supervisory levy might give rise to that thought, but I believe it is very important for us to put down that particular type of speculation that it will not and that there are still grave prudential deficiencies in the present superannuation scheme. Superannuation is an investment of savings, which are hard to come by in this economy as it is at the moment,and these particular superannuation prudential requirements and the supervisory requirements come under the control of the ISC and not the Reserve Bank. Perhaps the investing public should have the security of knowing that appropriate prudential standards are being maintained with superannuation funds and trusts. I believe they have that expectation. Because of this larger supervisory levy, will the ISC report on bad management and inappropriate results? Does the un- Commission have the latest techniques to properly supervise and interpret. the reports, even though the levy has been increased? Can people in superannuation demand that the funds perform and observe the statutory requirements demanded of them? As I have said before, there is that requirement and expectation of the banking industry in Australia, but I believe that the superannuation funds have a long way to go. It is ironic that many major banks in Australia at the moment are involving themselves very heavily in superannuation, yet that superannuation does not come under the prudential requirements of the Reserve Bank of Australia, and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission falls short of being able to provide those prudential requirements. One sees this link up more recently in the proposed merger between the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd and National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd, which did not succeed but showed that people expect that the banks will be properly supervised prudentially, but the superannuation aspects of it are not. There are complaints particularly now arising from the industrial occupational superannuation requirements, the great increase in the number of trusts and the competence of the directors of trustees of these funds, especially those who have very little expertise in the superannuation industry. As I said, I can understand that some people would have difficulty; because of the deficiencies of the experts and professionals, some of these trustees who are appointed because of their union background or some other requirement would also have difficulty, not only in understanding superannuation but also in the manipulations that are required within the trust itself. I am sorry; 'manipulabest tions' was not the word I wanted to use. There is also the other question of cupational superannuation for casual part time workers and itinerants who go not made at all. from one place to another and one type of work to another, and in many cases fall under different funds. Already people have suggested to me that an itinerant could contribute during his or her lifetime to probably 50 or 60 different funds and each of these funds is supposed to make a report to him or her-an itinerant who travels around Australia with nothing more than an income tax number and do with no fixed place of abode. Obviously these people are not going to be interested in that many funds and the amounts inment. volved, so one must ask the question: where are these amounts going to be bound eventually? Obviously they will into some type of funds for unknown resource. cipients, and then one must ask who will profit from that. Again I have a sneaking suspicion it will be the Government. One complaint which has come to me in connection with occupational superanOf nuation is that there is a lack of choice funds for the employer who on behalf an employee pays into a fund compulsotralian rily. In many cases there is only the one it. fund, and again the employer, acting out of ignorance perhaps, does not know there might be others. As a result of the manner in which some are attached-without any competition or alternatives and with comshow pulsion-there is that lack of choice. think that is bad. As I said before, there is a lack of knowledge and competence on the part of the trustees; in fact, person making those provisions often does not know who the trustees are. In respect of the cost of management, normally one would find administration and actuarial charges should be between 1.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent, but in funds this is grossly exceeded. It has been suggested that this cost of management will increase in the future with only result: diminution in the performance that trust. I mentioned the performance of the trusts and the tax effect on them, but also some of them lack the real detail required to make them perform at the level. I believe the annual report is not made in a form which is understandocable to the individual and sometimes when and reports should be made yearly they are Another aspect which is becoming obvious these days is that many of these funds are investing not in local industries or Australian companies and equities but externally. I think that that is rather criminal, but again that is the choice of the fund. If the fund can get a better risk investment overseas than it can in Australia, one might say it has every right to that. In fact, it might fail in.its duties to the trust funds if it is to invest in Australian industry as it is at the moThe latest suggestion by the Treasurer, made only within the last fortnight, is that he will insist on more regulation fall to direct investment to the Australian I suggest that if the Treasurer is thinking of regulation to impose this control, it would be better if he did it through his economic policies by making it more attractive to invest onshore than offshore. course, if the Treasurer is able to do of that, we might have better predictions of of where funds are best occupied and Ausinvestment might be the better for Many predictions are being made about the value of the superannuation funds and their amounts. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) September 1990 figures that the total investment in superI annuation in Australia at the moment is $124.6 billion. I suggest this is just slightly less than the gross foreign debt at this the stage. The Treasurer's estimate for the future and the year 2000 is $600 billion. Of course, this possibly assumes a full flow-on of the current 3 per cent occupational superannuation and the promised 3 per cent which is in train. If Australia is many to maintain a saving margin in connection with superannuation, it is important that these funds be properly used with the one maximum funds being used and not diof luted by big taxes and big management fees. If they are properly used, it could have some relation to building a bigger, better and more competitive Australia. That is precisely the industry statement we debated here last month, the implications of which have not really found a mark within the Australian economy. If we use these superannuation funds better, there is an opportunity that we can build a more competitive Australia. I will now examine the comparative saving rates in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries from 1960 to 1985, because superannuation is all about saving. These figures were made available through OECD data and refer to periods between 1960 and 1985. With the permission of the House, I would like to incorporate these matters. Leave granted. The document read as follows-Table I NA COUNTRIES, 1960-85 (A.verage %) 60-6768-7374-7980-85 Australia 8.0 10.9 12.2 US . . . 8.2 9.5 9.6 8.4 Japan . 16.6 17.6 21.6 16.8 Germany 10.3 13.6 13.3 France . 12.2 12.9 13.7 10.9 UK. . . 5.6 5.6 8.0 8.4 Italy . . 17.3 19.5 22.3 Canada . . . . . . . 5.7 7.5 12.4 14.9 Small European Countries . . 10.0 11.9 11.6 10.6 Weighted OECD average . . . . . . 9.5 11.5 13.1 11.3 Unweighted OECD average. . . . . . 9.6 11.5 12.5 (mean deviation).

127,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,COMPARISON OF SAVING RATES IN OECD,"These figures are rather significant because they compare over those periods the performance OECD countries and Australia is listed with them. I would like to mention first the net household savings rate, where out of nine countries Australia is listed third last. This varied from period to period, ' and in the 1980-85 Australia was almost back to the same rate as in 1960-67. At a rate of 9.4 per cent we are under the unweighted OECD average of 10.4 per cent by 1 per cent. The significance of this is that while Australia sits at 9.4 per cent in the household savings rate, Japan is at 16.8 per cent, Germany is at 12.2 per cent, France is at 10.9 per cent and Italy-although not recorded fdr the last period-reached over 20 per cent. It is significant not only in that regard but also in respect of gross domestic savings, where Australia comes in very low under the average of those same countries, that when one looks at the big investors in Australia, one finds they are Japan, Germany and France, which just recently established an Household saving offshore resort of Club Med off Mackay rate (net) at Lindeman Island. It is interesting that with those types of 9.4 savings people from those countries are investing in Australia and that is really 12.2 what our foreign investment problem is all about. It is attractive for people from those countries to be able to invest at our rates of interest, and yet Australians themselves cannot invest in those same assets. The superannuation funds are putting those funds offshore for investment. I believe there is a real message in those figures: Australia's performance in savings 10.4 is below average and has the undesirable (4.6) consequence that if we cannot provide the savings for Australian investment, overGross domestic seas countries will. Basically the problem saving/GDP of foreign investment in Australia is an 19.7 Australian economic problem purely and surely. I believe those figures are quite When we talk in terms of those savings for those figures I think that we must also look at the state of play since the last figures in 1985. If we examined the 1985 to 1991 figures we would have to take into account the collapse of the State banks that I mentioned before, because they are savings institutions, the Rothof wells debacle, which involves Western Australia Inc., and also the massive bad debts that are being written off a lot of the accounts of the major public companies in Australia, not the least of which are the banks themselves. All the failures of corporate companies and merchant banks, and also the accumulation of bad debts, indicate that our savings ratio is becoming less and less and, as a result, investment opportunities in Australia are also becoming less. Looking at our balance of trade, in the 1989-90 year, Australians spent $20 billion more than they produced. They have had to create loans for $20 billion, just because we insist on buying more imports and producing less exports. As a result, that $20 billion is lost in savings. In the current year that figure will probably be between $17 billion and $18 billion. We have committed ourselves further in foreign debt and less in savings to the outside world. Let us look at the public expenditure, the public saving ratio. The Treasurer has often quoted the Budgets of the 1980s. In more recent years-1988, 1989 and 1990-he has taken a lot of credit for producing Budget surpluses. I applaud the fact that we can produce surpluses, but we must remember that there have been negative savings in this same Treasurer's first four Budgets. I will go through them. The 1983-84 Budget, which was the Treasurer's first, brought in a deficit of nearly $8 billion-$7,961m; in 1984-85 it was $6,746m; in 1985-86 it was $5,726m; and in 1986-87 the last deficit was $2,716m, totalling $23,149m. That is significant because it is the money taken out in the form of taxation and money taken out of savings. It was not taken out in taxation, but loans created which have prevented those savings being used elsewhere. Since then, in 1987-88, 1988-89, 198990, there have been surpluses created against that of nearly $16 billion, but we are still in deficit, as far as savings are concerned, of $7 billion. To start with, we were to redeem this figure of the mismanagement of our own Treasurer in creating those deficits. We were to bridge that gap this year with an $8.1 billion surplus. The last estimate we have is $1.7 billion. That is a fair decrease in what was expected to be a potential saving for us. It has been suggested by some that if we scrape through to the end of the financial year with anything in surplus we will be lucky, but the message is that over the term of this Treasurer and since this Labor Government's performance on the Treasury benches we are $7 billion down the drain on savings. The savings program of the Treasurer, which he proposes in connection with superannuation, has been abdicated by his performance in this regard. So the deficits are in the face of the high rates of tax which discourage savings in themselves. . These are very important issues that Australia has to address. on superannuation, and we are talking in terms of the savings required. I suggest that the superannuation funds are not really the savings vehicle that the Treasurer would like them to be. I suggest that any amount of regulation will not correct that situation by making them invest onshore and not offshore. It requires a sensible approach to the economic management of this country and also some superannuation guidelines, which is understandable. The coalition's policy in connection with superannuation is certainly on the record. We believe that if we are going to help gross domestic savings then we have to reduce and provide for a better mix of taxation; businesses have to become more efficient and export directed; we have to reduce Commonwealth expenditure that has created those massive deficits in the past; we have to reduce inflation; and we also have to give certainty in legislation. Whatever that legislation is, there should be certainty that people can act on it and act properly. Our policy in connection with the retirement income on superannuation is quite clear. At the time of the last election we offered-and this is still operable-an increase in the tax-free threshold on lump sums from $68,628 to $125,000 and then indexed; abolition of the capital gains tax on superannuation to be replaced with a 5-year speculative gains tax which will assist tremendously with savings; introduction of a retirement savings account for those part time, casual and itinerant workers who have difficulty in getting into the mainstream superannuation schemes; removal of the age bar to employment above the age of 65; and superannuation contributions to continue to be made by a working spouse on behalf of a wife spouse who leaves the work force to raise a family. All those items are very positive and I suggest that this type of thing ought to be looked at. Finally, in the Committee stage of the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill 1991 we would seek to make some change to the regulations to ensure that the Minister is directed to consult with the various insurance organisations and have regard to their views.",91
128,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMPARISON OF SAVING RATES IN OECD,. Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,93
129,Mr MARTIN,COMPARISON OF SAVING RATES IN OECD,"We are debating the Occupational Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill 1991. In his contribution on the issue of superannuation the Opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), ranged somewhat more widely than the specifics of the Bill. Accordingly, Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek your indulgence to respond to some of his remarks in my contribution tonight. Essentially, the purpose of the two being debated this evening is to introduce the collection provisions for the proposed levy contained in the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill 1991. By way of background, honourable members would be aware that the Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC) issues standards that must be complied with for superannuation funds and approved deposit funds to be eligible for concessional tax treatment. The operating standards deal with such matters as who can contribute, the vesting of benefits, the preservation of benefits and, of course, various financial aspects of the fund in question. The funds are required to submit an annual return to the ISC. The ISC is required to give the fund a notice stating whether the conditions have been complied with and also detailing rights of appeal. The annual returns, also from these funds, are to be accompanied by the prescribed application fee which at present is a flat $40. The proposal contained within the legislation is not to retain that flat fee but to introduce a fee based on the assets of the fund and, according to the explanatory memorandum, is estimated to raise in the order of $6m to $8m per year compared with an estimated $3.6m, which would have been collected should the current $40 flat fee continue to apply. The decision to introduce this particular levy was announced in the 1990 Budget. It should not be seen in any way to be connected with the proposal to impose a levy on life insurance companies due to difficulties with Regal Life Australia and the Occidental Life Insurance Co. of Australia Ltd-which, incidentally, is opposed by the industry itself. Accordingly, the Bill is essentially one of a machinery nature. It provides an opportunity for collecting the superannuation supervisory levy. It adds flexibility to the current provisions because the Commissioner no longer is restrained from issuing a notice of compliance to a fund if the levy amount is underpaid due to a genuine error. But, of course, where there is a deliberate attempt to avoid payment, the Commissioner has been granted a disBills cretion to refuse to issue a notice of amounts of levy unpaid. As indicated by the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) in his contribution, the Commissioner is to issue guidelines. Obviously, at the end of the day there is an opportunity for the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to review any decision made by the Commissioner. The issue raised tonight by the honourable member for Dawson was essentially one of the role played by superannuation and superannuation funds in the Australian economy. It is interesting just to look back and draw some comparisons and, therefore, some conclusions about the role being presently played by superannuation funds in the Australian economy and to see just how that has . varied over the last several years. It is a fact that in 1983, for example, only 40 per cent of the work force had superannuation cover and it is a fact that now, in 1991, award superannuation covers some 77 per cent of the work force. If one is talking about savings, the ability of people to save and to provide for themselves at the conclusion of their working life, I think there is no starker contrast than that provided by those figures. The overall result of the Government's improvements to superannuation has been, of course, to extend it to a much larger prqportion of the labour force than ever before. Those people who perhaps came from occupations where in the past superannuation was set aside for the wealthy in the industry in which they worked, or generally for people that earned above average wages, certainly applaud this. It has been conservatively estimated that by the year 2000-which is not very far away-the contributions to superannuation funds by this 77 per cent of the Australian work force will produce a huge pool of national - savings, which the honourable member for Dawson has gone to great lengths to discuss tonight. It is that pool of savings, therefore, which will be available for the superannuation funds to invest and, hopefully-I am at one with the honourable member for Dawson-in Australia, as opposed to going offshore. It is a fact that before 1983 the majority of the work force, as I have indicated, were not members of superannuation schemes. A strong tax incentive existed to take superannuation benefits in the form of a lump sum rather than a regular payment of income. There was little regulation of superannuation to ensure· that it was directed to saving for retirement; there. was no incentive to preserve benefits until retirement; and there was a lack of opportunities for portability. It is a fact, despite the reservations that the honourable member for Dawson expressed about the number of changes that have been introduced by this Government-there is noone disputing the fact-that under this Government there has been an improvement in the areas that I have just listed by reducing the bias against those who wish to take superannuation and by improving vesting and portability. To oversight that, theInsurance and Superannuation Commission was established in 1987 to administer those guidelines. It is interesting to compare some of the statistics that are around. The Australian Bureau of Statistics found that about 80 per cent of Australian workers are covered by awards and of those between 80 per cent and 85 per cent have a superannuation entitlement of some sort now. It is a fact that the Government is developing this national strategy of superannuation in concert with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and rightly so, and with others in the industry. There is an education program so that all employees and employers are aware of their rights and obligations and there is also, as part of that overall compliance package, an education package-a program of inspections targeted at industries where compliance levels are considered unacceptable. It is important to ensure, as I am sure honourable members on both sides of this place would agree, that when people conclude their working lives they have an opportunity to live with a degree of decency, certain in the knowledge that the money that they have set aside through this pool of savings for their retirement is going to look after them in what have been described as their golden years. It is the role of government to facilitate the methods whereby people will have that financial security. When this Government came to office, there was about $17 billion in superannuation savings. Now, there is about $150 billion in these funds. Of course, the rate of contribution is about $17 billion each year. It is a fact, as I have indicated, that Australia has an ageing population; noone disputes that. I think it has been estimated that by the year 2020 18 per cent of Australia's population, or four million people, will be of retirement age. Hence, I come back to the basic thrust of my contribution: that is, the need for superannuation, the need to ensure that the work force generally is covered for that time. It does not matter who is in government in the year 2020; there will still be a problem for the government of the. day to meet the expectations of those people of retirement age seeking to ensure their financial well-being. It is in everyone's interest, in my view and in the Government's view, to ensure that the majority of those people are looked after by their superannuation contributions. It is important that we recognise that at least this Government has a policy which has two major elements in respect of superannuation and the ageing of Australia's population. Firstly, there must be an adequate age pension system to provide for those who have not had the opportunity to save for their retirement. Secondly, there must be encouragement of private superannuation savings for the entire work force to increase the living standards of future retirees. The creation; therefore, of roll-over funds is provided for the preservation of savings in these retirement funds. Already, about $14 billion has been saved through these instruments since 1984 and, as a result of developments such as that, we are seeing an improvement in the real standards of superannuation beneficiaries. Improved vesting and preservation rules have also been phased in and the Government has removed the taxation bias against superannuation funds investing in shares of Australian companies by introducing the imputation system. The interaction of the tax and social security systems is being overhauled so that by 1995 no pensioner, part or full rate, will pay tax. The Government has reformed the administrative arrangements for superannuation and has improved the standards required of superannuation schemes-all overseen by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. The Government, therefore, has done much to make those responsible for the management and investment of superannuation funds accountable to fund members. We have introduced occupational superannuation standards designed to ensure that all fund members receive regular information on their accrued benefits. I mention those points because in his contribution as spokesman for the Opposition on this matter, the honourable member for Dawson went to some length to talk about these sorts of issues. He talked about what he perceived as being some of the inadequacies of the Government's policy in creating a climate which would encourage savings through superannuation funds. What I have indicated in terms of listing those things that have been put in place already, specifically in reference to superannuation, is that the Government has done something about this. It has taken the initiative and put particular things in place as part of its policy guidelines which make the environment attractive for superannuation funds, for people to invest in them and, conversely, for those superannuation funds to invest in productive capacity for Australia. The honourable member for Dawson went to great lengths-and, as I have indicated, I agree with him entirely-to suggest that funds should be putting more of their savings, and there is a vast pool of savings there now, into productive capacity in this country. The environment has been created: the environment is there. We have seen the company tax rates lowered. We have seen the imputation system brought in. We have seen the industry statement brought down by the Government. All this has been aimed at providing the environment for investors to know with confidence that they can invest in the economy in this country and get some return on it. That savings pool that is there, provided by the superannuation funds, provides the perfect vehicle. It is also important to give some consideration to the issue of prudential supervision, which the honourable member for Dawson discussed in his contribution. He very rightly compared what has happened in the cas.e of State banks-the State banks of Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia - nd so on-with what may happen if the right prudential supervisory standards are not set for superannuation funds. He knows a great deal about that specific issue, being a member of the committee which is presently looking into the Australian banking industry. What he also knows, but which obviously he did not have time in his presentation to say this evening, was that the regulatory framework for supervising those State banks rests entirely with the State governments under constitutional arrangements. It also means that the voluntary compliance which the State banks have in terms of prudential supervision and in terms of information provided to the Reserve Bank of Australia comes not because of any statutory requirement under the Banking Act or any other Act of Parliament but because of voluntary arrangements entered into by the State banks. 1 refresh his memory on that because obviously, as 1 said, in his contribution tonight he probably did not have the time to elaborate on that point. It is a fact that the ISC plays a supervisory role. It is also a fact that last day week in Wollongong-an appropriate place, 1 would have thought, to make announcements of such importance-the Treasurer (Mr Keating), in addressing a superannuation conference, indicated that there was presently a review taking place into the creation of better supervisory standards for superannuation funds. That was genuinely welcomed by the participants at that conference and by the financial press in subsequent days in commenting on it. The concern and the alarm that the honourable member for Dawson might have about prudential supervision will be allayed by the fact that this review is to take place and that presumably a more rigid and better form of prudential supervision will emerge. 1 take a great deal of interest in the comments that have been made by the Treasurer in that respect because it probably goes a little deeper in respect of other areas of the Australian financial system. 1 also comment very quickly on one or two other issues that the honourable member for Dawson raised. One that was allied to this question of prudential supervision was that of the banks themselves and superannuation funds being created as part of the banks' corporate structure. As he indicated, the ANZ-National Mutual merger was blocked by this Government at the time, rightly so and still rightly so. Many of those banks have started their own superannuation or approved deposit funds. They are part of the non-bank financial institutions which have sprung up in this country. They are outside the prudential guidelines of the Reserve Bank because they are seen as being a separate entity from the main business, being the bank, the big four and the foreign banks that are now in this country. The concern that the honourable member for Dawson has about prudential supervision in regard to State banks and superannuation funds generally is possibly right in terms of being directed to those operations run by. banks. It may well be an issue that the. present review that the Treasurer has announced may wish to address. It is certainly one which the inquiry Tues- into the Australian banking industry is addressing at present. Finally, as 1 indicated at the commencement of my contribution tonight, this Bill goes a step further in reforming the Australian economy in terms of superannuation, the ability of people to save and the opportunity for those savings funds, those superannuation funds, to invest in Australia. But it is not the Government ultimately that takes those decisions by the superannuation funds; it is the boards of those funds. 1 would argue that the climate has been created. 1 believe it is now time for those people in those funds to take the ball, run with it, kick some goals and score some tries for this economy at the moment. We are in need of that investment. That pool of savings is there and 1 believe we can see some real benefits flowing from it. Debate (on motion by Mr Cadman) adjourned. NA Motion (by Mr Simmons) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. University: East Melbourne",93
130,Mr CHARLES,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak tonight on the desperate need for a new university in the outer east area of Melbourne. When Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd selected Ringwood as the location of its new factory in 1967 no-one, least of corridor. all education facility planners, could have foreseen the tremendous growth that has would occur in the eastern corridor in business establishment and residential velopment. Since that time there has been movement by several large compames wood from the west and central east areas of Melbourne to the outer east with the suing need for tertiary· technical professional training. The Yarra Valley is the oldest commerconfused cial wine growing area in Victo.r-a. with no tertiary training support fac-htIes at all. That industry alone has reqUlreme-ts for courses in viticulture, oenology-which is knowledge or study of wines-business management and hospitality. The outer eastern zone, or Ringwood corridor, can be clearly defined as a well developed sector of metropolitan Melbourne which already has a substantial population with further steady growth expected. Limited, but good quality, higher education has been provided by Victoria College and the Swinburne Institute of Technology. Higher education in Melbo-rne has beeaggregated into a few multI.camI?us versities. These lack local IdentIficatlOn and can be described as large, strong multicampuses or sprawling, weak and dispanded persed, depending. on how they are managed or one's point of view. The Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission preference to without service the north-east corridor by a combination of campuses attached to La rizons Trobe University, which will extend Bendigo and Wodonga, and Monash l!niconsider versity which will extend to the Mornmgsity ton Pe-insula and Gippsland, or for the option proposed by Deakin University, removes all local focus and identification and adds to already stretched South Australia, with 1.5 million people, is served by two universities; Queensland, with two million people, is served by universities and two university and New South Wales, with five million people, is served by nine. uni-ersit-es. The question then is why VIctona, WIt- four million people, should try to restnct the number to five universities, which clearly disadvantages the people of the north-east Though higher education in Melbourne been established with little regard for established transport, use of cars as a deprincipal means of transport is hi-hly undesirable in the long run. The Rmgline is an ideal service backbone for a higher education institution. In the l<?ng enrun technical and further educatlOn and (TAFE) must survive - nd prosper as a distinct type of educatlOn not generally with or sharing the administrative structures with higher education institutions. Major universities will have a clearly identified higher education fo-us. This is not to deny the value of maXImising credit for T AFE studies. This Government has thrown Australia into recession. Students are being told that . they should stay at school longer in order to contribute to the clever country. They cannot afford to leave home when they go to university. In the bankrupt Labor State of Victoria· some 9,000 qualified school leavers mis-ed out on tertiary places this year, yet this Gov-r-ment i.s con,cert,led only with rationahsmg tertIary mstItu-m­ tions and limiting their number. The outer east of Melbourne has exenormously in the last 20. years. It is no longer reasonable to depnve the citizens of that area of what should be a democratic right in an intelligent societythe right to ready access to a ,university having to travel long dIstances. I challenge the Minister to expand his h?of five universities for the four mIlto lion people who live in Victoria and the possibility of a new universituated in the outer east of Melbourne.

131,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable memcolleges; ber's time has expired. Homeless Youth,97
132,Mr SCIACCA,ADJOURNMENT,"ln the short time that I have tonight, I would like to talk about the growing problems of homeless youth, and specifically mention an organisation in my electorate, Bayside Adolescent Boarding Inc. (BABI), which has been doing an outstanding job in this area. The complex and varied problems facing homeless young people mean that there are no simple solutions to their circumstances. In fact, there is considerable potential to waste resources on ill-conceived plans. Merely to give income support to young homeless would achieve little in the long term unless it was related to schooling, counselling or other measures that would help these people escape from their current predicament. A preferred approach for homeless young people would be to introduce an integrated package of assistance which incorporates family mediation, income support, accommodation and education services. The holistic approach would be preferred, given the very young age of some of these children, which makes it critical for them to receive assistance before they become socially excluded and resistant to positive assistance measures. The Commonwealth and the States have embarked on a series of negotiations to come to grips with this latest problem that our increasingly disposable society has wrought upon us. Commonwealth and State welfare administrators, through the income security subcommittee of the Standing Committee of Social Welfare Administrators, have been considering ways of improving access to services provided to homeless young people by Commonwealth, State and non-government agencies. A specific emphasis has been placed on improving coordination between Department of Social Security (DSS) administration of the young homeless allowance and other services. Of particular note is a pilot project being pursued in Victoria which addresses this issue. This pilot has involved the immediate referral of applicants for the young homeless allowance to departmental social workers and joint training of staff of DSS and Community Services Victoria (CSV). The role of Community Services Victoria has included assisting in the assessment of outcomes and providing of information campaigns for CSV staff on DSS payments and eligibility criteria. An initial evaluation· of this pilot has deemed it extremely successful and recommended its continuation. But Victoria is not the only place where constructive moves are afoot to do something about the problem of homeless youth. In October last year the Queensland young homeless development fund was launched. Patron of the fund is His Grace Archbishop Peter Hollingworth, and I had the pleasure of handing over a Commonwealth cheque .to the tune of $25,000 at the launch to assist in initial research into the problem of homeless youth in the south-east Queensland corner. Roisin Goss, wife of the Premier, is copatron of the fund, and she presented a similar amount of money to the fund on behalf of the State Government. But the majority of the moneys for the fund will grow through bequests, donations and corporate sponsorships which are all tax deductible. Chairman of the fund and Brisbane radio personality Haydn Sargent has done an excellent job in lobbying government and business alike to gain support for the Queensland young homeless community development fund. It is community spirit such as this that makes one develop a warm inner glow even in these tough times of economic downturn. The fund's committee has developed a three-year program based on prevention and communication. The first year of activity will be devoted to research, communication, identification and formulation of preventative programs. Results will be available to agencies throughout Australia which provide hands-on services for the young and homeless. Another key person at that launch was Brian Burdekin, a man who needs no introduction in his commitment to doing something about the plight of homeless youth. I mention his name in the same breath as Bayside Adolescent Boarding Inc., because it was Brian Burdekin who recommended that BABI be used as a national model when it came to dealing with the problems of homeless youth. I am very proud of the work that BABI does and the people of my electorate are very proud. Of course, it would be better if the problem did not exist at all, but when facing reality it is comforting to know that organisations such as BABI are at hand. BABI came to life in the early 1980s. Since that time many people deserve to be thanked for the wonderful work they have put into the organisation to make it the national model that the Federal Human Rights Commissioner now talks about. I wish to place on record my personal thanks and the appreciation of the Australian Government to those people who are currently on the BABI management committee and those who currently do the fieldwork. Alan Prisley is the coordinator of BABI and has a reputation of being tireless in his efforts to make the lot easier for/young people who, for whatever reason, find themselves in need of accommodation and other support serv-. ices. The President of the management committee is Claude Huddy, a Woolloongabba CES manager, well qualified to give direction to people who have fallen on tough times. Many others are involved who deserve the thanks of the Government and certainly the people in my electorate. The demands upon BABI have been unrelenting and the growth rate dramatic, with referrals escalating from 39 in 1983 to over 600 in 1989; in 1991 the figure is higher still. BABI continues to fight the good fight and has one simple message to other organisations who are also fighting the good fight. Successfully supported, BABI youth regard themselves as part of the BABI 'family'. That one word indicates what all young people strive for: to belong to a family. If life in the closing years of the twentieth century cannot provide that simple yet necessary security, then perhaps organisations like BABI can. I applaud their work. I applaud their dedication. I only wish it was not necessary.",97
133,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Political Advertising,99
134,Mr CADMAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to condemn this cynical and hypocritical Government for its decision on the banning of advertising on electronic media. I have never seen anything like it in this country, and honourable members opposite should be ashamed of themselves for supporting the intellectually and financially bankrupt Party they serve. They have not got a dollar or an idea between them. That is the basic problem and that is the reason they have decided to ban advertising on the electronic media. The purposes of this decision are blatantly clear. By wiping out the advertising programs on television, they expect to stop . the criticism that is out there of their Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and their Treasurer (Mr Keating). People in the community do not like them one bit. Those opposite do not want to see us running television advertisements critical of these guys. They wish to take that right out of the system. . The Australian people want to see the undertaker Treasurer standing over the grave of the Australian economy. That is what the Australian people want to see and that is what those opposite intend to stop. They intend to replace the advertising on television, which the Australian community has become enthralled with and which they - ook forward to at each election time. They cannot wait until those final days and the Saturday when they will make the decision in the ballot box. In this instance, they will be looking forward to that Saturday to change the Government. I see the people in the gallery smiling. If they could applaud they would; I know they agree with me. The Government wishes to replace this electronic advertising with a direct mail link system, which it is now working out, paid for by the Australian taxpayer and funded by stamps, which all honourable members opposite collectively have refused to acknowledge they have gained illegally. Before the last election this was proven in the High Court. They have failed to acknowledge that and they have failed to repay where they have overdrawn. They are supporting those stamps with computer systems that, will allow them to keep records on every individual in their electorates if they so wish. They will send deceitful and misleading direct mail to them, trying just to have the same number of Australian Labor Party (ALP) members as are currently in the House returned after the next election. They are not even trying to win seats; they do not want to win seatsthey just want to keep the seats they have. That is their total objective. In addition, I suggest that those opposite are now, through the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), currying favour with the sole remaining financially stable media baron whom they are friendly with to have a pay television system run throughout Australia so that favourable programsgovernment advertising and information programs; not party advertising programs-can be run through pay television. It is a wonderful concept, but those opposite stand exposed for their plan. We have it worked out. We know what they are up to. The Australian people are not as stupid as the Labor Party thinks they are. They will not fall for the direct mail programs. They want to see the Labor Party justify at the next election the decisions it has taken over the last 10 years; they want to see the Labor Party front on television and pay for its advertising. Can honourable members opposite encourage people to make donations to that once great organisation, the Australian Labor Party? They cannot; that is their problem. The p-ople do not sufficiently believe in honourable members opposite to' make any more donations to their campaign funds. Those opposite cannot encourage even the most militant of unionists to make a forced contribution to their funds. That is what those opposite are scared of-they are afraid that, come election day, the resources will not be there fO! tnem to advertise on television and on radio. Even John Laws will not give them a run. He will be running news commentaries for the Liberal Party of Australia. He has already said that this is a blatant denial of free speech. I endorse John Laws in this area. Why are those opposite not game enough to open the matter up to normal discussion, the way it is done every election time? They are running scared. They have a scheme to subvert the traditional approach to election campaigns. They are paying out funds to the political parties. The formula is interesting: those who get the most votes get the most money, thereby reinforcing and re-endorsing a sitting government. Be that as it may, they now want to tell those parties how they must spend those funds that the taxpayer provides for them. That is blatantly dishonest. It is cynical and hypocritical, and the Australian people will not have a bar of it. Elvie Bergin",99
135,Mr GIBSON,ADJOURNMENT,"It is with sadness that I inform the House of the passing of a very fine Australian and a great woman who lived in my-electorate. Elvina May-or Elvie-Bergin of 36 Berlington Street,' Holland Park, passed away last Thursday, 4 April 1991. Elvie Bergin was a tireless worker for the community for most of her 77 years. At the time of her death, she was working as a Red Cross volunteer at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in my electorate serving tea and coffee to hospital staff and visitors. This was a regular activity for Elvie at both the Princess Alexandra Hospital and at the Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital, also in my electorate. Elvie worked with a number of community organisations in a voluntary capacity, making her own contribution to the community she loved. As well as working for the Red Cross at the hospitals, she was a volunteer at Meals on Wheels and was an active worker for the Holland Park Pensioners League. Elvie was not a person to seek kudos or any profile for her efforts. She never ran for president or secretary in these organisations; rather, she was happy being behind the scenes, keeping the kitchens operating smoothly, adding her views to planning ?f functions a-<;l events, and always havIng a Very posItIve outlook on life. I had known Elvie for only a few months, having first met her in her work with the pensioners club at Holland Park. I was immediately impressed with her enthusiasm and her dedication to the tasks at hand. I recently called together representativ-s from a number of community groups In my electorate to plan a picnic and concert as part of senior citizens' in Queensland, which will be celebrated from 22 July to 27 July. I was delighted when Elvie Bergin became part of that planning committee, representing the Holland Park Pensioners Club. I knew that her experience, enthusiasm and commitment would be invaluable to our efforts. Our committee was very shocked and saddened when we learned of Elvie Bergin's death because she was so energetic and enthusiastic in our meetings and had willingly taken on a number of tasks in planning for our senior citizens' picnic and concert. Elvie was also a member of the Greenslopes Ladies Bowling Club and her friendship and camaraderie will be fondly remembered by her fellow members. Elvie would be embarrassed at the knowledge of a speech being made about her in Parliament. She would hate having a fuss made about her. But Elvie Bergin was the type of reliable and behind-thescenes worker whom our community cannot do without. She cared about people and always wanted to make others' lives a little nicer and a little happier. I know that all honourable members join with me in offering our sincere condolences to Elvie's family and friends. She will be sa<;lly missed by her husband, Dan, her chIldren and her grandchildren, as well as the many hundreds of friends and thousands of people whose lives she brightened. May she rest in peace. GA200 Aircraft . M- RIGGALL (MCMillan) (10.4 7)-It IS WIth great pleasure that I rise tonight to talk about an aircraft that received its type certification this last month. The aircraft was designed in my electorate by a group of dedicated men who have been working on this project for a number of years. I will explain the aircraft's history. There was an aeroplane called the Piper Pawnee, an American design that was used for agricultural spraying. It was an excel-· lent aircraft in its day, but the unrealistic law practice in the United States of America, whereby whenever there was an aircraft accident the law courts took over week and usually went back to the manufacturers for suspectep design faults, created a window of opportunity for a new aircraft to be designed and modified. Three people got started on this project some 10 years ago. I guess it was inspired by a Ben Buckley, who is what is known in the best traditions as a bush pilot. Ben can land an aeroplane up in the high country in the Snowy Mountains on what normal people would consider not a safe area for walking, let alone landing an aeroplane. But Ben did this, and also decided that the aircraft that he had was not suitable or could be vastly improved. So he went to Gippsland Aeronautics Pty Ltd which at that stage had the motto 'Y obend 'em; we mend 'em', to ha-e this aircraft modified. Three people were particularly involved. There were two partners, Peter Furlong and George Morgan. They had a look at this aircraft to see what they could do. They had a designer by the name of Colin Nicholson. The three of these people put their heads together and came up with what is now known as the Fatman or . more partIcularly, the GA200, as it is' known officially by its type certification. Basically, they took the Piper Pawnee cut it down the middle, broadened it - ade it into a dual control aircraft and,' over a period of some 10 years, modified it and developed a totally new aircraft. To compare it with the old Piper Pawnee, it outflies it, outmanoeuvres it, outlifts it and it has greater speed and durability. ' It has the capability of using the new chemicals that are required in agriculture. It. can be. used. for fire fightiJ?g in very hIlly terraIn. It IS a very versatIle aircraft. Interestingly, this is only the sixth aircraft in Australia's great aviation history-going back to the days of Hargrave, who 1 believe was responsible for the concept of dihedral wings, and including the Nomad aircraft-to get type certification. Unfortunately, despite this being a great time in our history, neither the Minister nor the head of the Civil Aviation Authority, Dick Smith, for reasons of duplication, were able to see the aircraft officially launched this month. That was a great tragedy. 1 think that honourable members on both sides of the House would be delighted to see a small Australian company get on with developing something that can only be described as a great personal achievement for the company and, we hope, for Australia. Already there have been inquiries from right around the world about this aircraft because it is the only one of its type being made in the world. That is something of which we can all be proud. 1 call on the Minister, very quietly, to take note of what 1I have said. 1 would very much like any export incentives that may be available to be brought forward. 1 would like the Minister at some time in the near future to give these people the encouragement they deserve. 1 know that that encouragement would be received warmly and welcomed. Local Government Grants",100
136,Mrs CROSIO,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise In tonight to bring to the attention of this House the report tabled in this place in the first week of March entitled Commonpresent wealth Grants Commission: Report on the following. Interstate Distribution of General Purpose Grants for Local Government 1991. I rise tonight not only to express the concern of the two councils 1 represent, Fairfield City Council and Holroyd City Council, and the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils, but also to bring to the attention of the House an indication of what would happen to the States of New South Wales and Victoria if this local government report on equalisation distribution of Federal Government grant assistance were to become a reality. know at this stage that this report was commissioned in 1989 following the Preable miers Conference. 1 might add that this proposal was adopted at the request of the Premiers of the lesser populated States. 1 also add at this juncture that at that particular Premiers Conference only the Victorian Government questioned the appropriateness of fiscal equalisation as the basis of the future distribution of local government assistance. 1 acknowledge that this matter was raised in submissions. Both the New South Wales Local Government Association and the Victorian Local Government Association objected to the proposal and supported the continued use of a per capita grant in the allocation of State local government funding from the Federal Government. 1 say to all honourable members who are concerned about what would happen to the local government areas within their electorates if this report were adopted that they should read requirement five of the report, page xxv, where the Chairman of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, Commissioner C.R. Rye, states: . . . whether it is appropriate to adopt relativities based on fiscal equalisation is not a simple question. The answer depends upon the weights attached by governments to horizontal fiscal equalisation for the local government sector as against other policy objectives-including economic efficiency, social equity considerations and administrative simplicity. He continues: practice, however, there are several considerations which governments would need to take into account in considering any change to the basis of distribution. They include the (i) The per capita basis of distribution is simple and predictable. An equalisation basis would be much more complex and would deliver less predictable outcomes, particularly in the early years. (ii) A change to an equalisation system would entail extra administrative costs for both the Commonwealth and the States. These costs have to be considered in relation to the relatively small size of the pool. (iii) A move to an equalisation basiS would be very disruptive to local authorities in New South Wales and Victoria. We To comment on how disruptive it would be to New South Wales, 1 can tell honourmembers that in the western region of New South Wales incorporating something like nine councils which make up the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils, the grants would mean a loss of something like $24m in revenue in one year. If the Commission's recommendations were adopted it would result in the 176 local government councils in New South Wales losing $161m on the 1990-91 figures. If this report were adopted, these councils would receive an average grant of only $14.11 per person, as against the average per capita grant of $41.94 which they now receive, whereas Queensland councils would receive $90.70 per capita instead of $41.94. If the recommendations were adopted, the particular council I represent, Fairthe field City Council, would lose $4.126m and Holroyd City Council would lose $1. 14m-money they can ill afford to lose in the avenue of local government. Counparties cils in the Sydney region, including ford, Wyong and Wollondilly, would $62.5m. The Commonwealth Government provided a total of $699m this year in financial assistance grants to the 914 councils throughout Australia. That covcal ers the period 1990-91. This amount is distributed among the States on a per capita basis-a very fair basis. Of total amount, New South Wales councils at the moment receive 34.8 per cent, $243.1m. The Commission has recomnations, mended that the interstate distribution of they receive. Federal assistance grants be based upon the principle of fiscal equalisation. However, this approach needs to take into account the relative financial strength the councils in each State. In the limited time. I have remaining, would like to say that there is considerthen able concern throughout local government areas in New South Wales, which I feel sure would be expressed throughout the Victorian local government areas. As the Federal member of the area I represent, I next campaign'. would like to voice this concern in this Parliament. This is only a report, and that is how it should be dealt with by this Government. It was commissioned in for 1989, but is not relevant to 1991.",102
137,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Political Advertising,103
138,Mr LEE,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to respond to some remarks made earlier tonight by the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). The honourable member sought to attack this Government for its plans to abolish paid political commercials on radio and television. Of course, it has the support of the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker). This issue is about honesty in Government. The Opposition is continuing its total opposition to the disclosure of donations to political parties. That is what issue is all about. Members of the Opposition ignore the report of the Fitzgerald commission of inquiry which recommended that donations to political be made public. The Opposition Gosignores the recommendations made by the lose New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) in its investigation into land developments on the has New South Wales North Coast. Commissioner Roden said that it is a threat to honesty in government if politiparties do not declare where their donations are coming from. The Opposition ignores the recommendations of the for this mer Commonwealth Electoral Commissioner, Dr Colin Hughes, that political or parties should declare all of their doall the gifts and all the money We even have the farce of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), when of asked at the National Press Club what his position was on the disclosure of donations, saying that he had an inclination I towards the disclosure of donations and within 24 hours all the bagmen of the Liberal Party were on the phone to him saying, 'You cannot support the disclosure of donations because we will have trouble bankrolling the Liberal Party's",103
139,Mr MELHAM,ADJOURNMENT,He was kneecapped.,103
140,Mr LEE,ADJOURNMENT,"As the honourable member Banks says, he was kneecapped. Within 24 hours the leader of the Opposition had to do a backflip. He then came out opposing the disclosure of donations to political parties. We have to make it clear that the only way we can ensure that we have honesty in government is to have full disclosure at the Federal, State and local government election levels. It is only when we have full disclosure that anyone will be able to point the finger at any party in this Parliament or at the State or local level. We all know, and it has always been the Liberal Party's position, that the right to make a secret donation to a political party is as important as the right to a secret vote. That is what Senator Short has said to me on past occasions at press conferences. I ask honourable members to listen to the statement again: 'The right to make a secret donation to a political party is as important as the right to a secret vote'. The important difference is that when someone casts a vote no one knows who that person has voted for. If someone donates money to the Liberal Party, I am sure that the Liberal Party apparatchiks remember which businesses have donated to the Liberal Party. The same applies to donations made to my Party. That is why the Labor Party has been arguing at Federal and State levels that it is time we disclosed all donations to all political parties so that we can ensure that we have honesty in government and that the recommendations of the Fitzgerald commission of inquiry, ICAC in New South Wales and Dr Hughes are implemented as soon as possible. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11 p.m. NA The following notices were given: Mr Gibson to move That this House: (1) notes the major contribution to enhancing local facilities made by the Commonwealth Government's Community Recreation and Sporting Facilities program through provision of financial assistance to sporting and· recreational organisations; (2) notes that the purpose of this program is to encourage the development of high quality sport and recreational facilities across Australia to enable greater community participation in sport and improved development of skills to enhance Australia's national and international sporting performances, as recommended by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration reports of May and December 1989 entitled ""Going for Gold"" and ""Can Sport be Bought"", respectively; (3) seeks a continuation of this program in the 1991-92 Commonwealth Budget to enable additional support to be provided throughout Australia for development of further community facilities; and (4) calls upon the Government to allocate: (a) a sum of not less than $20 million over a three year period for the Recreation and Sporting Facilities program; and (b) a similar sum for the establishment of a National Sports Facilities program to provide substantial financial support for the construction of sporting facilities of national significance, particularly in regional centres, in accordance with recommendations contained in the above-mentioned reports.

NA NA Parliamentary Dining Room: Partitioning Mr Cobb to ask Mr Speaker: (1) What was the cost of partitioning the Members' and Members' and guests' dining rooms. (2) Were tenders or quotes called for the work. (3) Who undertook the work. (4) When was the work done and how long did it take to complete. (5) Who made the final decision to proceed with the work. (6) Was the person who made the final decision to proceed aware of the details of the work before making the decision. The following answers to questions were circulated: Higher Education Facilities, Melbourne (Q uestion No. 320) Mr Halverson asked the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, upon notice, on 9 October 1990:, (1) Is there an urgent need for higher education facilities in the Croydon/Lilydale area of the eastern region of Melbourne. (2) Will he support the current proposal from the Victoria College and the Outer Eastern College of TAFE to construct an $8.524 million higher education building at the new Croydon TAFE campus in 1993. (3) What advantages for the Croydon/Lilydale area will result from the planned merger of Victoria College and Deakin University. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) It is recognised that participation rates in higher education for all age groups are low in the outer eastern areas of Melbourne and are substantially below the State average. A participation rate of 9.3% for 17-24 years olds, for example, compares unfavourably with a State average of 13.1. There are a number of higher education and T AFE providers which cater for this area and which can provide the basis for action to improve participation rates. The Victorian Post-Secondary Education Committee (VPSEC) reported in November 1990 to the Minister for Education in Victoria on the development of higher education in the east and north of Melbourne and this report provides some options for developments to meet needs in the area. A copy has been provided direct to the Honourable Member. It is important that developments which do occur are co-ordinated in a way which ensures they meet perceived needs. (2) Given that the VPSEC report indicates that other institutions also have the potential interest and ability to meet needs in the area, specific proposals such as the one put forward by Victoria College cannot be progressed llntil structural proposals are finalised. The Victorian Minister is aiming to advise on final structural proposals by the end of March 1991. (3) Any specific advantages which might flow to the Croydon/Lilydale area from a merger of institutions is a question which the institutions themselves and the Victorian authorities would NA need to answer. However amalgamations of higher education institutions generally can provide significant educational and administrative adv.antages. The educational benefits may involve an expanded range of subjects, courses and categories of awards, better credit transfer arrangements, enhanced student services, a general strengthening of academic departments and imouter proved teaching and research facilities. Steel (Question No. 342) Mr Downer asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, upon notice, on 15 October 1990: (1) Is Australian steel sold for less on overseas markets than on the domestic market; if so, why. (2) What are the implications for the domestic steel market and pricing structures of BHP's average capital city pricing structure. Mr Crean-The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes, assuming an exchange rate for the Australian dollar of around US 77 cents. . Domestic price increases for most grades of steel must be approved by the Prices Surveillance Authority. In recent years such increases have been below the general rate of inflation. International steel prices, which are mainly quoted in US currency, are determined by supply and demand, export tactics of other suppliers, price controls in some countries and subsidies and export incentives in many countries. (2) For nearly all products, BHP's list prices are standard in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. All prices include a transport component. Centres more distant from major steelworks such as Perth, Darwin and Tasmania pay higher prices for steel reflecting a larger transport component. Under this pricing structure those firms in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide furthest from the steelmaking centre which makes their particular steel requirements are not disadvantaged compared to those closer. Science Courses (Question No. 397) Mr MCGauran asked the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, upon notice, on 12 November 1990: (1) What was the entry score for science related courses in each year since 1982 for (a) the University of Melbourne, (b) La Trobe University, (c) Monash University, (d) the University of Queensland, (e) the University of New South Wales, (f) Sydney University, (g) Flinders University, (h) the University of Adelaide, (i) Curtin University and (j) the University of Western Australia. (2) Is he able to provide similar information with respect to other post-secondary institutions. (3) Did any tertiary institution fail to fill its quota of positions for science related disciplines in each year since 1987; if so, (a) which institutions, (b) in what disciplines and (c) to what extent did they fall short of their quotas. (4) Have any concerns been reported of existing or future shortages of personnel in any of the science related disciplines; if so, what are the details. (5) What initiatives has the Government taken with respect to (a) the career structures of practising scientists, (b) the salaries and conditions employment of practising scientists, (c) the level of awareness of science courses and science careers amongst secondary students, (d) the levels of expertise of science and mathematics teachers, (e) the role of science and mathematics in primary schools and (f) deficiencies in science and mathematics curricula in both primary and secondary sc-ocils. (6) What is the difference between male and female participation in science and mathematics courses at Australian universities. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The Department of Employment, Education and Training's higher education statistics collections do not include statistics on tertiary entrance cut-off scores. I am therefore not able to provide comprehensive data of the type sought by the honourable member. (3) Higher education institutions are not required to provide information to the Commonwealth on any quotas they may set for entry to individual courses. Such information would need to be sought directly from institutions. (4) Concerns have been raised in meetings with the Australian Research Council and the Science and Technology Coordination Committee about anticipated shortfalls over the next decade for scientific researchers in academic and research organisations. These have been of a general nature. Discussions have been held between my Department, the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, and representatives of the relevant organisations on the possible role of immigration in these areas. DEET has also commissioned, and received a draft report of, a study on the Labour Market for Academics, which is currently being assessed. (5) (a) Since the beginning of 1990, through the improved and expanded Australian Research Council (ARC) Fellowships program, the Government has provided strong support to improving career opportunities for practising scientists. The ARC Fellowships program provides opportunities to pursue research full time for the very best Australian and international researchers from postdoctoral to professorial levels. Over 270 fellows will participate in 1991 at a cost of over $13.3m. In 1991 new fellowships will be available at the following levels: Australian Postdoctoral Research Fellow ($31,178-$34,584): 50 fellows with maximum tenure of three years; Australian Research Fellow ($33,163-$38,841): 30 fellows with maximum tenure of five years; Queen Elizabeth II Fellow ($40,257-$43,096): 15 fellows with maximum of tenure of three years; Australian Senior Research Fellow ($43,984-$67,812): 21 fellows with tenure for 5 years. All fellowships will need to be won in open competition. Subject to the competitive process, it is possible for promising young scientists to progress through each of the levels and for outstanding candidates to include a period as a Queen Elizabeth II Fellow. (b) Through its current involvement in negotiation on academic staffing matters, the Government has indicated its readiness to fund substantial salary increases for academic staff and has actively sought improvements in a number of non-salary matters relating to career structures which would improve the attractiveness of an academic career. These negotiations are still under way. CSIRO as a major employer of scientific staff has recently agreed to substantial improvements in salary and careers structures for scientists and related staff. (c) Recent Government initiatives in the area include the following: - the Women's Bureau of DEET has been responsible for the production of new material targeted at non-traditional careers for women, including science/technology; - under the Youth Social Justice Strategy, to ensure better access to services and information by young people, the Youth Access Centre (Y AC) Network has also been refocussed to give greater attention to those who traditionally have not made use of those services; and the expansion of the YAC network has been supplemented by grants to rural community groups or agencies to establish information services for young people. In addition, a program of distribution of literature on courses and careers, including those in science, is offered to young people, careers advisers and schools through the Commonwealth's occupational information program, Career Reference Centres and Work Information Centres (d) Under the Projects of National Significance Program, the Commonwealth is funding one project which addresses the levels of expertise of teachers in general and two projects that address the specific needs of science and mathematics teachers: - The development of a co-operative policy for the application of distance learning to inservice education-this will impact on science and mathematics teachers as well as teachers in other subjects; - the development of a national strategy for school-based in service in science; and - the development of inservice modules in areas of perceived need including mathematics, science and biotechnology. In July 1988 the Commonwealth established a Discipline Review of Teacher Education in Mathematics and Science - The - The Review's recommendations address a range of issues aimed at strengthening the pre-service and post-initial education of teachers, and hence the quality of teaching and learning in mathematics and science at all levels of schooling. - A Commonwealth response to the review has been prepared and circulated to higher education institutions for information and comment. Institutions have been asked to advise DEET by 1 December 1991 of changes they have implemented as a result of the review, and of any other developments which have occurred in the teacher education area since the release of the discipline review's report. The above initiatives need to be seen in the context of the Commonwealth's involvement in award restructuring in the education industry. The Commonwealth is supporting better salaries and improved career structures for teachers and has agreed to pay its share of the cost of award restructuring. It is also seeking to strengthen the profession in collaboration with employers and unions through the Nationl,ll Project on the Quality of Teaching. Improving the pre-service and inservice training of teachers is a high priority of the National Project's priorities. Outcomes of award restructuring will impact on science and mathematics teachers as they flow to the wider profession. (e) It is likely that in the near future science will be defined as part of the core curriculum for the primary school level, The Discipline Review of Teacher Education recommended that Deans of Education responsible for primary teacher education programs begin procedures to ensure that students are scientifically competent and confident. - In particular the Review recommended school-Ie avers entering primary education programs to have studied mathematics at Years 11/12. Because of the importance of mathematics in the primary curriculum the Discipline Review of Teacher Education in Mathematics and Science recommended that Deans of Education responsible for primary teacher education programs begin procedures to ensure that students are mathematically competent and confident. (1) The Commonwealth Government has been working co-operatively with the States and Territories through the Australian Education Council to progress the development of a common curriculum framework, which sets out major areas of knowledge and skills for students in all years of schooling. science and mathematics curriculum areas are being studied through two phasesa mapping exercise and the development of a statement of common curriculum principles which can meet the needs of all school students. The development of a set of common curriculum principles in mathematics has been completed and a similar document for science will be ready by mid 1991. The Commonwealth Government has also supported a further range of initiatives, including the UK-Australia Science Teacher Exchange Scheme, the international Mathematics and Science Olympiads, the Earthworm Award Scheme and the expansion of CSIRO Double Helix Clubs. (6) As reported in the Department's Higher Education Series Report No.4 (Science Students), women accounted for nearly 38% of science students in 1989, up from 34% in 1980. Male and female science students tend to specialise in different fields, with women showing a preference for the life sciences while men have a preference for computing and the physical sciences. Similar proportions of male and female s'cience students complete mathematics majors. Women are least represented in science at the higher degree level. In 1989 about 30% of higher degree science students were women, whereas they comprised almost 40% of Bachelor degree students. However, the rise between 1980 and 1989 in females' share of science enrolments was greatest at the higher degree level. Australian National University: Industrial (Question No. 408) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, upon notice, on 13 November 1990: Did Australian National University staff stage a half-day strike on 17 October 1990; if so, is he able to say (a) how many of the staff notified the University administration that they were on strike, (b) what sum was saved in wages as a result of the strike and (c) how will that sum be used. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) (b) (c) The Australian National University has advised that its staff did not stage a strike on the 17 October 1990. The Academic Staff Association called a meeting on 17 October at lunch time to discuss progress on academic issues. As far as the University administration is aware, there was no further industrial action on that day and there was no notification to the University about a strike. Information Technology Graduates (Question No. 418) Mr MCGauran asked the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, upon notice, on 15 November 1990: (1) Are there sufficient suitably trained graduates to meet the demand of the various sectors of the information technology industry. (2) Has his attention been drawn to the findings of the Information Industries Education and Training Foundation reported in ""The Supply of People Skilled in Information Technology"" concerning future shortages of suitably trained information technology graduates; if so, what measures has the Government taken to ensure an expansion in the numbers of students undertaking information technology related courses of study in the post-secondary sector. (3) What were the entry scores for computer related courses in each year since 1984 at (a) the University of Melbourne, (b) La Trobe University, (c) Monash University, (d) the University of Sydney, (e) the University of New South Wales, (f) Macquarie University, (g) the University of Queensland, (h) the University of Adelaide, (i) Flinders University and (j) the University of Western Australia. (4) Is he able to provide similar information with respect to other post-secondary institutions. (5) How many students have entered computer or information technology related courses in each year since 1985. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the Action honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. It is noted, however, that the intensity of the demand for computing-related occupations has shown a downward trend for over twelve months, with the Department's Skilled Vacancy Survey index of November 1990 down by 45 percent from its peak in August 1989. (2) Yes. Computer science has been nominated as a priority area for the allocation of additional Commonwealth places in higher education since 1988. It will remain as a nominated priority area over the 1991-93 triennium. (3) & (4) The Department of Employment, Education and Training's higher education statistics collections do not include statistics on tertiary entrance cut-off scores. I am therefore. not able to provide comprehensive data of the type sought by the honourable member. (5) 'Figures on the number of students commencing courses specifically in computing science/ information systems are available from 1987. These are 4413 in 1987, 5081 in 1988, 6664 in 1989 and 7881 in 1990. It is important to note however, that students may also gain qualifications in computing science/information systems by undertaking courses in business, arts, science and engineering. It is not possible to identify such students until they have completed their course. The figures provided are therefore an understatement. As a nominated priority area, computing received 970 of the additional 6300 places made available by the Government in 1989. In 1990 just under 700 of the 5600 additional places were allocated to computing. Generic Equivalent Drugs (Question No. 462) Dr Bob Woods asked the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, upon notice, on 6 December 1990: (1) Following the introduction on 1 December 1990 of major changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) whereby generic equivalents were to be substituted for brand name products, have pharmacists received the December edition of the PBS Price Book which details the prices to be charged for generic equivalent drugs. (2) Were two entire sets of the December edition of the Price Book printed in advance, each containing a different price differential based on the two alternative prices then being considered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. (3) Is it a fact that a number of generic equivalents for drugs such as Maxolen, Serepax and Indocid are not obtainable at present. (4) Has the introduction of the changes to the PBS resulted in the confusion of pharmacists and consumers; if so, when will he act to alleviate that confusion. Mr Staples-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The delay in the issuing by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal (PBRT) of a determination reflecting the terms of the agreement between the Guild and the Government posed a number of difficulties for the printing and distribution of the December 1990 edition of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Book for pharmacists (the Yellow Book). This delay meant that the prices to apply from 1 December were uncertain up until a few days before. The Department of Community Services and Health made strenuous efforts to have a new book printed with the existing remuneration levels and to arrange its distribution to pharmacists. Unfortunately there was a delay in the delivery of the books. Australia Post has been assisting the department to identify problem areas to ensure that these do not occur again. (2) Yes. In the expectation that the PBRT would make a determination effective from 1 December 1990 in accordance with the agreement, a book containing prices based on a 10% pharmacists' mark-up was printed but undated to ensure that any delay in the Tribunal's decision would not result in the book having to be pulped. When it became clear that a delay would occur necessitating a December book which contained prices based on a 25% mark-up along with other PBS changes occurring from 1 December 1990, such an edition was then printed. The early undated version has now been despatched to take effect from 1 January 1991 reflecting the determination made by the PBRT on 20 December 1990. (3) No. A number of claims have been made about the non-availability of some minimum price brands. These reports have been investigated. Manufacturers of all the products in question have been contacted. These manufacturers, with the one exception, have advised that they have adequate stocks of all the products identified and that supplies are being despatched to wholesalers as orders are placed. In the case of the brand for which there is a supply problem, and in order not to disadvantage pharmacists and their patients, the ance Commission has been advised to reimburse pharmacists on the basis of the higher priced brand until stocks are available. Similar arrangements will be made for any other case in which there is only one minimum price brand and where there is a genuine supply problem. (4) No. A major effort was mounted by the Department of Community Services and Health to ensure that pharmacists, as well as consumers and doctors, were well informed about minimum pricing. In spite of the difficulties outlined above, pharmacists were provided with ""ScriptWise"" information kits. These information kits provided complete details of the minimum price brands. As well, doctors, consumer and pensioner organisations, nursing homes and hostels, and all Federal Members of Parliament have been provided with information kits. Furthermore, a list of drug products affected by minimum pricing from 1 December 1990 and their prices was supplied to The Pharmacy Guild of Australia prior to 1 December for distribution to pharmacists. The Government has adopted a responsible approach in the face of substantial obstacles towards ensuring a smooth transition to the minimum pricing reform for pharmacists as well as doctors and consumers. Taxation: Value of Newborn Lambs (Question No 471) Mr Tuckey asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 20 December 1990: Did he in his May 1988 economic statement announce that the value of newborn lambs would be raised for income taxation purposes from $1 to $4 to reflect current values; if so, will he adjust the value downwards to reflect the fact that such sheep are practically worthless. MrKeating-The answer to the honourable member's question IS as follows: Taxpayers owning livestock may adopt either of two methods of valuing livestock: cost price or market selling value. Under the cost price method, livestock is valued at the cost incurred in purchasing or producing the livestock. In the case of livestock created by natural increase it is recognised that there are difficulties in determining the appropriate cost price. For this reason minimum values are prescribed as an estimate of the cost of natural increase. These values were first set in 1936 and were revised upward in 1984. In 1988 values were increased to a level more in line with the costs of natural increase. It is important to note that these values do not relate to the market selling Health Insur- value of the livestock. If a taxpayer using the cost price method of valuation sells livestock at a price lower than cost price, then the taxpayer will incur a loss in the year of sale which will be deductible for tax purposes. Where a taxpayer has chosen to use the cost price method of valuing livestock, this is an appropriate outcome. It is also worth noting that where a taxpayer using the cost price method sells livestock at a profit, then that profit will not be recognised until the year of sale. This is a recognised feature of the cost price method of valuation; it defers the recognition of both gains and losses in the value of livestock until sale. If taxpayers wish to gain immediate recognition of losses on production, then they can use the market selling value method of valuing livestock. This method, of course, also immediately recognises gains. A change in market conditions does not necessarily mean that the cost of production of natural increase of sheep has fallen. There is therefore no basis to change the minimum prescribed values. Moreover taxpayers can elect to bring the natural increase of livestock to account at the actual cost of production if this is less than the prescribed minimum value for that class of livestock. This should alleviate the problems faced by any taxpayer whose cost of production of natural increase is lower than the prescribed minimum value. Uniting Church Wesley Mission (Question No. 472) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Community Services and Health, upon notice, on 20 December 1990: Has his Department or its predecessors provided funds to the Uniting Church Wesley Mission since 1980; if so, (a) what sum has been provided and (b) were funds designated for special purposes; if so, what purposes.",103
141,Mr HOWE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The Department of Community Services and Health has provided funds amounting to $27,077 ,994 since 1980 to the Uniting Church Wesley Mission. (b) Funds were designated for the purposes set out in the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program (SAAP) and Crisis Accommodation Program (CAP) to meet the needs of homeless people. Capital projects being funded under CAP and salary subsidies, operating costs and equipment under SAAP. Also to assist people with a disability to achieve positive outcomes of competence, self-reliance, participation, choice and image by providing recurrent and non-recurrent funds in areas such as employment and accommodation support. Funds were also allocated from the Aged and Community Care Program; however, the detailed records required to answer Mr Campbell's question are not held in a central location within the Department of Community Services and Health and considerable time and resources would be involved in assembling the information requested. Mackay War Memorial (Question No. 481) Mr Hawker asked the Minister for Land Transport, upon notice, on 20 December 1990: Will the Mackay, Qld, Central State School's efforts to establish a war memorial receive national recognition through specific planting of trees along Remembrance Drive between Sydney and Canberra: if so, (a) how many trees will be planted on behalf of Mackay, (b) how will they be identified and (c) if there are to be two trees for every one planted at Mackay, why. Mr Robert Brown-The answer· to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes (a) 308 trees (b) Trees are to be planted at the junction of the Federal and Hume Highways and identified by a plaque. (c) Two trees are to be planted for each one planted by the students of the Mackay Central State School in recognition of their efforts and as part of the overall Remembrance Driveway objective of commemorating Australia's war dead. Wool Sales (Question No. 489) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 20 December 1990: (1) How many bales of wool did Australia sell in 1989-90. (2) How was the figure in part (1) calculated. Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) It is estimated that Australia sold approximately 3.085 million bales in 1989-90. (2) It is difficult to determine the precise number of bales of wool sold in Australia in any given period because although records of auction sales are available, full records are not compiled for wool sold by private merchants. It is only possible, therefore, to estimate an approximate number of bales sold during the year. Trade clearances are calculated as follows: Production in the year 1029.4 kt (estimated by ABS) Plus AWC opening 33.1 kt (Data from AWC) stocks Less AWC closing stocks 539.4 kt (Data from AWC) Plus brokers opening 41.2 kt (Data from National stocks of unsold wool CQuncil of Wool Selling Brokers) Less brokers closing 21.6 kt (Data from National stocks of unsold wool TRADE CLEARANCES 542.8 kt Using a conversion factor of 176 kg/bale TRADE CLEARANCES 3.085 m bales National Crime Authority (Question No. 495) Mr Mack asked the Minister representing the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 21 December 1990: (l) Did Dennis Lionel Williams of Canterbury, NSW, provide certain information to the National Crime Authority (NCA) in September 1990; if so, did that information include information concerning criminal conduct. (2) If Mr Williams provided information to the NCA concerning criminal conduct, what action (a) has the NCA taken and (b) does the NCA intend to take in respect of that information.",112
142,Mr DUFFY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: I am advised by the Authority that unless and until such matters may be revealed in court proceedings, or may be made public by others, it neither confirms nor denies that particular persons provided it with information, nor discloses the nature of any information provided. The Authority's position is based on a long standing practice it has adopted with my approval out of concern for the safety of witnesses and informants. Provisional Tax (Question No. 505) Mr Bruce Scott asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 21 December 1990: In light of the current economic recession, will he direct the Commissioner of Taxation to allow a higher percentage variation in assessable income for provisional tax purposes, than the existing 10 per cent, for small businesses and primary producers who will be calculating their liability in early 1991; if so, what percentage variation will be allowed; if not, why not.",113
143,Mr KEATING,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Commissioner is empowered to administer the provisional tax legislation which is clear on this particular issue. Primary producers, and small businesses that have a provisional tax liability of less than $8000 pay their provisional tax once annually which, in Couricil of Wool this case, is due no earlier than 1 April 1991. Selling Brokers) The 10 per cent tolerance applies to income earned over the full year, and in practice these taxpayers will or should have derived an actual or known income for 9 months of that year and will only need to estimate their income for the remaining 3 months of that year. That is, 9 months of actual income plus 3 months of estimated income. However, in the situation where the taxpayer does underestimate his or her taxable income for calculating provisional tax, the Commissioner has discretionary powers to: (1) grant remission or partial remission of penalty relating to the underestimation of income where the taxpayer can demonstrate ""unknown"" circumstances; such as, natural disaster, unseasonal conditions, change in economic conditions; and (2) accept an application for provisional tax variation after the 1 April due date. This allows extra time for the taxpayer to estimate a more accurate income figure. In the light of the above, I do not propose to direct the Commissioner to allow a higher percentage variation for provisional tax purposes. Taxation: Small Business Contractors (Question No. 506) Mr Mack asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 21 December 1990: (1) Has his attention been drawn to concerns expressed by the Contractors Association Limited of St Leonards, NSW, at the difficulties being experienced by small business contractors who, acting on the advice of lawyers and accountants, have carried on business under a company structure and subsequently been re-assessed for ruinous amounts of taxation. (2) Will he request a review of the practice of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) of re-assessing the taxation liability of such small business contractors for periods of several years prior to the ruling which found against the company structures under which they operated. (3) Will he take any steps to review the - ases of small business contractors who arranged their affairs reasonably in accordance with professional advice but have now been re-assessed for very large amounts of taxation. (4) Will the ATO issue information to the public indicating which incorporated business structures are suitable for small business contractors and are acceptable to the ATO; if not, why not. (5) Will he .ensure that the Contractors Association Limited and other interested bodies representing small business contractors have an opportunity to contribute to the ATO's formulation of a draft ruling on personal service income.",113
144,Mr KEATING,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l) The Contractors Association has, on numerous occasions, drawn their concerns on this matter to my attention. On each occasion, the Minister Assisting the Treasurer or a member of my staff has responded to those concerns. (2) The ATO is responsible for the administration of the taxation laws as laid down by Parliament and interpreted by the Courts from time to time. It does so in a responsible manner so that taxes, as far as possible, are imposed equitably and fairly. To assist in consistency of treatment, the· ATO publicly issues Taxation Rulings on a regular basis which outline its interpretation of the law. The ruling referred to in this question is Taxation Ruling IT 2121 which issued on 12 December 1984 and sets out the ATO's views on the taxation treatment of certain income splitting arrangements. The ruling issued after public debate over the decision in Tupicoff v. Commissioner of Taxation 84 ATC 4851; 15 ATR 1262 which confirmed the ATO's long held views on this. matter. The ruling did not issue as the result of any change in the law or change in policy. The Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (""the Act"") authorises the Commissioner of Taxation, under certain circumstances, to amend assessments so that the taxation laws are properly applied. Taxation Rulings do not have the force of law. Any re-assessment of the taxation liability of members of the Contractors Association Limited is not, and cannot be authorised by a ruling issued by the ATO but is a result of the application of the law as it exists (and in this case, as it has always existed). Nevertheless, the Commissioner of Taxation has advised me that re-assessments in this area have not been made in respect of periods prior to the issue of the ruling except in exceptional circumstances. (3) Where a taxpayer is dissatisfied with his or her taxation position which has resulted from advice received from a professional advisor, that dissatisfaction is a matter to be taken up by the taxpayer with the advisor. (4) The Commissioner of Taxation has advised me that Taxation Rulings IT 2121, IT 2330, IT 2503 and Exposure Draft Ruling EDR 14, which are all available to the public, deal extensively with the taxation implications of the various structures which may be used by small businesses. (5) Exposure Draft Ruling EDR 14 on personal service income was issued by the ATO for public comment on 8 January 1991. The Contractors Association Limited, and others, have submitted written comments on the Exposure Draft Ruling. Shepparton Preserving Company (Question No. 511) Mr Scholes asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 21 January 1991: (1) Did the Minister claim that International Public Relations had received a large payment from the Shepparton Preserving Company (SPC); if so, when was the payment received. (2) Is the Minister able to say whether International Public Relations was involved in the proposal for SPC employees to abandon award conditions and the Industrial Relations Commission; if so, what was the nature of that involvement. (3) Is the Minister able to say whether International Public Relations (a) is a foreign owned company and (b) has a record of involvement in political activities. (4) Is the Minister able to say whether any firms have approached or been approached to use International Public Relations to promote abandonment of the award conditions of employees, (5) Is there any evidence of a connection between International Public Relations and employees of SPC, grower representatives or SPC shareholders.",114
145,Mr WILLIS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister for Industrial Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (l) The Minister for Industrial Relations said on 17 December 1990 in the Senate that the Shepparton Preserving Company has retained International Public Relations Pty Limited at considerable cost to assist in the course of the dispute with employees. As the matter is of a contractual nature between the two companies, no further details are available. (2) No. (3) (a) I am advised that International Public Relations Pty Limited has been part of the world wide Shandwick Group since August 1988. (b) No. (4) No. (5) Not to my knowledge. Tariff Concession Orders (Question No. 513)  Business and Customs, upon notice, on 21 January 1991: (1) With regard to Tariff Concession Order (TCO) No. 880 1740, (a) why was the TCO revoked, (b) which company requested its revocation and for what reasons, (c) to which goods did the TCO apply, (d) how long was the TCO in force and (e) how many Australian companies have been affected by the revocation and to what extent. (2) With regard to TCO No. 900 7139, (a) which company applied for the TCO, (b) for what reasons was the TCO requested, (c) why was the TCO granted, (d) for what goods was it granted and (e) how many Australian companies are taking advantage of the TCO. (3) Was TCO No. 900 7139 granted with respect to individually packaged containers printer and photocopier toner of no more than 500 grams; if so, (a) why and (b) why did the TCO not apply to all toner. (4) Are there any Australian manufacturers of laser printer and photocopier toner; if so, how many. Mr Beddall-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: 1 (a) TC 8801740 was revoked because it permitted duty free importation into Australia of goods which are produced in Australia by Columbia Pelikan Pty Ltd. (b) The revocation action was taken by the Australian Customs Service for the reasons outlined in l(a) above. (c) The concession applied to toners and developers for laser printers falling within heading 3707.90 of the Customs Tariff. (d) The TCO was in force from 22/1/88 until 10/9/90. (e) It is not known how many companies have been affected by the revocation or to what extent. 2 (a) TC 9007139 was not granted as a result of an application for a concession. It replaced 880174 to aHow goods which did not compete with Australian product to continue to be imported free of duty. (b) The concession was not requested-see 2(a) above. (c) The TCO was granted in accon\ance with the Customs Act following enquiries by the Australian Customs Service which revealed that the goods described in the TCO were not produced in Australia. (d) The concession covers toners and developers for laser printers, in individual packs containing not less than 500gm, falling within Tariff heading 3707.90 of the Customs Tariff. (e) Since the TCO was put in place 56 different companies have entered goods using the concession. 3 No. (a) The TCO does not apply to containers of less than 500 grams. (b) Toner in smaller pack sizes was considered to compete in the market place with locally packaged goods. Imported bulk packs or large cartridges do not compete with local products. 4 The Australian Customs Service is unaware of any Australian manufacturers of toner. Industry Commission: Automotive Industry Report (Question No. 546) Mr Scholes asked the Prime Minister, of laser upon notice, on 12 February 1991: (1) Is he able to say what the Chairman of the Industry Commission (Mr Cole) meant by the use of the term peripheral effects in Geelong, Dandenong and parts of Adelaide, in a television interview after the release of the Commission's draft report on the Automotive Industry. (2) Is it a fact that what Mr Cole describes as peripheral effects in Geelong, could mean the total loss of income for between 7 000-10 000 families with effects spreading to over 20 000 persons, representing nearly 15 per cent of the entire population of Geelong. . (3) Does he agree with Mr Cole that these persons are of no account and are peripheral.",114
146,Mr HAWKE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l) (3) I have had the transcripts of television interviews given by Mr Cole following release of the IC's draft report examined. Mr Cole recognised in his comments that there will be inevitable loss of some jobs in the motor vehicle industry resulting from further reductions in the levels of protection afforded to the industry. The transcripts do not include, however, any statement by him to the effect that these persons are TC of no account and are peripheral. The Government certainly does not consider those affected to be of 'no account' or 'peripheral'. We are taking steps to alleviate the impact of tariff cuts on regional centres. In my 12 March Statement, I announced an improved labour adjustment package for the motor vehicle industry to assist displaced workers with relocation, training and wages subsidies for redeployment. We have also set in train a special study of the potential regional impacts of tariff reductions and possible ways in whkh these might ·be lessened. Building Societies (Question No. 547) Mr Scholes asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 12 February 1991: (1) Is it a fact that (a) a large number of accounts held with Pyramid, Geelong and Country Wide Building Societies which ceased operations in June 1990 remain unidentified and (b) progress payments have not been claimed by the operators of some significant accounts. (2) Has the Tax Commissioner commenced an investigation of these accounts to establish whether they were used for tax avoidance purposes or money laundering; if not, why not.",115
147,Mr KEATING,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian Taxation Office has had discussions with the society's administrator on the subject of a small number of accounts the holders of which he has been ,unable to identify. Although the amounts involved in these accounts appear to be relatively small, the Tax Office is looking into a number of cases. As a further check against avoidance practices, I understand the Victorian State Treasurer is insisting society account holders meet a number of identification checks in cases where accounts are in false names. Account holders are required to produce a letter from the Tax Office stating it is satisfied as to certain return lodgement and identification checks. A number of such letters have been provided to account holders. Pharmacy Approval Number Applications (Question No. 552) Dr Bob Woods, asked the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, upon notice, on 12 February 1991: (1) Is he investigating any claims that pharmacy approval number applications have falsely stated applicants entered into financial commitments prior to August 1990; if so, (a) what false statements were made, (b) what evidence was provided in support of those statements and (c) will the approvals be revoked if the investigations prove false statements were made. (2) Has his attention been drawn to statutory declarations by Kevin Baker, John Constant, Chris Ireland, John Murphy, Mark Plunkett, Paul Speedy and John Turner, pharmacists from Port Macquarie, NSW, that false declarations were made in an application for an approval number for a new pharmacy in Lake Road, Port Macquarie; if so, (a) what evidence was provided  into financial commitments prior to 8 August 1990, (b) what investigation has been made into the allegation of the pharmacists and (c) will the  have made false statements. (3) What evidence must be provided in support of an applicants statement that he or she entered into financial commitments prior to 8 August 1990. Mr Staples-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. I have been advised, however, that the Health Insurance Commission is investigating such claims. (a & b) Until these investigations are completed it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the nature of evidence or the invesc tigations; (c) The Commission will seek legal advice on any actions that may be appropriate resulting from its enquiries. (2) Yes. (a) Due to the provisions of Section 135A of the National Health Act, I am not permitted to disclose the affairs of another person in relation to matters covered by the Act; (b) I am advised that in making decisions on applications for approval, the delegate of the Secretary of the Department of Community Services and Health takes into account all statements made by the parties, including any objections and, where necessary, seeks additional information before making a decision on an application; (c) If false statements are found to have been made then an offence would have been committed under Section 103(5) (a) of the National Health Act. Penalties for contravention of this sub-section is $5000 or imprisonment for two years, or both. It would be up to a Court to determine the penalties for such an offence. It would be then up to the Minister to suspend the pharmacist's approval if he thinks fit. (3) In a Press Release that I issued on 8 August 1990 which was headed ""Pharmacy Restructuring-Restrictions in Approvals"", I outlined that temporary restrictions would be placed on the issuing of approvals to dispense Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme prescriptions following an agreement with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. I stated in that Press Release that ""Pharmacists who have entered into commitments with the expectations that approvals would be issued will have their applications dealt with on a case by case basis"". It would be expected that applicants would be able to produce some form of documentation or independent statements which would support the statement that commitments had been entered into prior to 8 August 1990. Skin Cancer (Question No. 553) Mr Tuckey asked the Minister for Community Services and Health, upon notice, on 12 February 1991: (1) Is it a fact that some parts of Australia have the highest incidence of skin cancer in the world. (2) Is it also a fact that the maximum protection factor of sunscreen lotion on sale in Australia is 15 plus. (3) Are sunscreen lotions with greater than 15 plus protection factor available in overseas countries such as New Zealand and the United States of America; if so, when will they be sold in Australia.",116
148,Mr HOWE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) No. (3) The current Australian standard, as specified by Standards Association of Australia A.S. 2604-1986, limits labelling of sunscreen products to SPF 15; the actual sun protection factor for products sold in Australia can be significantly greater than 15. World Health Organisation: Contributions (Question No. 555) Mr Langmore asked the Minister for Community Services and Health, upon notice, on 13 February 1991: (1) What are the procedures and expected timing of national contributions to the World Health Organisation (WHO). (2) When are contributions expected to be paid in each financial year. (3) What sums did Australia pay to WHO in 1990 and what are the payments expected to be in 1991. (4) What sum has Australia paid in 1991. (5) Is Australia in arrears; if so, by what sum. (6) Are any of the ten largest contributors in arrears; if so, by what sums.",117
149,Mr HOWE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Australia's annual contribution for membership of the World Health Organization (WHO) is paid in two equal instalments in January and July each year. Contributions are paid by the Australian Embassy in Washington to the WHO account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Australia also contributes directly to two isations supported by WHO: the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the International Program on Chemical Safety (IPCS). Payments to the organisations are made in January each year. (2) Contributions to WHO and the organisations it supports are due on 1 January each year. (3) In 1990 Australia paid US$4,782,650 (A$6,036,047) and in 1991 will pay US$4,782,650 as its annual contribution for membership of WHO. In addition, Australia provided US$692,787 to support IARC in 1990 and 1991 and US$42,000 to support the IPCS in 1990 and 1991. Australia also provides extrabudgetary funds to support individual WHO programs. To date in 1990-91 this has amounted to over 3.7 million dollars to support a range of WHO activities, including on AIDS and drugs, vaccine development, human reproduction and women's health programs. (4) Australia in 1991 has paid US$2,391,325 (A$3,047,827) as the first instalment for its WHO membership contribution. Australia has also paid its annual contribution for membership of IARC for 1991 and is in process of making its payment to IPCS. (5) Australia is formally in arrears by US$2,391,325 for its annual membership of WHO, which will be paid in July 1991. (6) As of 31 January 1991 none of the ten largest contributors to WHO had paid their annual membership contributions. Overall, the situation at that date was: seventeen Members had paid their contributions in full, sixteen Members in part and 129 Members had not yet paid any part of their assessed contribution. The following indicates the level of membership arrears for the ten largest contributors: (1) USA US$78,390,425 (2) Japan $34,689,740 (3) USSR $30,435,040 (4) Germany $28,540,620 (5) France $20,342,430 (6) UK $14,813,795 (7) Italy $12,142,965 (8) Canada $ 9,432,520 (9) Spain $ 5,931,730 (10) Netherlands $ 5,031,100 Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation (Question No. 556) Mr Andrew asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 13 February 1991: Further to information provided in the report organfor 1989-90 of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, (a) why did the cost of the annual general meeting increase from $381,000 in 1989 to $593,000 in 1990 and (b) what is the breakdown of expenditure in the 1990 annual genenil meeting. Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The meeting held during the 1989-90 financial year was held in Rockhampton in November 1989. The increased costs over the previous meeting, held in Adelaide, reflect the logistical problems of holding a major meeting outside a capital city and the outfitting of the venue to provide facilities of the necessary standard. Further significant costs were incurred because of the pilots strike, which necessitated the charter of planes to transport those persons required to attend the meeting, including members and staff of the Corporation, members of peak industry bodies and journalists. (b) The breakdown of expenditure on the November 1989 annual general meeting is: Maintenance of voting register Printing of material for sending to all registered to vote Advertising and promotion to notify and encourage attendance Hire of venue and catering Presentation at AGM Accommodation Travel $ 89,352 Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation (Question No. 557) Mr Andrew asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 13 February 1991: Further to information provided in the report for 1989-90 of the Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation, (a) why was $7000 lent to a full-time member in 1990 compared to $3000 in 1989, (b) why was $84000 lent to a full-time member in 1990 compared to $52000 in 1989 and (c) who are the full time members who have received loans in 1989 and 1990 and for what reasons were the loans provided. Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: NA Country Austria . Bahrain. Bangladesh Belgium Botswana Brazil Canada. China Denmark Fiji Finland. France (a)-(c) The two items in the account of the Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation (AMLRDC) to which the honourable member refers relate to a housing loan to the Executive Director of the AMLRDC. As at 30 June 1988-89, non-current receivables of $52,000 and current receivables of $3,000 both related to a 15 year housing loan made to the Executive Director with Ministerial approval. The non-current amount is that portion not due in the next year (1989-90), while the current amount is that portion due within 12 months. This loan was increased in 1989-90. The in$10 1,209 crease was authorised by a resolution of the AMLRDC Board, subject to Ministerial ap$116,665 proval. Ministerial approval was given for the increase. $123,319 At 30 June 1990, the non-current portion of $ 53,356 the loan was S84,000 and the current portion $ 92,177 $7,000. The total amount of the loan is $91,000. $ 16,605 Defence Exports (Question No. 559) $592,683 Mr Langmore asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 13 February 1991: To which countries did Australia export weapons and military equipment in 1989-90 and what was the value of those exports to each country. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to_the honourable member's question. This replaces the answer given on 6 March 1991 on page 1473 of Hansard: Values for each export destination are shown in the following table. The statistics embrace all defence related goods as covered by Schedule 13 of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations and therefore also include such items as cryptographic goods for financial institutions and nonmilitary lethal goods such as sporting rifles and related amrilUnition.

150,Mr KEATING,COUNTRY WITH EQUIPMENT VALUES,"The answer to the honourable member's question IS as follows: The data requested for 1989-90 is not yet available from the ABS. Data for the preceding years, which were provided to the honourable member in response to Question No. 213, were obtained by request from the ABS as part of the 1990-91 Budget process. It is expected that the data for 1989-90 should be available from the ABS in time for the 1991-92 Budget. State Bank of South Australia (Question No. 562) Mr Hollis asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 13 February 1991: (1) Has the South Australian Government given, as the Victorian Government gave, a formal undertaking to the Reserve Bank that the State Bank of South Australia (SBSA) would observe the Reserve Bank's supervisory arrangements; if so, on what date. (2) Have officers of the Reserve Bank met with representatives of the (a) South Australian Government or (b) board of the SBSA to discuss supervision issues; if so, on what dates.",119
151,Mr KEATING,COUNTRY WITH EQUIPMENT VALUES,"In answer to the honourable member's question, the Reserve Bank has provided the following information: (1) The South Australian Government has not entered into any formal agreement with the Reserve Bank in the way that the Victorian Government did. Like other State banks, however, the State Bank of South Australia (SBSA) has undertaken to comply voluntarily with all of the RBA's prudential requirements and it continues to comply with these. (2) On 23 August 1990, officers of the Reserve Bank met with a representative of the South Australian Government Financing Authority to discuss supervision arrangements in general. Prior to late January 1991, the Reserve Bank had no other meetings or discussions with representatives of the South Australian Government on prudential supervisory issues. After that time, a number of telephone conversations were held with various Government representatives, primarily to discuss the State Government's plans to maintain SBSA's capital position. Officers of the Reserve Bank have had no meetings with the full Board of the SBSA. However, officers of the Bank had discussions with the Group Managing Director of SBSA (who is an Executive member of the Board) on several occasions during 1990 and early in 1991. The Governor and Deputy Governor met with the Chairman of SBSA's Board of Directors and the Managing Director on 13 December 1990 to discuss aspects of the bank's operations.

Radio (a) Radio News carried stories about the matter of Aboriginal drinking in Western Australia early in February, but only in relation to an earlier report on a commercial television station. The ABC radio news stories were broadcast after complaints that the commercial television report was incorrect and that an Aboriginal leader wanted the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to investigate. The stories generally began in such vein as: ""The West Australian Commissioner for Aboriginal Planning says he intends lodging an officomplaint about a television news report on Aboriginal drinking at Wiluna . . . ""and ""In Western Australia, media portrayal of Abon origines has come under attack . . ."" In relation to the allegations in the commercial television item, ABC Radio News reported: ""Claims of a drinking binge in the northern of Goldfields town of Wiluna have been dis. . . "" and quoted the Wiluna police sergeant as saying there's been no· more drinking than normal in the town. (b) On 13 February ""AM"" ran an interview which reporter Diane Russell Coote had recorded with Cedric Wyatt, the Commissioner for AborigAlcohol inal Planning in Western - ustralia. Mr Wyatt was critical of a story carried by commercial television stations which made certain allegations involving Aborigines in Western Australia and the manner in which they had spent a $128,000 tax refund cheque. He told ""AM"" that the commercial television channel had no right to impose upon the privacy of the Aboriginal community at Wiluna; that the community had received a substantial amount of money in the form of tax refunds; that they had paid their accounts at stores for food and then spent an amount on alcohol. He said he would be registering a complaint to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal over the story. (2) No. The ABC has not provided a written report on its coverage of this issue. (3) Yes. The ABC radio and television items on this issue were directly related to previous coverage by a commercial television station.

156,Mr DUFFY,AAA AAA AAA AAA AAA AAA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) & (4) As is clear from Mr Justice Phillips' submission to the Inter-Governmental Committee (which is a public document) there will be a substantial reduction in direct drug-related referand inquiries and a greater emphasis on white collar corporate crime. It is not that the Authority will altogether cease drug-related references, and in those which continue or are commenced the Authority will move to a specialised role with emphasis on co-ordination and the provision of complimentary services to other agencies. There will also continue to the be investigation of drug offences through other references; for instance, investigation of moneywill include following the money trail from drug-related transactions. I endorse this role, as do all the Ministers on the Intergovernmental (2) The Parliament in enacting the National Crime Authority Act clearly intended that the Authority have a full range of powers for use in all references, including both drug-related and serious corporate crime. The Authority's charter has always included the investigation of the more serious kinds of corporate crime: see the definition of ""relevant offence"" in section 4 (l) of the National Crime Authority Act. The Authority has previously investigated and is currently investigating matters of this kind: see the descriptions of Matters 4, 5 and 10 in the Authority's Annual Reports. I should add in answer to a further thrust of the question that there has been considerable public discussion regarding the powers of the Authority since it was established. (3) I suggest that the honourable member refer his question to the Committee. (5) & (6) No: as Mr Justice Phillips indicated in his submission to the Inter-Governmental Committee, the great bulk of the ASC's investigative effort will be absorbed by at least 16 extremely large corporate investigations it is currently undertaking or will undertake. The Authority will be co-ordinating its activities in this area with other agencies, including the ASC. The Serious White Collar Crime Task Forces which are in the process of being established will be co-ordinated by a group which will include the ASC. (7) In his address to the Law Institute of Victoria on 5 February 1991, Mr Justice Phillips proposed that section 51 of the National Crime Authority Act be amended to mak""e it inapplicable, subject to safeguards, to proceedings before the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority; and that Members of the Authority be given a discretion to conduct parts of hearings publicly. Neither proposal affects the question of the public release of the two reports mentioned. The report of the management review conducted by Arthur Anderson is an internal NCA document and the report of the circumstances surrounding the resignation of the former Chair in confidence to IGC members only. I do not consider it appropriate to release to the public either of these reports.

(b) Yes: for reasons outlined above, the AFP is not in a position to reveal details of current investigations. Employment Training (Question No. 644) Mr Braithwaite asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 12 March 1991: Does the Training Guarantee Act provide for commission income to be included in the definition of payroll and therefore included in the calculation of employer's liability for training expenditures but deny the employer a claim to the against the levy for time spent by staff on comIS as fol- mission attending eligible training programs; if so, (a) is this an anomaly and (b) will he remove the provision.",128
158,Mr KEATING,AAA AAA AAA AAA AAA AAA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The minimum training requirement under the traihing guarantee is based on payroll-Australian national payroll, to be precise. Payroll includes salary and wages of all kinds, and when employers pay their employees on a commission basis the commission is part of the payroll. Employers meet their minimum training requirement with eligible training expenditure. That expenditure needn't be part of payroll, and often won't be. It doesn't even have to relate to training employees-it could relate to' other persons. But it must relate to training, in ways set out the legislation. When employers pay wages for an employee's time spent solely or principally on eligible training programs or certain related activities, that wage payment is eligible training expenditure. Some employers prefer to pay employees only for results, perhaps on a piecework basis or on a commission basis. Those employers don't pay for an employee's training time. So they have no salary or wage expenditure that is eligible training expenditure paid for training time. This is not an anomaly. The honourable member should consult the Minister for Employment, in Education and Training if he wishes to pursue changes to the policy of the training guarantee.",128
