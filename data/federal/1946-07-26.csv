1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. J. S. Rosevear) took the chair-at 10.30 a.m., and read prayers. PRIVILEGE. THE PARLIAMENT: BROADCASTING PROCEEDINGS ; RE-PLAT or RECORDING.",11
2,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"Fawkner) [10.31] - I rise to a question of privilege, which I believe will be of interest to the. House, and upon which there should be a determination. The broadcasting of the proceedings' of 1 the Parliament has created several novel problems .for honourable members, and many of them remain undetermined. I - understand that yesterday you, Mr. Speaker, arranged for a re-broadcast of the recording of certain portions of yesterday's proceedings in the House. I desire to know by. what authority that re-broadcast was made, since the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act places on the Joint Parliamentary Committee appointed under it the obligation of authorizNo. ing a re-broadcast, which should not be made under any other conditions. I also ask why, if such a re-broadcast was made, even to a limited number of listeners, an opportunity was not extended to other members of the Parliament involved in incidents covered by it, to attend and hear the matter re-broadcast?",11
3,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,Unknown,That would have been impartial.,12
4,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Parramatta had better guard his language. A certain incident took place yesterday. T wanted to be perfectly acquainted of exactly what had occurred. It was not that I altogether doubted my recollection of it. I wanted to be absolutely certain that I had done no injustice to the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt). From what I heard re-broadcast, I am satisfied that no injustice was done to that honourable member. Had I discovered by means of the re-broadcast that some injustice had been dono, I would have been the first to admit and make amends. The honourable member has asked by what authority the re-broadcast was made. I acted under (he authority, not> of the chairman of the Parliamentary Proceedings 'Broadcasting Committee but of the Speaker of this House. I want to be at all times in a position to know that no injustice has been done to any honourable member.",12
5,Mr HOLT,Unknown,What are the rights of private members in regard to the hearing of re-broadcasts ?,12
6,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,That question-does not arise. There may be an impression that this re-broadcast went over the air. That is not correct.,12
7,Mr HOLT,Unknown,I did not suggest that it did.,12
8,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"All that occurred was that the recording was re-played in private for the special purposes I have mentioned. I do not offer any further explanation in regard to it. MR. SPEAKER. MOTION or WAHT OF COSOTDBNCE. Motion (by M i . CHIFLEY)-by leaveagreed to- , That so. much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent Notice of Motion' 1, General Business, taking precedence of all other business until disposed of. - Mr MENZIES (Kooyong-Leade r of the Opposition) [10.34] - I move That Mr Speaker does not possess' the confidence of this House. To move a declaration of no-confidence in the Speaker of the House is 'to take a serious step. It has not been undertaken lightly by honourable members on this side of the House. The last incident which produced the motion occurred yesterday, in connection with the suspension of the honourable member for Fawkner (MT . Holt). But the naming and suspension of that honourable member was not an isolated case, though I intend to submit to the House that it is not only the most recent but also the most glaring. '",12
9,Mr BRYSON,Unknown,Why does not the right honourable gentleman make his party behave?,12
10,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"In order that the true nature of this problem may appear, it is necessary to consider the'function and responsibility of the Speaker of this House. He is not only the presiding officer in and about the House; he is not only the channel of communication between the ' Governor General and this House; he is also-and I believe this to be his prime responsibility-responsibl e for the due enforcement of the rules, rights and privileges of the Honse. When I nse that expression I am quoting from May's Parliamentary Practice, 10th' edition. I take leave to emphasize that these are not only the rules,. rights and privileges of the presiding officer of the House, hut also of every member of the House. It is the prime responsibility of the Speaker to see that the rights and privileges of members-which , after all, they exercise on behalf of the peopleare not whittled away, and most of all that they are not whittled away by himself. Standing Order 284 providesAll questions of order and matter's of privilege at any time arising shall, until decided, suspend the consideration and decision of every other question. In other words, honourable members are entitled to raise questions in order, and when that has been done, the raising of such questions suspends the consideration and decision of every other question. The first standing order which deals with the matter is No. .283, which, says thisAny member may rise to speak ""' to order or upon a' matter of privilege suddenly arising. Thus, the right is conferred by the Standing Orders "" to rise to speak to order "", and Standing order 284 provides that a question of order which an honourable member has raised shall, u n t i l decided, suspend the consideration and decision of every other question. Standing Order 286 providesThat after a question of order has been stated to the Speaker by the member rising to the question of order the Speaker shall give his ruling or decision thereon. Those rules make it clear that there are certain rights and obligations; first, that a member has the right to raise a point of order and, secondly, when he raises a point of order, he has the right to he heard.",12
11,Mr CONELAN,Unknown,Onl y when called by the Speaker.,13
12,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"The standing order provides that when a member hasraised a point of order he, has the right to state his point of order to the Speaker, and the duty of the Speaker is to give his ruling upon it ; and, until the point of order is disposed of by the ruling of the Speaker, all other business of the House shall be suspended. There you have in short terms-and they are not to be argued about in reality-the relative positions of members of this House and the Speaker in relation to a point of order. The right which is conferred upon members is most important, because it enables them to put in motion the enforcement of the Standing Orders themselves. There is no order and no practice which enables the Speaker to deprive a member of a right conferred upon him in this fashion by the Standing Orders. In yesterday's incident, which is not alone-w e all remember earlier incidents which concerned the honourable members for Richmond (Mr Anthony) and Warringah (Mr Spender)-the honourable member for Eawkner rose to a point of order. It is quite true that a previous point of order raised by another honourable member had been overruled. The Speaker, without hearing the point of order raised by the honourable member for Fawkner-wh o spoke in courteous and dignified terms-abruptl y ordered him to resume his seat. The previous point of order had arisen in relation to a long question of a highly argumentative kind, asked by the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Conelan). The honourable member for Warringah objected on the ground that the question was not one of urgency. What the honourable member for Fawkner was desiring to raise was not the matter of urgency but of the form in which' the question had been put , . because the questioner had asked the Minister to comment on the facts alleged by him."" That - was an entirely distinct point of order^ and the honourable member for Fawkner had a clear right to state it . He was denied that right. ' At that time he had two possible courses open to him. Having been ordered to sit down he could have done so, which would have meant abandoning the right conferred upon him in common with us by the Standing Orders. On the other hand he could have insisted in respectful language upon his right to be heard. He pursued the second course,. and he did so with quietness and dignity and to the great satisfaction of a large number, of honourable members in this House. Standing Order 287 providesIf any objection is taken to the ruling or decision of the Speaker, such objection must be taken at once, and in writing, and motion made, which, if seconded, shall be proposed to House, and debate thereon forthwith adjourned to the next sitting day. That standing order, as honourable members will see, refers to the taking of objection to the ruling or decision of the Speaker. What is the rulin g or decision of the Speaker? It is referred to in the Standing Order 286, which readsUpon a question of order being raised the member called to order shall resume his seat, and after the question of order has been stated to the Speaker by the member rising to the question of order, the Speaker shall give his ruling or decision thereon. The only ruling or decision that could have been challenged by motion would be a ruling or decision made upon the question of order if that question had been stated by the , honourable member for Fawkner. In point of fact he was never allowed to state it - It is not to the point for anyone to endeavour to answer that he had another remedy, that he could have moved that the Speaker's decision be disagreed with. There had been no decision given on his point of order, consequently, when he, realizing that, persisted that he was desiringto exercise his right as a member of this House, he was named and suspended from the service of the House. The naming of a member may arise under Standing Order 56, which deals with a member using objectionable words, which is certainly not this .case, because the honourable member behaved with marked'dignity throughout the whole episode. ' It may arise under Standing Order 58, which deals with noise or disturbance, which certainly is not this case. Or it may arise under Standing Order 59, which deals with the offence of disregarding the authority of the Chair or of disobeying the rules of - the House by persistently and wilfully obstruction the business of the House, or of disorderly conduct, or of otherwise disregarding the authority of the Chair. The only words that could possibly be seized upon would be ""or otherwise disregarding the authority of the Chair ""-. It may be said that by not at once resuming his seat and abandoning his right, he disregarded or disobeyed the authority of the Chair, but the authority of the Chair in this House cannot be considered independently of the responsibilities and duties of the Chair. The Speaker has no authority to overrule the Standing Orders, and a member, on the contrary, has the right to insist upon them, and, in my opinion, the duty to defend them. Now, when the Speaker abuses the authority of his office, it becomes a farcical thing that an honourable member should be ignominiously suspended from the service of the House because he has sought to rely on those very privileges that it is the supreme duty of the Speaker .to. defend. In my eighteen years' experience of Parliament, not all' in this Parliament, I Mr Menzies: have never seen' such a gratuitous abuse of power on the part of any presiding officer. I have said that the incident was not isolated. Unfortunately we have had instances before. I have reminded the House of two of them, when the Speaker roughly overruled points of order or privilege before they had even been stated. Indeed, there is very strong feeling on this side, and it may as well be declared - at once, that there is discriminationin the treatment accorded the members on one side of the House, and the treatment accorded members on this side of the House."" - Only two days ago an honourable member on the Government side rose at question time to put a long question, which was obviously designed to possess propaganda value, about Senator Foil and his non-inclusion in the Liberal Country party Senate team for the next general elections. The Speaker ruled the question out of order when, it had been completed, but he added in a distinctly jeering fashion that the political demise of Senator Foil was. not a matter of public importance or interest. I do not mince words. That was ah uncouth and grossly improper statement for a presiding officer to make about a man who has been in the Senate for 30 years and has held high office under the Crown.",13
13,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,The right honourable member gave him the kiss of death.,14
14,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"I read that laborious jest in the newspaper. I am-still trying to understand it. To sum up this matter, it is the responsibility of the Speaker to be completely impartial when he is in the Chair. It is his duty to regard his first responsbility as that of upholding the rules, rights and privileges of the Parliament, and in doing, all those things he must not exhibit bias of any kind. A Speaker should not fall into the error of believing that his powers in the Chair are to be exercised for his own benefit or in his own defence. There is hardly one of the Standing Orders of this House which is not really designed for the protection of honourable members, so that each individual member may have the right to-take part in debate in an orderly fashion, be protected, against vulgar abuse, and have his reasonable share of the time of debate. ""When my mind goes back over the fact .that in this Parliament I have repeatedly heard grossly offensive and abusive language engaged in without any protest from the Chair except when some wounded member subsequently objected, when I recall that yesterday a notably intelligent and courteous member, the honourable member for Fawkner, was removed from the House for venturing to stand firmly for the rights of all of us, I am driven to the conclusion that the public should be made aware that the authority of the Speakership of this House is being abused and that, as the result,' the efficiency and . standing of the Parliament are seriously diminished.",14
15,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"I second the motion, and reserve the right to speak at a later hour.",15
16,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"Hindmarsh-Minister for the Navy, Minister for Munitions and Minister for Aircraft Production) [10.52] - The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies), with his customary eloquence, has sought to-persuade the House that Mr Speaker no longer possesses its confidence, but I believe, with respect, that his contentions were most unconvincing. It is quite evident that the right, honourable gentleman would not have submitted this motion if. the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt) had not been suspended yesterday. Therefore, this motion must be judged from the conduct of the honourable member for Fawkner, because his suspension was the culminating point in the circumstances which led to the submission of it. If the Leader of the Opposition had had any grievance regarding any other ruling of Mr. Speaker or his administration of the high office that he occupies, he had a right and a duty to this House to raise the matter at the time when he considered the incident occurred. But the right honourable gentleman took no such action, and remained silent until this morning, when he sought to justify wilful disobedience of the Chair. The Leader of the Opposition is embarrassed by the recent repeated acts of misbehaviour of hi3 own supporters. He must excuse in some way to the listening public the recent unruly conduct of members of the Liberal party. Therefore, he has endeavoured to transfer the responsibility'from them to the Speaker. That attempt is as ungracious as it is ungenerous, and. those who have listened to the proceedings of this House recently will agree with me that the right honourable gentleman is behaving ungraciously and ungenerously in accusing the Speaker of some act contrary to the best parliamentary practice. I bring to the recollection of the right honourable gentleman the occurrence of yesterday which has led to this dehate. The honourable member for Griffith (Mr. Conelan) asked the Minister for Works and Housing a question dealing with an aspect of the administration of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis), formerly a Minister of the. Crown and now sitting on the Opposition benches. Possibly it would have been' somewhat embarrassing for that honourable gentleman if the Minister for Works and Housing had answered the question. With the customary astuteness of an experienced parliamentarian, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender), recognizing the possible embarrassment to his colleague, raised a point of order in an endeavour to shield the honourable member for Moreton from the answer that the Minister could have given. Mr. Speaker, having heard the point of order raised by the honourable member for Warringah, ruled that the question of the honourable member for Griffith was in order. It was at that stage that the honourable member for Fawkner rose to take a point of order. I remind the House that no honourable member may address the House until he has received* a call from the Chair. It is absolutely essential that an honourable member shall receive a call from the Chair before he may address the House on any matter. The honourable member for Fawkner did not receive a call from the Chair. T am therefore surprised that the right honourable member for Kooyong, who occupies the high and honourable office of Leader of the Opposition, should now seek to justify and condone the wilful disobedience of the honourable member for Fawkner, when he was directed by the Chair to resume his seat. That was inexcusable. Unless there is compliance with the directions of the Chair, there can be no orderly parliamentary procedure. If honourable gentlemen opposite desire to observe British parliamentary practice they must acknowledge the authority of Mr. Speaker, who is charged with the duty of conducting the business of the House. My statement regarding the responsibilities of the Speaker can be supported by many authorities. I remind honourable members that while the House itself may determine finally all questions of order, the Speaker is the authority who is .required to interpret the Standing Orders, and his interpretation must be regarded as final unless it be challenged in the manner provided - in the - Standing Orders for honourable gentlemen to make a motion of objection to a ruling. In my opinion, the motion of want of confidence in Mr Speaker, which the Leader of the Opposition has moved, is totally unwarranted. If the right honourable gentleman considered that he had a grievance in respect of the . interpretation of the Standing Orders by the Speaker he had his remedy under the Standing Orders, and could have made a motion of objection to the ruling. The right honourable gentleman.did not take' that course.",15
17,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,Mr Speaker did give a ruling.,16
18,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,Mr Speaker did give a ruling. The records of the House will prove that he did.,16
19,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,He refused to give one.,16
20,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"Mr Speaker not only gave a ruling, hut, furthermore, said to the honourable member for Fawkner, "" The - honourable member has his remedy"". That remedy was to move for disagreement with the ruling that had been given. The right honourable gentleman cannot escape from his responsibility for the position in which he has placed himself in condoning misbehaviour and wilful disrespect of the Chair by a member of his party.",16
21,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"The honourable member"" for Fawkner comported himself with great dignity.",16
22,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"Dignit y cannot he associated with disrespectful conduct in tion to the Chair.' I shall not rely upon my own view of the rights of Mr Speaker in this matter, but shall cite a man who was a member, and an ardent supporter, of the Liberal party in his day"". He was elevated to the high and honourable office of Mr Speaker, and occupied that position for a considerable period. He was universally respected for the manner in which he discharged his duties. I speak of the Honourable Sir Elliot Johnson. Surely honourable members opposite will not dispute the impartiality or fairness of any ruling he gave. I quote from Hansard of the 23rd September, 1913, at page 1372",16
23,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,I rise to a point of order.,16
24,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member cannot take a point of order in this connection. Mr Eioos - I submit that I can take a point of order at any time. .,16
25,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"In regard to other matters, the honourable member could do so, but I would remind him that the Speaker is the sole judge of what questions are in order, and no point of order nor question of privilege can arise in connection with his decision.",16
26,Mr WHITE,Unknown,Charle s I . said that.,16
27,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member for Balaclava is out of order.,16
28,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"The ruling then given by Sir Elliot Johnson is a complete and effective answer to anything that has been said by the Leader of the Opposition not this morning. Unless proper regard were had for the authority of the Chair^ the conduct of parliamentary government would be impossible -1 quote from Hansard of the 31st October, 1913, at page 2827. Mr Speaker MACDonald then saidIt is also laid down that the Speaker, until the House otherwise decides, is the sole judge as to what questions should be put. Mr Speaker yesterday, in the exercise of his rights and authority, ruled that a question which had been asked was in order. On numerous occasions I , as a member of the Opposition in this House, have risen to a point of order, but Mr. Speaker has intimated that he did not wish to hear my point of order stated. Although his decision might have been a wise one, I , nevertheless, naturally was somewhat concerned at being denied the opportunity to present my view. Mr: Speaker, however, was convinced that he relawas capable of giving a ruling without any aid that I might have been able to offer to him ; and he was acting perfectly within his rights and - was exercising, his unchallengeable prerogative. Having stated that he had heard quite sufficient, he gave his ruling. Had any honourable member felt so disposed, be could bave moved to dissent from the ruling. That is the proper procedure under the Standing Orders. Honourable members opposite did not adopt that course yesterday. The action taken by the Leader of the Opposition this morning is not "" cricket "". Questioning the decision of the umpire can be justified only when a most grievous wrong has been done. That is the spirit which animates all Australians. I shall cite an authority, the impartiality of who I am sure the Leader of the Opposition will not impugn. I quote from Redlich's The Procedure of the House of Commons, a passage that is singularly appropriate to the present situation. It refers to the submission of a motion of censure on Mr Speaker, and readsTt need hardly be said that such an event is abnormal and happens but rarely, and that such ft motion would only be acceded to by the House if the circumstances fully justified it. To an Englishman it would appear seriously to undermine the exalted position and dignity of the Speaker if, in addition to his application of the rules being open to challenge upon special and important occasions, it was competent for every, member to call in question the Speaker's authority whenever he chose, and if he was liable at all times to be called upon to defend the correctness of his decisions, ft is true that the House is the supreme Court of Appeal, to which the Speaker, like all others, is subordinate, but the authority of the . Chair is equally firmly established as against the individual members. Until the judgment of the House is appealed to in the prescribed form the authority of the Speaker must override the doubts of a single member and be final. According to English ways of looking at things the parliamentary umpire would be as much lowered by a. dispute with a member about hie ruling as a judge would be in a court of law, if, after giving his decision, he allowed himself to be drawn into an argument with the parties whose case he had disposed of, or with the public, about the correctness of his judgment or the grounds upon which it ' was based. The right honourable gentleman has not sustained his charge. He found himself in a difficult and embarrassing because of the conduct of one of his sup- ' Mr FADDEN porters, and he has sought to excuse an action that cannot be justified according to the practices of any parliament in British Empire. We must recognize the prestige of the Chair is the symbol and embodiment of the authority of Parwe liament itself. We should not lightly allow to be challenged the authority which Parliament has vested in its chief executive officer, an authority which he is bound to exercise to preserve order in the House. In this instance, the Speaker has upheld the. highest traditions of his office, and has proved himself to be entitled to the confidence of the House. He has followed the precedents which have been recorded for the guidance of those holding the office of Speaker, and he was protecting the privileges of this House when he dealt with an honourable member who refused to obey an order of the Chair.",16
29,Mr FADDEN,Unknown,"Darling Do w n s Leader of the Australian Country party) [11.13] - Member s of the Australian Country party desire to be associated with the motion of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies), because we feel that a grave injustice has been done to one of the most polite and tactful members of this House. I should like to know in what circumstances an honourable member is to be allowed to raise a point of order? According to the Standing Orders, an honourable member has the right to raise a point of order at any time. Therefore, we cannot understand your interpretation of the Standing Orders, Mr Speaker. The House had to listen to the arrant humbug of the Minister for the Navy (Mr M a k in ) , who has just concluded his speech.",17
30,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"F o r one who is questioning the ruling of the Chair, the right honourable member is using very unparliamentary language.",17
31,Mr FADDEN,Unknown,I simply said that we had had to listen to the arrant humbug of the Minister for the Navy.,17
32,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I repeat that the language is unparliamentary.,17
33,Mr BARNARD,Unknown,"The expression used by the Leader of the Australian Country party is personally offensive to me, and I position ask that it be withdrawn. - I did not even know that the honourable member for Bass (Mr . Barnard) was in the House. I am conthe vinced that the Minister for the Navy that did not mean what he said. He quoted rulings given by Speakers years ago, and are asked to believe that no variation in the interpretation of the Standing Orders had occurred in the intervening do so. period. Let me draw attention to one of your own recent actions, Mr Speaker, when you descended from your lofty place and took part in a debate in committee in order to extricate your party from the difficult position in which it placed itself. Every one knows that are a very competent debater, but this occasion you were unjust to the orable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) by quoting only a part of a speech he had made, even by beginning in the middle of a sentence. Mr SPEAKER;-Order ! The right honourable member will resume his seat. We shall now hear another Standing Order, 266; which is as follows:No member shall allude to any debate of the same session upon a question or bill not then under discussion, nor to any speech in committee, except by the indulgence House for personal explanations.",17

35,Mr SPENDER,Unknown,"I rise to a point order. When a motion of want of fidence in the Chair is moved, is it not practice that those rules which prevent reference to 'previous debates cease apply? If the Speaker is himself under censure regarding his present or conduct, is it not open to any honourable member, when speaking in support of ' motion, to refer to any event that has taken place?",18

The Minister for the Navy asked honourable members to play cricket, and he said that it was a tradition in cricket to accept the ruling of the umpire. However, if the umpire wears the blazer of one of the competing teams it makes it more difficult for members of the other team to accept his rulings with confidence.",18
40,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"Macquarie-Prime being Minister and Treasurer) [11.19] - This made issue has been fully dealt with by the of the Minister for the Navy (Mr Makin). Two things stand out clearly among the yesterday: The first is that a question was asked by the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Conelan), and the decision of the Chair is final as to whether of the subject-matter of any question asked conin the House is of urgent and public the importance, and whether it is couched in proper terms. Similarly, the Speaker to must exercise his judgment as to when any point of order is raised. Yesterday, past a point of order was raised as to whether the question asked by the honour the able member for Griffith was in order. The Speaker declared that it was, and no further ruling on that point of order was called for. Had no point of order been memtaken the Speaker's judgment as to the question related to a matter of urgent public importance and was couched in parliamentary language would all have been accepted. The fact that the Speaker had allowed the question was a clear indication that he considered it to the be in order. The deliberate refusal of the Howhonorable member for Fawkner to obey that the directions given by the Chair on two occasions to resume his seat is the really outstanding event in the incident. If the ' Speaker's directions were permitted to be flouted in that way there would be chaos in the House. Honourable the members should zealously guard the authority vested in the Speaker to preserve order. As this matter has been dealt with fully, I now move That the question be now put.",18

47,Mr HAYLEN,Unknown,"It was recently reported in the press that an ex-servicemanwhose wife is seriously ill in - England had had to pay £300 of his deferred pay to obtain an air passage in order to be with her. An ex-serviceman ought not to have to exhaust his deferred pay in that way. I understand that the Australian Soldiers' .Repatriation Act provides that in like circumstances the cost of a sea passage is met by the Repatriation Commission, but a sea voyage is too slow a means of travel when the life of one's wife is at stake. Accordingly, I ask the Minister for Repatriation to examine this matter with a view to introducing amending legislation to provide for the payment by the commission of the cost of air transport of ex-servicemen hastening to the bedside of wives and other near relatives stricken with serious illness. Mr..FROST - I shall see what can be done. Few wives of ex-servicemen are still in England. Most are either in Australia or on their way. The case mentioned by the honourable member' seems to be a serious one and I shall take it up immediately.",20
48,Mr MORGAN,Unknown,"Will the Minister for Repatriation have an immediate impartial inquiry made into the allegations in yesterday's Sydney Sun concerning the case of ex-Private Neale Edwards, of Lidcombe, who is' a disabled returned soldier inmate of the Yaralla Hospital? The Sun carried the heading ""Digger Won't Go Back To Yaralla Nightmare "", Mr under which it . reported- "" Serving in the Middle East, he contracted encephalomyelitis-inflammatio n of the spinal cord"". In an interview with the reporter, he said that he had been so affected by electric shock treatment that he was a nervous wreck. Will the Minister inquire whether it is true, as alleged, that army doctors told him that he would lose his pension unless he returned to the hospital for more electric shock treatment? Will the Minister take steps to ensure that he shall not be deprived of I his pension because of his refusal to submit to treatment which is apparently both futile and harmful in his case? Will he have him transferred to the Prince of Wales Repatriation Hospital, Randwick, for massage and treatment as requested? Will the Minister indicate whether progress is being made in the provision of proper hostels and sanatoriums for nerve cases? Will he also have trained manipulators, osteopaths, and chiropractors attached to the Prince of Wales Hospital and take steps to ensure that patients shall not against their will be used by medical experimenters as human "" guinea pigs "".",20

57,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"The main principles of the agreement were determined when I discussed the matter with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Dr Dalton. As the treaty involved a considerable amount of drafting of a highly technical character, the Government sent the Crown Solicitor, Mr Whitlam, to London to join Mr Mair, the Second Commissioner of Taxation. As is natural in the drafting of such complicated documents, a number of difficult points arose, one or two of which have not yet been entirely settled. They deal not with the main principles but ' with certain technical details as to how the treaty should be applied. Although the work is almost completed, it will not be possible to present the treaty to this Parliament for ratification. I have asked whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer will agree to making public the main points of the agreement, and I am hopeful that, before this session concludes, it will be possible ROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY. as PAYMENT OF PKIZE-MONEY-SCHNAPPE K ISLAND TRAINING SCHEME.",21

61,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"A few days' ago, the honourable member discussed this matter with me, and emphasized the excellent work that is being performed in training lads in marine and naval studies. I then indicated that I was sympathetic with his request. I have asked the Naval Board to inform'me whether a suitable boat can be provided. AUSTRALIAN LABOU R PARTY. POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENTS.",21
62,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"Does the Prime Minister intend to use government instrumentalities for the purpose of furthering the political propaganda of the Australian Labour party during the forthcoming campaign? If go, does the right honourable gentleman consider that such a practice is right and proper? I ask those questions because a large advertisement is appearing in newspapers throughout Australia, depicting the Prime Minister, as usual, smoking his pipe, and modestly praising his own leadership and disparaging that of the Opposition. At the foo.t of the advertisement the following words appear:The Australian Labour party seeks your support in presenting the truth about its policy to the Australian people. Donations addressed to the campaign trustees, J. B. Chifley or H. V. Evatt, Ms.P., Commonwealth Offices, Sydney, will be acknowledged and constructively applied.

THE PARLIAMENT. . BROADCASTING OF PROCEEDINGS : CITIZENS' RIGHT OF REPLY.",22
68,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"I ask the Prime Minister whether it is a fact, as reported in the press, that the Australian Broadcasting Commission has decided that it inhas no - discretionary power to allow to persons aggrieved by statements made during the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings the right of reply, and that commission has not been able to devise a practical plan to meet the position ? If so, has this decision been conveyed to the right honourable gentleman ? Recently, Prime Minister informed me that he discuss with the Australian Broadcasting Commission the matter of allowthese aggrieved persons the right to make their replies over the air. I ask to in the right honourable gentleman whether ' he has conferred with the Australian Commission on this subject, if so, did any helpful suggestions I am emanate from the discussion?",22
69,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I do not recollect having seen that statement by the Austhe tralian Broadcasting - Commission.

The New Zealand Government has replied in the following terms:No special provision is made for means of reply by persons attacked in parliamentary proceedings and no situation has .arisen in New Zealand which has made this an issue. The committee, at a meeting this morning, considered the matter and decided that no. action be taken at this stage and that the matter be deferred for consideration by the joint committee to bo appointed by the next Parliament. I make this statement on behalf of the committee. PENICILLI N.",22
71,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Health whether it is correct that a duty has been imposed on penicillin imported from Britain. Has this been done because imported penicillin was selling at almost one-third of the price of the local product? If this is so, what is the reason for the high cost of locally manufactured penicillin, and is there any prospect of a reduction of the price of the local product? Is. penicillin being manufactured commercially in Australia outside the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, and, if so, where ?",23
72,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"Penicillin is not being manufactured in the Commonter wealth except in the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. I have seen the figures recently, but there no serious shortage of penicillin in tralia, although every one would he haprapidly pier if supplies were larger. Progress the manufacture of penicillin in Ausare in prospect. tralia has been very gratifying. I cannot answer the honourable gentleman's question in regard to a duty. I doubt whether' a duty has been imposed, in order to make certain on the point, shall consult the Minister for Health ",23
73,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,The Minister has missed one point. Why is British penicillin selling at. almost one-third of the price of the local product ?,23
74,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"If that were the case, it would be a serious anomaly. I do not think it is so; but I shall consult the Minister for Health on that point also. PETROLEUM PRODUCTS. PBTKOL-MOTO R CYLINDER OIL.",23
75,Mr SMITH,Unknown,"I have noticed this week that the prices of motor spirit and of several other - petroleum products have been reduced. In the last few months, motor spirit has been reduced in price by about 4£d. a gallon. Is the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Shipping aware .that the price of motor cylinder oil has been increased 50 per cent, above pre-war rates? Will the honourable gentleman cause investigation to be made to ascertain why motor cylinder oil has not been reduced in price correspondingly with other petroleum products ?",23
76,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"It seems peculiar that at the time when the price of petrol is being reduced in Australia the price of motor cylinder oil should be increased. I shall bring the matter to the notice of the Minister for Supply - and Shipping, and ask him to have an investigation made and furnish a reply to the honourable member. PRIMARY PRODUCTS.

79,Mr GULLETT,Unknown,"Arisin g out of' the statement of the Minister for Immigration in Sydney recently, that immigration visas had been prepared for some . 2,000 alien immigrants to Australia, and in view of the shortage of shipping and of other considerations, including the obvious question of preference, I ask the Minister whether these alien immigrants will receive preference over British subjects who wish to come here? Will they, in fact, be .permitted to enter this - country before all those who wish to come here from Britain have arrived. In view of the anti-British activities of members of the Zionist organization, will the Minister see that no members of that organization, who have no intention of becoming good Australians and no intention of becoming loyal British subjects, are included in the quota?",24
80,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"I wish the honourable member would read ministerial'statements in regard to immigration. He would not then ask questions of this kind. I have been at great pains to make it clear, even to the dullest of intellects, that the issue of landing permits confers no right of priority - in respect of shipping facilities. I said on the 2nd August last, or it may have been subsequently, that landing permits for aliens would be issued only to the closest relatives of Australian 'citizens who were prepared to guarantee the maintenance of the persons concerned for a period of five years. In every case the persons to be admitted to Australia under such permits must have been victims of Nazi religious, racial or political persecution, must have endured a period in an internment camp, * or have been members of slave gang3 or compelled in other ways to suffer for their particular religious, racial or"" political views. That statement should have cleared away any idea that any persons predisposed to Nazi views would' be admitted. The people who have made applications for admittance of their friends to the Commonwealth are good Australian citizens, many of whom have served in the armed forces of this country. But no matter to whom persons overseas are related in Australia, they will not he admitted to this country unless the British Consul in the country from which they desire to come is satisfied that they are persons who would become good Australian citizens. The persons involved are not at present resident in Palestine. They are nearly all still living in Europe in displaced persons' camps, and they have been told by their relatives in Australia that they have no claims to shipping accommodation under the control of either the United Kingdom or the Commonwealth .Government, and that there is an absolute preference for the brides and fiancees of Australian servicemen and ex-servicemen, and for Australian personnel stranded abroad. I have made that clear time and again. I am not responsible for the comments of newspapers which are engaging in political propaganda. The honourable gentleman is a young man and, as yet, a very impressionable one. He has not, so far, developed any cynical tendencies. But he ought to realise that we are within, measurable distance of a general election campaign, and that certain persons in control of newspaper offices are prone to publish propaganda against the Government. The Government always gives preference to people who are inside the British Commonwealth, before extending it to those who are outside the British Commonwealth. TOBACCO.",24
81,Dame ENID LYONS,Unknown,"In view of the many inquiries and complaints that I have received in regard to the distribution of tobacco, will the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs state whether any authoritative information is available concerning the destination of that . tobacco which is represented by the difference between the ration received hy servicemen as such, # and the supplies that they can obtain as civilians after their discharge? In particular, have the officers examining black-market activities given specific attention to this point? Has the Government made any representations, to the Tobacco Manufacturers Distribution Committee on the need for allocating supplies to newly-established retail businesses ? ",24
82,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"Researc h will be needed upon certain aspects of the question. I shall obtain the information from the Minister for Trade and Customs. The Government has not exercised any control over tobacco rationing since the 1st April last. The tobacco trade has been continuing a form of rationing since then, and has established a tobacco advisory committee in each State. The Department of Trade and Customs has made some investigation of the , distribution of tobacco and the causes of the shortage of supplies. The tobacco companies have advised it that the shortage is due to the difficulty of obtaining sufficient female labour. At least one company has-decided to establish a branch factory in a country town in New South Wales, where, it is said, there is sufficient female labour, in order to augment supplies for the smoking public. I shall examine the difference between the quantity of tobacco allotted to members of the forces and that which ex-servicemen can obtain as civilians. Although the industry has been completely decontrolled, and there is no government rationing of tobacco, the honourable member may rest assured that the Minister will use every influence by taking up the matter with the tobacco companies to ensure that causes of complaints shall be removed. ALIENS DEPORTATION BILL 1946. SECOND READING.",24
83,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"Melbourne-Minister for Immigration and Minister for Information) [12.5] - I move That the bill - be now read a second time. - As at the 30th September, 1945, there remained in Australian internment camps 557 aliens, excluding Japanese, who prior to their detention were residents of the Commonwealth. These consisted of 509 Germans and 48 Italians. On the 25th October, 1945, Mr Justice Simpson, of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, was appointed a commissioner under the National Security (Inquiries) Regulations, to inquire and report upon the cases of all local civilian internees, in accordance with following terms of reference:1. Whether,""in the interests of the. safety and defence of. the Commonwealth, is necessary or advisable.to deport from Australia any persons and, if so,' what persons(a) who are or who, between the third day of September, One thousand nine hundred and thirty-nine and the fifteenth day of August, One thousand nine hundred and forty-five (both inclusive), were detained in accordance with the provisions of regulation 20 of the National Security (Aliens Control) Regulations or regulation 26 of the National Security (General) Regulations; and (6) who(i ) are aliens; (i i ) are regarded as aliens; or (i i i ) were, but have ceased to be, naturalized British subjects. 2. Whether in the interests of the public safety and defence of the Commonwealth it is necessary.or advisable(a) to revoke the certificates of naturalization of any persons and, if so, what persons, who are or were so detained, who are naturalized British subjects; (b) in the event of .the Commissioner reporting .that the revocation of any such certificate of naturalization is necessary or desirable to make, upon the revocation of that certificate, an order declaring or directing that any persons and, if so, what persons, who are British subjects by virtue of the grant of that certificate shall cease to be British subjects ; and (o) to deport i r om Australia any such person whose certificate of naturalization has been revoked or in respect of whom an order hag been made declaring or directing that he shall cease to be a British subject. 3. Whether, in the interests of the public safety and defence of the Commonwealth, it is necessary or advisable, pending deportation, to continue to detain, in accordance with either of the said regulations, anyperson whose deportation is reported by the Commissioner to be necessary or desirable. 4. Whether, in the interests of the public safety and defence of the Commonwealth, it is necessary or advisable to impose any restrictions upon any persons whose deportation is reported by the Commissioner to be necessary or advisable but whose continued detention is not so found to be necessary or desirable. The recommendations of Mr Justice Simpson have been accepted by the Gointo vernment and, as a result, 289 Germans and twelve Italians have been listed for the deportation. These fall into two categories-(a ) those to remain interned public pending, deportation; and (6) those rei t leased pending deportation. In group (a) there are 245 Germans, composed of 114 males, 46 females and 85 children, and one male Italian. It will be appreciated that all the children referred to, and a number of the wives, are included on compassionate grounds, and in accordance with their natural desire not to be separated from husbands and fathers. In group (£) there are 44 Germans-3 8 males, four females and'two children-and eleven male Italians. All of the aliens released pending deportation are under restrictions, with the exception of twelve aged men who have no Australian affiliations and are being included, not for security reasons, but on compassionate grounds, in view of their strong desire to return to their homelands. His Honour's report reveals that the majority of the persons recommended for deportation do not.wish to remain in Australia and have expressed a definite desire to return to their countries of origin. The balance of the local alien internees were recommended foi? release' to reside in Australia, with or without restrictions, and these recommendations have been carried out. The numbers so released are 217 German men, women and children,, and 36 Italian men. Three cases of local internees were not dealt with by Mr. Justice Simpson. One man was an escapee at the time of the inquiry, one was serving a gaol sentence, and the other was in hospital. On the 31st May, 1946, Mr Justice Hutchins, of the Supreme Court of Tasmania, was appointed a Commissioner under the National Security (Inquiries) Regulations, with terms of reference similar to those given to Mr Justice Simpson, to investigate the cases of certain overseas internees. These are persons who were detained by another Government outside the Commonwealth and sent to this country for safe custody. As well as examining certain overseas internees, Mr Justice Hutchins will inquire into the cases of merchant seamen who were formerly interned as civilians and later classified prisoners of war. The number of cases referred to Mr Justice Hutchins is approximately 1,500. As this inquiry is still proceeding, it is not possible at moment to indicate how many additional deportations will result. It """" can stated, however, that the Government Immigration. Mr Calwell proposes to give effect to the Commissioner's recommendations when received, whatever they may be. In other words we"" shall act in respect of these overseas internees in exactly the same way as in the case of local internees. The purpose of this bill is to empower the Minister for Immigration to give effect to recommendations made by Mr. Justice Simpson and Mr Justice Hutchins, and the provisions of the bill will be confined to cases of aliens examined and reported upon by the two Commissioners. named. As well as empowering the Minister to make an order for the deportation of any aliens specified in the bill, provision is made for the Minister to impose safeguards in the form ""of restrictions upon any alien who has been released from internment until deportation can be arranged. If reliance is placed entirely upon the regulations made under the National Security Act, it will not be possible to give effect to the recommendations of the two Commissioners unless shipping facilities are available before the expiry of the National Security Act on the 31st December, 1946. Owing to the acute shortage of shipping, and in order to meet the desire of the allied occupation authorities to restrict the entry of persons to former enemy territory for the present, it may not be possible to deport all or any of the aliens in question before that date. The bill at present before the House leaves no doubt as to the Government's intentions and powers to deport those aliens who have been found by. judicial inquiry to be a menace to the security of the Commonwealth. The. deportations or repatriations will take place as soon as the necessary shipping accommodation is available and satisfactory arrangements have been made for the reception of these people by the allied authorities. So far as local Japanese internees are as concerned, the Government decided some time ago that all Japanese aliens should brreturned to Japan with the least possible delay. On the 21st February, 1946, the 304 Japanese aliens were repatriated on the Eoei Mam in accordance with an . be. order signed by me as Minister for The small group of .Japanese aliens remaining in internment consists of Japanese with either Australian-born, wives or Australian-horn dren or both, and .some sick and aged Japaneseunable to travel. It is the intention of the Government to close internment camps with the least possible delay. Any outstanding cases will be referred to Mr Justice or Mr Justice Hutchins for investigation and report in accordance with their original terms of reference. Debate (on motion of Mr Holt) adassistance, journed. FINANCIAL STATEMENT. Debate resumed from the 25th July (vide page 3173), on motion by Mr. CHIFLEY- ' .That the following paper be printed:financial Statement by the Kight able J. B. Chifley, M.P., Treasurer.",25
84,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"Macquarie-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [12.15] - i reply-Havin g regard to the fact that honourable members have been indulscriptions gent enough not to prolong unduly debate on the Financial Statement presented byme as Treasurer, I would not now prolong the debate, did I consider it necessary to reply to some points raised, particularly by the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr. Fadden). Time and time again he There reverted to the investment by savings banks in public loans. So frequently he stress the subject, that it seemed an obsession with him. Indeed, in less polite circles, it would probably be that he had a "" bug "" about it. It ought to be placed on record, that ings during the time the Labour party has been in office, a total of £1,006,000,000 has been raised by loans, and of this no less than 46 per cent, was subscribed by companies other than life, offices, subject. firms and persons. While previous war-time governments were in office a total of £115,000,000 was raised, but of this only 41 per cent, was scribed by companies, firms and persons. then Of the £1,006,000,000 raised during .term of office of the Labour Government, not any represented central bank credit, and not any was subscribed by the trading banks - However, to during the ' raising of the amount true of £115,000,000 by previous governments, the trading banks were - free to subscribe and, indeed, did chilsubscribe. Moreover, in connection with the raising of £1,006,000,000 by the Labour Government, the making of advances by the trading banks to persons for investment in the loan was severely limited, thus avoiding the danger of Simpson secondary inflation. During the earlier loan raisings by this Government the Leader of the Australian Country party gave generous but. he suddenly decided that he would no longer help, his stated reason being that he objected to the Government's financial policy. Later, I regret to say, the Leader, of. the Opposition (Mr Menzies) also decided that he would not be able to give any more active assistance in loan-raising. However, Honorafter the Leader of the Australian Country party withdrew his support, we did rather better than before, and it is n an amazing fact that in the principal towns of his own electorate public subto the loans which he refused the to support constituted a record I have read criticisms in the press not of the Government's financial policy, and it is evident to me that some of the critics lack even, a rudimentary knowledge of finance and national economy. 1 seems to be a suggestion that the savings banks, whether Commonwealth did or State, should not contribute to Comto be monwealth loans. Could a safer investment for their funds be imagined? Subsaid scriptions have always been made to the loans, not only by the Commonwealth Savings Bank, but also by the State savbanks which, are in no way subject to Commonwealth influence. It is intertotal esting to read some of the observations of a former Treasurer, Mr Casey, on this In 1938, the late Prime Minister, Mr Curtin, who was then sitting in opposition, asked whether the Commonwealth Bank had subscribed substantially subto internal loans. Mr Casey, who was Treasurer in a government supthe ported by the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden), repliedI t is normally the habit of the Commonwealth Bank and the Commonwealth Savings Bunk make quite substantial contributions towards public loans they underwrite. It is that, on this occasion, they also made war-time substantial contributions. Not only did the Commonwealth Savings Bank make contributions to loans raised by .governments supported-by honourable members opposite; the Commonwealth Bank also did so; but during the regime of the present Government, there have been no contributions to Commonwealth loans by the central bank. However, I see nothing wrong in the Commonwealth Savings Bank and the State savings banks investing the people's savings in Commonwealth loans.",27
85,Mr FADDEN,Unknown,Excep t that the Treasurer has used their contributions to deceive the people into believing that the loans were invariably a great success.,28
86,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"No attempt was made to deceive the people. The Government floated loans and invited subscriptions. . It denied to the trading banks and the 'Commonwealth Bank the right to subscribe to them, but it left the savings banks, both Commonwealth and State, completely free to invest in them if they wished. Internal loans raised by this Government totalled £1,006,000,000 of which -46 per cent, was subscribed by persons, firms and companies. previous governments raised loans totalling £115,000,000, of which 41 per cent, came from the same source. The honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) said that the tax reductions proposed in the Financial Statement would give no benefit to other than wage and salary earners until after the 30th June, 1947. That statement is 'grossly inaccurate. The provisional assessments being sent out this year under the pay-as-you-earn system will be based on the income received last year, and provisional tax will be assessed at the reduced rate. That "" debunks "" the statement made by the honourable member. The Leader of the Opposition complained that I did not supply sufficient - information relating to goods which Australia received under the lend-lease settleto ment. I offer him my apology for not having furnished to him the additional information supplied to the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) at his request. As was pointed out by the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), most of the American war material remaining in Australia at the cessation of hostilities was of no value, but there was a residue of durable goods suitable for peace-time use, and it was decided that this should be purchased for use in this country.",28

88,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"Yes . The settlement provided for the purchase from the United States of lend lease capital equipment suitable for civilian purposes for $20,500,000. A large portion of the equipment taken over' consisted of machine tools, non-combat aircraft, mining plant, locomotives, motor vehicles of civilian type, tractors, steam wrecking cranes, and cargo handling plant. In addition, surplus property held by the Americans in Australia, including earth moving equipment, warehouse handling equipment and radio and signal equipment, valued at $6,500,000, most of it of durable quality suitable for peacetime purposes, was taken over. The bulk of the goods supplied by Australia to the American Forces consisted of consumable goods. Apart from these payThe ments, the lend-lease settlement washed out all other transactions.",28
89,Mr FADDEN,Unknown,"How much was received from disposals last year? To what accounts were the proceeds credited, apart from the £15,000,000 mentioned in the right honourable gentleman's statement?",28
90,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"The Estimates included £40,000,000 as the amount expected to be received from disposals. Of that, £28,000,000 was to have been credited to war expenditure and £12,000,000 to trust accounts. The right honourable gentleman will remember that some of the articles disposed of or to be disposed of were or are the property of departments other than service departments-the Department of Munitions, for instance-and , of course, when they are disposed of, the money received for them must be credited those departments. Only £16,000,000 was credited to war expenditure and only £9,000,000 to trust accounts. Instead of receiving £40,000,000, we received only £25,000,000. Delivery to purchasers has not yet been made of a great number of goods recently sold by the Disposals Commission. There were also large amount outstanding from overseas . administrations. So, we are considerably behind in actual collections. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt) interjected during this debate that Australians were the most heavily taxed people in the world. Only a few weeks ago, when I saw similar statements or New Zealand. appearing in the press, I distributed to the newspapers a comparison of income tax at the rates then payable in Australia, direct taxes? Great Britain and New Zealand, but, as far as I know, only two published it. To a great degree it contradicted the claim made by them and echoed by the honourable member for Fawkner, that to that I was replying. Australians are more heavily taxed than any other people. The statement showed that, at the existing rates, the taxes able on an income of £150 were £9 in Australia, £19 in New Zealand and £16 in the United Kingdom. On an income cessive of £300, the Australian taxes were £46, whereas the New Zealand taxes amounted to £54 and the United Kingdom levies to £55. In the case of a taxpayer earning £400, the statement showed that the taxes payable were £82 in Australia, £85 in' New Zealand, and £95 in the United Kingdom. The comparative table contreasury-bill tained in that statement is:TNCOME TAX-AUSTRALIA , NEW ZEALAND AND UNITE D KINGDOM.

It is true that persons with incomes of £1,500 a year or more are more highly taxed in Australia than in Great Britain",28
91,Mr HOLT,Unknown,Has the right honourable gentleman made a similar analysis of in,29
92,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"No , because the charge was that income tax was heavier in Australia than elsewhere, and it was A lot has been said about extravagance and wasteful expenditure. I take this payopportunity to place on record some cold, hard facts. A couple of years ago, honourable gentlemen opposite declared that exuse of treasury-bills would lead to inflation because they inflated the purchasing power of the people and thereby created a false economy and a false sense of prosperity. They claimed that unless the issue of treasury-bills were checked dire financial chaos would result. In the last two years, not oneadditional has been outstanding at the end of the financial year, although treasury-bills may have' been used temporarily during the year. No central bank credit has been, used, and INCOME . no subscriptions from private banks have in - been received for loans.",29
93,Mr FADDEN,Unknown,Do not say that!,29
94,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,I am saying it.,29
95,Mr FADDEN,Unknown,"Then why have the New United holdings of securities of the trading banks increased from £56,000,000 to £122,000,000? How did that arise? 19 16 Mr Chifley - I could give the 25 25 honourable gentleman a lengthy explana40 38 tion, but I do not think that the trading 54 55 banks would appreciate that. .Since the 70 75 Labour party has been in office, not one 85 95 public loan has been subscribed to by the 134 private banks. 173",29
96,Mr FADDEN,Unknown,"""Where does this security 252 movement come from, then? 331 432 Mr Chifley - It is perfectly true 544 that at their request the trading banks have been permitted to purchase soma 769 securities that have been available in the 1,332 1,957 market. That is the answer. They 2.632 were permitted to do so because otherwise they would not have been able to maintain a reasonable profit rate. Unless they had been allowed to operate on the market in the. same way as other institutions are allowed, their .profits would have fallen very low. I should have been grossly unfair if I had withheld that permission. Since hostilities ended, 480,000 vice personnel have been demobilized, 200,000 persons have been diverted from the manufacture of war materials to production. In other words, approximately 680,000 persons have been'transferred in twelve months from activities associated with the conduct of the the production of civil goods. Despite that unprecedented change-over, less than one-half of 1 per cent, of Australian workers is unemployed. No other country bas a better record regarding demobilization and the placement of ex-service sonnel in civil employment than has Australia. - I desire now to expose a fallacious argument which the Leader of the Australian Country party used in reply to a statement by the honourable member for Eremantle (Mr Beazley). The honourable member had pointed out that since the end of the war the production of civil goods had greatly increased. In an endeahas vour to .refute that statement, the Leader of the Australian Country party declared that receipts from the pay-roll tax, which were the real guide increased production, had not increased. Of course, the explanation is that salaries and wages are being paid to increase the production of civil goods, whereas they were previously paid for the manufacture of war materials. Civil production did substantially increase after the end of the war.",29
97,Mr FADDEN,Unknown,Then why is not the increase of civil production reflected in larger collections from the pay-roll tax?,30
98,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"Instea d of being engaged in"" the production of arms and munitions, which are not profitable to the national economy, whatever their value may be from a security stand point, large numbers of people are now producJuly ing civil goods. Although receipts from Mr CHUTLEY the pay-roll tax may not be greater, the civil goods that the workers are now the following rates:producing have increased.",30
99,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"The Prime Minister stated that, since the end of the war, 680,000 persons have returned to the production of civil goods. Surely that fact must be reflected in increased receipts from the pay-roll tax.",30
100,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"A big proportion of the people demobilized became employers, seror workers on their own account. A and lot more went to jobs in rural industry. Of the balance, a big proportion found civil jobs with small employers from whom no pay-rail tax would be collected, whilst of those in respect of whom payroll tax would be collected, few, if any, war to worked for more than a part of the financial year. I remind honourable members that never before in the history of Australia has there been so much economic activity in the community as there is today. We have heard complaints per- about the Tasmanian shipping service. Are honourable members aware that the shipment of goods from Tasmania has increased by 50 per cent., compared with the - quantities before the outbreak of World War II . ? We also hear complaints about the shortage of coal causing industry in Victoria to stagnate. I do not propose to deal at length with that subject now, but I point out that, although Victoria substantially built up its production of light and power from brown coal, it is getting an additional 350,000 or 400,000 tons of coal, compared with the quantity to received before the outbreak of World War IT. Despite those demands, so great is the economic activity in the community that production cannot overtake the demand for consumer-goods. Every businessman in Australia will agree that, despite many difficulties, production has increased enormously. Never before has the economic activity in Australia been so great as it is today.

102,Mr FADDEN,Unknown,"Darling DownsLeader of the Australian Country party) [2.16] - The Opposition cannot allow the tables associated with this motion to be agreed to without criticism and review. I move That paragraph 1. be postponed, as an instruction to the Government to substitute more equitable scales of tax to provide more adequately for the family man. One has only to examine the tables to realise the extent to which the claims of the taxpayer with family responsibilities have been totally overlooked. A crying need of the nation is increased population. Jndeed, the Government will place - on the Estimates for the current year a vast sum of money in order to encourage immigrants, but its first duty is to give just and equitable treatment to men who are already in this country and have family responsibilities. - The best contribution ' the Government can make towards an increase of the population is to encourage the family man. I have never seen a more unjust scale than that now introduced, in order to bring about what the Treasurer (Mr. Chifley) is pleased to calla reduction of tax to the amount of £17,500,000. Nobody will be deceived into believing that this reduction of tax will impose on the budget for the year ending the 30th June, 1947, the burden stated by the Treasurer. It would be ridiculous to accept that as the figure showing the extent to which the .revenue will be affected. Take the position of a taxpayer in receipt of an income of £250 a year. . If he is single, with no dependants, his net saving under these tables is Is. 4d. a week. If the man is married and has no children, his weekly saving is Is. 2d., or 2d. a week less than that of a single man. The man with a similar income, but having a wife and one child, is let off only 6d. a week, and if he has two children he gets a benefit of only 2d. a week. Has one to proceed further to show how unjust and inequitable is the treatment meted out, having regard to the basic desirability of encouraging family responsibilities? Having regard to the fact that the Government alleges that, it has a vigorous immigration policy, the first essential is to give practical encouragement to"" people with family responsibilities. Now take the £400 a year group. A single man's tax is to be 5s.' Id. a week lighter than previously. A married man with no children gets a benefit of only 3s. lOd. a week, compared with 5s. Id . a week for a single man. A taxpayer with a wife and one child saves 2s. l i d . a week compared with 5s. Id. a week for a single man. If he happens to have a wife and two children, which is the average size of Australian families, he is let off with a saving of only 2s. 6d. a. week. These examples point to discouragement, rather than encouragement, of family responsibilities and increase of population. In the £500 a year group, a single man pays 7s. 6d. a week and a married man pays 6s. a week less tax. If he has one child he pays 4s. l i d . a week less, and, if two children, 4s. 5d. a week less. What a slovenly and unjust table! Now take the £1,000 a year group, in which exactly the same principle applies. The single man pays 14s. 8d. a week less .tax, whilst the married man gets a benefit of only 13s. 3d. a week, or Is. 5d. a week less than a single man. With one child he pays 12s. 2d. a week less, and with two children only 12s. Id. a .week less. A man with a wife and two children pays 12s. Id. a week less, although a single man with no responsibility whatever has a reduction of 14s. 8d. a week! The table shows grievous anomalies. Only a week ago, Mr S. H . Lindsay, Deputy Prices Commissioner in Queensland, stated that the commission was greatly concerned that drapery prices had risen 74 per cent, during the war, and that every housewife found it difficult to meet drapery accounts. The taxpayer who has to bear that extra burden is not the single man, but the man with family responsibilities. These tables have been the subject of scant consideration and unwise adjustment. They will do nothing whatever to encourage. family"" responsibilities; in fact, they will have the opposite effect.",31
103,Mr BURKE,Unknown,"Perth) [2.25] --My remarks will be brief, as befits the speech just made by the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) and his previous contributions to similar debates. While he was speaking last night, I formed the opinion that he had no knowspeech ledge of his subject and therefore incapable of understanding it, or if understood it, was completely incorwith rigible. That opinion has been conand firmed today, because he demonstrated in no uncertain manner complete dishonesty in relation to this matter. I have no doubt that the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin) was forewarned by the daily newspapers of the nature of the which the Leader of the Australian Country party intended to make on financial proposals of the Government, and made preparations to repel it. He pointed out that the present reduction will be greater for the single man than the married man, because the former previously contributed very much more. He further made this proposal that the tax reductions which single men will enjoy must be sxibstantially greater than those of married men in a similar salary range with three children, because these latter in the lower wage groups no tax at all. No honourable member on this side of the chamber would wish impose hardship, by means of taxes or in any other way, on the married with family responsibilities. We all desire that he shall be given the fullest encouragement. The right honourable member for Darling Downs, however, again told half of the story notwithstandtaxation ing that this trick was previously exposed. I deeply deplore the gross exaggeration and misrepresentation of this former Prime Minister and Treasurer, who has displayed not the slightest vestige of political or personal responsibility. - Mr Francis (Moreton) [2.27] - The amendment of the Leader of the Austion. tralian Country party (Mr Fadden) ought to receive the unanimous endorseany ment of the committee. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Burke) has ignored the fact that for many years right honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin) was one of the best debaters in this Parliament. It was characteristic of him in the past to utter platitudes make compassionate appeals to his declared listeners when he had to support an argube ment that was not basically sound. On Wednesday nightj the greater part of his consisted of a tribute to the accomwas plishments of the Treasurer (Mr. 1 he Chifley). He said that immediately peace Japan had been announced Ministers oflicials of the Taxation Department has were called into conference for the discussion of means whereby taxes could be reduced; yet the relief granted in that connection has so far been negligible. The honourable member for Perthmay be influenced by the ""soft-stuff"" from attack the right honourable member for Yarra. I am not, and I am certhe tain that the country is not. What is needed today is so substantial a reduction of taxation as will promote an increase of production. Industry must for expand and be developed if employment had is to be found for all those who have served this country in the fighting forces. Plant and equipment have been ruined by the constant use to which they were put during six strenuous years of war. No assistance has been given by means of tax reductions to those who are pay engaged in industry or are producing - commodities that are in very short supply. to What chance have housewives of purchasing the commodities that the average man household needs today? Dr GAHA.:-We are told that the commodities are not procurable.",31
104,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"The reason is, that on private incomes and industry is so high that they cannot be produced. No organization has been set up by the Government to ensure thatraw materials shall be provided for productive effort. The Government is doing a grave disservice to Australia by its failure to reduce substantially the taxes on private incomes as well as on producAustralia should now be on the crest of the greatest prosperity which country could enjoy, but instead of being given the opportunity to make progress it is being handicapped the and hamstrung by excessive taxation, which the Government has not shown, the slightest disposition to reduce. While the Treasurer was overseas, the Minister for and Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) time and again that there could no reduction of taxation. The present proposals prove that to be the mind of the Government. When the Leader of. the Opposition (Mr Menzies) enunciated proposals for the reduction of taxation by 40 per cent, in a period of three years, the Treasurer declared that they were impossible of application; yet the Premier of Tasmania has supported them wholeheartedly, and they have been welcomed enthusiastically from one end of the country to the other. The Leader of the Australian Country party has expressed sentiments which I completely endorse. Married men are to receive scant consideration under these, proposals of the Treasurer. In a previous year, financial provision was made for migration to this country. The best migrant that it could have is the native-born child, for whom no consideration is being shown. Assistance is being denied to those who could reasonably expect it from a balanced and 'well-considered budget. The married man is bearing the heat and burden of the day. The Leader of the Australian Country party has pointed out that Mr Lindsay, the Deputy Prices Commissioner in Queensland, has said that the prices of drapery and clothing in that State have increased by 74 per cent. Who are the largest purchasers of those goods? Are they not the married men with families? Yet honourable members opposite do not give even a thought to them. Ex-servicemen, too, are to' receive a very raw deal under these proposals. Since their demobilization, the Government has been apathetic in regard to their welfare, and has antagonized them by its appeasement policy with respect to. Communistinspired strikes. I hope that the Prime Minister will accede to the request that ex-servicemen shall be completely exempt from taxation for a further twelve months. Under proposals which originated with the parties now in opposition, men who were fighting for their country were ' given definite tax concessions. To-day, when they are trying to re-establish themselves in civil life, they find that the problems confronting them are more difficult than they had been led to believe. ' I remind the committee of the black Christmas which followed the cessation of hostilities. Strikes in New^South Wales threw hundreds of thousands of men out of work.",32
105,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown," -'Order ! Strikes in New South Wales have, nothing to do with the motion.",33
106,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"The severity of the taxes imposed upon industry affects the success of industrial concerns, and, there7 fore their ability to pay taxes and to produce more of the goods and services that are so urgently needed. Similarly, if men cannot obtain work, they cannot earn incomes, and, therefore, they cannot pay taxes. I submit, therefore, that strikes have a definite bearing on taxation. Because of strikes many workers have been able to obtain only intermittent employment. Strikes have retarded the development of industries in which ex-servicemen hoped to obtain employment. The result is that those who fought for their country are being denied the security for which they fought, and to which they are entitled. Up to date, 480,000 men have been discharged from the armed forces. Many of them are looking for'work.",33

111,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,. -'Order ! I shall not have the honourable member questioning the ruling of the Chair in that way.,33
112,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"I am not questioning any ruling, but am submitting, with due respect, that men who fought for their country should be entirely exempt from the payment of taxes for a further, period. They have not been given a fair deal. Many thousands of ex-servicemen are facing difficult problems. Among *them is the problem of finding homes for themselves and their families. Taxes are paid to provide homes for them, but where are the homes that they need ? The story of housing is a tragic one.",33
113,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,". - Order ! The honourable member will not be permitted to proceed along those lines. The Chair has ruled that this is a resolution relating to the rate of tax. The Chair has been tolerant with the honourable member, but he must now confine his remarks to the question before the Chair.",34
114,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"There are three forms of taxation in this country. One of them is a direct tax on incomes. There is also indirect taxation, and there is a social services tax. Combined, those taxes are the highest in the world. Ex-servicemen are required to pay their share of those taxes. I claim that they should not be called upon to do so for another twelve - months. The basis of these rates of tax is wrong, as no proper consideration has been given to married men with family responsibilities. Moreover, provision is made for a means test before social service benefits provided by a special social service tax, can be paid. Many thousands of persons in the community pay the social service tax, but because they are not in necessitous circumstances, they are not entitled to participate in the fund so provided. I claim also that the rates of tax before the committee are ill-founded in that no regard is paid to the development of this country ---r the needs of primary and secondary industries. A nation cannot develop when government expenditure in time.of peace is as great as when the nation is at war. The rates of tax in the proposal before us are ill-balanced, because they do not make adequate provision for those who served their country well in its fighting services for periods of up to six years, and because the needs of primary and secondary producers have not been given proper consideration. I remind the committee that the proportion of men in primary industries who enlisted in the armed forces was greater than in any other section of the community. To-day, primary producers are facing many difficulties, among them being a shortage of necessary materials and commodities.",34
115,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"Order! I again remind the honourable member that this is a resolution dealing with the rates of tax, and that his remarks have nothing to do with the subject before the Chair.",34
116,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,I submit that the rates of tax. should have some relationship to production ,34
117,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order!,34
118,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"For the reasons that I have given I ask the Treasurer to consider the amendment favourably. It should appeal to the right honourable gentleman if he wishes Australia to advance instead of remaining stationary, as is the position today. Australia is again on the verge of a depression created hy the Government, because it will not reduce taxes. Inflation cannot be avoided if taxes are not reduced. Last night the proposed reductions of taxes were shown to be hopelessly inadequate because of the many problems facing this country. I again point out that taxes amounting to £42,000,000 have not been collected and that assessments covering an additional £50,000,000 of taxes were not sent out at the proper time. If this £92,000,000 had been collected a further substantial reduction of taxation could have been made. I strongly support the amendment.",34
119,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"Fremantle) [2.44] Prior to the war a humorous book entitled A Cliche Expert Testifies of Life was published. To-day, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis) has delivered a speech which could be headed "" A clichd expert deals with politics"". He has spoken of the "" heat and burden of the day"" and has told us that ""the baby is the best immigrant "". Indeed, he has used all the stock-in-trade of the soapbox orator which we are accustomed to hear reverberate through this chamber whenever he speaks. I wish to draw attention to the absence from his remarks of any analysis of the financial state of the country.' Affirming that no consideration had been given to ex-servicemen in respect of taxes, he confined his remarks to generalities. He did not attempt an analysis of the concessions which are now given, or, in his opinion, should be given, to ex-servicemen. All he said was. that a man who had returned from service overseas should be exempt from the payment of taxes for another twelve months, and that in respect of those who had been on home service in Australia the exemption should be raised. The honourable member was not concerned with making an analysis of the financial position, but only with tub-thumping. Actually, present level 'of taxation in Australia is largely due to the concessions that have been - made to ex-servicemen. The financial statement of the Treasurer showed that the item of deferred pay had increased from £9,720,000 to nearly £73,000,000. The honourable member claimed that no consideration had been given to primary producers, and little encouragement to other producers, and he rightly emphasized that production was the most important thing today. I point out to the honourable member, however, that the amount paid in subsidies has increased from £14,280,000 to £19,753,000. Also, war pensions and repatriation costs have risen from £3,872,000 to £8,566,000. In the course of his speech, the honourable member made some astonishing statements. He said that there had been many strikes, which had had the effect of putting people out of employment, thus impeding production.",34
120,Mr SPENDER,Unknown,"The honourable member does not doubt that, surely.",35
121,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"No ; but one of the fundamental theories advanced by the Opposition is that, because of high taxes there is no incentive to produce. Then why do the employers want to employ the strikers if there is no incentive for them to go on producing? The honourable member's argument contains a contradiction, and there is a further contradiction, also: he said., that if heavy taxation on income were reduced production would be increased and inflation prevented. Let me point out that the taxation imposed during the last five or six years has had one curious effect; it has increased the savings bank deposits from £234,000,000 to £649,000,000. These savings represent unus.ed spending power in the hands of the community. In March, 1944, the total volume of savings banks deposits' was '£446,046,000; in March, 1945, it was £539,990,000; while in March, 1946, it was £648,852,000. Mr Francis.:-That is a reflection on the Government.",35
122,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"It . may be, but the theory advanced by the honourable member was that high taxation was destroying spending power. How, then, does he explain the increased spending power of the the community ?",35
123,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,Productio n has declined and consumers cannot purchase the goods they need ,35
124,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"The fact is that the money taken in taxes from the higher income groups is distributed among those in the lower income groups. The amount of. £73,000,000 for deferred pay goes straight back to the community, as also does the amount of £65,000,000 paid out on social services. Inflation is affected not only by the volume of spending power in the hands of the community, but also by the velocity of the circulation of money. If money payments are made to those in the higher income groups, the chances are that the money will be banked, because the people in those groups .have no immediate need to consume. If , however, extra spending power is given to those sections of society which need to consume immediately, the increased velocity of the circulation of money will create pressure on prices. Whatever the defects of means tests, they do at any rate ensure that social service payments are applied.to those most in need of them, and those who will most quickly use them. I suggest that the honourable member was not honest in his advocacy of the abolition of the means test, having regard to his defence of the contributory system for social services.",35
125,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,I advocate the contributory system.,35
126,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"Yes , but we must face the fact that the Government which came into office in 1941, when there were 000,000 persons in the services, was not in the position to introduce a contributory scheme. A primary requirement of such a scheme is that there shall be general stability of employment. among those to whom it applies, which is why contributory schemes have been confined, so far, to the Public Services. During the last five or six years of economic instability, there was no opportunity introduce a contributory scheme. It astonishing how many faults are attrihigh, buted to the pre-war Labour government which was in office for only two years in a period of 25 years. That governcessions ment is supposed to have been responcan sible for high tariffs, and for all faults which have been ascribed to our social services. The tax nates which the people must endure today on every level of income are obviously much higher than before the war. That is regrettable, but a munity which isfacing the task of mobilization must unwind its war effort slowly. In Great Britain, from 1914 to 1918, the British Government itself was hy far the greatest spender. In time, the whole economy of' the country geared to government spending. In 1919, there was a sudden cessation of governinescapable ment spending and a sudden effort at economy. The result was, that while at . the beginning of 1919 the number unemployed was only 128,000, the number at the end of the.year was 2,300,000. United States' of America and Canada have both adopted the tactic of a. unwinding of the war effort. Canada had 256,000 persons out of work in March of this year, while the United States of America had about 4,000,000 unemployed. The sudden cessation of government spending, before there has been time set other forms of enterprise in motion, must create an economic crisis. By tapering-off the war. effort, the Austhe tralian Government has ensured that there are fewer than 11,000 persons ing unemployment relief at the present time. No reference has been made by subsidies honourable members opposite to the fact that although £9,500,000 was put aside for unemployment relief, only £1,114,000 has been expended to date. That is tribute to the Government's financial policy. Government expenditure is not hoarded by the Treasurer; it is distripropose buted throughout the whole community. It is desirable that the Government should diminish vastly itsshare in economic activities of the nation, but when 700,000 men are to be demobilized within a period of twelve months, their Mr Beazley. to claims for pay, deferred pay, &c., must is be met. Thus it is that taxation remains but it is being reduced. Concessions have been made to those in the lower income groups, but no greater conthan have been provided for be made to the community as a whole. the If the Government had failed to meet the - money claims of ex-servicemen it ' would have failed in its trust. If it had met those claims.to a greater extent out of borrowed money it would merely have been putting off the evil day, and the burden of payments on the money comborrowed would have had to be met out deof future taxation. Anybody can get cheap popularity by standing up and bellowing, ""We don't like these deductions from our wages "". The vital"" point is for what purpose is this expenditure to be was applied? Every item specified in the Prime Minister's statement represents expenditure, and I congratulate the right honourable .gentleman upon the fact that the scientific taperingof off of government expenditure is not creating in this country the unemployThe ment crises that exist in Canada, the United States of America, and to a lesser rapid degree in Great Britain itself.",35
127,Sir EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Cowper) [2.56] I am afraid that the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley) rather misstated the position when dealing with subsidies to primary producers. He implied that these subsidies were for the to sole benefit of the producers; hut, in fact, they are being paid for the specific purpose of assisting consumers by keeping prices of essential commodities at reasonable levels. The prices of bread drawand butter for instance have remained' almost at pre-war levels. In effect the are the-equivalent of a reduction of taxes on the lower income groups. That is a point that I should like the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) and particularly a the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr Scully) to bear in mind,, because we on this side of the chamber to ask for more substantial subsidies in the future as an incentive to production, and as a means of assisting the low income earners whose wages have been pegged for the last four years. The honourable member for Fremantle mentioned the fact that an enormous increase of savings banks deposits had occurred during the war. That was inevitable owing to the shortage of civilian goods. The position that has now arisen is this: The enormous government production of munitions having ceased, if we are to maintain full employment in this country, there must be placed in the hands of consumers, especially those in the lower income groups, a substantially greater amount of money than they have been receiving. I appeal to the Prime Minister to consider carefully the suggestion by the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) that further consideration of the motion be postponed in order that the Government may reconsider its proposals. An' adjustment of taxes on lower incomes, especially family incomes, would not, in my opinion, reduce the total return from taxation, generally. Our experience after the last war was this: When one came to examine the relative contributions in indirect taxes of the various classes of the community, one found that people in the lower income groups were paying a greater share in proportion to their income, of indirect taxes, than people more fortunately placed financially. There is not likely to he any substantial alteration of the rates of indirect taxation within the next few years. For instance, it would be most difficult to reduce customs tariffs and duties whilst the world is in its present disrupted state. There is no certainty as to what costs in this country will be in the future. We must import a great deal of machinery and other essential commodities. suggest, therefore, that an examination of this matter should be made. to see whether it is possible to take a bigger step than the Government now proposes towards, reducing taxes. For instance, we found that the increase of the statutory exemption from tax from £200 to £300 a year did not lessen the total amount of income tax received because subsequent industrial expansion increased the field of both income tax and indirect taxes. I believe that the next two or three years will' bring the most difficult times that the wage-earner of this country has ever faced. Recently the Prices Commissioner stated that the price of clothing in this country has increased by 75 per cent. since the pre-war years. Similar increases have occurred, in the prices of many other essential commodities. Within the next few years many young men who have returned from the war will marry and will 3et up house-keeping. We should do everything possible to enable these people to obtain the greatest possible value for their wages. Up to the present, it has not been possible to deal with many items because they are imported or include a proportion of imported material; but the Government could make a practical contribution to the solution of this problem by reducing taxes to the greatest possible degree on all incomes up to, say, £7 or £8 a week. I do not think that this would have any great effect on the total revenue received from taxes. In fact, I believe that the revenue would be ho less than that forecast in the Financial Statement, because what was lost on the roundabouts would be made up on the swings. In addition, there would be an important psychological effect on the community which might easily increase production. Apparently it is the intention of the Government to impose a permanent tax on incomes for social services. In these circumstances, it seems to me that other income tax proposals contained in this resolution should'be amended to give additional relief in the manner I have suggested. That is not advisable only from a humanitarian point of view, although that in itself is a worthwhile motive; but also it would ""benefit us from a financial point of view, and certainly from the standpoint of production. I Opportunities are ripe for great developments in this country, but private enterprise is being greatly hampered by the excessive burden of taxation. Increases of the cost of consumer goods resulting from high taxes must inevitably bring about an increase of the basic wage, and so we have a pyramidal result. In this way our chances of competing successfully in the markets of the world arc considerably lessened. I support the amendment moved by the Leader of * the Australian Country party, not with a desire to delay the business of the committee, but for the purpose of awakening in the Government a sense of its responsibilities. If the proposals I have advocated to. reduce income taxation on lower incomes are accepted people in the low salaried groups, particularly married men with family responsibilities, will be able to secure the utmost from the expenditure of their incomes.",36
128,Mr FRASER,Unknown,"Eden-Monaro) [3.6] My contribution to this discussion will be limited to reminding the committee of an important statement made in Melbourne less than three months ago emphasizing that the primary war-time control which must be continued in peace-time conditions is high taxation. The statement proceeded to point out that unless high taxes were continued as the most important of a number of war-time controls which must be retained for the present, wild inflation would result. The statement added, further, that there should not be any sudden or sharp reduction of taxes, emphasizing that any reductions made should be gradual and steady. That statement was made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies).",38
129,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"Balaclava) [3.7] - The Treasurer (Mr Chifley) should take an early opportunity to indicate what real reductions have been effected by the recent tax cuts. Last night I cited some figures which had been compiled by a member of the Victorian Parliament showing that in some instances, particularly in the case of taxpayers with dependants, the reductions were insignificant. In some cases they represented less than 2d. a week over a widerange of taxpayers. If the right honourable gentleman gave the information I suggest and at the same time made a forecast of proposed future reductions, it would go a long way towards restoring the optimism of the people. The right honourable gentleman stated that the maximum reduction would be more than 47 per cent. The maximum reduction would, however, be applicable to very few taxpayers."" I trust that this does not represent the final income tax concession which the Government is prepared to extend to . the people this year. Reductions might also be effected in the sales tax which is punitive in its incidence. The figures in the financial statement clearly prove that reductions of that tax would not result in reducing the volume of revenue. The tax should be immediately reviewed, particularly as many of our young servicemen now being discharged from the forces who wish to marry find that almost everything they heed is subject to a very heavy impost. Very many household requirements which were exempt before they joined the forces have since been brought iuto the sales tax schedules.",38
130,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"Order! The honourable"" gentleman will have an opportunity to deal with sales tax at a later stage.",38
131,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"The Government might also give consideration to the need for reviewing its public departments with the object of avoiding, extravagant expenditure, so enabling taxes to be still further reduced.",38
132,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,. - The honourable gentleman is not in order in proceeding along those lines.,38
133,Mr WHITE,Unknown,We know what happens here when we.3uggest anything.,38
134,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,. - Order !,38
135,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"There are many ways in which public money is being wasted. As an example of wasteful expenditure Icite the continuance of the Division of Import Procurement, the need for which might very wellbe made the subject of joint investigation by the Treasurer and the Minister for Trade and Customs. The Postmaster-General's Department, despite its buoyant revenues, is not able to extend telephone services because of shortage of telephones.",38
136,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,. - Order ! The honourable member is not in order in discussing whether taxes generally 'should be reduced as the result of savings effected in government departments.,38
137,Mr WHITE,Unknown,It is obvious that suggestions are not welcome.,38
138,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,". - I ask the honourable member to resume his seat. The Chair will not condone imputations of the kind made hy the honourable member. He must address himself to the motion before the committee. I have already reminded, him that neither sales tax nor the activities of the government departments are involved in it.",38
139,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"I bow to the ruling of the Chair. I shall confine my remarks at this stage to citing specific examples of the effects of the most recent income tax reductions. . A taxpayer with dependfrom ants who earns from personal exertion an this year, amount of £2 8s. I d . a week, or £125 year, will receive a reduction of amounting to 9d. A similar taxpayer port was who earns £3 5s. 4d. a week, or £170 year, will also receive a reduction ing to 9d. That, I suggest, is a miserable reduction to have made at a time when this country is changing from a war-time to a peace-time economy. When microscopic reductions are revealed to the people they will take the Government to task for not having been more generous. To-day we have opportunities for the sional, organization, expansion of our export trade, greater New Zealand strongly advocated than at any other time in our history; but policy despite the fact that every reduction of and taxes gives an added incentive to private at ' enterprise, the Government comes fordominions. ward with these miserable proposals. Although servicemen and their dependants have suffered, this country remains at unscathed by the avalanche of war; yet, the Government forces suffer from what-might be described self-inflicted wounds for .our difficulties are man-made.' The Government should do everything possible full employment and assist production by reducing taxes to the greatest possible degree. I ask leave to continue my remarks at a later date.

140,Mr DRAKEFORD,Unknown,"MaribyrnongMinister for A i r and Minister f o Aviation) [ 3 . 1 7 ] - I move That the House do now adjourn. I take this opportunity to bring before the House a report on the First Assembly of the Provisional International Civil Aviation Conference held in Montreal the 21st May to the 7th June of at which consideration a of a multi-lateral agreement on comtax mercial international civil air transprobably the most ima portant subject discussed. As Leader of amountthe Australian delegation to this assembly, my foremost task was to present Australia's very definite opinions on the urgent need for an international conthese ception of civil air transport. At the Chicago conference in November, 1944, which established the proviAustralia and the of international ownership control, framed in advance conferences between the two Only France and Afghanistan indicated readiness to support it . Deliberations at Chicago, made it clear that, that stage, it was impossible to achieve general agreement on the political and it to economic aspects of international civil as aviation. Many countries, led by the United Kingdom, were not prepared to grant transport rights without securing to "" hasten that degree of protection which certain other countries, led by the United States of America, were not prepared to concede. This lack of agreement led to the whole subject being referred to the interim council for further study, although an air transport agreement, granting commercial rights - without protective provisions was drawn up and' left open for acceptance CO Nby such States as wished to accept it . - When the matter of a multi-lateral agreewas raised at the Montreal Assembly, Australia's adherence to the expressed at - Chicago was As then, it was still a plea ESTAT E that full control and operation of the AUSTRALIAN international trunk air routes and the - ownership of the requisite aircraft and - ancillary equipment should be vested in - an international air transport authority. At Montreal it. was most g r at if y in g to hear the announcement of the leader of r Civil the United Kingdom delegation that his government now supported the "" ANZAC "" proposal for international ownership and control. The leader of the Belgian delegation also supported it. Despite this, it was clear that there was not sufficient support to justify Australia pressing for the adoption of the ""ANZAC"" proposal at that assembly. The assembly did approve a recommendation from the Interim Council that a special body be established under the council to study and develop the idea. The Australian delegation afHrmed its adherence to the opinion "" that a multi-lateral agreement on commercial rights in international civil air transport constitutes the only solution compatible with the character of the International Civil Aviation Organization established at Chicago "". A resolution in these terms was unanimously' adopted by the assembly. In addition to the principles stated in the preamble to the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation, Australia considered that certain other principles should be included in the basis of any such multi-lateral agreement. principles include the fostering of the widest possible distribution of the benefits of air travel at the cheapest rates consistent with sound economic principles; the stimulation of international air travel to promote friendly understanding and goodwill, and to ensure the many indirect benefits of this form of transport for the common welfare of all countries. Air transport facilities should hear a close relationship to the requirements of the public. There should, too, be a fair and equal, opportunity for the air carriers of all countries to operate between their own territories and those of other countries by reasonably direct routes. We contended further that all air transport services should - retain, as their primary objective, the provision of capacity adequate to the traffic demands between' the country in which the aircraft is registered and the country of ultimate destination. The handicap under which many States are placed should be recognized, and satisfactory means should be found to enable the airlines of such countries to play their full part in international airline operations when they become able to do so. In our view, satisfactory means should exist to ensure that the rates charged on international airlines are reasonable, taking into consideration Mr Drakeford. all the relevant factors; There should also be satisfactory machinery to determine authoritatively whether in any specific instance the provisions of the agreement are being observed. Subject to the general acceptance of an agreement giving effect to the principles enumerated, the Australian Government would be prepared to grant multilaterally the first four freedoms, and would be prepared to consider the granting of the fifth freedom if the agreement was otherwise acceptable.. The "" five freedoms "", as defined by the Chicago conference, and as they affect each contracting State, are(1) the privilege to fly across its territory without landing; (2) the privilege to land for non-traffic purposes; (3) the privilege to put down passengers, mail and cargo taken on in the territory of the State whose nationality the aircraf t possesses; These (4) the privilege to take on passengers, mail and cargo destined for the territory of the State whose nationality the aircraf t possesses; (5) the privilege to take on passengers, mail and cargo destined for .the territory of any other contracting State,. . and the privilege'to put down passengers, mail and ""cargo coming from any such territory. The representatives of the United States of America, whose Government assumed responsibility for initiating the Air Transport Agreement, which covers the "" five freedoms "" admitted that, owing to the small extent to which the agreement had been accepted, it could no longer be considered as the basis ""of a world-wide scheme for international civil aviation. Eventually the assembly resolved unanimously that, whereas it desired to establish a programme for the development of a multi-lateral agreement which would be acceptable to member States as rapidly as possible, and whereas it was in accord that a final, multi-luteral agreement on commercial rights should not be completed or presented at the assembly, the appropriate commission should proceed immediately with a frank and open discussion of all the problems involved in 1 developing a multi-lateral agreement. The result of such discussion is to be incorporated in a document which, it was agreed, would serve as a basis for further study. It was further resolved that in the coming year each member State should furnish any additional views on the subject, and that the council should circulate these views so that a document embodying the experience of nations with operations under existing or future agreements might be presented to the next annual assembly. The views expressed by most of the delegations, with the exception of the United States of America and the Netherlands, indicated readiness to grant commercial rights in a multilateral agreement, only if such agreement contained reasonable safeguards to protect their interests. Many States obviously had it in mind to protect the interests of their airlines from uncontrolled competition from airlines of more powerful States. Apart from this vital matter of international agreement on control and operation, much other work of great value was accomplished by the assembly. Deliberations were extremely thorough. All the 44 member States were represented, and observers - comprised representatives of ten non-member States and eight international organizations, who were present by invitation. The leader of the Belgian delegation^ M . Louis de Brouckere, was unanimously elected president, and, as leader of the Australian delegation, I was elected second vice-president. The work of the conference was divided into five commissions, each of which was entrusted with the duty of considering certain items of the agenda and presenting a report and recommendations to the full assembly. Australia was represented on each of these commissions. At the instance of the' Australian . delegation it was resolved that the interim council of the organization should be authorized to make such arrangements with the United Nations as might be necessary for the effective co-operation of the two organizations during the coming year. Any agreement made or co-operation arranged, should preserve the autonomy of the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization with respect to the purpose for which it was created. The resolution achieved Australia's main objective which was that, in order to reach the maximum measure of international co-operation and security, the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization should be closely related to the United Nations. After debating problems relating to international airmail, the assembly requested the interim council to establish close liaison with the International Bureau of the Universal Postal Union, especially for the exchange of information of mutual interest. When dealing with finance, the assembly adopted the Finance Commission's recommendation concerning units of contributions by each member State. This was on a scale that gives 289 units from all member States. Australia, like Argentina, Brazil, India and the Netherlands, is allocated ten units- a contribution for 1945-46 of approximately £A10,500. For 1946-47, Australia's allocation will remain at ten units, but the amount of contributions' will rise to approximately £A19,500. It is interesting to note that, in the 1946-47 financial year, while other countries' contributions will remain on the same scale of unit allocation, that of the .United States of America will be increased from 30 to 45 units. In the technical field of air navigation, meteorology and ground organization, progress was made in the formulation of standards, practices and procedures for the safe and efficient operation of international air services. The ultimate objective is that the most vital of these shall become legally binding on all member States. Experts in international air law drew up modifications of existing rules for the settlement of differences between member States. This alone represented a vast amount of intense study. Outstanding in the work of the Legal Commission was an investigation of means by which the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization should deal with legal problems affecting such subjects as aerial mortgages and real securities, ownership of aircraft and an aeronautic register, assistance and rescue of aircraft on land, and amendment and'replacement of the Warsaw Convention on International Carriage by Air. The assembly decided that provision should be made within the permanent organization for a committee on international air law. The principal functions of this committee will be the preparation of draft conventions for the unification of international air law, and the submission of expert advice on all international legal matters. It is expected that ultimately this committee will absorb Comite Internationale Technique Expertes Juridique Aeriens, the existing and independent expert international committee on air law. The assembly agreed that non-member States should have the right to take part in all the discussions of the' assembly, and that the council might invite exenemy States to take part, without the right to vote, when the council considered such attendance would be of use for the furtherance of the objectives of the-meetings. On the question of filling the vacant seat on the council, the delegation opposed action at this stage, feeling that the vacancy might well be left until the next assembly in the hope that universal membership of the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization might be achieved by the inclusion of Russia, the only major nation not yet a member ""of the organization, and for which the Chicago conference tacitly held the twenty-first seat open. The decision to fill the seat wa3 carried by a vote of 20 to 18, and Eire was elected to it by secret ballot with 32 votes. Argentina was the only other candidate declared before the poll was taken. That country joined the conference only in the last few days. When 26 States have ratified the Convention on International Civil Aviation drawn up at Chicago in 1944, the organization will cease to be provisional. Early ratification by all member States was recommended by the assembly, and the interim council was requested to recommend a procedure so that all States which had not yet done so might simultaneously deposit their ratifications on the. 1st March, 1947.",39
141,Sir EARLE PAGE,Unknown,Will Parliament be asked to ratify the convention or will that be done by the Government ?,42
142,Mr DRAKEFORD,Unknown,"The Parliament will be asked to ratify it. It is largely a formality and there is nothing controversial about it . However, the Parliament will be asked to give a decision. Montreal, Canada, was selected as the permanent seat of the organization. Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization is now firmly set on a sound foundation, ready to delete the word "" provisional "" from its title. I cannot conclude this report without expressing my deep appreciation of the work of every member of the delegation which I had the honour to lead. This work has enhanced the Commonwealth's already high reputation in the field of international civil aviation. My object in making the report has been to inform honourable members of what has been done so far. When subjects related to international civil aviation are introduced in this House in future, honourable members will be in a position to debate Australian - them intelligently. Dame ENID LYONS (Darwin) [3.32]. - I bring to the attention of the House a matter which I raised during the first session of this Parliament. One of the things which create considerable unrest in the minds of the people is the amount of waste that occurs under schemes of government control. I believe that a certain amount of waste is inescapable, but much of it could"" be avoided by the introduction of a little more flexibility into the systems of control that are exercised. The waste which I have particularly in mind relates to certain dairy products of the district which I represent in this House. The circumstances obtaining there may well be unique in the Commonwealth, but I do not know that they are. The average farm in my electorate has an area of between 100 and 150 acres. Most farmers carry on mixed farming; few of them are dairy farmers as such. Many of them, of course, keep sufficient cows to justify them sending cream' to the butter factories, and there are fairly large sales of factory butter from the area. In the past, many of the farmers kept only sufficient cows for their own immediate use, perhaps two or three, and occasionally a few more. This meant that they had a sufficiency of milk, butter and cream for their own use, but in flush seasons there was always a considerable surplus. Most of these people regularly kept one or two more cows than were then necessary for their own use. The farmer's wife made up the cream into dairy butter, and disposed of it at the local store each week-end when she went, into the township to do her shopping. The return from the sale was regarded as her "" pin money"". The aggregate output of butter was quite considerable, but, at present, practically the whole of the cream is thrown to the pigs. This is a very serious matter. . My suggestion to the Government, when first I raised this matter, and 1 repeat it now, was that a permit should be granted to these farmers to produce 7 lb. or 8 lb. of butter a week for disposal to local storekeepers. Some people will say that the adoption of my proposal will mean that certain quantities of cream will not be available for export, but, as I have pointed out, this cream is not now being used for export, but is being thrown to the pigs. It would even be possible to increase the quantity of butter available for export by the quantity thus disposed of through local storekeepers, because I assure honourable members that the market for that dairy butter was a steady one. There were people who always preferred that good farm butter to the factory product. In the particular area of which I speak, most of the storekeepers would be prepared to accept a reduced quantity of factory butter, and substitute for it some of the farm butter. They would have a ready demand from the public for the good farm butter. I commend that proposal to the Government, because this is a subject which arouses a good deal of feeling amongst the farming community on the north-west coast of Tasmania. It has already resulted in the destruction of a large number of cows, because farmers who formerly kept three, ' four or five cows have now reduced their numbers to one or two. They considered that it was not worth their while to register as producers with a butter factory. The present position has two bad features: First, the waste of cream, and, secondly, the destruction of cows. Perhaps it is rather late now to deal with the second problem, but a start could be made in this way to rebuild the dairy herds, which will mean a great deal to us in the future.",42
143,Sir EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Cowper) [3.37] I ask the Minister for Air (Mr Drakeford) to inform me, when he replies to this debate, whether' an agreement has been reached between Australia and the United States of America regarding the use of Honolulu and other American islands in the Pacific for a reciprocal service between America and^this country. Before the war, the United States of America was not willing to allow Australia to use Honolulu. If we were permitted to utilize that base, we should be able to'establish a very"" satisfactory trans-Pacific service. I direct the attention of the Government to the very serious condition of affairs in the dairying industry as I found them to exist during the last fortnight from Gympie, in Queensland, - to Newcastle, in New South ""Wales, especially from Kempsey north. I was informed that the conditions which I saw were general along the whole north coast of Queensland. This area is affected by. one of the worse droughts on record. Last February and March, heavy floods occurred throughout the area, with the result that the entire fodder crop was destroyed, and the pastures for this year were ruined. Since then, no rain has fallen. ""All the feed is so dry that, according to the managers of butter factories, the quantity of butter produced in their establishments in May and June of this year was only one-third of the output in the corresponding months of last year; and last year's production in those months was the lowest for twenty years. In addition, the dairy-farmers and their organization have informed me that they have submitted to the Government, as the result of the Dairy Advisory Committee's - inquiry which extended over a year, a closely reasoned set of costs for the industry. This calculation shows that they must receive at least Is. H i d . per lb. for butter to enable them to meet their costs in normal times. At present, they are receiving about Is. 7.3d. per lb. If this amount could be increased immediately as the result of an investigation which, I understand, the Prices Branch has been undertaking, the dairy-farmers would be given new heart, and could establish credit to enable them to buy the fodder which is essential if their stock is to be saved. Earlier this week, I asked the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr. Scully) about the relative number of dairy cattle and calves in Australia. He replied that since the outbreak of war, the number of dairy milking cattle had diminished by about 250,000, and, at present, there were 120,000 fewer heifer calves underone-year old than at the corresponding period last year. Erom what I saw, I consider that between 200,000 and* 300,000 dairy cows will die during the next. few months unless immediate relief is given. Last February, because of drought conditions in New South Wales, especially around Sydney, the Prices Commissioner examined the ""costs of the dairying industry supplying whole milk in that area and the Prime Minister Chifley), on behalf of the Government, made a grant of a special subsidy of 3d. a gallon during January, and also certain payments to those who were compelled to purchase feed. I emphasize that the plight. of those dairy-farmers who are supplying the butter factories is really much more desperate than that of those who market their milk. Undoubtedly, the producers of milk require assistance, but the needs of those who supply the hutter factories is even more urgent. I hope that the Treasurer (Mr Chifley), the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator J. M . Fraser), the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture and the Prices Commissioner will examine this matter, and that the Government will announce an immediate increase of price so that dairy-farmers shall be able to pay for fodder the high prices now ruling because of the shortage of feed caused by the drought.",43
144,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"Barker) [3.43] - Many young men who served in the Royal Australian Air Force and who are applicants for appointment to the Permanent Air Force, believe that if their names are mentioned in the Parliament, they will be immediately ""scrubbed"". Therefore, without mentioning the names of individuals, I direct the attention of the Minister for Ai r (Mr Drakeford) to the fact that one young man, for whose family and service record I can vouch, and who is now in civil life, has applied for appointment to the Permanent Air Force. In company with many other young men, he has been examined and re-examined, interviewed and re-interviewed. At his own expense, he travelled from Adelaide to Melbourne some time ago for his final interview, and.was informed that, within a fortnight, he would be notified whether he had been appointed. That occurred weeks ago, and he has not received the intimation. These young men do not know what the future holds for them. Some of them were decorated for their service in World War II . , but evidently the Department of Air has so little regard for their future that it has not advised these men whether they will be appointed to the Permanent Air Force. I hope that the Minister will ensure that such delays (Mr shall not be repeated - I - am using the facts with regard to one man as indicative of the position of many others. The time is ripe to make a statement as to the future of the interim air force and of the force which the Government proposes to employ eventually. These young men should be told whether they will be required. If they knew that they will not be needed, they would take steps to obtain employment in civil life. A few weeksago I asked a question in the - House, and was subsequently assured by the Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley) in writing that a statement made by Mr John Fletcher, the honor : able member for Mount Gambier, in the South Australian House of Assembly, about the use of cigare'tte papers in the paper mills at Snuggery, was incorrect, and that only 8 cwt. of that class of paper had inadvertently reached the mills. I have a telegram which states that a whole truck load of this paper passed through Mount Gambier, consigned to Snuggery. It would appear that somebody received instructions and did not carry them out. I have had cause to complain about the treatment of ex-servicemen coming home from tropical areas. I have been assured that instructions have been given that they 'shall be provided with clothing of a suitable character when leaving a tropical climate and entering a zone in which winter conditions prevail. But many of them are arriving from the north. and are not receiving suitable ciothing. This matter should be investigated. I have received a letter from a reputable resident of my electorate who says that for ten years he has been the tenant of a house in the metropolitan area. He rents the property from the Government Savings Bank of South Australia, which is presumably the owner of the premises. The second mortgagee recently offered the property for sale, and the second mortgage was taken over by another man who already owns a house. The man who has now purchased the house has ordered the present tenant to vacate it, as apparently he desires two houses in which to live. While there is a serious shortage of houses, some Commonwealth authority should have power to say that nobody shall occupy two dwellinghouses in any circumstances. My correspondent complains of the method by which this house was put up for auction. The bidding went to a certain price, and then the auctioneer said it was obvious that there were several bidders,-and that the Treasury valuation would be exceeded. It was finally arranged that offers inincreasing at £5 a bid should be made, and that when a certain undisclosed figure was reached, the lucky bidder would receive the property. that method the man to whom I have referred is reported to have secured a second ho.use. That is a method of acquiring property which should not be tolerated by any government. If that were to be the rule more than one. person could bid on behalf of an.interested party, who would obviously increase his chances of securing additional property by that means. No Minister would attempt to justify the way in which property sales are sometimes conducted. The whole subject of price restricgraphs tions and valuations needs be overhauled, but I have a fairly good idea of what is happening with regard to some sales. When it is found that the Treasury delegate has announced that the limit is a certain sum, the would be purchaser offers perhaps £1,000 for some paltry article of furniture and secures the house. Those . who are prepared to break the law are "" getting away with it "" constantly. It is unthinkable that a person who already owns a dwelling house should be able to purchase a second one, and turn out the occupant.",44
145,Mr TURNBULL,Unknown,"Wimmera) [3.50]. - I recently asked the Minister for Air (Mr Drakeford) when the Lake Boga depot of the Iioyal Australian Air Force would be ready for disposal, 'and he promised to look into the matter and speed it up as much as possible, so that the buildings could be sold. I desire to know what will become of them when the department no longer requires them. 1I have made representations on behalf of the Swan Hill Hospital authorities, who require nurses quarters and ask that the hospital at the Lake Boga depot and - some of the other buildings be made available to that institution. A request has also been made that some of the workshops be handed over for the purposes of a scheme contemplated by the Government of Victoria for the decentralization of secondary industries. I am concerned about the provision of homes for ex-servicemen in the Lake Boga district, who are urgently in need of accommodation. I have a list before me of ex-servicemen 1 in that district whose plight is deplorable. The first man on the list is an orchardist at Tresco. He is a married man with two children, and is living at present in a three-roomed house. He desires to makeUnder further sleeping accommodation for his family who are at present sleeping with their mother.' Another case on the list is that of a returned prisoner of war from Germany. He was married while in England, .and his bride has arrived in Australia. At present he is residing with his parents in a four-roomed house, in which his two sisters also live. There are about twenty such cases, and with the permission of the House I shall incorporate the remainder of the details in Hansard. Each of the following parafurnishes particulars of the cirto cumstances of individual ex-servicemen:Married with family. Has obtained at present make-shift quarters. Desires to erect his own residence. Is at present working in Tresco district. Married with boy of thirteen years old. At present renting two-roomed house which he have been given notice to quit. Is engaged to be married, and cannot obtain house or rooms of any sort. Married, no family. Living with his parents"" until he can obtain house. « Orchardiet at Tresco. Living in hut 24 feet hy 12 feet. Married. Married with one child. Living with fatherin-law. Could purchase dairy land which has no liouse. Married, desires to erect house for his widowed mother, as she has received notice to quit from present residence. Has returned from prisoner of war (Japan). Married with two children. Has commenced business as boot repairer. Present arrangements inadequate. Married, one child. At present residing in concrete house' which has been declared by his medical adviser as unsatisfactory for his wife and child owing to dampness. No other place obtainable. Landowner at Winlaton. Present buildings on his land, not suitable for his needs. Wishes to purchase one of these huts to erect his own dwelling Married with no family. At present residing with his parents. Dairyfarmer at Fishpoint. Desires to erect his own house in place' of living with his parents. Single, but is engaged to be married. Could obtain land from his father to erect house on. Present materials for this are unobtainable. Returned prisoner of war (Germany). Is engaged to be married, and'desires to have his own house. Married with'live children. At present residing with his wife's people. Has use of two rooms and verandah - which are inadequate for his family. Returned soldiers at Lake Boga and the president of the district council, Mr ,S. Taylor, inform me that the buildings are suitable for conversion, to living quarters for these men, all, of whom work in the town or district. Some have blocks of land but no dwellings. If they do not get these houses they will be compelled to leave the district, but they prefer to settle - there. They should be given absolute preference in the purchase of these dwellings, and should not be required to compete with contractors at a sale. A local contractor is prepared to remove the ' buildings to their blocks at a cost of £20 each, and that price might even he reduced if a number of the buildings were to be removed. There are more than 21, hut these are those of which I have particulars. As these are local men who urgently need dwellings, and the buildings are on the spot, the authorities should give favourable consideration to the application that I make on their behalf. Mr Turnbull. On several occasions, beginning with the second day on which I had been a member of this House, I have brought to the notice of the Minister for the Army (Mr Forde) the need for the payment of a subsistence allowance of 3s. a day to men who were captured by the Japanese and held as prisoners of war for 3£ years. I learned that officers who had been prisoners of war had been paid a field allowance of 3s. a day. The Minister for the Army accepted my statement that that field allowance was paid normally to enable an officer to meet social obligations which members of other ranks had not to meet, and to provide for himself additional food in the mess. In a prisoner-of-war camp, an officer has no social obligations. L'espite that fact, the authorities continued the allowance in respect of officers who were prisoners of war. I have stressed that prisoners of war had to sell many, personal belongings in order to obtain the food that they required, and that the brunt of the hardships in Malaya and Singapore was borne by the - men of other ranks, the officers having a comparatively easy time. In order to obtain exact information, I asked the Minister for the Army this questionWhat percentage of (a) commissioned officers and (6) other ranks of the 8th Division, Australian Imperial Force, lost their lives in Japanese hands after the f all - of Singapore ? The answer that I received was(a) 9.5' officers; (o) 36.6 other ranks. That is rather a dramatic revelation, which proves to the hilt that the brunt of the hardships was borne by men of other ranks. The Minister at first refused the application for a subsistence allowance,"" but upon my. raising the matter again he decided to reconsider it. I urge him to take into account this new evidence that' the percentage of other ranks who lost their lives was very much higher than that of officers. I know that many ministerial supporters v favour the payment of a subsistence allowance to these men! If British justice is to be observed, it should be paid.",45
146,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"Moreton) [4.0] - I direct attention to the serious discontent that is caused among members of the fighting forces who are still in Rabaul, by the conflicting advices they receive as to the date on which they are to be returned to Australia. A correspondent of mine has pointed out that again and again the Minister for the Army (Mr Forde) has stated that all the troops will have been evacuated from Rabaul. by the end of July. Yet the General Officer Commanding the forces in that area has stated that only a portion of the troops will be able to leave on Westralia at the end of July, and that maybe one or two months, or more, may elapse before the balance oan be relieved. These men are thoroughly exasperated by such conflicting statements. In their correspondence, they say that they have no confidence in the Minister, because he makes statements which appear to be to some degree irresponsible, and are quickly denied by the General Officer Commanding. I urge the Minister to fix as early as possible the date on which these men will be completely evacuated, and to take steps to ensure that they will be evacuated on that date. They have been in Rabaul for a considerable time. As the war is over, it should be possible to make definite arrangements. This is another "" forgotten legion "". Being out of sight, they are out of mind. In spite of what the Minister for the Army has said in regard to the provision of amenities - for the Australian troops in the occupied areas in Japan, those men are still discontented. The right honourable gentleman has made lengthy statements, after interviewing senior officers, [t is generally known that the Australian Comforts Fund has provided amenities to a value of £45,000. Already profit of £160,000 has been made from the sale of goods by Army canteens in Japan. I ask that a portion of that profit shall be devoted to the provision of amenities for the men who are more or less isolated in that inhospitable country. During the war, the profit made by the Army canteen service was between £4,000,000 and £5,000,000. If the profit of £160,000 made in Japan be not adequate to meet the needs of the occasion, this other fund should be drawn upon. I hope that immediate attention will be given to the matter. These men are entitled to more consideration than they have received. By their deportment and general conduct, they have added to the prestige of our fighting forces, which is justifiably high. I have asked the Minister for Air (Mr Drakeford) questions concerning the maintenance of aircraft, the property of the Royal Australian Air Force. Recently I askedIn view of the reported low standard of maintenance of service aircraft, will he supply a statement showing (a) the number of service flights completed successfully this year and (6) the number of flights interrupted for technical reasons? The Minister repliedRoyal Australian Air Force Head-quarters' records show that (a) 15,000 service flights by aircraft (other than training types) such as Catalinas, Liberators, Mustangs, Beaufighters and Dakotas, have been successfully completed this year; (6) 29 aircraft were forced to land, due to engine trouble. There is much anxiety, particularly on the part of relatives of men serving in the Royal Australian Air Force, regarding the maintenance of aircraft. The impression is that too many technical men have been released, and that, as a consequence, sufficient adequately trained men are not available to maintain aircraft in a satisfactory condition; that available technicians are distributed too widely""; and, generally, that the organization of the Royal Australian A i r Force is topsy-turvy. I sincerely hope that these fears are without foundation, but I ask the Minister to investigate the matter thoroughly and to make a full statement on the subject as early as possible.",46
147,Mr DRAKEFORD,Unknown,"MaribyrnongMinister for Air and Minister for Civil Aviation) [4.7] - in replyVarious matters have been raised by a number of honourable members and I shall bring those which do not concern the departments under my control to the notice of the appropriate Ministers. The honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) referred to the destruction of cows and the wastage of cream. The honourable member's representations will be referred to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr Scully), who, I am sure, will investigate the matter thoroughly. The right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) asked a question relating to the operation of air services between Australia and the United States of America. Negotiations are being conducted at present and, in the circumstances, I am sure that the right honourable gentleman will appreciate that, at this stage, no disclosure can be made. The negotiations are proceeding smoothly, and 1 hope that the results will be satisfactory. I point out that, » in addition to Australia, the United Kingdom and New Zealand are concerned . with the setting up of this service. ever I can do to arrive at a satisfactory^ arrangement as early as possible will be' done. The right honourable gentleman also referred to dairy herds in the Gympie district of Queensland, and in parts'of New South Wales, and asked that an investigation be made by the Prices Branch. That matter will be brought to the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs. The honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) referred to applications for permanent service in the Royal Australian Air Force, and said that men had travelled at their own expense to undergo examination but had not been notified of the results of the examinations. There are difficulties associated with this matter which I am sure the honourable member and ex-servicemen generally will appreciate. The strength of the permanent air force has not been determined. conference is to take place overseas at which Australia's share of Empire defence and various technical matters will - be considered. A rapid decision cannot be made. The number of applications for appointment to positions in the higher ranks exceeds the number of such positions which are likely to be filled. It may be, for instance, that only half a dozen squadron leaders or flight lieutenants will he required, and there may be 50 applications for such positions, but not so many for lower ranks. I agree with the honourable member that an early decision is-desirable so that these men may know where they stand. The honourable member's references to property sales will be brought to the notice of the appropriate Minister. I agree with him that, as far as possible, the exploitation of men desiring homes should be avoided. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Turnbull) spoke Mr Drakeford. of the claims of people at Lake Boga for a share of buildings previously used as hospitals and workshops to be allotted to them. There seems to be a belief that the army or the Air Force controls such disposals, but that is not so. The service departments notify the Commonwealth Disposals Commission of any surplus materials in their charge, arid thereafter, negotiations for the purchase of these materials What- must be conducted with the commission. However, governmental bodies such as municipal councils, may make application direct to the Royal Australian Air Force or to the Army, in which event, the service department concerned will notify the Commonwealth Disposals Commission. I agree with the honourable member that individuals are also entitled to consideration in these matters, but I point .out that it was to prevent any suggestion of preferential treatment of individuals, or certain sections of the community, that the Commonwealth Disposals Commission was set up. If those who desire to obtain surplus goods would bear in mind that their applications should be made to that body, rather than to the service departments, much correspondence and dissatisfaction would he avoided.",47
148,Mr TUBNBUXL,Unknown,I thought that the A Minister of the service department concerned might make a recommendation to the Commonwealth Disposals Commission.,48
149,Mr DRAKEFORD,Unknown,"I am most anxious to assist in these matters, as are my colleagues in the Ministry, but if each of the service departments is to make an investigation, the work which has been entrusted to the Commonwealth Disposals Commission will be duplicated and the demobilization of servicemen will be delayed. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis) suggested that the parents and relatives of men in the. Air Force were fearful that insufficient maintenance work was being done on aeroplanes in use. I point out there have been 15,000 flights this year, and in only 29 instances was it impossible to complete a flight. That information should dispel the anxiety of parents and relatives. There are occasions, as I know from my own experience, when bad weather causes interruptions out of which anxiety, but the figures I have supplied should assure honourable members that soon as possible. every precaution is being taken to ensure the safety of aircraft. I trust that the honourable member will convey this information to those who have him on the matter, so that they will be in possession of the facts, instead to rely upon rumours disseminated by irresponsible persons.",48
150,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,What about the troops stationed at Rabaul!,49

POULTRY IITOOBTBY.",49
155,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, upon notice I. Is it a fact that British importers are anxious to obtain unlimited quantities of Australian poultry and turkeys this season? 2. Is it a fact that, under the present system of exporting poultry and turkeys to the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth Government acts as procurement agent - for the British Ministry of Food, which purchases the product and re-sells it to importers? 3. Does his department lay it down, under conditions imposed by the British Ministry of Food, that the birds must be inspected where they are killed and not on the farms? 4. Does this entail transportation of live birds by goods train to approved killing sheds ? 5. Is it a fact that rabbits' exported to the United Kingdom are packed on the farms and despatched by fast, trains to exporting centres? 6. Does this ensure that they - reach their, destination in prime condition?' ' 7. Is it possible for the practice followed in the preparation of rabbits for export to the United Kingdom to be adopted in the case of poultry and turkeys?",49
156,Mr SCULLY,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions ' are as follows:1. British importers are interested in obtaining supplies of poultry from Australia, but the Ministry of Food has requested that all shipments be effected on their behalf. 2. Yes. Following 'representations from poultry producers in several States, an approach was made to the British Ministry of Food, with a view to disposing of surplus fowls and turkeys. As a result, a contract was entered into between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth Government for the shipment of 1,000 tons of boiler fowls at is. Bd. sterling f.o.b. and 380 tons of turkeys at 2s. 4d. per lb. sterling f.o.b. The Ministry indicated that immediately these quantities were in sight they would be prepared to' negotiate for additional quantities. I understand that the British Ministry of Food utilizes the services of importers for subsequent distribution and sale of the poultry in the United Kingdom. 3. The Government of the United Kingdom specifies the conditions under which poultry must be prepared. These provide that the killing facilities must be hygienic and ample chilling facilities available to ensure of the product arriving in a satisfactory condition. 4. Yes. - 5 and 6. No. The regulations provide that rabbits must be packed at approved establishments. 7. No. Rabbits are trapped and gutted in country districts and transported to approved works for final inspection and packing. This procedure could not be followed in the case of poultry as the birds are shipped frozen and undrawn. In order to ensure that they are packed under hygienic conditions and comply with the specifications laid down by the Ministry, supervision must be exercised at approved killing premises. ROYAL AUSTRALIAN Ant FORCE : AJBCBAFT MAINTENANCE . .
