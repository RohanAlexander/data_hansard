1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Ot. H. Mackay) took the chair at 10.30 a.m., and read prayers. COAL-MINING INDUSTRY.",9
2,Mr HTJTCHIN,Unknown,"In view of the the threat toindustry and employment ordered by the State tribunal. throughout Australia which is involved in the contemplated stoppage of work the miners on the northern coal-fields of New South Wales, I ask the Attorneyis General whether the Arbitration Court can take any action to prevent the catasaction trophe, and, if so, whether the Governvery ment proposes to take steps arbitration machinery in operation?",9
3,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"The Government has read with concern the announcement to which the honourable member has referred. Industrial conditions in the coal-mining industry are supposed to be determined by awards under the Industrial Peace Act, which, however, has been almost dead letter for a considerable period, because owing to its terms it is almost inoperative. It can operate only by the consent of both parties in industry. The together ? mere existence of the act prevents the Arbitration Court from functioning generally in relation to the coalexplained, mining industry. That state of affairs sliould not be allowed to continue indefinitely, and the Government is noir considering the desirability of rethat act. pealing the Industrial Peace Act, in the honorablefurther order that the restriction it imposes upon the court may be removed.",9
4,Mr JAMES,Unknown,A recent award State tribunal reduced the wages of the Wonthaggi coal-miners by 20 'per cent. Does the Government propose to take any action to prevent a determination by a State authority from overriding an award of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court under the Industrial Peace Act?,9
5,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"A determination by a State tribunal cannot override any existing determination of a federal triship Board? bunal. If there be a valid and applicable award by the Commonwealth Arbithrough tration Court that will prevail, notwithtlie standing any award by a State tribunal. But the position as to many of the determinations under the Industrial Peace Act is obscure and ambiguous. This matter is at present engaging the attention of the Government, which considers that there should be no uncertainty as to the legality of determinations purporting to control an industry so important as' coal-mining..",9
6,Mr JAMES,Unknown,"A very serious position is developing in the industry, following reduction of 20 per cent, in wagesThe Wonthaggi miners are affiliated with the by miners of northern New South Wales, and it is reported that industrial trouble imminent. Because of the seriousness of the position will the Government take to clear this matter up? It is all well for some honourable members to to put the treat it lightly, but",9
7,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! Again I remind the honourable member for Hunter that the object of questions is to obtain, not to give information.",9
8,Mr JAMES,Unknown,"This 20 per cent, reduction in wages follows an earlier cut of 12^ per cent. As the Industrial a Peace Act provides for the convening of a. compulsory conference of the parties interested, will the Attorney-General take the necessary action to bring the parties",9
9,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"I shall certainly look into the matter. As I have already the position under the Industrial Peace Act is so difficult and obscure that it is doubtful that any good result could follow from any action taken under There is a risk that it might lead to still confusion. I assure member that the threatened trouble in the coal-mining industry is at the moment engaging the attention of the by a Government in all its aspects. EILM CENSORSHIP. "" THE FIVE-YEAR PLAN "" .",9
10,Mr DEIN,Unknown,"Will the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs inform the House why the Russian film "" The Five-year Plan "" was rejected by the Film Censor the usual process which precedes release of films for public exhibition.. It was viewed by the Chief Censor, who furnished a report to me. As the production was definitely political, its banning was considered to be in the best interests of the community.",9
11,Mr BEASLEY,Unknown,"""Was the film banned by the Government or by the Censorship Board?  banned by the Government upon the recommendation of its advisers. INVALID AND OLD-AGE PENSIONS. Mr BLACKLOW"" - Unde r existing legislation an applicant for an invalid or old-age pension is ineligible if his income, including pension, would exceed Â£78 a year. In connection with the proposed reduction of the pension will the maximum of the income allowable be amended?",10
12,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"Particula r attention will be given to that matter in the draftter ing of the-amending bill, which, I hope, will be introduced at an early date. TARIF F REDUCTIONS.",10
13,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"In view of the attempt by certain manufacturers to sreate an unemployment scare because of the House? small reductions in some customs duties, will the Acting Leader of the House read the evidence given by Mr Hutchinson before the Tariff Board, in the course of which he drew attention vestigating in ofdetail to the enormous importations of galvanized iron which were permitted by a former Minister for Trade policy and Customs because of a similar threat of unemployment?",10
14,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,I shall read that evidence if I can spare the necessary time. CENSUS.,10
15,Mr R GREEN,Unknown,"In connection with the census to be taken next year, will questions be asked for the purposes of ascertaining the number of persons then living who served overseas with the Australian Imperial Force?",10
16,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"I cannot say whether such questions are to be included. It desirable to make the ceusus form as simple as possible in order to produce an accurate general result, but consideraothers tion will be given to the honourable memis ber's"" suggestion. TRADE WITHT HE EAST.",10
17,Mr HOLMAN,Unknown,Will the Acting Leader of the House state when copies of the report of Mr Gepp on Australian trade with the Orient will be made available to honourable members?,10
18,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"Rone o copies will be available to honourable members. In order to avoid unnecessary expense the Government has decided provisionally that the report shall not be printed, but I understand that it is a very informative document, and if the House desires that it be printed, the Government will not oppose a private motion to that effect. CONTROL OF TRANSPORT.",10
19,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"I read recently in the newspapers a statement by the Minisfor the Interior, from which I inferred that the Commonwealth Government is seriously considering the formulation of a policy for the national control of transport. Is any definite proposal being considered by the Government and, if so, what progress has been made with it, and when is it likely to be submitted to",10
20,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,Unknown,"The policy of the Government was announced in the Prime Minister's policy speech, and a sub-committee the Cabinet is now in the transport problem with a view to formulating a which, I hope, will be disclosed to the House in the near future. AUSTRALIAN CURRENCY.",10
21,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I ask the Acting Leader of the House whether the Commonwealth Government prohibits Australian currency from leaving the Commonwealth, and whether that currency is negotiable in other parts of the world?",10
22,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"I am not aware of any such prohibition, but, of course, our currency is worth more in Australia than is elsewhere. When I went abroad recently no restriction was placed upon the amount of Australian currency which I and took with us. Australian currency negotiable abroad, but upon terms that are fixed by other countries. UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF.",10
23,Mr JAMES,Unknown,"I ask the Acting Leader of the House whether the Government is aware of the serious position that has developed on the coal-fields of New South Wales through the restriction of food relief to such an extent that grocers and other business people refuse to negotiate coupons issued hy the State Government. As starvation tends to drive men to acts of violence in order to procure food, and a serious state of affairs is fast approaching which may involve the Commonwealth, is the Government prepared to confer at this stage with the State Government with a view to adjusting the trouble?",11
24,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"Sustenanc e and other forms of relief are controlled entirely by State Governments, and intervention by the Commonwealth would cause embarrassment without producing any useful result. NEW GUINEA. AOM ra i STR ATi VE REVO KM .a .",11
25,Mr NAIRN,Unknown,"I ask the Minister Health if it is the intention of the Government to establish in New Guinea an executive council and also a legislatain tive council, and, if so, will he, at a suitscriber able time, give the House an estimate the cost likely to be incurred by, and incidental to, the establishment of such bodies?",11
26,Mr MARR,Unknown,The honourable gentlefor man will find the necessary information going tenants. in the bill of which I moved the first reading yesterday. CANBERRA HOUSING.,11
27,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"In view of the fact that in Canberra there are pracbe tically no houses now available to prosthe pective tenants, will the Minister for Interior consider the re-introduction a housing scheme on lines similar to that which had to be discontinued a year two ago owing to the lack of finance? him. Will the honourable gentleman make overtures to the Commonwealth Bank to that end ?",11
28,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,Unknown,The position in Canberra is now reaching the stage when some additional accommodaister tion will be necessary. Tenders are being called for the erection of a number of additional cottages. This was one of the conditions under which the Commonwealth relief grant was made. I shall be glad to give consideration to the suggestion made by the honourable member.,11
29,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,"In this morning's Canberra Times, there appeared a statement, under the smiling photograph of the Minister, to the effect that great building developments were about to take place in Canberra. Will the Minister inform the House precisely what new works are in contemplation?",11
30,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,Unknown," The report in question was a comparatively accurate summary of a contribution which I made to a debate last night. For details of the works mentioned, I refer the honourable member to the Hansard report of my speech. TRANSFER OF TELEPHONES. LIABILITY FOR ARREARS.",11
31,Mr LANE,Unknown,"Will the Postmasterfor General examine the regulations under which a telephone service is transferred from one subscriber to another, and ascerif it is a fact that the incoming subis held responsible for the liability of of the subscriber whose telephone he is taking over? This is a radical departure from a well-recognized business principle. Gas and electric light companies, for example, do not expect new applicants services to pay the arrears of outWill the Postmaster General see that the transfer of telephone services from one subscriber to another is put upon proper business lines?",11
32,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"In the conduct of the Postal Department, every care must taken to safeguard the interests of taxpayers, the public, and the revenue, the but if at any time the honourable member of has a useful suggestion to make with regard to any phase of the department's or business, I shall be glad to hear from 1 STEEL PIPES AND TUBES. TARIFF BOARD'S REPORT.",11
33,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"I ask the Acting Minfor Customs if his attention has been directed to the statement, in last night's Sydney World, by Mr J. L. Cook, dealing with the Tariff Board's report on steel pipes and tubes, to the effect that the board's recommendation was against the weight of evidence, and that certain evidence had been suppressed ? In view <of the seriousness of the statement made, - and in view also of the fact that the steel .pipe industry, when in normal production, would use 50,000 tons of Australian rsteel, 25,000 tons of coal and 5,000 tons of .zinc, will he investigate the charges made, and consider the advisability of referring the matter back to the board for immediate inquiry and report?  statement referred to, but I was informed of its publication in the World. Mr. Cook approached me some weeks ago and made a statement on similar lines. Following that interview I got in touch with the Tariff Board and was advised that the board did give consideration to the whole of the evidence submitted. However, in view of what the honourable member has said this morning, I shall make further inquiries, and if an application is made to me in writing, I will adopt the suggestion made by the honourable member. TOBACCO INDUSTRY.",11
34,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"I ask the Acting Minister for Customs if , in view of the conflicting reports regarding the sales of Australian-grown tobacco, and the fact that, although the selling season is now very far advanced, not more than one-half of the growers have even heard from the buyers, will he appoint an officer of his department to investigate the position without delay, so that the House may be informed of what is really happening ? I may add, by way of explanation, that I have received communications from many growers advising me that in some district's nothing has been heard from auy buyers and not one pound of this season's crop has been sold. I am further informed that in some districts which have been' visited by buyers, certain growers have been deliberately passed by",12
35,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! . The lionorable gentleman is now giving information instead of seeking it.,12
36,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"I wish to impress it upon the Minister that many growers are complaining that, because of their active association with the recent agitation to further the interests of the tobacco growing industry in this country, they are being victimized by the buyers, and to ask him if he will instruct one of his officers to investigate the position?  being closely watched by the department. Each week I am in receipt of reports of what is happening at head-quarters in connection with the policing of the sales of locally-grown leaf. Although some complaints have been made in the press, very few have reached the department. I am advised that already about 2,750,000 lb. of this season's crop has been sold at an average price of 2s. 3d. per lb. One report received a few days ago from the Tumut district stated that the price received was very low, some of the leaf, I understand, being sold for as little as rid. per lb.; but even including this figure the average price now being obtained is about 2s. 3d. per lb. I.shall give instructions for an early investigation of the position. CANBERRA ROADS. TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS.",12
37,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"As there have been several serious"" traffic accidents in Canberra recently, I should like to know if the Minister for the Interior will consider the advisability of closing a number of apparently unnecessary side roads, particularly those within a few hundred yards of Parliament House. If this is not done, it would seem that, on the law of averages, it will not be long before a member of Parliament is killed. That, with certain reservations, would be a terrible calamity!",12
38,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,Unknown,Con sideration has already been given to the matter mentioned by the honourable member. Some trees have been removed at road intersections where it was thought they were obscuring the view. The suggestion will be taken into consideration. NA SERVICES.,12
39,Mr STEWART,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Can the Postmaster General say what action, if any, has been taken to give effect to the recommendation of the recent federal railways confereuce regarding the joint performance of railways and postal work?",12

41,Mr LANE,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"I ask the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs if , in view of the monopoly established by the glass merchants in Sydney and glass manufacturers in England, Belgium and Germany, to control the sale of sheet glass, which at present is not regulated by the law of supply and demand, he will see that the former duties are restored?  member can furnish proof in support of his charge the matter will receive consideration. VENEZUELA NATION AL DEBT.",13
42,Dr MALONEY,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. Is it a fact, as stated in the press, that Venezuela, on the hundredth anniversary of becoming a State, has signalized the event by paying off the whole of its national debt? 2. If the Government lius no knowledge its departments of this great make inquiries and inform the House?",13
43,Mr LYONS,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"It is understood that, in 19S0, Venezuela commemorated the onethis hundredth anniversary of dependence by paying off the its external debt only, the amount being approximately Â£1,000,000 in sterling.

45,Mr FENTON,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"The practice of making postage stamps available to the public per medium of licensed vendors has not been discontinued. The decision to withdraw commission payments to vendors was reached only after the fullest consideration, and the Government is not prepared to revert to the system previously in operation.

ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC. In Committee of Supply: DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR. Proposed vote, Â£175,000.",13
50,Mr SCULLIN,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Yarra) [11.5] - All honourable members must be anxious to pass the Works Estimates, so that the relief which the proposed expenditure will give may be provided as speedily as possible to persons out of work. Unemployment is now so widespread that it constitutes a very grave problem to Australia at the present time. It would be unreasonable to say that it is for the Government to solve that problem. As I have said before, no one government can solve it. It will require the co-operation of all governments, and of private employers as well, even to ameliorate the position. In saying that, I am a good deal more generous to this Government than honourable members opposite were to me and my government when we were in office. They then constantly hurled across the chamber at us the gibe that the volume of unemployment was growing, and had grown enormously since our assumption of office. They quoted the statistician's figures in support of their statements, but they neglected to add what every one knew, that the times were calamitous and the whole economic system seemed to be crashing about our ears.  honourable member say when he was in Opposition ?",14
51,Mr SCULLIN,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"I said none of the tilings of which I am now complaining, but I shall mention some of the things that were said by the Assistant Minister and his friends during the last election. If ever there was an election fought on the promise to restore a job to every man -' out of work, it was the last election.",14
52,Mr ARCHDAXE PARKHILL,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,We are doing it.,14
53,Mr SCULLIN,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"The Minister for the  ready to quote, as a means of discrediting the last government, the statistician's figures regarding unemployment.",14
54,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,When waa that?,14
55,Mr SCULLIN,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"When the honourable member was in Opposition, and had less responsibility than he has today. If honourable members will study the statistician's figures now, they will realise how far the present Government has fallen short of honouring its promises. The figures today show a record percentage of unemployment. During the election it was pointed out by honourable members opposite that 28 per cent, of the members of trade unions were unemployed. That was a very high percentage, aud I do not deny that the position was serious, nor do I deny that the percentage of unemployment increased during my term of office. That, however, was not because of anything done by my Government, but in spite of what we did. Honourable members opposite charged us with raising the tariff, and with thus contributing to unemployment, but most thinking persons are now beginning to understand that, had we not increased the tariff, unemployment would have been very much worse in our time than it was. The party opposite covered the hoardings of the country with repetitions of the statement that, if it were returned to power, jobs would be found for everybody. At the present time the Government professes to be most anxious to keep men in work, and to find jobs for those who are unemployed. A certain amount of money is being provided for new works, but this is only a drop in the bucket compared with what is needed. As the Prime Minister stated in his budget speech, we must look to private industry for the greater part of the relief needed to solve the unemployment problem. The Government professes to be hastening on with new works to relieve unemployment, but, at the same time, it is destroying the country's power to absorb unemployed workers by reducing the protective duties under which industry has been operating. I draw the attention of honourable members to the appeal published in the press this morning by the Prime Minister. Already notices of dismissal have been issued to hundreds of employees in factories throughout Australia because of the reduction of duties, and the Prime Minister has appealed to the manufacturers to stay their hand. The suggestion is that the Government has not definitely made up its mind, and that an appeal to the Tariff Board by the manufacturers might, still be successful.",14
56,Mr CAMERON,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,How much bluff is there in the manufacturers' attitude?,15
57,Mr SCULLIN,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"If the honourable member were one of those threatened with dismissal he would realise that the situation was serious enough. The Prime Minister asks the manufacturers not to dismiss their employees, stating that the reduced duties will not operate until after they have been agreed to by Parliament. In the meantime, if they feel aggrieved, they can approach the Tariff Board again. These ditties have been considered by the Tariff Board, and have been reconsidered by the Government, and the Government now proposes to reduce them to the 1928 level. This is what the Prime Minister stated in his appealAlthough a resolution has heeti tabled in the House of Representatives under which it is announced that Parliament is to be invited to reduce duties in certain cases, these reductions of the tariff do not become operative until such time as the tariff has passed both Houses of Parliament. The Attorney-General (Mr Latham) made a similar statement yesterday, saying that that was an effective answer to the manufacturers who had threatened to dismiss employees. As I understand the position, every one of the new duties which have been tabled except those which reduced the Scullin tariff below the 1928 level, operated the moment they were introduced. If that is so, this House has been seriously misled by the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General.",15
58,The CHAIRMAN,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"The right honourable member must realise that, even though the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General may have misled the House in regard to tariff items, this is not the proper time to discuss the matter. The Estimates for new works and buildings are before the committee.",15
59,Mr SCULLIN,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"I do not propose to pursue that subject at length; but I claim that I am entitled to draw attention to the Prime Minister's appeal to employers of labour to give work, and not to dismiss men because of any reduction of the tariff. Are employers to take his statement as a declaration that the Government will back down or, at least, stay its hand ? If not, will the employers be justified in continuing to make goods 'which will be of less value when the flood gates are opened to the products of cheaplabour countries? More unemployment has been created during the last few months by the Government's policy than will be compensated for by the employment which these new works will give. I want these works to be proceeded with in addition to other works. I drawi the atteution of the committee to the annual report of the Chief Inspector of Eactories for Victoria in which he shows that, despite the depression and the shortage of money for industry, 221 new factories employing an additional 5,700 workers were established in Victoria in 1931 as a direct result of the increased' duties. His statement that in Melbourne, Geelong, Ballarat, Warrnambool, Castlemaine, and other places, woollen mills and textile factories were busy, particularly in the latter part of the year, shows that only when the .local stocks of imported goods became low did the Australian manufacturers begin to gain substantial advantage from the tariff of the Scullin Government. Since the present Government assumed office, many hundreds of employees engaged in the manufacture of matches, glass, and iron and steel have been thrown out of work. Yet the Government says that its policy is to help the unemployed to find work.",15
60,The CHAIRMAN,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,I cannot allow the right honourable member to proceed further along those lines.,15
61,Mr SCULLIN,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"The Attorney General should let this committee know the facts. I ask him to say specifically whether these reduced duties are actually in operation. My opinion is that, with the exception of those duties which are lower than the 1928 tariff, the reduced rates are already in operation, and that' the blow has already fallen on the Australian industries concerned. I support those works estimates, but I repeat that they provide only a small measure of relief compared with that which would have been given had the Government not tampered with the tariff, thereby making it impossible for our industries to retain the workers employed in them.",15
62,Mr LATHAM,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [11.17] - The total of the estimates for additions, new works, buildings, &c, is Â£963,000, of which Â£231,500 is for departments and services other than business undertakings and territories of the Commonwealth; Â£655,000 is for business undertakings, ancl Â£76,500 for territories of the Commonwealth; The actual expenditure under those heads last year was Â£832,622. The new Estimates, therefore, provide for an increase of .Â£130,378. Estimates for the year 1932-33 will lie taken in detail, and should honourable members desire further information concerning the various items, the Minister concerned will be glad to supply it. The right honourable the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) referred to the difficult subject of unemployment, and the relation'of governments to unemployment. I think that he will do me the justice of admitting that, in both the last Parliament and this Parliament, I have consistently contended that no government, of itself, can handle the Unemployment problem satisfactorily. So far as there is an answer to that problem, it will be found in a sound general policy rather than in relief provisions.",16
63,Mr SCULLIN,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,It is a sound policy to protect Australian industries.,16
64,Mr LATHAM,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"In Australia particularly, a sound Â«policy in relation to finance, tariffs and industrial conditions, will, if properly administered, give our citizens a better chance to obtain employment than is possible otherwise.",16
65,Mr RIORDAN,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,That is very different from what the honourable gentleman said in 1928.,16
66,Mr LATHAM,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"I have said the same thing throughout. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Scullin) said that the reduced duties now actually in operation, and the further reductions, contemplated by the Government, had led to manufacturers throwing large numbers of men out of work. As to the facts, I direct the attention'of honourable members to the statement of the Assistant Minister for Trade and Cus ister explained that, in cases in which the result of the proposed reductions would be to bring the duties down to, or below, the rates which operated in 1928, the reductions operated immediately, but not below the 1928 level.",16
67,Mr SCULLIN,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,That is not what the Prime Minister says in this statement; nor is it what the Attorney-General himself said yesterday.,16
68,Mr LATHAM,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,The position was accurately set out yesterday by the Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs.,16
69,Mr SCULLIN,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"He said that some duties had been reduced, and some had The not; he'gave no accurate information.",16
70,Mr LATHAM,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"The Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs drew a distinction between those reductions which brought the duty down to or below the 1928 tariff and those which did not. That, at any rate, is the position. As to the dismissals and threatened dismissals mentioned by the right honourable gentleman, the only case of which I have knowledge is that of a company which is engaged in the manufacture of glass. Honourable members were given the facts in relation to that company yesterday. .",16
71,Mr SCULLIN,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"They heard certain statements, which were alleged to be facts.",16
72,Mr LATHAM,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"I shall give the facts now. Eor some time the Customs Department had been conducting regular weekly investigations into the industry concerned, at its factory. About ten days before the tariff schedule was introduced a customs officer, in the course of his investigations at the factory, was informed that the management proposed to close down the works at an early date for five or six weeks for the purpose of reconditioning, or altering in some way, a tank used in the manufacture of clear sheet glass. That information was repeated the day before the tariff schedule was introduced into this Parliament. Later, when the action already announced by the company was taken, certain newspapers attributed it to the Government's policy in relation to the tariff. I can hardly think that the general manager of the company, or its board of management, would associate themselves with such propaganda. Dismissals, or threats of dismissals, may be bona fide, or they may be propaganda intended to exercise pressure on the Government in the hope that it will respond. Should it be found that the effect of an alteration of duty is gravely to reduce employment in an industry which is suited to Australia, the Government, realizing that the employment of our citizens is of fundamental importance in our social economy, will certainly reconsider it. The Government desires to act in the best interests of the community as a whole; it will consider uot only the effect of a duty upon a particular set of men but also upon employment generally. So far as the particular proposals made are concerned, the right honourable gentleman is really going a - little too far when he suggests that the Government has been engaged in an indiscriminate slaughter. There is not .the slightest justification for a charge, particularly when we reflect that some of the duties which have been reduced were the highest in the world, and that in no case has a duty been reduced other than ou the recommendation of the Tariff Board after a more exhaustive inquiry than auy honourable member in this chamber - could possibly make. The duties recommended are regarded by the Tariff Board as sufficiently high to protect the Australian industries concerned, on the basis of Australian conditions. In all these matters the Government will be guided by the facts of the case, as ascertained by the best authority available for the purpose. It will undoubtedly consider the effect on employment of any reduction of duty both in the industry particularly affected and in relation to the community generally.

74,Mr LATHAM,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"I was afraid of that; but I wanted to set out clearly the attitude of the Government on this important matter.  may be that the .Government's desire to provide money for the relief of unemployment is the reason why these estimates provide for an increase of Â£130,378 on last year's expenditure. If the latitude which has been given to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) and the Attorney-General (Mr Latham) is to be extended to all honourable members, I desire to draw attention to the Tariff Board's report, which completely refutes the views expressed by the former. The board states that high tariffs create unemployment, and that every increase in the rates of duty has been accompanied by an increase in unemployment. The present Government came into office pledged to do its best to reduce unemployment in this country, and to that end it applied its mind to the tariff.",17

The Government is proposing to expend Â£142,000 this year, which is, I understand, Â£50,000 more than was expended by the previous Government. It seems to me that the river Murray scheme is one of the greatest sinks for public money that we have ever had in Australia. It is surpassed only by Canberra. About Â£10,000,000 has, up to the present, been expended on the river Murray works. There is no use for the water that is being stored in the Hume reservoir. There are 500,000 acre feet of water impounded at Lake Victoria in South Australia. In the river Murray, which is locked to its mouth, is impounded an immense quantity of water. The total area of irrigated land in South Australia is 30,000 acres. In New South Wales, there are stored millions of acre feet of water, and the total area of irrigated land is 90,000 acres. Neither of those States wants additional water at the moment. Victoria is practically in the same position. The Hume reservoir may be necessary in 50 years' time, hut it is not necessary today.",17
77,Mr HILL,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,I disagree with the honourable member.,18

80,Mr GIBSON,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"There are no channels. The only benefit from, the Hume reservoir will be obtained by those persons who have land which will, in future, be irrigated from that source. The cost of construction has been out of all proportion to the value to be derived ' from it. Five complete plants costing about Â£100,000 each have been erected for the building of the locks and weirs in the river Murray. Those plants belong to the State Governments, which have the right to write off the cost of them in the construction works. Naturally, the cost of the plants is being written off to the extent of about Â£30,000 or Â£40,000 for each lock and weir. By the time that the whole of the locks are completed, the State Governments will have unloaded a charge of Â£500,000 on to the Commonwealth Government, which is the fourth partner in the building of the whole of the locks and weirs. A certain amount of revenue is derived each year from shipping on the river Murray-about Â£10,000-bu t the Commonwealth Government is not entitled to any share of it . Yet it has to stand for all time the cost of maintenance on the whole of the weirs and locks. This is a national work, and the people of Australia are finding the whole of the money that is being expended upon it. I can quite understand the representatives . of South Australia and Western Australia protesting against the expenditure of Â£10,000,000 on this scheme.",18

82,Mr GIBSON,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Thos e States have to share in the eost of construction and maintenance for all time, and yet obtain no result from the scheme. The people of Victoria and New South Wales are helping to pay for these works, although the owners of the land which will be irrigated by the scheme contribute nothing to the cost, excepting by way of ordinary taxation. The Government is going a step too far in finding this money at the present time. It should hold its hand and simply make provision for safeguarding the work already completed.",18

85,Mr FORDE,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Capricornia) [11.36] I do not agree with the previous speaker that it is unwise for the Government to spend this money on the river Murray works. My regret is that in time of prosperity the governments of Australia expended on public works large sums of loan money which would have been better expended in giving relief to the unemployed at a period of depression such as that through which we are passing today. The governments of Australia, instead of withholding the construction of necessary public works until a return of prosperity, should put them in hand immediately, so as to give some relief to hundreds and thousands of our * workers who cannot today be absorbed in industry. Our secondary industries, if allowed to develop along proper lines, could employ many of these men. Some honourable members will say, "" Put them on the land"". But what is the use of putting them on the land to produce commodities for which there is no market?",18
86,Mr MARTENS,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,There is a glut everywhere.,19
87,Mr FORDE,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"That is so. This Government made all kinds of specious promises on the hustings. It said that if returned to power unemployment would soon be at an end. This morning the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) quoted figures showing that unemployment had increased since the advent of this Government, and had now reached record figures. The Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons), speaking at. Launceston before the elections, said that with the return of the United Australia Party to power, things in Australia would begin to improve, that there would be no necessity for further cuts in the wages and salaries of public servants or pensions, and that there would be immediate relief for the unemployed. Unfortunately, when this Government was returned to power no action was taken to give effect to its promises. Many new works could be put in hand by the Government to give relief to both skilled and unskilled workmen. The work of painting the post office buildings throughout Australia could be proceeded with. Other works that are being held up could be put in hand. We were told that with the restoration of confidence money would flow and that, plenty of credit would be available to enable these works to be undertaken; but the position is that the Government is adopting the policy of inaction which was instituted by the previous Nationalist Government. The following . statement, which appeared in this morning's Canberra Times, is a gross misrepresentation :Regret was yesterday expressed by the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) that one or two firms, apparently affected by the decision of Government to reduce tariff rates, missing employees.",19

This scare of unemployment has been raised time after time. If the sworn evidence of Mr Hutchinson is true, just prior to the embargo being placed on galvanized iron, 10,400 tons of that material were imported into this country.

I quite appreciate the difficulty which confronts the Chair. Honourable members opposite are continually raising the scare of unemployment, in an effort to obtain special favours. We should have some clear and definite statement from the Government as to the past and proposed expenditure on the river Murray works. When it was suggested that the river Murray should be locked, I strongly supported the proposal, believing that it would afford an opportunity to open up huge areas of productive country. The scheme will not benefit Western Australia, Tasmania or Queensland, but members from those States have supported it in the belief that it would be to the advantage of Australia as a whole. The first estimate of the probable cost was Â£4,600,000. I believe that it has already cost over Â£10,000,000j and that the latest estimate of the ultimate cost is over Â£14,000,000.",19

The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Gibson) the present provision. has shown the smalluess of the area of land that will be available for irrigation. It is an undoubted fact that land that has beensubmerged is more valuable than that which will be irrigated, at least in Victoria. We ought to have some indication as to what the ment proposes. Unless it is shown that further expenditure is imperative for the protection of work that has completed, I am strongly inclined to oppose the vote.

That work, in adthat dition to the construction of weirs and locks Nos. 7 and 8, should, in normal circumstances, be completed by the end of the financial year 1933-34. Any deferment of the work would add to its cost. Commencing with the year 192728 the estimates of the River Murray Commission were reduced by the Loan Council or the Governments concerned, and the suggestion was made that each year, payments on account of land resumption should be deferred. Every attempt was made to defer those payments, but the stage is now being reached when that can no longer be done, and it has been found necessary to include in this year's programme an amount of Â£220,000 under that heading. The wall of the Hume weir is at prehas sent being raised to the height necessary to impound 230,000 acre feet of water.

I think that I am entitled to remind him that for many years he was a member of an administration which spent large amounts on these works. If he held the view that that expenditure was not warranted, he ought to have been able to use some influence in the direction of having it reduced.

We are certainly looking ahead, and are providing an additional quantity of water for some of the best land in the world. The result will be to bring substantial wealth to this country. The honourable member for Corangamite pointed out that each State had installed a separate plant, and alleged that one plant would have done the work equally as well. That is true. Efforts were made to repair such extravagance, but the internecine jealousies of the different States concerned prevented that from being accomplished. An act to relieve the situation by providing for the operation of only one plant was passed by this Parliament and a couple Â©f the State Parliaments, but I understand that it was defeated in the Legislative Council of New South Wales. Therefore, this Parliament cannot be blamed for what has happened in that direction. The contracting parties are shouldering their proportion of the depreciation, which has been spread over the whole of the construction, and covers a certain period of years. I urge the committee to realise, first, the immense national conception of the work; secondly, its undoubted value to Australia in the comparatively xear as well as the distant future; thirdly, the expenditure that already has been incurred; and, foiu'thly, the urgent and clamant necessity for providing at least sufficient to make; reproductive and valuable what has so far been done.

At the same time, however, I believe that, on account of the small amount of money at the disposal of the Government, and that is likely to be available to other governments that probably will succeed it for a period of years, the operations should be suspended for a time. If the object of the Government is to provide employment, the proposed expenditure should be allocated to works that will be more productive and of greater utility to the people in the immediate future. If the present Government has Â£142,000 at its disposal, I suggest that that amount should be made available for the construction of sewerage works in some of the main cities in various States. It is a disgrace to Australia that some of its important cities are unsewered, or have incomplete systems, while in the United States of America towns of half the size are thoroughly equipped in that' respect.

It is time we developed a water For generations we have had railway conscience, and the result of it been to direct the trade of this continent towards the capital cities. We now have the world's most gigantic centralization evil. We have always assumed that we occupy an arid country, and that experiments in inland irrigation and navigation were foreordained by Providence to fail. But we know from what has been done in Egypt, that the scope for water conservation in Australia is not appreciated. This country has vast engineering possibilities for water conservaAion and interior navigation. One of our problems today is undoubtedly due to the - complete collapse of the railway systems. .Lines have been laid chiefly through undeveloped country. These show a great loss, and that is very largely responsible for our financial problem. That we have proceeded on wrong lines is proved by the fact that, after all these years, we are practically in a condition of national hankraptcy. The Murray waters scheme represents the first constructive effort by a government of Australia to develop a national water - conscience, and to make use of rivers which have been hitherto shamefully neglected. It is said that the undertaking .has developed into a much larger work than was originally anticipated. We are told that already Â£8,000,000 has beeu - expended upon it, and that at least a further Â£8,000,000 will be required to - complete it.

As to the use of the water, the theory is, of course, that if we provide the water, the population will follow it just as it was argued years ago, that if railways were provided in undeveloped country, the people would go there. Unfortunately, we have built too many railways. We must remember, in thinking about all these projects, that we are building, not only for today, but for tomorrow. We have been too restricted in our outlook. Many people imagine that if a work will not yield a return immediately, it should not be put in hand. But we are building Australia for the future, as well as for the present.

The Minister has said that it is necessary to spend the Â£143,000, now proposed to be provided, to safeguard money already spent; but that is not the way to attain success.

126,Mr THOMPSON,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"What I said was that Egypt did not go half way with big undertakings of this kind, but finished the works that were put in hand.  misinterpreted the honourable member's statement. I certainly gathered that he thought that Australia was backward in regard to water conservation schemes. As a matter of fact, Victoria has a greater mileage of water channels for both irrigation and domestic purposes than, posiaibly,. any other territory of its area in the world. She is certainly in a leading position in. that respect. Seriously conflicting opinions have been expressed this morning regarding the desirableness of spending more money on the Murray water scheme. In the circumstances I suggest that the Minister should agree to the postponement of the further consideration of this proposed vote until he is able to place before us detailed information on the whole subject. The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Gibson), who was for some time Minister in charge of the Murray water scheme, has expressed the opinion that we are trying to conserve more water than we can possibly use in the immediate future, and that, therefore, the expenditure of additional money on the work is not justifiable at present. The honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill who was also the Minister in charge of these works for a considerable time, remarked by interjection while the honourable member for New England was speaking, that we had the water in the tank, but no taps through which it could If be turned on. I take it that the honourable member meant that there were no channels through which the additional water could be run from the reservoir to the land for which it was intended, which is some distance from the reservoir. The present Minister has told us that it is considered necessary to spend the amount provided on the Estimates in order to safeguard the money that has already been spent. The views of these three honourable gentlemen are therefore seriously diverse, and as each of them is in a position to express an authoritative opinion, it will be apparent that there is justification for my suggestion that further consideration of the subject be postponed until fuller and more detailed information has been submitted to us.,. I , therefore, appeal to the Minister to adopt the course which I have suggested.",24
127,Mr BEASLEY,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"West Sydney) [12.29]. - I desire some information regarding the expenditure of certain sums proposed to be provided for war service homes purposes. The vote uuder this heading for 1931-32 was Â£42,000. The Minister will remember that a week or two ago I introduced to him a deputation on this matter consisting of the secretary of the Bricklayers Union. Of the Â£42,000 voted in 1931-32, Â£24,000 was expended, leaving a balance of roughly Â£18,000. The vote for 1932-33 is Â£33,000, and I should like to know what work is likely to be carried out with this amount, and how far it will meet the requests that have been made from time to time. The members of the organizations associated with the building trade have experienced a very lean period during the last two years. As a matter of fact their circumstances are of such a character that it will probably take them a considerable time to recover; but that is an aspect of the matter which need not be discussed at this juncture. Quite recently a rumour was current in the Newcastle district that the Government proposed to increase its ) , activities in the matter of additions and repairs to the war service homes. That would be of great benefit to those engaged in the building trade, and relieve to some extent the unemployment which now prevails. The representatives of the building trade organizations asked me to .approach the Minister to see what could be done for them. He was good enough to receive the representatives of the bricklayers' union, but he said he could not .announce just how far the Government was prepared to make employment available in the direction suggested ; but that he would do all he could to secure the largestamount possible, and that when a grant was available, it would be distributed among the districts most needing it. I should like the Minister to say if the Â£33,000 now provided is in addition to the Â£17,000 or Â£18,000 left unexpended from the previous year. If that is not so, is it uot possible to utilize that Â£.18,000 as well as the proposed vote? Perhaps the Minister can say how many requests have been received and to what - extent they can be met by the money available. The amount provided for a continuation of .the river Murray water scheme has been freely discussed this morning. Although I represent a city electorate I join wholeheartedly with those who have .advocated the expenditure of public money for irrigation purposes and works of that, kind. In these days, when there is such a lot of talk about settling our surplus city population on the land, everything possible should be done to encourage rural development by providing for water supplies for irrigation and other purposes in districts where it can be profitably utilized to increase production. Although I represent an industrial constituency, the early part of my life was spent on irrigable land. I realise the importance of water conservation and irrigation schemes, particularly when such schemes assist in making the land productive. I am unable to understand the attitude of the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr. Gibson), who as the ministerial head of the department controlling this scheme once took a pride in its development up to the stage it had then reached. I hardly think it fitting that he should now suggest that any extension should be curtailed, particularly when the objects in view are the effective development of the land and the providing of employment. Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [12.35] - As a city member, I join with the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) in his contention that the provision of water schemes has a direct bearing upon increased production and employment. We should not adopt a short-range policy such as that suggested by the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Gibson).",24
128,Mr GIBSON,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"My contention is that we should meet the requirements of the country as they arise. Mr E. J. HARRISON - Wate r conservation should be seriously considered by the National Parliament, and I shall support any proposal submitted to provide more adequate water supplies, particularly in country areas. A short-range water conservation policy, such as some suggest, is detrimental, not. only to rural areas, but also to the capital cities. It was recently stated that if the City of Sydney experienced an exceedingly dry spell, its water supply might be in danger. In the absence of adequate conservation schemes, the capital cities of Australia, as well as outback centres, may be endangered. While the present depression is upon us, works of a reproductive nature should be seriously taken in hand. What more effective way could be suggested for spending money than the construction of reproductive water schemes? The construction of immense dams would provide employment, and at the same time remove the danger of a water famine. Moreover, an ample supply of water increases development and production. I was surprised to hear the honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson) express some doubt as to the wisdom of the course which is being followed.",25
129,Mr THOMPSON,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"I am not opposed to the scheme. I merely asked for full information on the subject. Mr E. J. HARRISON - I was also surprised to hear the Deputy Leader of  the views he did, because this scheme, when completed, will be of unquestionable benefit to primary producers. Honourable, members ""who have Australia's interest at heart should wish to do all in their power to increase primary production. They should use every endeavour to forward this great scheme of water conservation.",25
130,Mr HUNTER,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Maranoa) [12.3S] Ever since I have been a member of this Parliament, the utility of the Murray River waters scheme has been discussed when provision has been made in the Estimates for the expenditure of thousands of pounds to conrplete a portion of the work, which, it was said, was urgently needed. In the first instance, we were told that this scheme would not cost more than Â£3,000,000 or Â£4,000,000; but I think the iatest estimate for the whole work is Â£14,000,000.",26
131,Mr GJBSON,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"It is Â£16,000,000.",26
132,Mr HUNTER,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"The latest figures I have seen give the amount as Â£14,000,000. Although the original estimate was Â£4,000,000, the estimated total cost is now approximately Â£16,000,000. This shows what vast sums of money have been expended, and that reliable information has not been given to Parliament and to the people. The estimates of so-called experts have beeu grossly exceeded. Every now and then additional sums are required to secure, it is said, an existing asset. Similar statements were made in connection with a certain work in Victoria, where a wharf was to be built on dry land, and money would have had to be spent to bring water to it so that ships could utilize the structure. Reproductive water conservation schemes are an urgent necessity, but I think honourable members will agrr>e that Â£14,000,000 or Â£16,000,000 would have been found' sufficient dam practically the whole of the rivers in the western districts of Queensland and New South Wales, thereby adding to the productive capacity of the country. Before works of such an expensive character are embarked upon, a thorough investigation should be conducted by some competent authority into their cost and utility. The Bruce-Page Government appointed a Development and Migration Commission to fully inquire into such developmental undertakings and supply the Government with all the information that was required. Some time ago a similar water scheme was advocated in the northern part of Queensland, which it was estimated would cost approximately Â£3,600,000. The government of the day appointed a commission, which cost a few thousand pounds. It reported that the expenditure was not justified, as the land could be put to a better purpose, and the Queensland Government was saved a very large expenditure. If that work had been undertaken it is only reasonable to assume that the estimated cost would; have been greatly exceeded. There should be a full inquiry by unbiased' experts before works of this nature are undertaken.",26
133,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Darling Downs) [12.43] - As one who. was associated with the Murray waters scheme at its inception, I feel that there is a good deal of misunderstanding concerning the whole 'undertaking. Eor instance, it has been suggested that this scheme was launched without proper consideration having been given to it ; but such suggestions show utter lack of knowledge of what actually occurred. For some time prior to the present scheme being adopted there was considerable controversy between South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales over the Murray waters question. It was felt that the best use was not being made of the greatest of our Australian rivers, and in order to obtain independent and reliable information the services of an expert from the United States of America were obtained to determine the best way to utilize the waters of what has been termed the Nile of Australia. South Australia insisted upon its navigation rights, and New to South Wales and Victoria wished to preserve sufficient water for irrigation purposes. Ultimately the interested parties were brought together by the Commonwealth agreeing to make available Â£1,000,000, and the present scheme evolved. Reference has been made to the extent by which the original estimate of the scheme which was prepared by an American engineer has been exceeded. At the time the estimate was prepared it was impossible to foresee how costs would increase. It was realized, however, that the scheme would be of tremendous value to Australia, and provide an insurance against drought.",26
134,Unknown,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Sitting suspended from 12.1,5 to 2.15 p.m. Sir LITTLETON"" GROOM - The estimated cost of the complete Murray River waters scheme, as first contemplated, was given at Â£4,663,000 in the Murray River agreement dated the 9th September, 1914. Of this amount the Commonwealth was to provide Â£1,000,000 and the States of New South ""Wales, Victoria and South Australia Â£1,221,000 each. ""With costs as they were at that time, the scheme presented to Australia one of the most promising that could be embarked upon and a consideration of drought periods established the wisdom of its acceptance. It was, however, only the advent of the Commonwealth with its proposal to provide Â£1,000,000 which brought the three States together after they had been fightcourse. ing over the question for nearly half a century. After the war, construction work was resumed and I was president of the commission for three years from March, 1918. ""We were really then just commencing operations and had the task of adjusting equities of the administration between the different States. The scheme provided for the appointment of a commission consisting of an expert engineer from each of the contracting States with a Commonwealth expert and presided over by the Commonwealth Minister of ""Works. A very capable secretary was appointed. No engineers could have had greater experience in such matters than the four who were selected. They were faced with a difficult problem, the construction of reservoirs, locks and weirs in a country with special features of its own. They did not have huge rock formations to aid them. They bad to provide weirs across rivers running through vast alluvial beds into which deep foundations had to be sunk. But I do not desire to go into further detail. After the war, costs increased aud conditions changed in several aspects. Eor instance, the navigation aspect originally emphasized by South Australia has been somewhat modified, State railways having been built up to the Murray valley enabling the carriage of produce previously carried by river steamers to be undertaken by the railways. Present conditions have to be grass land. taken into account in dealing with this scheme. In ray opinion, the governments concerned were quite right to build the Hume reservoir without delay. We have not, as other countries have, huge mountains covered with snow providing for our rivers a steady flow of water all the year round. We have to build artificial reservoirs to maintain a flow of water when required for irrigation. The Hume reservoir is essential for that purpose. The complete construction of the scheme, of course, must depend on the financial condition of the country.",26
135,Mr GIBSON,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"And on the country's requirements. SIR LITTLET ON GROOM - Of But it is highly desirable that the irrigation areas should be brought into a state of production at the earliest possible moment so that a return for the money already spent upon these works may be obtained. That is a matter for sound administration, and I am sure that it is in the minds of the Minister and the commission. Settlement should certainly be extended. This scheme will provide a water supply for a large area in all seasons, and will be a great insurance against drought. One of Queensland's problems today is to conserve fodder to meet its periodic droughts. Unfortunately, Queensland has not a great river like the Murray to provide it with irrigated areas on which fodder crops can be grown, but there are possibilities for irrigation in that State. The Murray River scheme will prove a guide to the States generally. Irrigation has\ not been carried on extensively in Australia. In 1929-30, the latest returns available, the irrigated areas of the Commonwealth were as follow:Acres New South Wales .. 126,321. Victoria .. 586,577 Queensland 26.282 South Australia .. .. 40,002 Western Australia .. 4.043 Tasmania .. <i,(>!>3 Total .. 770,818",27
136,Mr GIBSON,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Most of that area is Sir LITTLET ON GROOM - The use io which the irrigated areas were put is shown in the following table:Crop. Cereals .. 170,796 Lucerne, grasses and- green forage . . . . 426,171 Orchards and vineyards . . 128,296 Root crops, market gardens, and other crops .. Total .. 770,818 Those figures are not satisfactory when we take into consideration our climatic conditions. The Murray River scheme must be considered from a national point of view, and although the other States have had to find some of the money for this undertaking, I am sure they have ""done so readily. The less we think as States, and the more we keep national ideals before us the better for all concerned. Party divisions should not cur across national ideals.",27
137,Mr HILL,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Echuca) [2.23] - As a representative of a constituency bordering on the Murray River, and as one who is deeply interested in irrigation and knows something about it, I rise to express my disagreement with the honourable member for - Corangamite (Mr. Gibson). The honourable member suggests that the amount provided on the Estimates this year for the Murray River works should not be spent, and that the works are very much ahead of the times.' The scheme ""provided originally for 26 weirs ancl locks on the Murray River, and nine on the Murrumbidgee River, together with the Lake Victoria storage, and the Hume Dam. at a total cost of Â£4,663,000. The reservoir was to be situated a little above the junction of the Murray River and the Mitta River, and was to have a holding capacity of 1,000,000 acre feet. Some years later, it was considered advisable to construct the dam below the junction of these two rivers and to increase its capacity to 2,000,000 acre feet, which would have made the reservoir the second largest in the world. ",28
138,Mr HILL,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"It is large enough with its present capacity of 1,250,000 acre feet to supply the immediate requirements of Victoria, South 'Australia, and New South Wales, but unfortunately, Victoria has not taken advantage of the water impounded. I was not able to ascertain Total during the lunch adjournment whether a Acres. surface level outlet had been provided at the Hume dam. I am of opinion that the only outlet today, other than the bywash, is through the huge needle valves that discharge into the river. There is 45,555 not a single place on the river where water can be diverted by gravitation, other than Torrumbarry. It is suggested thatwater should be ""diverted at Yarrawonga, over SO miles below the Hume dam. When I was Minister for Works, it was suggested that an outlet should be provided at the Hume dam, in order to divert the water at the highest possible level. If that outlet has been made, it is the duty of Victoria and New South Wales to provide water channels. No better reproductive work could be .undertaken, assuming that the outlet has been provided, than to construct those channels. They would enable the whole of the area between the dam and Echuca to be irrigated. It was suggested at one time, that the main take-off should be at the dam itself, that a main channel should be run for some distance through Victoria, with branches off it, and that an aqueduct should be run across the river at a high level to keep water always >above the surface level in New South Wales. Apparently that is not going to be done, with the result that a diversion weir is 1 being put in at Yarrawonga. If there is one thing more than another which will provide employment on reproductive work, it is the construction of channels in these areas. I know that something like 500,000 acres of good irrigable country has been surveyed in New South Wales and Victoria on both sides of the river Murray between Albury and Echuca. It is useless to say that that water cannot be used to advantage. At times, there is a slump in dried and soft fruits, but we have to view the matter nationally. Generally speaking, large areas of cultivable land are necessary, particularly during dry years, and times like the present when wheat is sold at such a low price. With the land, water, and sunshine available in the Murray valley, we should go in for a different class of farming; one might call it a landed peasantry, embracing all varieties of mixed farming. I am confident that there is room in the Murray valley for more people than there are at present in Victoria, provided that water is made available and that reasonable prices obtain for our products.  get those prices?",28
139,Mr HILL,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"There are world markets today for practically everything that our farmers can produce, provided that some of their many burdens are removed. If the Japanese were in possession of that area, with its water storage of 2,000,000 acre feet, the Murray valley would be populated by 2,000,000 or 3,000,000 people, all living like fighting cocks. I do not want our people to live under the conditions favoured by the Japanese, but I point out that we have close to hand delightful surroundings, suitable land, and plenty of sunshine and water; everything that is necessary for the man on the land. Yet we are doing nothing with all that splendid irrigable country. It is like possessing a tank filled with water, and not having a tap to the tank. The original estimate for the river Murray 1,000,000 acre feet dam and locks and weirs was Â£4,633,000, while the cost to date is Â£8,837,000, almost twice what was expected. I believe that before the work is finished, including locks and weirs on the Murrumbidgee, it will run into Â£14,000,000 or Â£16,000,000. We cannot do better than go in for water conservation. Certainly, I represent a constituency bordering on the river Murray, but I venture the opinion that had our rainfall for the past couple of years not been above normal, the farmers in my constituency would have been prepared to shoot the Government if it had not consented to go on with these works. It is all very well, while have an abundance of rain, to say that irrigation is unnecessary. But immediately we encounter dry years, everybody wants to know why the government did not put in the channels. I have tried my utmost to persuade the State Government to proceed with the channelling, but if the outlet is not also provided, whole effort will be wasted, so far as the land immediately below the weir is concerned. I have no hesitation in saying that much of the work has cost a good deal more than it should. Each weir and lock constructed by South Australia cost approximately Â£100,000 less than those carried out by Victoria and New South Wales. New South Wales constructed a weir and lock at Wentworth which I had the pleasure of inspecting some time after I became chairman of the River Murray Commission. I was surprised to find a substantial brick house, an attractive garden laid out with beautiful lawns, rose and citrus trees. The adjoining buildings were all beautifully painted, and there were roads about the place-bu t nothing had been done in connection with the weir although those people had been there for about eighteen months. Eventually the weir was finished and, speaking from memory, it cost well over Â£100,000 more than identical weirs and locks immediately below it, constructed by Victoria and New South Wales. Again, the weir and lock at Torrumbarry, the only one at present taking out water by gravity, cost in the vicinity of Â£350,000, or Â£100,000 more than those constructed by the South Australian Government.",29
140,Mr BEASLEY,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,The conditions may have been different.,29
141,Mr HILL,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"If they differed they favoured Victoria and New South Wales, for in South Australia the river is very much wider. The explanation is that South Australia had a standardized plant. It was American, but it worked well. A ll the parts were interchangeable, and, as two or three plants' were working simultaneously, the South Australian Government was able to do the work much more economically than it could be done in New South Wales or Victoria. The weir we constructed by the Victorian authority at Mildura cost something in the vicinity of Â£369,000, again well over Â£100,000 more than the South Australian average. I entirely support the Government in this matter. I believe that the money will be well spent, but I do hope that something is being done to provide an the outlet at the Hume dam. If that is to be done, it is up to the River Murray Comniission to make representations to the Victorian Government to proceed with the channelling at the earliest possible moment. The diversions which are being put in at Yarrawonga are at the expense of Victoria and New South ""Wales, but the water will not come to the surface until it is eight miles below Yarrawonga.",29
142,Mr GABB,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Angas) [2.37] - I know that, as the amount is on the Estimates, the item will be passed. The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Gibson), stated that there were 30,000 acres of irrigated land in South Australia, excluding grass. I point out that this scheme is also used for irrigating country in Victoria and New South ""Wales. If honourable members had my experience they would encourage every effort to serve water. Eor some years I navigated a motor launch along the river Murray. In times of flood I was continually ing huge logs, while during droughts, I had to roll my pants up and seek channels with 2 feet 6 inches of water, through which I could push the launch. I contend that we want all the water conservation that we can afford. I shall vote for this amount without any qualms of conscience. I am surprised that any honourable member should challenge a vote for the conservation of water. Had we spent more money in that direction instead of building the Federal Capital, the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Brisbane Town Hall, and the Adelaide. Railway Station, Australia would be in a much better position today.",30
143,Mr COLLINS,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Hume) [2.42] - I am glad that honourable members have made up their minds to vote for this item. My only regret is that the amount is not three times as great, so that more employment could be given through these agencies. I agree that we have no greater insurance than that of water conservation. The governments that were responsible for the construction of the Burrinjuck Darn, the Hume weir, and the ""Wyangaia dam beyond Cowra will have the thanks of posterity. The people of the present day will not reap the full benefit of these national works, which will, in later years, obviate moving stock from otherwise dry areas. If we foster the idea of water conservation, add to the storage already available, we shall do something to justify our existence in this Parliament. I approve of the proposal of the Government.",30
144,Mr GIBSON,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Corangamite) [2.43] When I referred to this matter I did not think I would create such a stir. I have been accused by several members of being opposed to the conservation of water for irrigation purposes. I am not. What I endeavoured to point out was the extravagant waste of money under this scheme. I should like to see the Government keep a storage of water to meet the demands, and as development proceeds, construct the weir to a higher level. At present there is about 250,000 acre feet in the Hume reservoir. If there is a demand for 500,000 acre feet, by all means build to a higher conlevel. But why should we go on spending millions of money to provide 2,000,000 acre feet of water when it cannot be used ? dodg- When the budget is before the House I propose to direct attention to the serious waste of money that has been incurred in connection with this huge scheme. At present I shall merely add that no honourable, member is more anxious to see the development of irrigation in Australia than I am.",30
145,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Warringah-Minister for the Interior) [2.44] - There are two points on which I should perhaps have given some information at an earlier stage. I am constrained to bring them before honourable members, particularly in view of the remarks by the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Gibson). The money which he declares is being wasted is in respect of a storage of 2,000,000 acre feet of water. The proposed expenditure is for a storage of 1,250,000 acre feet, a much more economic scheme than if the storage were 2,000,000 acre feet. If the latter were the case the honourable member would have some real grounds for his contention, as that quantity of water could not possibly be used for many years, except at great expense. The alterations to this scheme have not been adopted without the most complete preliminary investigation. The Premiers Conference realized the dimensions to which the expenditure was attaining, and two inquiries have been held by the Developand ment branch and by the Governments concerned. The scheme now being carried out was recommended by the committee of investigation, agreed to by Commonwealth and State Ministers in conference in 1930, and confirmed by their Governments last year. The best advice available to the Government is that the work now being proposed is the quickest means of deriving a real benefit from the scheme. The total area of land to be submerged under the 1,250,000 acre feet proposal will be 30,000 acres, whilst the land irrigated already is approximately 175,000 acres. In New South Wales alone, at least 250,000 acres will be irrigated, and probably that could be increased to 5,000,000 acres by gravitation if the water were available. In Victoria, the increase would be almost equally as great, whilst considerable expansion is possible in South Australia. Those figures - show the mammoth character of the scheme that has been undertaken by this Parliament. Works of this nature will make for the greatness of Australia: The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A . Green) spoke of employment. works do provide employment, and the people in country districts are as much entitled to have work as are those who would be employed on the sewerage schemes which the honourable member says should be substituted. He asked why we should continue production when there is already a glut of commodities. That contention, carried to its logical conclusion, would lead to the stoppage of all production. The present glut will not continue for all time. W it h the facilities th.at are being provided this country will produce huge quantities of commodities that will be sold overseas, even where there is no market for them today. Every scheme of any magnitude has been attacked by Jeremiahs and small-minded objectors. Some undertakings which were most bitterly attacked have been remarkably successful, and are already proving in adequate. I repeat that the works in connection with the Hume reservoir are based on expert advice, and are designed to safeguard the money already expended and yield immediate benefits.",30
146,Mr GANDER,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Reid) [2.50] - Al though the Minister for the Interior (Mr . Parkhill) says that there glut of production, it is an unfortunate-fact that our people are not able to get enough of the foods and other commodities produced in their own country. The honourable gentleman castigated somehonorable members for not having vision,, and said that in the past there had been men who had taken the courageous view that Australia must advance, and had by their f a it h achieved great things. I agree with him. Not long ago, Mr Lang enunciated a plan which was called repudiation.",31
147,The CHAIRMAN,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL, Order!,31
148,Mr GANDER,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"The honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson) said that we on this side of the chamber do not represent country interests. But the Labour party has had a country policy for many years. I remember when the honourable member for Martin (Mr Holman), at that time Labour Leader of New South Wales, used These to go into the country districts and in his inimitable fashion, tickle the ears of the farmers with the golden promise of the Labour platform. He spoke of water conservation schemes which would make the desert to blossom like the rose, and visualized the day when the wife of the small farmer would do her washing and ironing with electrical appliances. Rural audiences applauded these sentiments aud cheered the speaker. The Labour party has still a policy to improve the lot of rural communities. There are other reasons why we desire to develop the country. Capitalism is crumbling, and the time is not far distant when the present social system will be changed. We believe that we should proceed with water conservation schemes throughout Australia, in order to make life easier for the people when we take control of the real workers' Parliament.",31
149,Mr FRANCIS,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Moreton-Assistant Minister) [2.55] - The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) asked a number of questions concerning the appropriation of Â£33,000 for expenditure in connection with war service homes. U n fortunately it is not possible this year to is _ a provide for the building of additions to these homes. The proposed expenditure is to be allocated in the following manner:Charges by Municipal Councils in respect of kerbing, guttering, road-making, & c , in connection with land held and unsold . . Fees, rates, taxes, &c., payable in respect of reverted homes .. .. Provision of sewerage and payments of amounts outstanding - for sewerage and roadmakiiig and in respect of reverted homes .. Adjustment of applicants' equity in respect of reverted homes resold .. Repairs and renovations principally to reverted homes.. Interest to be allowed on sinking fund deposits . . Miscellaneous items - I am hopeful that, if the financial position improves, it may be possible to make some provision for the building of additions to homes because an extraordinary number of applications have been received by the department. Many purchasers and occupiers find that, owing to the increase in their families, tlieir existing homes are too small. The Government appreciates the problem which confronts them. It is anxious to assist them, at the earliest opportunity, and when funds are available provision will be made to meet urgent cases. 1, like the honourable member for West Sydney, am most anxious to do all in my power to relieve unemployment, and I very much regret the unfortunate condition of the building trade, but I can assure the honourable member that, when the financial position improves, I shall be glad to do all that is possible to make provision for the extension of existing homes.",31
150,Mr ROSEVEAR,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Dalley) [3.0] - I am pleased that the Minister has given details of contemplated expenditure in respect of war service homes, because that is the information which I have been seeking for some time. I notice that Â£1,200 is set aside for the adjustment of applicants' claim for their equity in homes of which they have been dispossessed. In view of what has happened honourable members should seriously consider the advisability of expending Â£18,000 on ref airs and renovations to reverted homes, am afraid that much of this expenditure Â£ will be so much money wasted. Under a recent amendment of the act a certain proportion of this expenditure is chargeable against the soldier who has been dispos641 sessed. This, I maintain, is unfair, because in not a few instances homes upon which expenditure to the amount of Â£50 3,260 or Â£60 has been incurred to make them fit for re-sale, have been allowed to stand unoccupied, and, as a consequence, have fallen into the hands of vandals. 2,176 I cite the North Belmore settlement as a case in point. Much damage has been 1,200 done there to renovated homes which were unoccupied. I therefore question the 18,200 wisdom of expending Â£18,000 on repairs to these homes this financial year if the 7,443 80 commission is not going to accept some responsibility for their effective maintenance. If the Government spends Â£100 on repairs to a home, and debits a proportion of the amount to the returned soldier who has been dispossessed, what chance has he of securing a reasonable proportion of his equity'if the commission allows the home to .stand idle and at the mercy of vandals? Would it not be better, as has been suggested by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley), to expend this money on additions to existing occupied homes ? Apparently, no effort is being made to rent reverted war service homes at a reasonable rate. It would be much better to allow returned soldiers to remain in occupation, even if they are unable to continue their payments, than allow them to get into the hands of vandals. I have here a list, supplied to me by the Railway and Tramway Returned Soldiers Association, of homes upon which money has been expended, and which, as I have explained, have been allowed to fall into disrepair again. The list contains full details of each property; it shows the approximate date when repairs were effected, and gives an estimate of the damage done by vandals. The figures are impressive, and suggest that it would be better to allow returned soldiers to remain in occupancy rather than to dispossess them and spend Â£18,000 on repairs. Proposed vote agreed to. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE. Proposed vole, Â£41,592.",32
151,Mr JENNINGS,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"South Sydney) [3.3] - I direct attention to the item Â£10,030 for expenditure on construction of buildings, hangars, workshops, barracks and earthworks and preparation of aerial routes and landing grounds. I presume this covers expenditure on the Mascot aerodrome, Sydney. It has been sugr gested in Sydney that Mascot is not suitable, in view of the probable future developments in aviation, and it has been urged that other areas in the vicinity of Sydney should be developed for that purpose. I should like to know if the department is satisfied that expenditure on the Mascot aerodrome will make it thoroughly suitable for all future requirerients.",33
152,Mr BEASLEY,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"West Sydney) [3.4] ' I desire some information about the item Â£8,980 for arms, armament, and ammunition. The public generally, more particularly those who are about to suffer at the hands of this Government through reduction in wages or pensions, or loss of employment, will not look upon this proposed expenditure with approval. During the Scullin administration the present Postmaster-General (Mr Fenton) was sent abroad at the expense of the Commonwealth taxpayers to attend a disarmament conference at Geneva, and more recently the Attorney-General (Mr. Latham) also represented this country at another disarmament conference. Their mission cost our taxpayers a considerable sum of money, and, notwithstanding the attitude of the people towards disarmament proposals, this Government is now setting aside a considerable sum for arms, armament, and ammunition. not appear that there is any intention to deal with disarmament in a serious manner. I cannot allow the item to be passed without drawing public attention to this matter, and particularly the attention of those who are called upon to suffer a reduction, in the miserable pittance they receive, namely, the old-age pensioners. The sum of Â£1,000 has been allocated for the provision of aircraft, equipment, and plant, including spare parts, machinery, tools, ordnance and engineering supplies and ammunition, and the preparation of aerodromes for the Royal Air Force. It would be interesting to know where this money is to be spent. Is it to be at Point Cook, that sink for the taxpayers' money? Much interesting information could be obtained by holding an impartial inquiry into the administration of Point Cook, and the expenditure in connection with it. We know that Rolls-Royce engines were brought out from England, and, after lying at Point Cook for some time, were sold for Â£30 each. "" Wizard "" Smith bought one of them, and later used'it to break a speed record in New Zealand. Two thousand, seven hundred pounds is set down for the construction of buildings, hangars, workshops, barracks and earth works, and preparation of aerial routes and landing grounds. Where is this work to be done, and for what purpose? For the acquisition of a small arms factory at Footscray, Â£19,153 is provided. The committee is entitled to know something about that matter also. I feel that the Defence Department is oue which should be closely watched. It was always inclined to spend more than the country could afford, even in prosperous times, aud this applies much more in times like these.",33
153,Mr JAMES,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Hunter) [3.10] Instead of spending this money on defence, it would be more fitting if we allocated some of it for the relief of people in need. We might distribute some of the military clothing held in store for the benefit of those who at present are not adequately clad. Money is spent every now and then sending delegates from Australia to disarmament conferences in Europe, but, in the meantime, we are arming ourselves to the teeth. In the circumstances, our representation at It does disarmament conferences is a farce. This country ought to give a lead to the world, and scrap its arms to show that it is genuine when it subscribes to the doctrine for the outlawing of war. We should then be able to spend the money formerly allocated to defence on the relief of unemployed persons and their dependants. This department, which specializes in the training of youths in the noble art of killing, recently turned 80 unemployed persons out of the Maitland camp so that training operations might be carried on. At the present time, large stocks of military equipment are lying in store, providing a banquet for moths and weevils. It would serve a much better purpose if it were distributed amongst the unemployed.",33
154,Mr LANE,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,It could be distributed amongst members of the .New Guard.,34
155,Mr JAMES,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"The honourable member seems to be obsessed with the idea of the "" Boo "" Guard. For my part, I sliould favour casting members of that organization over the Gap, or throwing them from the Sydney Harbour bridge. The honourable member for Barton (Mr. Lane) The CHAIRMAN. Order!",34
156,Mr JAMES,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,The honourable member is prepared to invoke the law to punish one section of the community,34
157,The CHAIRMAN,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,The honourable member is out of order.,34
158,Mr JAMES,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,But will allow another section to go free even though it also consists of disruptionists.,34
159,The CHAIRMAN,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,The honourable member must respect the call for order.,34
160,Mr JAMES,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,The honourable member for Barton was interjecting.,34
161,The CHAIRMAN,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,I called the honourable member for Barton to order.,34
162,Mr JAMES,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,You would need a mallet to stop him from interjecting.,34
163,The CHAIRMAN,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"When I called him to order, he ceased to interject, so the honourable member for Hunter (Mr. James) should not have continued replying to the interjection.",34
164,Mr JAMES,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Most of those who are unemployed today are willing and anxious to work, but are unable to find anything to do. This is due to the system under which we carry on. Those in possession of the necessaries of life not sell them except at a big profit. Nature has lately been most bountiful in Australia. There is enough for all, but many cannot obtain access to what they need. I know some people who cannot even leave their homes because they are not decently clad, yet we in this House are asked to vote money for defence. For what, purpose? Is it so that we may protect those who are at, present exploiting the people?  the Estimates for defence would provide about 5d. for each man out of work.",34
165,Mr JAMES,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"I am speaking of the military stores which could be given to the unemployed, many of whom are today practically naked. Time after time. I have appealed to the Government to show some practical sympathy with these unfortunate people, by making available to them surplus military equipment, and, - although it has done - something in that direction, it has, iD so doing, benefited itself more than the unemployed, because otherwise the clothing would have had to be carted to the incinerator. It was practically useless. The Government has also altered the policy of making clothing available to members of Parliament for distribution; instead, State Governments are now entrusted with its distribution.",34
166,The CHAIRMAN,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,The honourable member must confine his remarks to the subject before the Chair.,34
167,Mr JAMES,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"For the Royal Australian Air Force the sum of Â£3,850 is to be made available for the provision of aircraft equipment and plant, and for other purposes. That money should be transferred to the vote for civil aviation ; for surely it is better that it should be spent in something useful, such as the development of our trade and commerce and the expeditious transport of people aud goods, than in preparation for bombing towns and murdering their inhabitants. On many occasions I have urged that money be made available for the development of an aerodrome at, Cessnock. only to be informed that no money is available for the purpose. Not even for the clearing of the ground would the will Government advance funds, and, consequently, the local authorities used a portion of the last unemployment gram for that purpose. Even .from the point of view of the defence of the country, civil aviation should be encouraged. Expenditure in that direction would not only assist in the development of the country's trade and commerce; it would also provide a well-trained body of men for defence purposes in case of need. In my opinion, Â£41,592 is too great an expenditure for defence purposes, especially when we reflect that, in order to provide that sum, unfortunate invalid and old-age pensioners and expectant mothers are to be deprived of a portion of their allowances. The Government feels that it is safe in demanding over Â£1,100,000 from these people, knowing that without any organization to protect them they are defenceless. They cannot even have their representatives in the corridors of Parliament House, engaged in lobbying in their behalf.",34
168,The CHAIRMAN,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Order ! honourable member may make passing reference to the reduction of pensions and the maternity allowance, but he may not discuss those subjects.  sented in the vote for the Department of Defence would mean only about 9d. to each pensioner.",35
169,Mr JAMES,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"That may be; but 9d. here and 9d. there makes up the total of over Â£1,100,000 which they will have to provide. The pensioners will be called upon to contribute to the grant of Â£1,000,000 to South Australia. The most callous individuals in the world would not treat the poor and helpless in a worse manner than this Government proposes to deal with them. The actions of the Government are both a tragedy and a disgrace. I shall record my vote against this item.",35
170,Mr ROSEVEAR,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Dalley) [3.21] This is the first opportunity I have had in this chamber of discussing matters associated with our naval, military, and air forces. So long as I have a voice, I shall raise it against a continuation of the accursed system which brought about the devastating war of 1914-18. It is remarkable that while the Goverument is using the pruning knife ruthlessly in other directions, and preaching economies to those least, able to bear them, it should provide Â£4.1,592 for new works to build up a system of navy and army expansion in this country. Still more remarkable is the fact that of that sum over Â£27,000 is for [14] arms and ammunition, to be wasted, as I indicated last night, in an amateurish attempt to build up an army of school children to defend this country. Over Â£41,000 is to be spent in preparation for another war, and only Â£3,000 for the purpose of assisting mentally afflicted ex-soldiers. What a commentary on our boasted civilization! I suggest that it would be better to spend Â£3,000 in preparation for another war, and Â£41,000 on the men who were maimed and otherwise afflicted in the last war. Those ultrapatriotic individuals who urge that we should prepare for war, lack a sense of proportion. Another remarkable - thing is that the Government is prepared to The feed, clothe, and shelter a soldier, in order to make him good fodder for cannon, while hundreds of men who returned from the last war are left to walk the streets of our capital cities in search of food. The Government boasts of its patriotism; it would show a truer patriotism if it spent a little more money in supplying food to those who came back maimed and crippled from the last war than in preparing for another such adventure. What is the use of preaching disarmament, and spending thousands of pounds in sending representatives to peace conferences, if at the same time we do oiir utmost to build up another army, navy, and air force with which to start another war? It is'time that the people were awakened to the situation. The Government preaches the gospel of peace. Why does it not ptit theory into practice, and expend the money now earmarked for military purposes in directions better suited for the conditions under which ""we are living today? The Government is adopting a hypocritical attitude by sending its delegates overseas to a peace conference, ,and immediately they return, expending Â£41,000 in preparing for another war.",35
171,Mr FRANCIS,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Moreton-Assistant Minister for Defence) [3.26] - The only reply that I wish to give to the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) is that I have no desire to occupy the time of the committee in dealing with the subject that he has raised merely in order to give him a further opportunity to indulge in propaganda. It is the sacred obligation of .every honourable member to ensure the defence of this country. This Government, as did the last Government, is taking every opportunity to bring nearer the day of disarmament throughout the world. Until that time arrives this Government will continue, as far as the depleted funds of the Commonwealth will permit, to honour its sacred trust and maintain the defences of this country. The * honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) asked for an explanation in regard to certain items. First of all, he wished to know what was covered by the item ""'arms, armament, and ammunition "" under Division No. 5, and he incidentally expressed the desire that there should be no provision for munitions at all. Yesterday, he made a' strong appeal for continuing the operations of the' small arms factory at Lithgow, which was established for the manufacture of rifles and munitions. The honourable member cannot have it both ways, and I shall be glad to know what he really desires in regard to the expenditure on munitions. The item in question provides for an increase of only Â£3.780 on last year's vote. It covers signal cartridges and munitions generally for various types of guns, such as eighteen-pounders and howitzers, smoke shells and other miscellaneous stores required for this year's operations. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) strongly objected to the small provision made for civil aviation. He claimed that the whole of the vote was more or less for the Air Force. The honourable member will find, in Divisions Nos. 6 and 7 that the total provision for the Royal Australian Air Force is Â£3,850, and for civil aviation Â£10,280. The expenditure under Division No. 6 for the provision of aircraft equipment and plant, including spare parts, machinery, tools, &c., is only Â£1,000. That is really to make provision for emergency expenditure on urgent purchases which may be vitally necessary later in the year. Item No. 1, under Division No. 7, provides for an expenditure of Â£2,700 towards the cost of construction of buildings, hangars, workshops, barracks and earth works, and preparation of aerial routes and landing grounds. This expenditure applies Ilr. Frannis. mainfy to Point Cook and' Laverton. At Laverton, it is proposed to provide a ventilation system in the paint room to afford some protection from the fumes arising from the paint spray. It is also proposed to erect a pyrotechnic store at Laverton. The proposed expenditure for works at Point Cook is Â£2,340, the chief item of which is Â£1,500 for the erection of an explosives store; the next mdst important Undertaking being the undergrouiiding of a power line leading to headquarters. The provision for works at Richmond, New South Wales, is Â£2,100. Item No. 1, under Division No. 8, provides for ah expenditure of Â£10,030 towards the cost of construction of buildings, hangars, workshops, barracks and earth works, and preparation of aerial routes and landing grounds. A sum of Â£2,466 is to remain unexpended. While many new works are required, the present financial stringency has involved drastic curt-ailment of the new proposals, those covered by the remaining vote of Â£7,564 being vitally urgent and essential. The honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Jennings) referred to the Mascot aerodrome, and wished to know what provision had been made for landing grounds in Australia, and whether it would not be possible to abandon Mascot Aerodrome. Before any provision was made for the Mascot aerodrome careful inquiries were made by the Public Works Committee and all branches of the air services. The unanimous decision was that the work should be proceeded with. The proposed vote provides for only part of the requirements. Each year the Mascot aerodrome is nearing perfection. Work is being undertaken in progressive stages as funds permit. The aerodrome has been considerably improved, and this year's vote provides for further improvement. It is proposed to erect an office building at a cost of Â£200, and to provide a public enclosure, fencing, paved taxi-way to public enclosure, and roadway through public enclosure at a cost of Â£2,200. The work of completing the filling of public enclosure, the filling for hangar sites on south side of public enclosure, drainage, &c. will cost Â£1,600. The surface treatment adjoining taxi-way will cost Â£150, and the extension of paved taxi-way in front of public enclosure, Â£500. Other proposed works and services are as follows:Archerfield, Queensland-Concret e tarmac for proposed new private hangar Maylands, Western Australia-Variou s works . . Western Junction, Tasmania-Brain ago, &c. Darwin, Northern Territory-Exten sion of area for overseas flights . . Mount Isa, Queensland-Extensio n of prepared area MCKinlayj Queensland-Extensio n of landing area .. Winton, Queensland-Extensio n of landing area by filling in washouts Longreach, Queensland-Lengthenin g and widening of run-way and topping existing portion of run-way . . 1,370 Charlcvillc, Queensland-Extensio n of prepared area",35
172,Mr RIORDAN,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,That is money spent.,37
173,Mr FRANCIS,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"I am glad to hear that interjection, because last night the honourable member took the stand that the vote for the Defence Department was excessive.",37
174,Mr RIORDAN,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,Not this vote.,37
175,Mr FRANCIS,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"I think that I have replied to the queries of honourable members regarding the defence vote for new works, buildings, &c. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) has for the third time referred to the Rutherford military encampment. I assure him that that matter .has been carefully investigated by the department. The State Labour and Industry Department assures me that ample provision has been made for the accommodation of 39 single men ancl one married couple who are domiciled there. The equipment is being checked and returned to the department, and particular"" satisfaction is felt at the manner in which the department has met the needs of the unfortunate unemployed in that district. A change would not have been made had not the barracks been required for defence purposes. I hope that the vote will now be agreed to.",37
176,Mr HOLLOWAY,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Melbourne Ports) [3.36] - I find it very difficult to vote against this provision, because it embraces work for some of our unemployed and expenditure on what is absolutely essential to the development of this country. I refer to civil aviation. But I am sorry to find that we are asked to agree to an increased expenditure on f purely military operations. That makes it very difficult for me to vote for it. 475 Last night I listened carefully to the very fine speech of the Attorney-General . . 2,405 (Mr Latham) in connection with in180 ternational conferences that are wrapped up with this particular question. There 250 can be no questioning the honourable 250 gentleman's knowledge of the many important conferences that have been held .. 100 since the war. He must agree with the fundamental principle underlying the 200 whole of the operations of the League of Nations. It is hoped that eventually international peace will be achieved as a result of the maintenance and extension 150 of social justice in all countries. Clause w e ll 13 of the Peace Treaty distinctly lays it down that there can be no international peace that is not founded upon social justice. In the Estimates that we are now discussing, the military side is exaggerated at the expense of the breaking down of our social justice. It is unfortunate that in one set of items we are tearing to pieces and ruining some of the best social legislation in this country, and, at the same time, increasing the grants for purely military matters. That is what I object to. If it was intended only to maintain what was already in existence, and to add to the comfort of the people concerned, it would not be so bad. I was informed, in answer to a question that I asked this morning, that the Government is awaiting the result of the Disarmament Conference before definitely deciding upon its defence policy. One is placed in an awkward position when one believes that there is some hope of sooner or later achieving international peace, and that that is not possible except by the extension of the principle laid down in clause 13 of the Peace Treaty, which calls upon all countries not only to maintain' but to increase their social legislation so that others will be envious of it and endeavour, to emulate it, thus placing it on. an international basis. I object to the proposal to expend an additional Â£3,000 on arms and ammunition,"" because it does not involve any work for the development of Australia, but simply means the production of more cartridges to be' blown away each year. I should like the different items to be separated, so that I might vote against the increases and support the developmental work which is necessary.",37
177,Mr BEASLEY,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"West Sydney) [3.40]. - The Minister need not have been so generous as to reminnSms of the remarks that I made last night concerning the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow. I have no wish to retract anything that I then said. My aim was to enable that factory to continue a class of work in which, I think, it should be engaged, rather than in the making of arms and ammunition, namely, the manufacture of combs and cutters. Auy attempt to convert this and similar institutions from the sword to the ploughshare should be encouraged by all parties in this chamber. I witnessed such a transaction at Krupps works, Essen, in 1926. Huge workshops, which had been used for purposes of war, were, in a few months, converted to purposes of peace to meet the agricultural requirements of Germany and adjacent countries.",38
178,Mr HOLLOWAY,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,The result is that she is today the greatest exporting country in the world.,38
179,Mr BEASLEY,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"It is a. sight that I shall never regret having witnessed. My efforts will always be directed towards conversions of thatcharacter. I am certain that the men at Lithgow would stand behind any one who was prepared to take up that attitude. They do not desire to produce what will be used for the purpose of destroying their own either in Australia or abroad. Our aim will always be to develop those industries that are of real use to the people of this country. I urge the Government to expand the operations of the Lithgow fac' tory along the lines that are now being followed. Let its activities be extended so as to embrace the production of wireless equipment, for which it is eminently adapted. I shall seize every opportunity that presents itself to speak and work for the utilization of these factories in such a way that they will be of real use to the people of this country.",38
180,Mr MARTENS,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Herbert) [3.43] - I regret that no provision has been made for the establishment of an aerodrome in a convenient situation at Cairns. This work has been recommended on more than one occasion by the Cairns City Council, and other local bodies. An aerodrome has been established there, but at high tide it is completely submerged by water, with the result that a plane cannot land unless it does so on property belonging to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, twelve or fourteen miles distant from the city. The desirability of having an aerodrome at Cairns is indisputable. Recently, because no communication waf available, two men died on the Batavia rjold-field before a doctor could reach them. Had there been an aerodrome at Cairns, rapid transport would have been available, and that would not have happened. It is regrettable that no provision has been made for this very important centre, which is the outlet for an enormous area of back country that is a considerable distance from the coast. Rapid transport is possible only by aeroplane because of the poor type of bush road that is met with. I know that one officer of the department recommended the establishment of an aerodrome seven or eight miles out of Cairns; but because of the lack of funds, no action in that direction could be taken. The same gentleman then suggested, as a suitable one, the present site of the so-called aerodrome. On his recent visit to North Queensland, Sir Charles Kingsford Smith landed at Cairns. Subsequently, he proceeded to the district of which I understand he is a native, or in which he spent the early part of his life. When he returned to Cairns on the following afternoon, he class, found that the aerodrome from which he had taken off was under water, and he had to continue further southward. It would be better to provide services of that kind than to produce material for the destruction of human life. Proposed vote agreed to. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH . Proposed vote, Â£1,000.",38
181,Mr BEASLEY,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"West Sydney) [3.45]. - I notice an amount has been set down for the construction of launches and vessels. On the occasion of a deputation to the Acting Minister for Trade and  the honourable member for Martin (Mr. Holman), and supported by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) and other members whose electorates are in the neighbourhood of Cockatoo Island Dockyard, the Minister was urged to circularize departments with a view to placing as much work as possible with the dockyard. I can speak from personal knowledge of this governmental activity, because when I was a member of the Scullin Government, it came under my jurisdiction, and I endeavoured to see that, whenever possible, repairs to launches and similar work for various departments were entrusted to the dockyard for the purpose of providing employment. I now urge the Minister to consider this matter favourably. Proposed vote agreed to. Proposed rotes (Repatriation Department Â£3,000, Department of Commerce Â£10,908, Commonwealth Railways Â£75,000) agreed to. PoST.MASTlilli-GENEBAl/s DEPARTMENT. Proposed vote. Â£580,000.",38
182,Mr ROSEVEAR,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Dalley) [3.47] - In cluded in the vote "" Postmaster-General's Department, Â£5S0,000,"" there is an item of Â£50,000 for National Broadcasting service. What are the reasons for spending that large sum out of revenue?",39
183,Mr FENTON,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Maribyrnong-Post master-General) [3.48] - All money to be spent by the Australian Broadcasting Commission will represent the licence-fees contributed by listeners-in, and a fair portion of the Â£50,000 referred to is for the erection of five regional stations for the purpose of improving the broadcasting service, particularly in country areas. All the other items included in the departmental vote will result in the provision of employment.",39
184,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,Where will the new stations be located ?,39
185,Mr FENTON,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Wor k will be proceeded with in practically all the States. If the five new stations are not completed during the current financial year, they will certainly be commenced. At least one will be erected in Tasmania, and construction work will proceed in all the other States except South Australia. Mr M . CAMERON - Why except that . State?",39
186,Mr FENTON,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Because one of the finest broadcasting stations in Australia has recently been completed in South Australia, and it is giving excellent service throughout that State and even beyond its borders. Almost all the preliminary work in selecting suitable sites has been carried out by expert engineers, but I am unable to say precisely where the stations will be located. The object, however, is to meet the needs of those areas which are not well served at the present time.",39
187,Mr NAIRN,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Perth) [3.49] - This vote shows an increase of about Â£137,000 over the sum expended last year. It is impossible from the information supplied in these Estimates to determine exactly in which directions increased expenditure has been incurred.",39
188,Mr LATHAM,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,All the figures are set out.,39
189,Mr NAIRN,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,But not in detail. The Postmaster-General (Mr Fenton) should state why substantial increases are proposed at a time when ordinarily we should expect a decrease in the cost of governmental administration.,39
190,Mr FENTON,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Maribyrnong-Post master-General) [3.50]' - During recent years,- postal expenditure has been considerably curtailed. The department would be pleased to be able to carry out new works in Western Australia and other States, but it has been prevented from doing so owing to the financial stringency. When loan money was plentiful, sums amounting to Â£3j000,000 or Â£4,000,000 prowere sometimes authorized for new works. Of the present total vote of Â£580,000, Â£400,000 will be spent principally in the provision of telephone exchange 'equipment, conduits, underground cable, aerial wires, subscribers' instruments, private branch exchanges and public telephones. This amount will be distributed among the States as follows:Â£ New South Wales 177,000 Victoria .. .. . . I l l ,500 Queensland .. .. 42j00Q South Australia .. 35,000 Western Australia .. 20jO00 Tasmania .. 14,000 I urge honourable members to approve these Estimates, because the Government desires to proceed with the works, in some cases, almost immediately.",39
191,Mr GREGORY,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Swan) [3.53]. - The Minister's statement is anything but satisfactory to me. ID future, he should give the committee exact information as to where and how the money is to be spent.",39
192,Mr LATHAM,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"If all the particulars were supplied in the Estimates, the publication would be five times its present size.",40
193,Mr FENTON,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,I assure the honourable member that he will have the fullest information when the general Estimates are under consideration.,40
194,Mr GREGORY,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"It will then be too late to deal with the particular items now before us. For two years the department has been backward in providing telephonic facilities for the people in outback areas. Only Â£20,000 is allocated under these Estimates to ""Western Australia, as against Â£111,500 to Victoria. I cannot understand why the telephones of the present type are not regarded as satisfactory; and if the Government has money to spend in supplying new instruments, I claim that more money should be made available for providing ordinary telephonic facilities for the people in the back country. Preference should not ""be shown to the subscribers in the cities. Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [3.55] -- I cannot understand the policy of the Government respecting ""buildings and sites "", for which Â£25,000 is allowed on these Estimates. Some time ago the municipal council of Woollahra made certain representations to the Government. The pret'jnt post office site was possibly reasonably situated years ago, but is now not by any means in the centre of the business locality. A request was made to the Government that a more central site should be used, but it was refused. ' The council then offered to make a central site available for a period of twelve months, to demonstrate to the Postal Department that a more centrally situated post office would result in a larger volume of business; but this offer was also rejected. I suggest to the Postmaster-General (Mr Fenton) that the council should know the needs of the district. Lf he cannot accede to the request for a more central site, I trust that he will take steps to put the present building in decent repair.",40
195,Mr GABB,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Angas) [3.57] - I desire some information in regard to the building of official post offices. I have tried on a number of occasions to get the Government to build official post offices at Edwardstown and St. Morris, suburbs of Adelaide, and at Wanbi, in the country, but I have been told that it is not the present policy of the department to build official post offices. I wish to know whether official post offices are being built in other States.",40
196,Mr GIBSON,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Corangamite) [3.58] I ask the Postmaster-General (Mr. Fenton) to give special consideration to the installation of additional rural automatic telephone exchanges. We know very well that it is impossible for financial reasons to give a continuous service in exchanges with only about twenty subscribers. The office hours in such circumstances are necessarily limited. But if automatic telephone exchanges were installed in such rural areas a continuous service could be provided for the people with very little cost to the department. Some such exchanges were installed during the regime of the Bruce-Page Government, and they have given remarkably good service. I appeal to the Postmaster General to extend the scope and number of these most useful adjuncts to country life. I trust that the Government will not build any more official post offices. Visitors to the Old Country never see official post offices. The policy of the British Postal Department is to give service to the people, and that, I submit, should be the policy of the Commonwealth Postal Department. Our money should not be spent on ornate postal buildings in cities and country towns, but in the provision of facilities to the public.",40
197,Mr FENTON,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Maribyrnong-Post master-General) [3-59] - The details of the proposed expenditure on buildings and sites have been submitted to the  I regret that I have not the complete information with me at the moment, but I shall be glad to make it available privately to the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb).",40

199,Mr FENTON,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"I think not in the Estimates for additions, new works, buildings, &c. The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Gibson) must know that the Government is unable at present to in-crease the number of rural automatic telephone exchanges because of the financial stringency, but I assure him and also the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) that it is our intention to do everything possible to improve the service of - the Postal Department in rural and outhack areas. Although the department was uot able to accede to the request of the Wbollahra Council, referred to by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr E. J. Harrison), I am pleased to say that it has been decided to proceed with the long delayed postal work at Edgecliff. A fine site has been obtained which, although not quite central, will make it possible for the department to give improved facilities to the people in the locality.",40

The Canberra Times of today's date, in its report of the discussion, used the line, ""Parkhill facts answer Blakeley Fiction "". In its usual one-eyed way this newspaper gave a most partial and biased account of the discussion which also completely misrepresented the' position. The irresponsible statements of the Minister were repeated in an equally irresponsible way by this newspaper. For the edification of the Minister, and the instruction of the Canberra Times, I wish to state the facts very clearly. The present administration has been in office for six days short of six months aud during that time it has spent on unemployment relief Â£23,000 less than the amount provided in the Estimates of the Scullin Government, for expenditure in this direction in the Federal Capital Territory. That amount has therefore been, lost both to the unemployed and the business community of this city. The amount provided for the - iuinc purpose in the Estimates for 193233 is Â£30,000 less than the amount so provided in the Estimates of the Scullin Government. It will be seen therefore, that even if this Government expends the whole amount which it is providing in the Estimates, the amount that will have been spent on unemployed relief in Canberra in eighteen months will be Â£53,000 less than it might have been. Iii the general Estimates Â£15,000 less is build- being provided for expenditure in Canberra on unemployed relief than was provided by the Scullin Government. Thus in the short period of eighteen months the reduced expenditure under this heading in Canberra will be Â£68,000. So much for the alleged fact3 of the Minister for the Interior, who, I am sorry to say, is not at present in the chamber. I very much regret that the real position has been misrepresented. I could say a good deal more on this subject but I shall reserve my remarks for another occasion.",41
202,Mr GREGORY,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Swan) [4.5] - A large sum of money is provided on these Estimates for the purpose of still building up this white elephaut. A sum of Â£7,000 is provided for architectural and Â£-11,000 for engineering services. It seems extraordinary that such large amounts should be provided when no constructional work is being undertaken. What works does the Government propose to carry out in the Federal Capital Territory? Provision is head- also made for the expenditure of Â£6.000 in connection with forestry. I have always maintained that, as the States have forestry departments, this activity should be reserved to them, and unnecessary Commonwealth duplication avoided. Provision is also made from time to time for the expenditure of the Health ment, which is also au unnecessary dupextracted lication.",41
203,Mr SCULLIN,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,Why not ' unnecessary duplication by dispensing - with State governors?,42
204,Mr GREGORY,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,And when we do I hope we shall have a Governor General who will represent the King.,42
205,Mr SCULLIN,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"I submit, Mr ChairMinister man, that that remark should be withposed drawn. It is a reflection upon His Majesty's representative.",42
206,The CHAIRMAN,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Th right honourable the Leader of the same Opposition himself was out of order. The reference of the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) to the represenon tative of His Majesty the King is not in order, and must be withdrawn.",42
207,Mr GREGORY,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,I withdraw it.,42
208,Mr SCULLIN,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"I rise to a point order. I should like to know, Mr Chairthose man, under what standing order you me responsible for the disorderly remark of the honourable member for Swan. My interjection was that the appointment of omitted. State governors is an unnecessary duplication. That was not in any way a reflection upon His Majesty's State representatives. To that interjection the honourable member for Swan made a retort Canberra. which was a reflection upon His Majesty's representative. I should like to know in what way you hold me responsible for the disorderly remark of the honourable member ?",42
209,The CHAIRMAN,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"I do not hold the right honourable member responsible for the disorderly remark of the honourable member for Swan, which has been within drawn. I did not intend to reprove him for that, but only for interjecting after I had called for order.",42
210,Mr GREGORY,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,It is my intention to move that the amount provided for the forestry department be left out.,42
211,Mr GAJBB,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,On what grounds?,42
212,Mr GREGORY,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"On the grounds of tixtravagance. The State governments have forestry departments which are well cently equipped for carrying out forestry work. These Commonwealth departments are continually growing, and it is essential that something should be done to reduce Commonwealth expenditure. It grown to such extraordinary proportions Departthat unnecessarily large sums are from the people in the form of taxation. Last year, I understand, avoid Â£340,000 was spent by the Health Department; but that is an amount which I cannot discuss a,t this juncture. The operations of the forestry department should be curtailed, and I should like to have some information from the as to the way in which the provote is to be expended. If money is to be spent for engineering services, it must be for carrying out certain public e works which are not enumerated. The can be said with respect to the proposed expenditure on architectural services. We should have more information the items I have mentioned,, particularly when it is supposed to be the policy of the Government to curtail expenditure. The States should carry on certain activiof ties, and the Commonwealth look after which are essentially federal. It is hold time we got back to fundamentals. I move That the item ""Forestry, Â£6,000"" be",42
213,Mr LATHAM,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [4.12] - There has been a good deal of argument in the past with respect to the continuance of a forestry school at That question, however, does not arise under this item, although 1 recognize that the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) is not in possession of the information which would enable him to determine that point. All the States agreed that it was desirable to have one advanced forestry school, and that such a school should be conducted Canberra in order to avoid unnecessary duplication. Victoria is now objecting to duplication, and the question is whether we should have six forestry schools,- or only one under Commonwealth control. I think that it is desirable, in the interests of Australia, to have one school, and that was the opinion expressed by the representatives who attended the Forestry Conference which remet in Australia. The amount provided is for clearing and planting an additional 500 acres of softwoods in the Cotter River catchment area, erecting rabbit proof fencing to enclose a further has. 750 acres, and for providing for the treatment of the native forest at the back of Black Mountain as a future firewood reserve for the city. Of this amount, Â£250 is a revote to complete works which were in progress at the 30th of June. The items mentioned total Â£6,000. That work is not associated with the Forestry School as such, and in the circumstances, I suggest that the honourable member should withdraw his amendment.",42
214,Mr GREGORY,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,I withdraw it .,43
215,Mr LATHAM,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"The amount provided for architectural services is to cover the cost of alterations and additions to cottages in Canberra, including the enclosing of sleepouts, the provision of garages, and the like. The item is reproductive as increased rents are received to cover the capital outlay. The vote also covers alterations and additions to schools, the provision of sanitary conveniences at the Manuka oval, and at, Kingston and Manuka, the abseuce of which has been the subject of complaint. Provision is made for public shelter and office accommodation at the cemetery. It is also necessary to provide further accommodation for the staff at the pumping station in accordance with the decision of the Industrial Board. The balance of Â£1,500 is required to complete works already in progress. The engineering services are on a larger scale. Some small extensions are being made to the sewerage system including the sludge beds at Western Creek sewerage disposal depot, which are insufficient, and must lie looked after. Some steel mains are required to replace the cast iron mains which have worn out, particularly those which serve the Canberra Hospital - Whatever degree of blame may rightly be attributable to some one in the past in relation to that particular expenditure, this provision must be made. An item of considerable importance is Â£12,150 for a reservoir on Black Mountain. My information is that the water supply to the northern suburbs is inadequate, especially as regards fire protection, and that the proposal forms part of the general developTiicnt of the water supply reticulation of Canberra, and will involve the expenditure of further amounts of Â£11,000 in each of the two following years for mains. The other large item is Â£15,000 for road work to improve the surface of certain city roads with bitumen, and seal coats to bitumen and gravel roads on bus routes aud other thoroughfares. These roads must be maintained, and this work has to be done. Another substantial item is Â£750 for a bridge over Paddy's Elver. In winter, the landholders on the other side of the river are frequently unable to cross it . For electrical reticulation services, Â£1,200 is provided, and for a quarry on Mount Ainslie, Â£1,800. The quarry at Mugga has been abandoned, because the stone worked there has turned out to be very bard, and, as a consequence, the jaws of the crusher required constant replacement. Furthermore, the length of haulage was a serious matter, and the silica dust in the stone was a detriment to the health of the workmen. A site for a quarry has been chosen on the slopes of Mount Ainslie, and a road already built to it . So far, Â£4,250 has been spent on the installation of plant, and the Â£1,800 on these Estimates will complete the project. I suggest that an examination of these items will show that they are only reasonable provisions to meet the requirements of the community: Amendment-by leave-withdrawn .",43
216,Mr STACEY,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Adelaide) [4.18] - Las t session I recommended that some of the local unemployed should be put to work on Mount Stromlo. I had noticed that some of the trees planted sixteen or seventeen years ago had a diameter of not more than 5 inches or 6 inches, showing clearly that there is something wrong about the forestry methods adopted here. After sixteen or seventeen years, a pine tree should have some commercial value. These particular trees were planted in the correct fashion, 8 feet apart, but should have been thinned out years ago. T recommended months ago that every other row both ways should be cut out, leaving the trees 16 feet apart. That would give them room to grow. Portion of the money provided on these Estimates for afforestation might advisedly be used in that direction, otherwise the Stromlo plantation will be useless. It is impossible for trees to grow to any decent size when they are only 8 feet apart.",43
217,Mr BLAKELEY,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,Thinning s are taking place from time to time.,43
218,Mr STACEY,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"They should have taken place at least eight years ago, so far as this plantation is concerned. As the rainfal l in the Territory is inadequate, it is a pity that a large expenditure should he incurred in afforestation in the Territory. I have had sufficient experience of forestry work to know that pine trees seventeen years of age should have a - diameter of close on 20 inches. Even if the Stromlo trees had been given room to grow in the manner I have suggested - they would probably have only half that - diameter today. There is not sufficient rainfal l here for successful pine-growing. When speaking on this subject previously, I drew the attention, of the House to the fact that it would cost at least 38s. par 100 super, feet to land the Stromlo pine in one's backyard, whereas a far superior Canadian timber could be delivered at 15s. 9d. per 100 super, feet. I think that the idea of having a forestry school here is wrong if the young students are to be taught that pine trees should have no greater diameter than 6 inches or 7 inches at seventeen years. I propose to discuss this matter further on the general Estimates.",44
219,Mr GABB,RAILWAYS AND POSTAL,"Angas) [4.24] - I am alarmed at the statement of the' Attorney General (Mr Latham) about the opening up of a quarry on Mount Ainslie. I hope that' the beautiful surroundings of this House, the hillsides of the Molonglo valley, will not be scarred as they have been in the neighbourhood of Adelaide.",44

BUSINESS-PREMIER S CONFERENCEDAY S OF MEETING - TARIFF .",44
221,Mr LATHAM,NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [ 4 . 3 3 ] - I move That the House do now adjourn. On Wednesday it is proposed to proceed with the second-reading speech on the High Commissioner Bill . If desired, the Government is prepared to adjourn the debate, but I suggest that it might be possible to go straight on - with it. On that day the Government may also introduce bills to amend the sales tax. It is proposed that the next business shall be the State Grants Bill , and on Thursday, it is hoped to introduce the Financial Emergency Bill , to be followed later in the week by the second reading of the New Guinea Bill . My attention has been drawn to a statement in the press to the effect that it is possible that, within the next few weeks, the Federal Parliament will adjourn for a fortnight to allow the holding of a Premiers conference at which the long range problems facing Australia will be dealt with. While it is proposed to hold a Premiers conference"", no decision has yet been come to regarding the date, nor has it yet appeared that there will be any necessity to adjourn the House for the purpose. That aspect has not been considered by the Government.",44
222,Mr SCULLIN,NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT,"Yarra) [4.34] - I am concerned about the developments that are taking place in different parts of Australia, and I ask the Attorney General (Mr Latham), who is at present in charge of the House, to consider whether something can be done. I am informed that there was a broadcast in Melbourne today, which gave the reassuring message to the manufacturers and workers of Australia that the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) had indicated that there would be no immediate application of any cut in the tariff, but only after Parliament had dealt with it, and that, in the meantime, .manufacturers may make further representations to the Tariff Board, and for further consideration to other proposals. I presume that is based on a statement made by the Prime Minister. Prime Minister is reported in today's newspapers as having said I learn with regret that one or two firms which nre apparently affected by the decision - f the Government to reduce tariff duties are dismissing employees. There is not the slightest justification for this action being taken at present, because, although a resolution has been'tabled in the House of Representatives, under which it is announced that Parliament is to be invited to reduce duties in certain cases, these reductions of the tariff not beoome operative until such time as the tariff has passed both Houses of Parliament. Consequently, if in the meantime any industry haB reason to believe that its case has not received, at the hands of the Tariff Board, consideration to which it thinks it is ontitled, it is open for the industry concerned to make further representations to the Tariff Board. I appeal, therefore, to those industries which may consider themselves adversely affected by the decision of the Government, to hold their hand, and refrain from dismissing their employees, and to take the action which is open to them. In the meantime, they have the same measure of protection that they had previously. The newspapers publish a further statement that between 50 and 60 employees of Bryant and May Proprietary Limited, match manufacturers, in my own electorate,- have received notice of dismissal as the result of the tariff. Other similarstatements have been made. The Prime Minister has stated deliberately on behalf of the Government, that, pending the further consideration for which he invites manufacturers to apply, their industries will be protected as they were previously. A ll I ask is that steps be taken by the Government to give effect to that assurance. I assume that the Prime Minister is under a misapprehension as to the effect of the tariff schedules, which, I understand, applied from the day on which they were tabled in this House.  match industry.",45
223,Mr SCULLIN,NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT,"To some extent they do. There are six or seven items in the schedule in respect of which the ful l reductions will not take place because they are below the 1928 level; but every reduction of the duties imposed by my Government will apply except those below the 1928 level. The duties below the 192S level do not operate tc the full extent immediately, but in those cases the reductions apply at once down* to the 1928 level. The Apparently the Prime Minister was not aware of that. With few exceptions the lower duties are operative, and, as a result, employees have been dismissed, although Parliament has not yet ratified the reductions. The obvious step to be taken is to restore the old duties until Parliament has given its decision. If that is done I shall join with the Prime Minister in appealing to manufacturers do to keep their employees at work in the meantime.",45
224,Mr GABB,NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT,"Angas) [4.40] - I call the the attention of the acting leader of the House to the inconvenience caused to members from distant States because of the House not meeting until Wednesday. Already all the New South Wales members have left this chamber to catch the afternoon train to Sydney. The House meets for two and a half days in the week, and for the remaining four and a half days members from distant States have to remain in Canberra. That arrangement, no doubt, is convenient to New South Wales members, enabling them to spend at least half of the week at their homes or in tlieir constituencies; perhaps that was why they hurried the transfer of the seat of government to Canberra. But members from other States should not be penalized. I have no desire to dodge my job. The running of sleeping cars between Canberra and Sydney and .TVfplbourne in order that members may sit here for two aud a half clays in each week is not economical. I may be told that the State Governments are paid by the Commonwealth for the conveyance of members; that does not alter the fact that the running of the car3 more frequently than otherwise would .be necessary is extravagant. This House has made very little progress with its business during the last fortnight.",45
225,Mr LATHAM,NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT,We did very well yesterday and today.,46
226,Mr GABB,NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT,"Onl y because the House spurted in the last few hours. The bills providing for grants to three of the States have already been discussed for one day, and will presumably occupy another sitting. In every session we have the same experience; the House sits for two or three days each week at the beginning of the session and then rushes through a mass of business towards the enfl. Probably the present Goverument, like its predecessor, will endeavour to bulldoze the Esti^ mates through the House in one night without affording members an opportunity to discuss them. A few months ago the Bankruptcy Bill of about seventy clauses was passed through all stages in this chamber in less than half an hour because members wanted to return to their constituencies. It is reasonable that the House should commence immediately to sit on Tuesdays. We have to deal with the decisions of the Ottawa Conference, and the consequential alterations in the tariff, as well as the budget proposals, the Estimates, and other measures. The Financial Emergency Bill alone will occupy two weeks unless the Government applies the gag. Having regard to the extensive programme of business' to be transacted, I appeal to the Government to arrange for the House to meet on Tuesday. T Adjournment.",46
227,Mr FORDE,NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT,"Capricornia) [4.43] I am much concerned about the conflicting explanations of the tariff schedule given by members of the Government. The Acting Minister for Trade and Cus tion, saidTaking the schedule generally, the majority of the duties will not operate until they have been authorized by Parliament; but in a few instances in which the Government has reverted to the 1921-28 tariff they become operative immediately. To-day the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) broadcast the statement which has been read by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) to reassure the manufacturers who considered that the lower rates of duty would commence from the dates upon which the amending schedules were tabled by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Gullett) and the Acting Minister for Trade and  schedules introduced by me were validated for three months. On the day before the expiration of that period the Minister for Trade and Customs introduced further schedules which automatically took the place of mine. The new rates of duties applied in all instances except those in which the rates were below the level of the 1921-28 schedule. The rates of duty specified in the 192S schedule will apply in the case of only six items until Parliament authorizes the new tariff proposals. In certain items, including matches, the duties go even below the level of the 1921-28 schedule. In one item affecting Queensland interests-I refer to the duty on Diesel engines over 100 horse-powerthe rate in the new schedule is free, British",46
228,Mr SPEAKER,NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT,Hon. G. H. Mackay). - Order ! The honourable member must not discuss tariff items in detail.,46
229,Mr FORDE,NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT,"I should like to emphasize the urgent need, in the interests of Australian workers and of manufacturers who have put their money into Australian industries, to give effect to the promise made by the right honourable the Prime Minister. The Leader of the Opposition has made a reasonable request. In view of the definite promise given by the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs and by the Prime Minister that the new rates of duty will not apply until validated by Parliament, the Scullin schedule should be again introduced and operated until Parliament decides otherwise. It is no wonder that the Melbourne Age, in a leading article on the 5th September, said thisMr Latham asserted that in the hands of his party the policy of protection would be safe. . . . As far as the tariff is' cerned the Lyons Ministry won the election on false pretences. I now ask the Acting Leader of the Government (Mr Latham) to accede to the request made by the Leader of the Opposition. All who have at heart the interests of Australian industries, and particularly the workers in them, will agree that we cannot afford to see hundreds of workers thrown out of employment in Australian factories as the result of the lower duties brought in by this Government. I hope that the promise of the Prime Minister as published in the press this morning will be honoured.",46
230,Mr EILEY,NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT,"Cook) [4.48] - I support the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin). I am very much concerned at the black outlook in many industries that have been established during the last year or two as the result of protection given to them under the Scullin tariff, or under tariffs introduced by previous governments. I should like to refer particularly to the glass manufacturing industry, which, taking advantage of the deferred duty imposed in the Scullin tariff, commenced the manufacture of sheet glass. Altogether about Â£400,000 has been expended in laying down an efficient plant for the manufacture of this commodity.",47
231,Mr SPEAKER,NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT,The honourable gentleman must not refer to details of the tariff schedule now before the House.,47
232,Mr RILEY,NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT,"I shall endeavour to conform with your ruling, Mr Speaker. Because of the lower duties fixed by this Government, a number of manufacturers have threatened to dismiss employees and close down their works. It has been suggested that, in the case of the window glass industry, the threat was merely so much bluff. I can assure honourable members that the management was very much in earnest; but, following urgent appeals made by myself and also other honourable members on this side of the House, yesterday I received the following telegram from the manager:In view your telegram yesterday, Australian Window tilass Coinpuny will act on your recommendation and keep plant in operation until Parliament has decided fate of industry. It is all very well for honourable members who do not represent industrial constituencies ' to treat this matter lightly. conLet me tell them that members of industrial electorates are not unmindful of the welfare of our primary producers. I , for one, am always prepared to render them all the assistance in my power.  to sheepskins!",47
233,Mr RILEY,NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT,"Eve n in such matters as that. That they ueed assistance is evident from recent statements in the Melbourne press that prices for certain classes of wool lately have been so low that growers have been forced to burn or bury their skins. The Attorney-General has suggested that statements of certain manufacturers that, because of recent tariff alterations they were closing down, was merely a threat. I assure him that, in many cases, this is the renl intention. The Australian Window Glass Company had intended to close down this week-end to effect repairs to its furnaces; when the industry received this death-blow the management resolved to cease operations because of the impossibility of competing with overseas manufacturers. I appeal to the Government to give the House an early opportunity of discussing its drastic tariff proposals. During its term of office the Scullin ^Government was twitted by its opponents, including the honourable members for Forrest (Mr. Prowse), Swan (Mr Gregory), and  ing tariff schedules and not giving the House an opportunity to deal with particular items. Although it is only a week since the last schedule was laid on the table by this Government, I earnestly hope that, because of its serious effect upon a number of Australian industries, we shall have an early opportunity to discuss it.",47
234,Mr LATHAM,NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [4.53] - The honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) has raised a question which is mentioned in nearly every session of Parliament, namely, the sittings of the House. The complaint voiced by the honourable gentleman illustrates the difficulty of administering the affairs of a country the size of Australia. He must be aware that honourable members do not leave at the week-end merely to visit their homes. If Parliament were to sit regularly four or five days in each week, I do not see how it would be possible to carry out the necessary administrative work and allow Ministers time to meet the people in the different centres of population.",47
235,Mr GABB,NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT,How do we manage to sit four or five days a week at the end of each session?,48
236,Mr LATHAM,NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT,"We do that under very great pressure, which it would be quite impossible to maintain during the whole of a session. Indeed, having the country? regard to the complexity of some of the problems that confront us, I assure honourable member that -. even it is the pressure is very heavy at indeed on nearly every Minister sideration who is responsible for the presentaBoard tion of business to the Parliament. Parliament must decide. It would be more acceptable, perhaps, to honourable members as a whole if we were io sit more days per week, and shorter session; but as to whether we should have a shorter session in that event, the honourable member for Angas has had sufficient experience to entertain recommendations of serious doubts. With reference to the matter raised the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Scullin), the Deputy Leader (Mr Eorde), and the honourable member for Cook (Mr. Riley), I admit frankly that the state of ment of the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) unfortunately contained an error. It a statement of what was understood be a fact; it was not in any sense a profacie, mise, but an explanation of the position as.it was understood to-be. UnfortuGovernment nately, owing to the very heavy pressure of business yesterday, the statement issued before it had been reconsidered checked as it ought to have been. A statement has been issued to the press this afternoon correcting the error. The Government is, however, not prepared to make further alterations in the tariff without new recommendations being received from the Tariff Board. All existing alterations have been made on the basis of, and in accordance with, the recommendations of the Tariff Board, and it is one of the principal duties of the board to secure the proper protection of Australian industry. We are not going to assume, because objection is raised to particular proposals, that the board haB obviously and flagrantly neglected its duty. The Prime Minister has already saidj and I repeat the statement, that an invitation has been extended to any industry affected, which considers that there is relevant evidence available, or that some important aspect of the industry has been misunderstood, to approach the board again. If the board makes further recommendations, certainly those recommendations will receive consideration.",48
237,Mr SCULLIN,NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT,Is the board to govern,48
238,Mr LATHAM,NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT,"^-In any event, the prothe posals of the Government, on whatever as they are based, will be before Parliament as early a date as possible for conand determination. The Tariff is not the governing factor;",48
239,Mr FOBHE,NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT,But the Government has stated that it will carry out the recomhave a mendations of the board.,48
240,Mr LATHAM,NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT,"Speakin g generally, the Government proposes to base its recommendations to the House on the the board. That does not mean a mechanical and slavish by adherence to every recommendation the board makes. I am certainly not going to adopt such an attitude, responsible as I am to my constituents and to the people Australia, but in broad outline, we propose to follow the recommendations of was the board. In most instances, those to recommendations are regarded, prima as sound, but when reasons can be shown for doubting their wisdom, the does not mean that, notwithstanding everything else, the board's was recommendations must be accepted in and their entirety. That attitude, I submit, is a fair one to adopt, and it is very undesirable that attempts should be made to represent events that would take place in any case as due to alterations in the tariff. There has been an instance of that kind in connection with the glass the manufacturing industry. I say earnestly to those 'concerned with the industry that they Jo rist serve its interests by utilizing methods o i that kind. We know that it was proposed to close this factory even before the tariff schedule was tabled. To represent the action taken as a consequence of the amended tariff was not fair to the Government and Parliament or to the employees of the company itself. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 5.1 p.m.",48
