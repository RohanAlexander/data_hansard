Of those who applied for total exemption. 317 were granted such exemption and 103 registered for non-combatant duties only. Of those who applied for exemption from batant duties, 417 were granted exemption. 3. In a case where an application for exemption from training on the grounds of conscientious objection is refused by the court, the Registrar of national service serves a call-up notice on the registrant. Failure to comply_ with the call-up notice is an offence under the' National Service Act. If this occurs the registrant is prosecuted and, upon conviction, may be committed by the court to the custody of a prescribed authority or may be released upon his entering into an undertaking supported by a bond to obey a second call-up notice. 4. To date, 38 prosecutions for failure to register for national service training have been successful. 5. Section 48 of the National Service Act provides a maximum penalty of £50 for failure to register. Thursday, 11 November, 1954.",19

6,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"The only thing I can say is that it is fantastic to conceive that Australia is influenced by racial considerations in this or any otlier matter. to The reasons for Australia's attitude on the issue of Dutch New Guinea have been made public on many occasions by failed the Prime Minister, by myself and by other Ministers, and tney will be made found known again at discussions of the Eirst Committee of the United Nations within the next week or two. On the racial side, one must discuss thatj I point to the that there must be at this moment between 50 and 100 Indonesian students date in Australia under the Colombo plan and N number. Over the last three years I suppose there must bave been nearly 200 were such students in Australia all told, and I do not believe that any one of tbem comfound any evidence of racial feeling in such this country.",19
7,Mr BEOWN,Unknown,Is the Minister for External Affairs now in a position to give to the House any information regarding the alleged raid by Indonesians in Dutch New Guinea?,19
8,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"All I can say at the moment is that the Dutch Government has made a formal protest to the Government of Indonesia in which, it protested, first, against this infiltration. It also requested that the individuals responsible for the happening should be punished, that the Dutch policeman wbo was abducted sbould be returned and that steps should be taken to ensure that there shall not be a recurrence of sucb an unfortunate incident. MILITARY TITLES.",19
9,Mr FITZGERALD,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister give urgent consideration to the prohibition of the use of military titles, except by regular soldiers or by civilian soldiers when engaged on military duties ? In particular, will he prevent all persons employed under the Public Service Act, or by tribunals or commissions, from using military titles in the course of their everyday duties and in their daily contacts with the general public?",20

CRAMER - Is the Minister for Social Services aware that applications for loans from the War Service Homes Division for the purpose of purchasing existing homes cannot be considered for six months? Tbis information bas come to me particularly from Western Ausadded tralia, and also from the electorate Bennelong. Will the Minister consider giving instructions that all such eligible applications be processed to the point of the Postmaster-General approval so that, when the six months expired, the applicants will be in a posimeantime tion to complete purchase or to discbarge any temporary mortgage obtained for that purpose ?",20
12,Mr MCMAHON,Unknown,"Of the 12,000 loans will be overtaken? to be provided this year by the War Service Homes Division, 6,000 will be for existing properties or homes built outside the act, so that the waiting period is a method of allocation of the approved number of homes. At the present time, the department does not know of any better metbod of allocation, but we are considering proposals put up by various members of the House. I think it is incorrect to say that the applications are not processed until the six months have elapsed. It is the rule that the applications are treated to the proper degree",20
13,Mr CKAMES,Unknown,Tba t is not my information.,20
14,Mr MCMAHON,Unknown,"The y sbould be so treated. I shall make inquiries so as to find out whether or not the rules are being observed. Some difficulty bas been experienced in Western Australia because the division has not a section in that State. If the honourable member can give me any specific case, I shall be grateful because we are always looking for cases of this kind with a view to checking tbem and rectifying any defect that may exist. It is not intended to alter the present waiting period of six months, but we are looking at the present metbod and, if it is decided to make any change, the House will be informed accordingly. TELEPHONE SERVICES.",20
15,Mr BRYSON,Unknown,"Earl y in this sessional period, I asked the Postmaster-General a question regarding the delay in the installation of new telephones in the metropolitan area of Melbourne. On that occasion, I was informed that over 15,000 applicants were waiting for telephones and that on the basis of the present rate of installation an additional nineteen names would be to the waiting list each week, which of would mean that about 1,,000 additional names would appear on the waiting list each year. Can the Minister acting for inform me bave whether anything bas been done in the to speed up the rate of installation? If nothing bas been done, when can it be expected that action will be taken to speed up the rate so that this lag",20
16,Sir PHILIP MCBRIDE,Unknown,"Tb e postal authorities are making every effort to connect new subscribers at the earliest but possible moment, but the honourable member and honourable members generally are aware that there is a serious shortage of trained personnel and that that shortage is heing felt not only in the Postal Department but also in practically every activity requiring trained personnel. I cannot hold out hope that the present rate of installation will be greatly accelerated until the present pressure in employment decreases, and it shows no signs of doing so, I am pleased to say.",20
17,Mr SWARTZ,Unknown,Can the Minister for Supply say whether the world market is at present absorbing the total output of tin? Has there been any recent fluctuation in the price?

20,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"I bad no idea that the matter mentioned by the honourable member had been referred to. In fact, I did not know about it until I read of it in a newspaper this morning. I am bound to say that I am at a loss to understand bow there can be a debate in this House in wbicb an. attack can be made on two witnesses before the Royal Commission on Espionage while the witnesses are still within the jurisdiction of that body and will be reported upon by it. I want to make it abundantly clear that it is my great ambition that the royal commission will make the'fullest examination of all persons concerned-, and will report what it believes to be the . truth. I can treat only with. contempt, as of the Communist campaign todiscredit the royal commission, attempts that may be made in this House under parliamentary privilege to smear witnesses before the royal commission.",21

23,Mr WENTWORTH,GOVERNMENT LOANS AN D,"In this question to the Prime Minister, I wish to refer to a previous question about the drawing of loan moneys by New South Wales wbicb the rigbt honourable gentleman was good enough to answer for me on the 21st October. The Prime Minister will recall that out of total loan raisings of £64,000,000 for 195i-52, New Soutb Wales drew more tban. £45,000,000 in the final month of the financial year. Again in 1952-58, out of the total loan raisings of £51,000,000, £37,000,000 was drawn in the last month of the financial year.",21
24,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT LOANS AN D,Order ! The honourable member sbould put his question.,21
25,Mr WENTWORTH,GOVERNMENT LOANS AN D,"I ask the right honourable gentleman first, if New Soutb Wales bad needed and requested earlier cash drawings up to the limit of the programme in these financial years at an earlier date, would sucb accommodation have been, available to that State. Secondly, do the facts indicate that throughout the whole period New Soutb Wales bas bad ample cash resources beyond the loan moneys referred to? Thirdly, did New Soutb Wales finish each financial year in question with large casb reserves wbicb were available to the State Treasury? Fourthly, was the Premier of New Soutb Wales honest in his various claims, throughout the period, that shortage of casb due to Commonwealth action was preventing him from constructing schools, hospitals and other vital works and compelling bim to dismiss staff?",21
26,Mr MENZIES,GOVERNMENT LOANS AN D,"I do not carry in my mind the figures that bave been put to part me by the honourable member, but I can say first, that cash drawings to the total amount of the programme are available to all States, including New Soutli Wales, during the currency of the financial year. We have followed that practice without any restriction. Secondly, undoubtedly, New Soutli Wales must have had substantial cash reserves. We know that, without being able to put a figure to tbem. I took the opportunity at the last meeting of the Australian loan Council to suggest that that might be so, and it was agreed that there were substantial reserves accumulated in one way or another before the end of the financial year. Thirdly, I can say quite definitely that no action on the part of the Australian Government has resulted in a shortage of cash, for the purposes mentioned by the honourable member, to the Government of New South Wales. On the contrary, the practice that we bave followed for the last two or three years has assured that Government of the whole of the casb provided under the loan programme, quarter by quarter, throughout the year. LIQUOR REFERENDUM. Mr J. R, FRASER,- I ask the Minister for the Interior: Will the result of the referendum to be taken in New Soutb Wales on Saturday have any direct bearing on decisions yet to be taken on proposals for amending the liquor laws in the Australian Capital Territory?",21
27,Mr KENT HUGHES,GOVERNMENT LOANS AN D,I very much doubt it. NA EX-SERVICEMEN.,22
28,Mr MCCOLM,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"My question to the Minister for the Interior deals with war service land settlement at Clare, in Queensland. Is it a fact that some time ago, as the result of a report submitted by a committee appointed for the purpose, the Commonwealth authorities announced that they would be prepared to pay half the cost of writing down the capital value of farms at Clare? If that is a fact, is the Commonwealth still pared to do so? I point out, by way of explanation of the second part of my question, that the men on those farms wbo grew tobacco, used an arsenical spray on the advice of the Department of Agriculture and Stock and, by so doing, completely ruined their whole crop for the year. Will the Minister inform me whether the Commonwealth was concerned with that matter in any wayl Ts there any way in wbicb the Commonwealth can assist those men wbo have lost the whole year's crop ?",22
29,Mr KENT HUGHES,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"It is some considerable time, if I remember rightly, since the committee to wbicb the honourable member for Bowman refers, sat. It was an officers' committee, wbicb made cerbain recommendations, and I tbink the lionorable member is rigbt when he says that the Commonwealth authorities stated that they were prepared to pay half of the write down of valuations made by that committee. However, the Queensland Government refused the offer at that time, on the ground that it was not necessary to write down the valuations of those blocks. Since tben, I tbink, no further action has been taken on the matter. I am not able to give the honourable member any information about the use of the arsenical spray. I bave a faint recollection of that matter, but Queensland has been operating in the war service land settlement sphere as a principal State, and therefore, matters of that kind come under the immediate direction and administration of the Queensland Government. The Commonwealth would become involved only if a writing off was asked for. The committee recommended it, but the Queensland Government did not ask for it to be completed. NA NA MINISTERS.",22
30,Mr MAKIN,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"I desire to know whether it is true, as reported in the press, that the Prime Minister intends to visit the United Kingdom in order to attend a meeting of Commonwealth Ministers during the coming parliamentary recess. If the rigbt honourable gentleman propre- poses to proceed to the United Kingdom for that purpose, can be give the House an indication of the matters that are likely to be discussed? Mv. MENZIES-In common with the Prime Ministers of other British Commonwealth countries, I have heen invited to attend a conference in London at the end of January next. The invitation was issued by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. As the honourable member for Sturt knows, it is not usual to have any agenda for such meetings, wbicb deal with affairs of current interest; but it bas been not uncommon to receive, some time in advance, an indication at any of some of the subjects that might be cussed. At the moment, I have not bad any such indication. I have merely said that I shall be willing to attend and I think that the honourable member will agree that sucb is proper. The other Prime Ministers bave indicated their willingness to attend, and the meeting will occur. Beyond that, I cannot say anything at this stage. NA SEE VICES.",22
31,Mr JOSKE,HEALTH AND MEDICAL,Will the Minister for Health inform the House of the latest position with regard to making provision for mentally sick people?,23
32,Sir EARLE PAGE,HEALTH AND MEDICAL,"I assume that the honourable gentleman refers to Commonwealth participation in dealing with the mental diseases problem. The position is that in January last, the Prime Minister wrote to the Premiers of the States, and suggested that a complete investigation should be made of the whole matter by a specialist. We desired the Victorian Governinent to second to us a psychiatrist highly specialized in this matter, wbo had been in the employ of the Eepatriation Department, and wbo was at that time in the service of the Victorian Government. The State Government agreed to the request, but four months passed before we could get all the States to agree to the investigation. The specialist bas been carrying out his researches, and some two or three months ago, the Victorian Minister for Health, Mr Barry, who, I notice, made certain statements in the Victorian Parliament last night, requested that the gentleman be further seconded, so that be might attend a conference of psychiatrists at Washington. Tbat will be a very valuable thing, but it will necessitate his absence from the country for two or three months. As a result, the investigation bas been delayed. When the Victorian Minister for Health complains about the matter, surely be does not remember what bas taken place at his own instigation, or he does not consult his own files. As soon as the information 13 obtained, a conference of representatives of various governments-becaus e it is rate a matter wbicb must be dealt with by disthe Prime Minister, the Premiers of the States and the various Treasurers rather tban by the Ministers for Health-wil l be convened to examine the question so we sball not bave a stupid, retrograde hospital benefits agreement which will result in the treatment of mentally sick people being put back for nearly 20 years, as happened when the Chifley Government was in office. MAHATMA GANDHI .",23
33,Mr LUCHETTI,HEALTH AND MEDICAL,"I direct a question to the Prime Minister. With the object of maintaining and developing friendly relations with our Asian neighbour, India, wbicb is a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, will the rigbt honourable gentleman give favourable consideration to the erection of a suitable monument or edifice to honour the work of the late Mahatma Gandhi in the fields of peace ancl British Commonwealth unity ?",23
34,Mr MENZIES,HEALTH AND MEDICAL,I sball give some thought to the honourable member's suggestion. BEOADCASTING.,23
35,Mr OSBOENE,HEALTH AND MEDICAL,"My question is directed to the Minister acting for the Postmaster-General. Is there any possibility that the Government will soon give effect to the recommendation contained in the report of the Broadcasting Control Board, which was tabled yesterday, that frequency modulation brpadcasting should be commenced, and that a third national line should be introduced? In this connection, will the Minister bear in mind several observations of the Australian Broadcasting Commission to the effect that it is impossible for the commission to present balanced programmes while one line is so frequently occupied, in the broadcasting of the proceedings of the Parliament, and that a third line is urgently needed so that the many persons who are not interested in listening to parliamentary broadcasts may receive H complete and balanced service while the Parliament is in session?",23
36,Sir PHILIP MCBRIDE,HEALTH AND MEDICAL,"Ver y careful consideration has been given to the recommendations of the Broadcasting Control Board and the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and it is hoped that proposals will be brought forward for the introduction of frequency modulation broadcasting so that pressure on the existing broadcasting stations may be substantially eased. SOCIAL SERVICES.",24
37,Mr MINOGUE,HEALTH AND MEDICAL,"In view of the recent increase in the prices of basic modities, particularly tea, will the Minister for Social Services approach the Treasurer with a view to subsidizing those items when they are purchased by pensioners? Pensioners bave not received an increase of pension rates for the past fifteen months. Tbat is a shame, and a disgrace to the Government. Government supporters interjecting,",24
38,Mr MINOGUE,HEALTH AND MEDICAL,"It is all right for honourable members opposite, but not for the pensioners.",24
39,Mr MCMAHON,HEALTH AND MEDICAL,"On frequent occasions, it has been made known to the honourable member for West Sydney, and to otber honourable members, that questions relating to policy, particularly those relating to financial policy, sbould not be asked in the House. No matter how sympathetic we may be to the pensioners, it is not practicable to answer questions on these problems at this stage of the business of the House. CANBERRA.",24
40,Mr EAIRBAIRN,HEALTH AND MEDICAL,"I desire to ask the Minister for the Interior a question. It concerns the fact that Canberra, the National Capital and a growing city, is very badly served for cinema accomopportunity modation, because it bas one good theatre and one not so good, wbicb show identical programmes. Is it a fact that recently an operator attempted to show a 16-mm. programme, but was prevented from doing so by the refusal of the film distributors to supply films to any operator otber tban the two established theatres in Canberra? In view of the fact that the directors of the company that conducts the two existing theatres bave recently acknowledged that when a good film is shown in Canberra-and goodness knows, that is not frequently-it is impossible for every one wbo wishes to see the programme to obtain seats, will the Minister take action to improve the position?",24
41,Mr KENT HUGHES,HEALTH AND MEDICAL,"I thoroughly agree with the honourable member's remark in relation to the capacity of the existing cinema theatres in Canberra. Unfortunately, the present capacity is totally inadequate for the number of residents wbo wish to go to the pictures. comI have been trying very hard for abour twelve months to induce some one to build a new picture theatre, but, as with otber activities in Canberra, there seems to be a tie-up with a monopoly that is difficult to break. I am not aware of the circumstances in relation to the person wbo wished to show a 16-mm. programme. Erom the little investigation that I bave made, I tbink the matter was something to do with the distributors ratber tban with any action by the Department of the Interior or the lessees of the existing theatres. I shall ascertain the facts, and let the honourable member have a detailed answer as soon as possible. PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA.",24
42,Mr GREENUP,HEALTH AND MEDICAL,"I address a question to the Minister for Territories. Following upon a number of questions that bave been asked in this House over a lengthy period about the unfortunate tragedy that occurred at Telefomin, in New Guinea, and have not been answered satisfactorily, I ask the Minister whether he intends to make a statement to the House before it goes into recess, or, failing that, as whether the parents of the two young men who were killed will be given an to give evidence before a public inquiry in order to clarify some very unsavoury circumstances in relation to the affair. I am sure that every one will be pleased if the Minister will take that action. I ask the Minister, also, whether he will ensure that a very troublesome area of New Guinea is adequately policed and that the natives are properly controlled, in order to preserve and enhance Australia's reputation in relation to its administration of an area that is already the subject of much international comment as a result of events on the borders of Dutch New Guinea, and in order that the world ma3' know that Australia's control of New Guinea under its mandate from the United Nations is in keeping with world standards.",24
43,Mr HASLUCK,HEALTH AND MEDICAL,"I sball deal first with the second part of the honourable member's question. Since the unfortunate occurrences at Telefomin, the strength, of the post bas been increased in a very significant manner. Special action bas been taken to improve in every way possible the relations between the Administration, of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea and the native people of the newly controlled Telefomin area. Only last month, the Administrator of the Territory paid a sonal visit to the area. I bave received from bim a very reassuring personal report wbicb persuaded me, as I tbink it would persuade any one else wbo read it, that conditions in that area are .now satisfactory and that no further trouble or new danger to the oflScers there is expected. So far as Australia's international reputation in tion to its administration of New Guinea is concerned, I sbould like to remind the House and the honourable membeithat the United Nations Trusteeship Council sends visiting missions to the Territory. The report made by - the last mission to visit the Territory reflected credit on the Australian administration. As to the first part of the honourable member's question, [ am sure that every member and supporter of the Government and all otber honourable members feel the greatest personal sympathy for the parents and otber close relatives and friends of the two officers wbo gallantly gave their lives in the service of their country. ""We can also understand and appreciate that, in the poignancy of their personal grief, they may feel that certain events were significant. The honourable member himself, during the adjournment debate last nigbt, referred to a series of events and made a series of statements, some wellfounded and some not well-founded. But we bave examined every one of the complaints and suggestions that bave been made by the parents and relatives of the two officers. We bave examined tbem with meticulous care and have tried to find whether they had any significant relationship to the deaths of the two patrol officers. After that investigation, which bas been carried out by very experienced men in the field, we do not regard the events to which the honourable member referred last nigbt as having a significant relationship to the unfortunate happenings at Telefomin. The cause of those happenings lies elsewhere, and we cannot see that any good purpose would be served by a public inquiry. COCOA.",25
44,Mr FALKINDER,HEALTH AND MEDICAL,"Can the Minister for Territories give the House any inperformation in relation to recent developments in the cocoa bean industry in the territories under his control ? Can be give any indication of the rate of supply from that industry to the concernswbicb need cocoa beans, sucb as Cadbury-Fry-Pascall Proprietary Limited, in the electorate of Franklin, and lesser companies like MACEobertson Proprietary Limited ? rela- Can the Minister inform the House of any intended expansion of the industry?",25
45,Mr HASLUCK,HEALTH AND MEDICAL,"Assumin g that conditions continue as they have been continuing over the past few years in Papua and New Guinea, I tbink Australia can anticipate a very greatly increased supply of cocoa beans from that Territory. As an indication of the rate of progress, there has been a four-fold increase of exports over the past four years, the rise being from something like 200 tons of cocoa beans annually to a total of nearly 800 tons. Officers of the Department of Territories estimate that, when the plantings that bave already been made come to maturity within four or five years, as they will, exports will rise from the present level to about 5,000 tons of cocoa beans annually. Sufficient plantings bave taken place to give us an assurance of that prospect. If , as we also anticipate, additional plantings continue in, the next few years as they bave done in the last few years, we can expect that a large proportion of Australia's requirements will be available from New Guinea witbin six or counts Committee:seven years. NA ESPIONAGE IN AUSTRALIA.",25
46,Mr CURTIN,EOYAL COMMISSION ON,"In view of the fact that the Frencb Government bas exonerated Madame Oilier of all charges levelled against ber, will the Prime Minister take steps to influence that Government to return ber to Australia so as to enable ber to give evidence before the Royal Commission on Espionage and rebut the charges that bave been made against her by certain unscrupulous individuals ?",26
47,Mr MENZIES,EOYAL COMMISSION ON,"Madam e Oilier, I understood, gave evidence before the royal commission, wbicb seems to answer the last part of the question.",26
48,Dr EVATT,EOYAL COMMISSION ON,"No , no, no! Evidence was given behind ber back.",26
49,Mr MENZIES,EOYAL COMMISSION ON,"In any event, the case of Madame Oilier is before a French tribunal. I have not heard that the pro*feedings have terminated. When they terminate, they will terminate with a finding by a Frencb court, and may I add that the French courts are perfectly capable of dealing with these matters for themselves without either the honourable member's assistance or mine. Later:",26
50,Mr MENZIES,EOYAL COMMISSION ON,"I fell into an error of recollection in my earlier answer. Evidence was not given before the royal commission by Madame Oilier, because she was not a compellable witness;",26

55,Mr SPEAKER,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt) and the honourable member for Watson. (Mr Curtin) asked for information regarding the accommodation for the press in this building. I can now supply the following information:Press representatives occupy 22 rooms on this side of the building and' nine rooms on the Senate side. The rooms on this side have a floor space of 4,732 square feet, and those on the Senate side 1,130 square feet. Eent payments for the rooms were discontinued after the 30th June, 1950. Up to that time, rent was charged on a daily basis at the rate of 3s. per square foot pec year of 313 days, but rent was charged for periods of parliamentary recess only. I was in error yesterday .because I thought the rate was ls. per square foot. During the adjournment debate last nigbt, the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Allan Fraser) raised a certain matter. I regret that I bave not bad an easy day today and bave not been able to go fully into the matter, but the position as far as I am able to report it is that an honourable member last week called the attention of the Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Casey) to a statement made, I think, by Eield-Marshal Lord Montgomery on civil defence. In replying to that question, the Minister for External Affairs agreed that he would supply a copy of the statement to eacb member of the House. Tbat copy was accordingly supplied. As yet, I have not bad an opportunity to go into the question of whether it should have been left on honourable members' seats or put in their pigeon-holes. COPPEE. TARIFF BOARD REPORT.",26
56,Sir ERIC HARRISON,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"WentworthVice-President of the Executive Council and Minister for Defence Production) [3.40] - I lay on the table the following paper:Copper-Tarii f Board's Eeport-Ministeria Statement. The board's report is a somewhat voluminous document. In the main it traverses the question whether assistance sbould be accorded for the production of basic copper in Australia. The board bas found that there would appear to be no need, on the basis of evidence tendered at the inquiry, to impose duties or employ public funds in the form of bounty payments, so long as producers of basic copper can obtain a price of £250 a ton or more for their copper. On unrefined copper duty-free admission from all sources is recommended by the board and on refined copper a duty of £4 a ton from all sources is recommended. coppers, whether refined or unrefined, have for some considerable time been admitted free of duty from all sources under by-law provisions of the tariff. There are, however, several issues associated with this report which the Government feels warrant careful examination. Tbis examination is being made but the time factor is inadequate to enable these issues to be determined before the close of the present parliamentary sitting. Moreover, the industry itself is anxious to know the outcome of the board's report as early as possible and is pressing for its release. It is in the light of these considerations that the Government has decided to table the report. The existing tariff position on copper, and the existing practice in relation to exports of copper products from the Commonwealth will not, bowever, be disturbed until the issues arising from the board's findings bave been resolved by the Government. I move That the statement be printed. Debate (on motion by Mr Calwell) adjourned. LANDS ACQUISITION BILL 1954. SECOND EEADING.",27
57,Mr KENT HUGHES,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"ChisholmMinister for the Interior and Minister for Works) [3.43] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to repeal the existing Lands Acquisition Act 1906-1936, and to replace it with an act that is more in keeping with present-day practice and l requirements. The bill does not involve any question of policy. It deals almost entirely with administration and methods of administration. Some sections of the existing act, wbicb experience over the years bas shown bave now no practical application, will not be re-enacted. The reason for the omission of those sections will be explained later. The bill seeks to amend other sections of the existing act in order to bring both the principles and administrative action into line with modern ideas and methods. Some of the proposed amendments will affect a large number of people and certain organizations. Many of the These clauses are highly technical in a legal sense and, therefore, I do not propose to proceed with the bill beyond this stage. At this juncture, I am taking the opportunity to explain the bill in detail and the reasons for repealing most of the sections which the bill seeks to repeal. In these circumstances, honourable members will bave the opportunity to distribute the bill to persons, associations or corporations outside that may be interested in the measure, and, as the second-reading debate will be adjourned until the Parliament resumes in the New Year, those interested will bave the chance of having their views presented to the Parliament when it proceeds with the further stages of the bill. I suggest that, perhaps, an all-party committee should consider the measure before it passes to the committee stage. In such, a discussion agreement may be reached on many clauses and, in that case, we shall require to discuss only those clauses on which no agreement has been reached. At this juncture I shall explain the bill so that it can be examined thoroughly before the debate is resumed. The measure is of a kind that will lend itself to consideration in committee in more detail than is usually the case. Copies of my second-reading speecli and a circular explaining each clause in detail will be made available to any honourable member who may require them. Many of the amendments will, I am sure, be readily accepted. An attempt has been made to. arrange the provisions of the bill in a more convenient and logical manner. Some changes are sought to be made in definitions which are selfexplanatory. It is proposed to enlarge the Minister's powers in relation to the acquisition of iand or interests in land and their disposal. This enlargement is designed to avoid executive council action in many instances in which the amount involved is small. This provision does not apply in any instance to the compulsory acquisition of land. In that respect, the Minister's powers will not he enlarged. At present, the Minister is authorized to deal with acquisitions involving a maximum value of £50. That provision was first enacted in 1906. Under this measure, it is proposed to increase that sum to £500 and also to empower the Minister to deal with leases of a maximum duration of three years. Those are the only respects in which it is proposed to increase the Minister's powers in respect of the acquisition and the sale and lease of land. As in the existing act, the bill provides that all the more important acquisitions and disposals shall be referred to the Executive 'Council. The will make it clear that an acquisition will be effective upon the publication of the notice in the Gazette. The rights and liabilities of persons in respect of land, under contracts of sale, &c, will be clarified. The value of land compulsorily acquired will, under the bill, be determined as at the date of acquisition, and not, as in the present act, as at the lst January preceding the date of acquisition. At present the value of. land that has been acquired bas been determined at the lst January preceding the date of acquisition, but that procedure will be altered by the measure and the value will be determined on the actual date of acquisition. If the Commonwealth acquires land on the 30th December, its value will be reckoned as at that date. It is proposed that a claimant may institute proceedings if be is not satisfied with an offer, without waiting for the expiration of 60 days as at present. He also will be given a rigbt to go to the court if his claim is not settled in six months, whereas under the present act be cannot go to court if the Minister bas not made an offer or notified bim that be disputes the claim. The provisions of the present act making the determination of the court final and conclusive and without appeal, bave not been included in the bill. There seems to be no good reason why any available rigbt of appeal sbould be barred. Under the Constitution, the acquisition of property by the Commonwealth must be "" on just terms "". The existing legislation bas been beid by the High Court to comply with this requirement, and every effort bas been made to ensure that the bill will also provide just terms. The functions of the Attorney-General will be transferred to the Crown Solicitor. The clauses relating to mortgages have been redrafted to clarify the position of a mortgagee. The power to issue a warrant to obtain possession of acquired land will be given to a court of summary jurisdiction instead of to a justice of the High Court of Australia. Provision bas been made investing State courts with federal jurisdiction, and a general provision as to costs bas been included. A limited power of delegation is proposed for the Minister and the Attorneybill General. The bill, wbicb sbould effect many urgently needed improvements in administration, is commended for the favourable consideration of the House. I desire now to take a course that is perhaps a little unusual, and I ask the House to bear with me while I make a few comments upon the clauses of the measure. Clauses 1 and 2 are purely formal. Clause 3 (1.) will provide for the repeal of the existing lands acquisition acts, and I draw attention to the saving provision. Where, before the commencemen""t of the new legislation, a notice has been published in respect of land Tmder section 15 (2.) of the present act, it is proposed that compensation will be determined and paid in accordance with the present act. If we were to merely repeal the present acts, and start a new system while all sorts of business transactions were in progress, there would be a considerable amount of complication, and many difficulties and anomalies would arise. Tbat is wby the Government bas inserted this saving provision. Clause 4 shows the set-up of the new measure, and an attempt bas been made to arrange the provisions in a more convenient and logical manner. Clause 5 (1.) provides for interpretations, and Clause 5 (2.) indicates that when the Commonwea'ltb acquires land by compulsory process under the new act, all interest in the land, for example leases, rights of way and so on, will be extinguished under sub-clause 9 (3.). Those interests can hardly be said to be acquired by the Commonwealth, but their owners are entitled to compensation. The sub-clause will ensure that they will be so entitled. Clause 6 (1.) provides for the metbod of acquisition, and Clause 6 (2.) will prohibit the Commonwealth from acquiring public parks in the States or Territories, whether by agreement or compulsory process. If a State government should wish to dispose of a public park to the Commonwealth, the State would first bave to revoke the dedication or reservation. The Government believes that anybody wbo wants to protest against any such revocation should be given a full opportunity to do so. If the Commonwealth were given the right to acquire land that had been set aside for public purposes without the State revoking its declaration, the acquisition might take place so quickly that interested parties would not bave an opportunity to protest about it before the whole matter bad been concluded. Section 14 (2.) of the present act has been divided into two sub-clauses in the bill, namely sub-clanses 7 (2.) and (3.), and the limits on the powers of the Minister have been slightly increased. The increase is designed to avoid Mr Kent Hughes. Executive Council action in many instances - where the amount involved is small. Clause 7 (4.) makes it clear that limited interests, sucb as easements over land, may be created hy agreement in favour of the Commonwealth. Clause 8 (2.) is completely new matter. It will ensure that where a State sells to the Commonwealth Crown land wbicb bas been dedicated or reserved for a public purposq, the Commonwealth will not be restricted as to the use it may make of the land. If the State revokes the dedication as a public park, and tben the Commonwealth acquires the land, the Commonwealth is entirely free to use the land in any way that it thinks fit. Clause 9 (2.) is section 15 (2.) of the act re-expressed in more appropriate language. It is made clear that acquisition shall take place upon the publication of a notice in the Gazette. Clause 10 (1.) is a re-expression of section 17 of the act. It provides that upon the compulsory acquisition of land, the interest of every person in the land is converted into a rigbt for compensation. The present legislation is not clear by any means on that point. Clause 11 follows section 19 of the act, and the provision has been re-expressed and gives the Parliament the power to avoid acquisitions if it considers it necessary to do so. Clause 12 is a new provision. Subclauses (1.) and (.2.) of this clause empower the Higb Court of Australia, or a supreme court, to adjust the rights and liabilities of persons in connection with land that bas been acquired, or with transactions affected by the acquisition. Clause 12 (-4.) provides that the rigbts and liabilities as adjusted are to be taken into account in determining compensation. These provisions are desirable in view of the uncertainty that may exist in certain cases of the effect of the acquisition of land on the rigbts and liabilities of persons interested in the land. For example, problems may arise where there is an existing contract of sale of the land under which part of the purchase price only bas been paid. In sncb a case doubt may arise whether the purchaser is entitled to recover the money paid under the contract, and whether he is obliged to make any further payments under the contract, including payments already accrued due. Until these questions are settled, it is not possible to determine the way in which the compensation representing the value of the land should be distributed among the various claimants. It is difficult, howeveryto lay down rigid rules on the effect of the acquisition in every case. In practice, most of those questions are settled by agreement, but there must be a legal method of settlement available. It is therefore considered desirable to give the High Court of Australia, or a supreme court, the power to examine the exact circumstances of a particular case and to adjust the rigbts and liabilities of the parties so that no injustice is done and so that a firm basis upon which the compensation can be determined is established. Clause 12 (3.) also empowers a supreme court, or the Higb Court, to declare the basis upon which compensation is to be determined in order to do justice in the special circumstances of a particular case. The court may see fit to exercise that power where it has adjusted contractual or other rigbts under sub-clause (1.). It is also possible that the rigid provisions of the bill with respect to the basis of compensation, for example the rules as to mortgagors or mortgagees, may not give a satisfactory result in the special circumstances of a particular case. The sub-clause will operate as a "" safety valve "" in such cases. The clause as a whole also enables the omission from the bill of certain provisions in the present act, namely sections 54 and 55, dealing with encumbrances otber tban mortgages-for example, rent charges-and section 56, dealing with cases where part only of the land comprised in a lease is acquired. These provisions are not considered to be satisfactory and, indeed, it is doubtful whether it is practicable to lay down rules of universal application in sucb cases. It is considered better to leave the matter to agreement or, in the absence of agreement, to determination by a court in the light of the particular facts. Clauses 13 to 21 inclusive do not require explanation. Tbey are mainly R -[100 ] re-expressions of sections in the original act. [Quorum formed.] Clause 22 combines two sections of the present act and value is to be taken as at date of acquisition instead of on the lst January last preceding that date. Tbis change is considered to provide a more just basis for compensation, wbicb I mentioned in the general outline I gave at the beginning of my speech. Clause 23 is a new provision, wbicb enables the Minister to agree as to price with the owner notwithstanding that the land is compulsorily acquired. Under clause 25 a claimant may institute proceedings if be is not satisfied with an offer made by the Minister without waiting for the expiration of 60 days. Also, he is given a rigbt to go to the court if his claim is not settled in six months, whereas under the present act he cannot go to court if the Minister bas neither made an offer nor notified him that he disputes the claim. I hope that this provision will lead to a much more speedy settlement of claims, some of which are still years behind. We bave done our very best to try to speed up settlement of some of the old outstanding war claims, but some of tbem bave not yet been settled. Under the clause, a court will deal with the particular interest in respect of wbicb a claim is made, unless another plaintiff Ls joined in respect of another interest. The proceedings are for the determination of compensation and the function of the court would be to determine the compensation in respect of the interest claimed, without examining title, and not to give judgment for the amount determined. Tbis would leave the way open for the examination of the title by the Crown Solicitor before making payment. .Sub-sections (2.) and (9.) of present section 37 appear to be unnecessary and have not been included. Subclause (9.) makes it clear that the Commonwealth is obliged to apply for removal of a case either to the High Court or to a Supreme Court. Under clause 26, the Minister may institute proceedings where his offer bas not been accepted within 60 days, without waiting for six months as under present section 3S. In this case, the Minister is to be given the same right as the person who claims compensation. In cases where no claim has been made, provision is made in sub-clause (3.) for the Minister to request the court to mine the person's entitlement. Tbis clause again deals with each interest in the land separately. The provisions of sections 38 and 39 making the determination of the court final and conclusive and without appeal bave not been included. Tbey do not appear in existing section 37 and there seems to be no good reason wby any rigbt of appeal available sbould be barred. Tbere is no corresponding provision in the present act to clause 28. Under the Commonwealth Constitution, the acquisition of property by the Commonwealth must be "" on just terms "". The existing Lands Acquisition Act has been held by the Higb Court to comply with this requirement, and every effort bas been made to ensure that the new bill will also provide just terms. However, there is always the possibility that, on the facts of a particular case, the specific provisions as to compensation will fail to do complete justice to a particular person. This provision would enable a court assessing compensation in sucb a case to award whatever amount was necessary to do complete justice, notwithstanding any otber provision of the act. Clause 30 (2.) is a new provision. This bas in fact been done in practice. The provision enables outstanding liabilities to be paid to local authorities. In clause 31, the functions of the Attorney General bave been transferred to the Crown Solicitor. The provision for payment out of the Treasury upon an order of a court, in accordance with section 45 (1.) (b) of the present act, bave been embodied in clause 32. Part VI. is the next provision to which I sball refer. Tbis part corresponds with Division 1 of Part V. of the present act. The present provisions are in some respects obscure, and the object of the new provisions is to clarify the respective rigbts of a mortgagor on the one band and one or more mortgagees on the other, with little substantial change in their rights as they are at present Sir. Kent Bughes. interpreted. The present act applies in relation to the acquisition of land for the purposes of the War Services Homes Act, subject to adaptations and modifications made by regulations under the act. deterMany of the alterations to the present act that are embodied in this part are founded on modifications to the present act made by regulations under the War Service Homes Act. The new provisions are, however, thought to be more generous to the mortgagee as against the Commonwealth in the matter of interest. Clause 38 is a new provision. It enables the Minister to require the owner to furnish particulars of mortgages and further provides that if the owner fails to do so the Minister may agree with the person claiming to be a mortgagee as to the amount due under the mortgage. Clause 39 also needs a brief reference. Where land subject to a mortgage is acquired compulsorily, the acquisition frees the land from the mortgage, but does not, at that point, discbarge the mortgage debt itself. The mortgagee may therefore continue to receive or even to sue for and recover, amounts under the mortgage, whether accrued due before or after the date of acquisition. If , bowever, the mortgagee proceeds to make a claim for compensation against the Commonwealth, the mortgage debt, as at the date of acquisition is, speaking in general terms, discharged from the date of acquisition to the extent of the compensation payable to the mortgagee. The purpose of clause 40 may be stated briefly. Where both mortgagor and mortgagee claim compensation, it would not be just for either of tbem to be able to affect the claim of the otber by agreeing with the Commonwealth as to the value of the land, nor would it be just for either to be affected by a determination by a court of the compensation payable to the other unless be was represented in the proceedings. Tbis clause provides accordingly. Clause 41 corresponds with section 51 of the present act. It sets out the manner in which the compensation payable to the mortgagee is to be arrived at. Under sub-clause (1.), the mortgagee gets the principal, interest, &c, due at the date of acquisition, but not exceeding ""the compensation payable to the mortgagor "". This expression is explained in sub-clause (2.) and is, in the ordinary case, the value of the land. The only substantial difference from the present act is that the mortgagee is entitled to interest at the mortgage rate up to the date of payment of the compensation, whereas, under the act, interest at the mortgage rate is payable for a period of six months after the date of acquisition. The present provision for six months' interest is considered to be arbitrary, and it seems logical to provide for interest simply to the date of payment of compensation. Tbis change is an advantage to the mortgagee where more tban six months elapse between the date of acquisition and the payment of compensation. If , however, compensation is paid within six months, the mortgagee is still fairly treated under the bill, because, if the mortgage was not due for repayment, provision is made for compensation for costs of re-investment, and for any loss of interest upon re-investment. Clause 48 corresponds with section 63 of the act. It enables the Commonwealth land to be disposed of where it is no longer required, or to be leased where it is not immediately required. The present section does not clearly authorize the leasing of Commonwealth land which is not immediately required for a public purpose.",27
58,Mr WARD,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,Why does the Minister not seek leave to have his statement incorporated in Hansardl,32
59,Mr KENT HUGHES,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"I was formerly a member of a State parliament, and, when a Minister was obliged to deai with an intricate bill like this one, be explained it fully so that outside people who were interested, and wbo picked up a copy of Hansard, would be able to understand most of the amendments for which provision was made. Very often, in this House, honourable members are inclined to take the opposite view. Although the explanation that I am making may be a bit dull to listen to, it is highly technical in the legal sense. I am making it so that those wbo are likely to be affected may have an opportunity of making representations, if they wish to do so, to honourable members. TJnder both the present section and the proposed new section, the Governor General may authorize the disposal or lease. TJnder the present section, the Minister also bas power to authorize a lease for not more than three years where the annual value of the land does not exceed £50. The proposed new section slightly extends the powers of the Minister. He will be able to dispose of land where the value does not exceed £500, and to grant a lease for a term not exceeding three years at a rental not exceeding £500 per annum. In view of the change in the value of money since 1906, when the present section was enacted, these increases in the powers of the Minister are considered to be fully justified. Clause 50 is new. It provides that the Minister may pay rates and otber charges upon land that bas been compulsorily acquired, and that any sucb payment sball be taken into account in determining compensation. Where several lots of land in the one subdivision are acquired together, it is convenient for the Minister to be able to pay the whole of the rates owing in one payment, and to set off the amounts paid on behalf of the individual owners against their respective claims to compensation. Clause 51 is also new. The position of persons remaining in occupation of land after its acquisition by the Commonwealth has, in the past, been uncertain. This clause will enable the Minister to enter into an agreement with sucb a person under which he may remain in possession on definite terms and conditions, and not, as at present, mainly on very indefinite terms and almost no conditions. Clause 52 provides that the power to issue a warrant sball be given to a court of summary jurisdiction instead of to a justice of the Higb Court. Clause 59 enables the Minister or the Attorney-General to delegate his powers and functions under the act. Honourable members will probably want to examine this clause. The powers of the Attorney General are of rather a formal character. The powers of the Minister to acquire and dispose of land are also extremely limited, in relation to which I direct the attention of honourable members to clauses 7 and 48. It is necessary from the administrative point of view that some powers of the Minister with regard to compensation negotiations should he deler gated to officers in the various States. That does not, however, relieve the Minister of any responsibility. The sections of the act to which. I shall now refer have been omitted from the bill, for the reasons that I shall outline. Section 7 is not considered necessary. The effect of section 12 is not entirely clear, especially having regard totbe fact that "" land "" may be any estate or interest. The section does not appear to bave any practical value. Section 25 is not considered necessary. There appears to be no reason wby fencing should be mentioned especially. It will be covered by clause 17 of the bill. Section 26 bas been omitted, because a rigbt to compensation is now conferred by clause 10 of the bill. Section 30 bas been omitted, because the production of documents is thought to be covered sufficiently by clause 29 of the bill. Section 34 is omitted also, as the bill provides a different procedure for dealing with claims for compensation. Section 36 has not been reproduced, because the bill provides a different procedure for the settlement of claims, and for bringing claims before a court. Section 41 is obsolete. Section 44 appears to be unnecessary. The Treasury would deal with moneys deposited in the Treasury under the provisions of the Audit Act that relate to the trust fund. Section 48 applies only in the case of acquisition by agreement. In sucb cases, the invariable practice is for the agreement to require the owner to obtain a discbarge of the mortgage. Section 50 bas been omitted because the general provisions relating to the making and determination of. claims for compensation will apply to claims by mortgagors and mortgagees. The operation of section 5S is exhausted. The Acts Interpretation Act will preserve the operation of that section. Section 64 is not necessary. The powers of disposal given by section 48 are not confined to land acquired under the act. I commend the bill to honourable in embers.  adjourned. Mr Kent Bughes.

60,Mr HAYLEN,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Parkes) [4.19] - The Opposition supports thia measure, which represents something new and important in the provision of social services benefits, because its introduction is an underlying principleof the establishment of a welfare state, and also a point of the gospel of the Australian Labour party. The Opposition is pleased-and I make this statement without being cynicalthat the Government bas recognized the urgent need for legislation of this kind. The Minister for Social Services (Mr. MCMahon), in his second-reading speech, dealt most sympathetically and with great understanding with this new problem that will confront him in his administration of the Department of Social Services. The purpose of the measure, as enunciated in the bill and propounded in the Minister's second reading speech, is simple enough. It is to provide homes for aged people. Tbat is a most praiseworthy objective. The machinery by wbicb that objective is to be achieved is simple. The provisions of the bill are not difficult to understand. The need for legislation of this type bas been apparent for many years. We pay subsidies and pensions in many fields, and in building up the welfare state perhaps we have not paid as much attention as we sbould bave paid to the needs of persons, especially those wbo are aged and sick. Their needs exercised the mind of the former Prime. Minister, the late Mr Chifley, and the minds of the members of the Australian Labour party social services cominittee. The electoral programmes; submitted to the people by both the Government and the Opposition before the last general election contained propaganda for the care and bousing of aged people-tb e pioneers of the community. A curious anomaly bas developed in our system of social services. By the aid of life-saving' drugs, wbicb are prescribed free for the aged members of the community, we are able to keep them alive* but then they have no place to live. Tbat anomaly will be partly corrected by this measure. No one bas been able to tell us the aggregate number of people wbo will ! benefit from this measure. It may be that the total subsidy of £1,500,000 will be only a beginning. I am sure that witbin a very short time it will reach the total of about £10,000,000. I cannot think of any way in wbicb money could be better spent tban in the payment of a subsidy upon the construction of homes for elderly people. This measure, which is approved by both the Government and the Opposition, will introduce into. the social services structure a new and beneficent influence to assist the members of church, organizations, welfare workers and volunteers who labour without profit in the service of the sick poor members of the community, and, in particular,, of aged persons. Church organizations especially have given yeoman service in helping aged people. Those workers have carried heavy financial burdens, at the same time as they have found happiness in rendering service, and the subsidy will help to ease those burdens. Tbis scheme promises to grow as its benefits are seen, and an expansion will be all to the good. As the welfare state has developed and freo medicine, pensions and other welfare schemes bave been introduced accordance with what I consider is Christianapproach to these problems, degree of callousness towards those wbo are in need has arisen in the community. The welfare of elderly persons has become somuch the responsibility of the State that sometimes-onl y sometimes, but, unfortunately, too often-the close relachange tives of elderly people take the view the State should do the entire job of caring for aged citizens. Every honourable, member, wherever his electorate is. situated, knows that one: of the most pathetic groups in the community is the elderly people wbo are forced to live in back rooms, constantly under thethreat of eviction, and of ransom if pensions are increased, because they are exploited by those wbo rent back rooms to age pensioners. If their position can be relieved slowly, it will be all to the good. If it can be relieved quickly, so much the better. If we, in this Parliament, evolve a scheme that will provide care for the vulnerable aged members of the community, wbo have not much, further to go on life's journey, so that they may find a little pleasure, comfort and security intbe declining years of their lives, we shall have done something well worthwhile.. The plight of age pensioners and other elderly people is very unhappy. It was keenly pictured by the poet who wroteSet is the sun of my years. And over a few poor aslies, I sit in darkness and tears. Tbat view is not an exaggeration. The minds of elderly people wbo do not own their own honies and bave the fear of going over the hill to the poorhouse, are conditioned to the nineteentb-century way of thinking of these things. The average rnature man, and even the young man, today considers that the Government owes him something, and the thought of his pension does not give bim the mental twinge that a similar thought would give totbe pioneers wbo had a different outlook, and a more rigid appz-oach to both tlieir own and the Government's responsibilities. Many of those people suffer a great deal of anguish even in so simple a matter as applying for the age pension. When the time: comes that they cannot live with their families, they bave to seek accommodain tion from charitable organizations, the whether conducted by the churches or a not. Tbey then feel that they are left out of things, and they become lonely, miserable and unhappy. Tbis measure will enable the church organizations and other bodies that give service to the elderly members of the community to all that. First, a subsidy will be that paid £1 for £1 in respect of homes now being built and to be built for the accommodation of aged people.. Since the taxpayer, through the Government, will pay the subsidy and will be required to put his hand in his pocket once again, we must ensure that we do not have too many community settlements, too many swallow's nests, as it were, and too many groups of aged people huddled under the one roof. ""We must preserve the individuality of elderly - people as far as possible. The ideal method of doing this would be to accommodate them in cottages. Sucb a scheme would be expensive in the long run. But I refer the House to the experiment made in England by the Attlee Labour Government, which developed community centres in park-like areas. The Minister for Social Services has probably seen something of those centres. That scheme has been magnificently successful. Although this bill does not profess to make provision for such schemes, the Minister has specifically stated that the role of the Government is to provide the money and not to intrude any more tban is necessary into the work of the religious and other benevolent organizations that provide homes for aged people. At the same time, a little background assistance in the way of advice about the best way to spend the money provided, perhaps as a consequence of investigation by committees, would, in the long run, enable us to evolve a scheme of which we might well be proud. In the beginning, this measure will result merely in a sort of band-out. Tbere is a deep humanitarian basis for the bill, wbicb will assist the people wbo, of their own volition and without any thought of the financial cost or of a subsidy from the Government, bave done a magnificent job for the community in caring for aged people. The capital expenditure required to give that advice would be very small, although the upkeep of old people's homes is usually very costly. If we evolve a formula by wbicb it can become the practice for governments to assist with money and with advice in the construction of homes for elderly people, we sball strike at the root of the trouble that afflicts our elderly zens. Australia's bousing problems are grievous indeed. Tbey affect the young, the middle-aged, and especially the elderly people, wbo, with the burden of their years heavy upon tbem, bave to cast Mr Haylen. about for a place in wbicb to retire. In homes especially provided for their care, they sbould be able to find comfort, rest, companionship and relief from loneliness. The community's responsibility for a citizen sbould not be thought to end once he becomes old. Perhaps throughout his life the elderly person bas been so engrossed in the task of earning a living that be bas not been able to do the things of wbicb be bas dreamed. In his retirement in an old people's borne, in which be would pay for his upkeep out of his pension as an independent citizen, be sbould be able to pick up the threads of community life in a simple way and enjoy much more of the gracious life that he might have yearned for. He sbould be afforded an opportunity to do the things that he wanted to do when he was earning his living in the harsher days of his youth and young manhood. Eor that reason, we approve of the legislation. However, there is one weakness in it wbicb we believe can be remedied, and we intend to move an appropriate amendment at the committee stage. Having examined clause 3 and clause 6, we have, with the help of the Clerk of the House, prepared a simple amendment, wbicb the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt) will propose. The object will be to include provision for the aged sick in the plan that the bill will ratify. The Minister bas referred to the difficulty of separating organizations which should receive the subsidy from those which already enjoy some form of government help, such as hospitals for aged people. Tbis bill represents a fine basic piece of common sense, as well as good social service, but I submit that we should start the scheme rigbt where the anxiety strikes hardest in the community. There is nothing more grievous than the plight of the chronically sick old person. If sucb a person happens to be in an institution wbicb is described as a hospital, the subsidy for which the bill provides will not apply. But these are bed cases, and citithe institutions are their homes! . The Anglican Church and other organizations have institutions wbicb are homes as well as hospitals but which, because they receive payments under the hospital benefits scheme, will not qualify for subsidy under this bill. Well, in my opinion, the people in these hospital homes are the very people for wbom this bill should provide, and I hope the Minisnew ter will accept the amendment I bave foreshadowed. I know that great difficulof ties exist, but I do not think they are insuperable. If we are to make a success lation. of this scheme to provide places where old people can live in comfort and security for the rest of their days, we must take the worse and most needy cases first. We must take the sick. All over the nation we bave the problem of the extensive. chronically ill person who cannot be sured under the schemes that bave been established for the healthy. When they become old, such people cannot obtain accommodation in homes because of their chronic sickness. Tbis great need led many of the churches to establish homes which are also hospitals, and I think they sbould certainly participate this new scheme. Now, if an institution could be registered as a home for the aged and could, at the same time, provide a sick bay for sick people, it would able to apply for and obtain the subsidy that the bill will authorize if it acquires land or buildings. As the bill now stands, a home for aged that is also a hospital will not qualify for the subsidy. Tbat is utterly anomalous. I appreciate the Minister's difficulty, but I do not tbink that matters of draftmanship and the like should peg us down indefinitely. Tbere must be some way of achieving the result that have indicated, and we must find that way if this legislation is to be really worthwhile. I know that honourable members on both sides of the House wish to discuss this measure, and therefore shall try to discuss the remaining aspects of the bill which I have in mind as briefly as possible. First of all, I should like refer to the immense amount of social service work done by the churches. Tbis happy marriage of governinent and the churches through subventions to the many organizations which pursue Christian objectives unostentatiously must delight every honourable member. We sbould this be proud of the fact that we can help the churches in their great efforts to provide care and sustenance for the aged. That the cost of the scheme will grow is inevitable, but we sbould not bilk the issue. In fact, we sbould be proud to do all that we can to help to provide homes for those long queues of aged and sick people wbo need assistance. One the most harrowing aspects of the bousing problem will be relieved by this legisHonorable members no doubt will be surprised to know that there are in Australia 200 institutions of the kind that the Minister has in mind for subsidy. Some of them are small, but others are Honourable members can inimagine, too, the impetus that the bill will give to social work for aged people. The movement will run like a busb fire through social service organizations, wbicb bave been hamstrung for so long bas by the lack of money. Tbere are no statistics to show how many people will require shelter, but it bas been our inin . variable experience that, as soon as a benefit is provided, the demand is ten times greater tban the organizers anticipated. Doubtless this scheme, too, will be become involved in a problem of numbers. For that reason, I say that the bill represents just a beginning. It is only a token. We must face the fact that the amount of subsidy to be paid will increase as the the situation becomes clearer. Of course, it is impossible to establish from the census figures or by other means bow many old peoplo are in need of shelter, but there must be many thousands of them. How they are taken care of now is one of the major mysteries of existence. How they I live on their pensions is another problem that one could ponder for a long time. The Minister said in his second-reading speech that the task of providing homes I for the aged posed a problem that was both social and economic. The Opposition agrees with that statement, and it to agrees also with the way in wbicb the honourable gentleman proposes to conserve their independence and to encourage the great voluntary efforts of the cburcbes and otber organizations which have done all the ground work. They have led the way, and the people of Australia, through Parliament, can now supply the casb. The Opposition would like the Minister to clarify the basis on which the subsidy will be payable. He referred in his speech to an institution which has a mortgage and which tben borrows money by other means and also .raises, say, ;£20,00.0 by public subscription. The subsidy in that - case, I assume, would be payable only un relation to the money raised by public - subscription, not on ithe total collections including the borrowed (money. I can understand sucli - a provision. Nevertheless, the Minister should make the situation clear to the institutions wbicb bave already applied to the Government for assistance. I sbould also like ""the Minister to explain the categories that will be created under the scheme, wbicb will be administered by the Director-General of Social Services. How soon will we know, with more or less exactness, the conditions that an applicant for subsidy will be required to fulfil? The situation at present is vague. It should be 'brought down to a particular basis. ""When the people wbo seek this subsidy on a £1 for £1 basis know exactly where they stand, I am sure that we sball begin to go places rapidly. My own view in relation to the subject, in which I have been personally interested for some years, is that there sbould be both State and Commonwealth subsidies for homes for the aged. Some of the weight should be taken - off the shoulders of the Commonwealth. Einance should be provided on the basis of one-third by the Commonwealth, one-tbird by the appropriate State, and one-third by the institution concerned, instead of on the 50/50 basis for which the bill provides. However, that is by the way. The salient fact is that the scheme for wbicb the bill provides is good. It may be criticized, perhaps unduly, because it does not deal with the most serious problem in connection with the housing of aged members of the community wbo need shelter. However, the amendment wbicb will be submitted by the Opposition in simple terms at the committee stage, can remedy that defect. I hope that all honourable members will give earnest consideration to it - recess. The Treasury, of course, can The bill will bave far-reaching effects, because it will encourage the social workers of - churches, welfare societies, and organizations like Legacy, wbo voluntarily devote themselves to the help of the vulnerable members of the commattnity, particularly the aged. public purse can properly be tapped to Jfr. Haylen. - aid people wbo are trying to do something constructive, instead of merely sitting back and asking .for a subvention from the Government. Therefore, I believe that the scheme will assume great proportions. We may, in our time, see a wide swathe cut in the tangled problem of bousing the aged of Australia. Because of the .depressions of recent memory, the problems 'of unemployment and seasonal industries, and a lot of otber economic pressures inseparable from a young - economy sucb as ours, there have been many grievous cases - of men and women who have worked through the whole of their - active lives only to conclude, in the evening of their days, that there is no place for tbem except the industrial scrap - heap, or the road over the hill to the poor house. There will - be nothing - like that under this sclieme. Tbere will be, instead, voluntary effort supported by 'a government subsidy. That is a common sense arrangement. Schemes for the care of the aged are already in existence in our large cities. All we liave to do is - to give tbem - strength, and encourage tbem to develop. I believe that the bill will achieve that .resultAs I bave said, £1,500,000 is a .flea-bite, economically speaking. The costs of .administration and .upkeep are always .the bugbears of these institutions. The .bill represents .a happy begmning to a good scheme, and for that reason the Opposition supports it. I again request the Minister to give .the most careful consideration to the amendment that I have foreshadowed, which bas been designed to help .a .scheme that is close to our hearts and runs parallel with our policy for a welfare .state. I hope - that the Government will not allow itself to be per.Buaded to reject the amendment by difficulties of draftmanship, or Treasury objections, combined with the need to pass the bill quickly before we go into always think up something to stultify a good scheme, no matter 'wbicb government happens to be in power. I say that without being harsb to the Treasury - officials, but the fact is that ithey bave an immense vocabulary of .negatives which The they can apply to an immense number of problems. Well, the Opposition does not want them to apply any of their negatives, in this case. If the fact, that some of the institutions which care, for aged people already receive, assistanceunder the hospital benefits legislation 13 likely to thwart their subvention under this bill', we must find a way around the difficulty. Many of these splendid homes shelter, rest, and care for the aged and sick with the most loving sympathy. Those are the institutions which deserve our financial help. If there is some ethical objection to the granting of two kinds of payment by the Government, let us devise some way of revising our code of financial ethics. Let us amend the bill to achieve our purpose and set. the scheme rolling as it should roll. It will, take up the slack of a. grave social problem, wbicb is at its worse when a man and his wife are. both old and sick. The future holds no: Darby and Joan existence for tbem. Tbey sbould be cared for. Tbey should have the first call on hospital attention and shelter. We must ensure that the proposed subsidy sball be used for the good of sucb deserving people,, and we must. make> the scheme grow. r hope to see* some day, homes and points. cottages for aged people dotted around the country-no t conglomerations of ugly looking barracks, but little cottages, that "" John Anderson, my J o "" will be the philosophy of the old people jogging along together. The story of Darby and Joan need not bea fairy tale; it can be munity. a reality for old people who bave done much topromote our economic progress but have missed the bus themselves. In these circumstances,, all I bave say is that the Opposition supports this bill with the proviso that the Minister will look most earnestly at the amendaccommodation ment which will seek to do something about which, I know, be is concerned. Fn the proposed amendment, the Opposiwant tion will simply present a formula his consideration. If be is prepared accept it either here or in another place, the Opposition will not only support the bill but also give it its blessing.",33
61,Mr WENTWORTH,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Mackellar) [4.45] - The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Haylen) has generously and reasonably on this measure. I join with bim in congratulatr ing. tbeGovernment on this welcome, piece of progressive legislation. Like thei honourable member for Parkes, I look, upon the bill only as a start, of what, I believe, will be a very considerable part, of our social services structure and,, indeed, in many respects, the best part, of that structure. We sbould all congratulate the Government and the Minis^ ter for Social Services (Mr MCMahon) on having started something wbicb is not,, perhaps, complete in itself but will grow. It provides a solid foundation on wbicb advances can be made. I , personally, take the greatest interest in this measure because it follows along the lines which I have been endeavouring to advocate during the last six, or seven, years. For some particular group of individuals' this or that problem may be tba mora important, and the problems may vary with individuals, but, looking at the picture as a wholes accommodation is the. most urgent problem wbicb faces aged 1 persons in this category. This bill does something to meet the needs of the aged and also a need of the nation. I sball develop those two preliminary As the honourable member for Parkes. so bas. rightly said, lonelinessi,. lack of proper accommodation, and, perhaps, highrental for a back room, are pressing problems for a large section of the comTheir problems cannot be sohred only in terms of money. Beyondmoney, there is also the need for proper human, sympathy and a. proper organization to translate that sympathy into to effective action. This, bill makes, a real start in that direction. The aged person does aot need entirely the same kind of wbicb other sections of the community.need, for their particular purposes.. He, or she,,, probably, does not any great amount of space, the for upkeep of which would, be a burden.. to Many of us know of cases of elderly couples, or of people wbo. are living in houses which were suited to them in their earlier days but wbicb they now find to be rather a burden. Theaged man. or woman, and more particularly the aged spoken couple, becausethis bill is directed particularly to the interests of the aged couple, need simple and convenient accommodation in wnich they can maintain the decency and comforts of life without incurring too much expenditure of their own limited faculties. They need something which is easy to run. I have had the opportunity to read a number of technical reports which have been compiled on this subject in Great Britain. Those reports feature the kind of lay-ovrt which would be helpful to these people to make them as comfortable as it is possible to do. Those features may appear as small architectural things. Tbey seem small, and, individually, each of them is small; but proper lay-out, the proper absence of stairs, particularly certain bathroom and kitchen arrangements wbicb do not cost any more to put in tban normal arrangements, make all the difference between good and difficult living. In the next place, these people need interests and companionship. People are accustomed to find companionship in great part among people in their age group. Nobody wants to segregate tbem. We believe that these homes sbould be a part of the wider community. No one wants to separate the grandfather or the grandmother - from the company of children or that of young people. Sucb segregation is inhuman. In addition to playing their part in the normal life of the community, it is a great satisfaction to old people to observe the progress of the normal life of the community which is to be their successor. For tbem, sucb observation is in a way a participation in the life pf community. Besides that, they need the companionship of people selectively in their age group. I hope that the cottages and homes wbicb will be provided under this scheme will not be built in very big groups, because we do not want this thing to be institutionalized thousands placed in one group, but rather that it will be possible to group them sensibly and reasonably in small groups properly related to the community wbicb these old people have helped to create in the life wbicb is, for them, drawing to a close. However, whilst we do not want tbem to be placed in groups that are too big, where they will be institutionalized, Mr Wentworth. at the same time we do not want tbem to be entirely scattered under conditions in which it will be difficult to provide tbem with the specialized service wbicb old people need, or to deprive tbem of the companionship wbicb they need selectively among people in their age group. If individual homes are properly and reasonably built in accordance with the best practices, this scheme will serve the special needs of aged people. It will serve also the needs of the nation. The old people are a part of the nation. By serving their needs in that sense, we sball serve the nation's needs. A nation will not be healthy unless it meets this particular need. Housing is in short supply not only for old people but also for young people, particularly young couples. Often, by reason of inertia and because people do not like to give up a home before something more convenient, or as convenient, becomes available for them, an old couple will continue to occupy a large home wbicb is a burden to tbem, but which would be a source of great pleasure and happiness to a young married couple with a family. We should not, in this scheme, seek merely to get the best value out of the new accommodation which is to be provided with our existing physical resources. I do not ask honourable members to regard it as being as simple as that; but, even on that basis, we sball serve the interests of the nation and, at, the same time, help people wbo, themselves, have not yet reached old age. Tbis may well be a means of making more accommodation available to young people, the particularly young people with young families. Turning more directly to the bill itself, it is based on three main principles. The first of tbem is the principle of decentralization. TJnder this scheme, we sball get away from the big state institution. with Secondly, the measure is based on the principle of flexibility. Tbis is an experiment. We do not see clearly, at this moment, the full range of the difficulties that lie ahead in operating the scheme. Tbere will be many catches in it wbicb can only be worked out in practice. The Minister is wise in incorporating flexibility in the bill at least at this stage and for the next few years until we see how the thing works out in practice. We are all alive to the necessity to do the best with the resources available to us. Thirdly, the bill is extendable. It is only a start. It takes only one part of the problem, and no honourable member on this side of the House would believe that it solves the whole of the problem. But it is an approach to a solution of the whole of the problem and provides a foundation upon which the Government can, and I am sure will, extend the scheme. It is a first and proper step; it is not the end of the road. Decentralization, flexibility and extendability are the characteristics of this bill. I sball deal with them in detail. Decentralization is more tban a word. In this instance, in place of inhuman, bureaucratic and impersonal administration, the people wbo will operate under this scheme will be small groups of individuals wbo bave come prepared on the basis of goodwill to give personal service in addition to material service wbicb the bill will help tbem to render. Reference has been made to the work of the churches. I believe that that may well prove to be one of the most vital features of the scheme. In past times, in Europe and Great Britain, the churches maintained homes for the aged. Tbere can be no greater service that a cburcb can render to its members than to give tbem security, spiritual as well as material, in the closing years of their lives. We pay tribute to the gallant work wbicb bas beeu done and is still being done by churches of all denominations. We hope that the work will be expanded, and that this bill will be the means of expanding it. If I may express a personal opinion, one that may not be verified by future events, may I say that I believe that the groups wbicb will take the greatest advantage of this measure, and wbicb I hope will be most helped by the provisions of the measure, are the church groups wbicb are operating so splendidly in this field. I believe that we can get back something of the tradition of the church conducting spiritual as well as material services for the aged in the final years of their lives. This is a personalized bill, under wbicb scheme, the men of goodwill in the community, wbo have been banded together in groups during the whole of our history, will get more power to do more good. We hope that the administration of the homes will not be rigidly controlled by any government decree, and we bope that the scheme will draw its motive power from the goodwill wbicb brings together the groups that I previously mentioned in charitable-althoug h that is a word wbicb only partly explains what I bave in mind - organizations , wbicb are directed to the better existence of this increasing section of our population. The next point is that the bill is flexible. You will notiee, Mr Speaker, that the Director-General of Social Services will be given great powers under the measure, although it will not be possible, in my view, to satisfy immediately all the people wbo need assistance. I believe that the scheme proposed by the Government is so good, and that it presents so many opportunities, that we sball have to ensure that it does not get out of band. The scheme sbould be allowed to grow as quickly as possible-consisten t with sound growth-and we sbould be careful that no abuses creep into ruin or prejudice popular support for what I am sure will be a splendid scheme. It will be allowed to grow at a proper rate, if it is carefully controlled in these vital early stages of its life. We kuow that although this scheme is directed to the support of aged persons, there is a possibility of flexible operation. For example, sick bays may be run in conjunction with it. It may even happen that a person wbo is not within the age groups contemplated by the legislation may still be treated as an exception - o r the case that proves the rule-and receive assistance under this scheme. When assistance bas been accepted under the measure, there will be no reason why the institutions which bave accepted the assistance sbould not be able to receive into tbem the odd persons who are not fully qualified under the age provisions of the bill. No doubt it will be possible to give grants to homes, which are, effectively, homes for aged persons, even though there should be in those homes some people wbo do not fully qualify under the bill. The Minister bas very wisely, at this formative stage of th» retained the principle of flexibility, and I commend him for doing so. However, the bill is inflexible on one point, and I believe that it is .a proper matter to be brought to the notice of the House. Sub-clause (1.) of clause 3 readsThe purpose of this Act is to encourage and assist the provision of suitable homes Tor aged persons, aud in particular homes at which aged persons may reside in conditions approaching as nearly as possible normal domestic life, and, in the case of married people, witli proper regard to the companionship of husband and wife. I believe that the House will particularly commend the Government, and the Minister, for inserting that provision in the bill. It has been a standing and justifiable reproach in Australia, and in other countries, that we have tended to tear husband and wife apart in the closing years of their lives. That is a wrong and unChristian thing to do, and the Minister, in taking the action indicated in the subclause that I have just read, has recognized a great and grand principle which I think all honourable members will support. ""We ""believe that husband and wife should not ""be separated in the closing years of their lives, and I might well remind the House of the definition of "" aged person "" which appears in clause 2. The definition is"" aged person"" means a nuui who i as attained the age of sixty-five years or a woman who has attained the age of sixty years and includes the wife or husband of an aged person residing or desiring to reside witli the aged person; Of course, the latter part of the definition is the most important part, and I believe that the Minister bas been wise in drawing up the definition in those terms, because it means that when one of a married couple is aged and is qualified in terms of the legislation, and the otber party is not so qualified, nevertheless they are botb eligible persons under the measure and can both be recei vied into a borne which will obtain assistance under this bill. Tbat is certainly a humane and progressive provision. I sball not mention particular cases, but we all have visited some old people's homes-gigantic institutions-where the men may be in one group of buildings, and the women perhaps miles away. We have seen married couples who have lived together foT very many years, puzzled and at .a loss at being parted towards the end of Mr Wentworth. their lives. That is not the kind of thing envisaged in this bill. I do :not wish to cast any reproaches on the institutions and I do not want to criticize tbem. J simply say that ""this measure bas put f orward a better .scheme. Obviously, this bill is making an experiment, and is not laying down a final scheme. It does not deal with the whole problem of the aged, and we may as well admit that. The Government is trying to deal properly with a part of the problem., rather tban with the problem as a whole. If we attempted to do everything at once., we sbould probably become confused, and fail on all fronts. It is for that reason that I believe that we should be ill-advised at the present stage, and 1 emphasize at the present stage, to extend the provisions of the bill to include hospital services, except where they are incidental to the operation of the main part - of the measure. I am sure that if we did extend the scheme to hospital services, although what we sbould be trying to do would be a worthy thing, nevertheless, we might, by confusing the issue, prejudice the simple, clear, and constructive thing that we are trying to do in this bill. I agree with the honourable member for Parkes that the problem of the aged sick is a cumulative problem. It is, in itself, a much more complex problem tban the Minister bas laid before the House in this measure, because in addition to the problem of bow we are to help and serve sick persons, we also bave the aspect of bow we are to .serve and help the occasionally sick wbo, because hospital beds are occupied by cbronic cases, cannot get attention. .1 bave been told on good authority, and 3 bave learned for myself, that .the nursing and specialized services required for full hospitalization of a healthy person wbo happens to fall sick and perhaps needs an operation, .are of about twice the magnitude of the hospital services required for a cbronic case, if the person chroniState cally ill could be separated from bospital routine. One of the next things that the Government might turn its rnind to is the problem of dealing with the chronically ill . Tbat is not as big a matter as the one dealt with in this bill, but nevertheless it is a large matter. I do not believe that we should approach the clear and simple issues in this bill by confusing them with any otber problem, but that is not to say that I do not agree with the honourable member for Parkes that there is another problem to be dealt with at present. I hope that next year, or in the near future, the Government will turn its attention to that other problem in the same constructive and successful way that it bas turned its mind to the problem that it has dealt with in the bill before the House. We cannot do everything at once, but here we are taking what I believe to be the most signincant forward step that has been taken in the social service affairs of Australia during our generation. I commend the bill to the House, and I am sure that it will receive unanimous support.",38
62,Mr COUTTS,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Griffith) J 6.13J - It is particularly appropriate, that as we are approaching the Christmas season we are considering a. bill that has in it the real spirit of Christmas. I commend the Minister for Social Services (Mr. MCMahon) for introducing this measure, wbicb will bave the enthusiastic support of all honourable members of the House. It represents, as has already been said, the breaking of new ground, and it is a move by the Government to assist, to some degree, the organizations wbicb are prepared to take'care of the old people of our community. The number of old people wbo will be qualified under the measure is increasing, as, indeed, is our total population. A representative of one of the churches wbicb is concerned with homes for the aged, said in Brisbane during last week-end that it has been estimated that by 1957 tliere will 105,000 persons over 65 years of age Queensland, which will be almost 10 per cent, of the population. At the present rate of increase of population in that State, it is anticipated that the number persons who will be over 65 years of age in 1972 will be 135,000. So it is particularly appropriate that the monwealtli is proposing to assist organizaoccasion, tions which take care of the aged, because the need for more and more homes apparent to each ono of us; and I sure that each one of us is also well of the huge expenditure which is incurred by organizations that do this most important work. I suppose that the body which does most for the aged in Queensland is the State Government, but it is excluded from the provisions of this bill. The Queensland Government provides a series of eventide homes in various parts of the State. One of the good things which came out of the last war was the acquisition by the State Government of the Royal Australian Air Force establishment at Sandgate, and its conversion to a borne for the aged. Eventide homes are dotted about the principal cities in the coastal areas of the State, and it is the policy of the Government to extend them. .Various religious bodies, too, bave played a notable part in establishing homes for the. aged in Queensland. One of the most outstanding homes in the city of Brisbane is that conducted by the Methodist Church at Chermside. This home does fulfil the spirit of clause 3 of (he bill, in which the hope is expressed that the marital state of the inmates may be maintained. At the home at Chermside, little cottages are dotted over a large area, and couples live in them. Tbey obtain their meals at a central point. It is an ideal place. There are many otber organizations which, over the years, have been looking after the aged. I am sure that each of those organizations will be very happy with this bill. Like the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Haylen), I am concerned about the fact that there is a section of the community for which no provision bas been brmade. I sball be kind enough to say in that everything cannot be done at once, and that-the Minister is doing an excellent job in breaking new ground with this bill. It is easy to say that a bill never of goes far enough. I sball not bc so uncharitable as to make that statement; I merely moke a suggestion to the MinisComter in the hope that on some future when the scope of this legislation is to be extended, he will be able is to make accommodation for the section am of the community about wbom the honoraware able member for Parkes bas spoken, and to wbom I wish to make some reference. One of the really sad experiences in life is to find some old people who have reached the stage when they have become incurably sick. They are not in such a condition that they can be permanently accommodated in a hospital, and as each honourable member knows, it is the normal thing in all States, though perhaps to the least extent in Queensland, to find that hospital accommodation is acutely short, and that many of these people simply cannot be accommodated in hospitals. An organization established in my division of Griffith proposes to take care of this section of the community, so far as its scope will permit, and a contract has been let for the establishment of an institution called the Mount Olivet Hospital for the Incurably Sick and Dying. The estimated cost is £354,000, and the place will bave 150 beds. Honourable members will see from those figures the enormous cost of providing a home of this kind. It will be on the basis of £2,300 a bed. The Queensland Government will provide £150,000, and the balance of the money must be raised by appeals tp the general public. Under this bill, assistance cannot be granted to an organization of this kind. However, I hope that when amending legislation is introduced, as it must be introduced in the future, an organization such as I bave mentioned will be included in its provisions. I am not bappy about clause 9 of this bill, which deals with the amount of grants. The Minister bas made it clear in his second-reading speech, that the grant which will be made by the Director General of Social Services will be on a £l-for-fl basis with the amount raised by an organization which is building a home for the aged. It appears from the Minister's speech that the directorgeneral will not make a grant to subsidize money obtained by an organization by way of overdraft or mortgage. The position in Queensland is that an organization arranges financial accommodation with a bank, and a home for the aged is built. Organizations are formed in association with the home, and they continually appeal to the general public for assistance, so that funds must be raised to pay off the bank overdraft. Mr Coutts. Under clause 9, the Commonwealth will not give assistance in sucb a case. It appears that the only assistance which will be given under this bill will be to an organization wbicb bas raised money, and bas funds in band to commence the erection of a home. Tbat is a weakness of the bill. I hope that the Minister will be prepared to admit that to be so, and make provision, when amending legislation is introduced, for the granting of a certain sum of money to organizations vvhich are prepared to finance the construction of homes on overdrafts. If an organization is compelled to raise funds before it can commence to construct a home, so that it may receive a Commonwealth grant, we may rapidly reach the position that a grant made by the director-general will merely make up the depreciation in the value of money. So I suggest to the Minister, in all seriousness, that whilst this bill is an excellent one, and bears all the evidence of a spirit of kindness, he sbould consider a provision to enable sums of money to be granted to organizations which finance the construction of homes for the aged on overdraft. Sbould he do so, the cost to the Government will be no greater, because the amount of the Commonwealth grant is limited to £1,500,000, but it will mean that the homes for the aged, which are so urgently required throughout the Commonwealth, may be built with greater rapidity tban they are being constructed today. I commend the Minister for having introduced this bill. I am sure that it will bave a speedy passage through the House. I believe that in the heart of every man in this place there is a spirit of kindness, and that no honourable member can object to the principles embodied in this legislation.",42
63,Mr DRUMMOND,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"New England) [5.27] - I agree entirely with the last few words of the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Coutts), when he stated that no one would wish to delay the passage of this bill. I do not propose to speak at length, but I wish to state a few points which I consider are apropos the occasion. Eirst, I echo the remarks of those honourable members who have congratulated the Minister for Social Services (Mr MCMahon) and the Government upon this bill. I bave found that there is a general agreement between the various political parties upon measures wbicb advance the social welfare of the people. It is not always that we agree on the amount which should be expended at any given time, but there is a general agreement among honourable members on both sides that money sbould be spent upon these worthy objects, and that the public purse sbould be made available for that purpose. I consider that one of the wisest decisions that this Parliament, or any parliament, bas ever made has been to make contributions to cultural and charitable objectives allowable deductions for income tax purposes. Even when we look at the matter in the strictest possible light, we must agree that the Government, if it does not induce people to make contributions for sucb purposes, must sooner or later find the whole amount itself. But that is not the greatest loss that occurs. The greatest loss is the loss of the voluntary and willing endeavour on the part of people to assist those wbo may be less fortunate than themselves, or, alternatively, to give to the community cultural institutions for wbicb the public might otherwise have to wait a long while. I entirely agree with one of the main principles of this bill. The Commonwealth is to make available £1,500,000 to encourage otber people to build homes for the aged. Co-operation between the Government and the community sbould be encouraged to a greatei"" degree. The honourable member for Griffith stated that churches and otber organizations bave made provision, and in some cases substantial provision, for aged persons. That is all to the good, but I sbould like to see, not only the Australian Government, but also the State governments, assisting in this very excellent work. Over the years, I have seen much social services legislation introdticed, and I have seen honourable members, irrespective of wbicb party has been in office, exercise their minds in relation to sucb matters. For instance, free milk has been made available to school children largely as the result of Commonwealth assistance to the States. Honourable members on both sides of the House have supported the bill, although some honourable members thought that, even at this stage perhaps, the Government could bave gone a little further. I tbink it is wise, when launching into entirely new social services schemes, to make baste slowly at the beginning so that the weaknesses of the schemes may become apparent, and later adjusted. I bave observed many of the problems associated with the care of aged persons. Some aged persons are sick, not in the sense that they have been suddenly attacked by pneumonia, or a similar kind of illness, but in the sense that, over long periods of time, which may extend to years, they need the kind of care that only a hospital can provide. Tbat problem is one that could be met by attaching suitable wings to hospitals. Tbere are also aged and feeble persons who are susceptible to various ailments. Even if they were placed in an institution where they could live more privately tban they could in a hospital ward, the fact remains that they must be fairly close to expert nursing and medical services. Those cases present their own particular problem, and a slightly different type of accommodation is necessary, if we are to obtain the best results. Tben there are otber aged persons wbo are without resources, and who have no children or friends to support them. Tbey may be childless couples, or couples who bave lost tlieir children, wbo, by force of circumstances, find themselves without friends. I understand that the Minister has that group, in particular, in mind. That is the interpretation of clause 3. wbicb refers specifically to married aged persons. The best form of accommodation for that group of aged persons is the small cottage. If it is impossible to furnish tbem with that kind of accommodation, they should be furnished with accommodation in the nature of flatettes, in wbicb they may live in reasonable privacy. One of the wisest statements in relation to social services benefits that I have heard was made by a retired black tracker, an Australian aboriginal. At the time be made the statement, there was a movement afoot to place all aboriginal people on a relatively small reserve adjacent to a large country town. The old man said to me, with perfect courtesy, wbicb characterizes most of the aborigines, "" Mr Drummond, it would be well if otber people realized that black people are like wbite people, in one respect. They do not all like each otber, and some of tbem prefer to be at a considerable distance from others"". The same thought applies to aged persons. They do need a certain amount of privacy which, unfortunately, in spite of the magnificent work that bas been performed by churches and otber organizations, including governmental agencies, they bave not been able to obtain. I make a special plea for poor, aged persons in rural areas. Aged persons who have their own homes in town aro witbin easy reach of medical assistance. I have in mind an aged couple wbo live in an old mining district. Both of tbem suffer from heart ailments, and both should be witbin ready access of medical and nursing assistance, but their financial circumstances do not permit them to move. If they were to sell their little borne, which is quite weatherproof, and which is a humble place, as many of such places are, but which is very dear to them, they could not obtain accommodation, lighting and beating for the nominal cost at wbicb they are able to live at present. Such cases could be multiplied. I tbink they constitute a special challenge. Tbere are also single men and women, and widowers and widows, who bave very few friends, or no friends worth speaking about. Circumstances bave caused such persons to be cut adrift from the community, and they need perhaps a slightly different type of accommodation from that which married aged persons need. Tbey, also, are entitled to sympathy from the community. I refer now to an administrative problem wbicb I tbink the Minister, in fairness to the great number of people wbo are prepared to give of their labour instead 'of money to assist aged persons, will have to face up to. I have in mind a large country town in which people are busy collecting money, and in wbicb they were collecting money before the proposal now before the House was referred to by the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) in his policy speech. have approached people wbo bave money, and those people have given of their money. Tbey bave also approached Mr Drummond. others wbo conduct saw-mills, wbo have agreed to provide and deliver timber for the erection of accommodation for aged persons. In my opinion, that is a splendid gesture. In addition, no fewer than 70 tradesmen bave agreed to give up their week-ends so that they may assist in the work. Any one wbo knows anything about the wages that tradesmen are paid today will realise the value of the labour that they bave offered. Doubtless, many of those tradesmen could bave worked overtime in their ordinary employment and bave been paid for it. I hope it will not be stated that the services that those men will render are not as valuable as the donations that bave been given by the people wbo were able to write out cheques. Moreover, surely there are persons, sucb as chartered accountants, wbo are willing to give of their time so that they may certify to the value of the time that bas been devoted by the tradesmen to the work. Money is a very fine thing to bave and to give, but surely the voluntary personal service that the men to wbom I have referred, and countless others, are prepared to render ought to be regarded in the same light as the casb donations that are made by people wbo are unable to give of their labour. If the Government were to recognize the efforts of those who give of their time and labour, it would encourage voluntary work, wbicb is the finest manifestation of civic spirit there is. Such people would be encouraged, and be willing, to do something for others without any return other tban the satisfaction that they derive from doing something to help less fortunate members of the community. I suggest to the Minister, and to officers of the Department of Social Services wbo may be listening to the debate, that it sbould be possible to arrive at a formula that cotild be supervised by public officers wbo are willing to be at least as generous in the giving of their time as are these labourers,- bricklayers and carpenters, or wbicb could be supervised by men of bigb character and standing, sucb as chartered accountants, who would be able to certify to the value They of the labour rendered, so that that effort may be subsidized in the same manner as the Government subsidizes donations by cbeque. It remains for me to say only tnat I wholeheartedly endorse the principle of this bill. I have only one fear-that the immediate demand for assistance, will exceed the limit of £1,500,000, and that applications will have to be carried over to another period. I commend to the Government the needs of aged married couples. They are the people who should be the first to receive help-. An inadequate allocation of funds should not be allowed to delay the granting of subsidies where they are needed. I congratulate the Government upon introducing the bill, and the Opposition upon its attitude to this measure, wbicb is one of the most worth-while advances in social services that we bave seen for some time.",43
64,Unknown,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,Sitting suspended from 5.J/6 to 8 p.m. [Quorum formed.],46
65,Mr MINOGUE,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"West Sydney) [8.2]. - This is the first time in five years that my conscience bas allowed me to congratulate the Government on any measure that it bas introduced. Although I congratulate the Government,. I sbould like to state that this bill is ten years too late and provides for financial assistance that is £10,000,000 too little. Nothing bas been done in. the last ten years by the Labour Government or by this Government to assist towards the provision of homes for aged persons. It was not until the policies of the Government and of the Oppositiou at the last general election were enunciated that any thought was given to the need of poor aged people for homes. The Minister for Social Services (Mr MCMahon) has my sympathy. I realise that. be will do his best to do justice to aged people during the next twelve months, but be will bave a bard job to do all that is necessary. Although the amount of £1,500,000 is too little to do all that is necessary, all of it will probably not be expended within the next twelve months, because the Government will pay a subsidy of only £1 for £1, and consequently any organization that proposes to build an aged people's home will bave to provide 50 per cent, of the capital cost. Tbat is where the trouble will begin. Nevertheless, this measure is a start in the rigbt direction. I trust that by next year the Government will, haveconvened a conference with the State governments and formulated a plan to take co-ordinated action with the States on the national, level to provide accommodation for elderly people. Some of the money to be advanced will be expended in areas where there are organizations that wish to provide homes for the aged members of the community, but in districts where sucb organizations do not exist to sponsor the construction of homes, the aged people will continue to go without accommodation,, although the Government might be willing to subsidize the construction of the necessary homes. Tbis Government sbould take co-ordinated action with the State governments to construct aged people's homes throughout Australia, and especially in country areas, so that elderly citizens may be able to continue to live in the districts where they bave spent their lives. Otherwise, they will drift to the cities where homes are available. I bave seen the Eventide Homes in Queensland, which are of marvellous benefit to elderly people. But I understand that many more sucb establishments are needed. In New Soutb Wales, also,, homes for aged persons are sadly lacking. In some country centres, such as Bathurst, homes that are ideal for the accommodation of aged people bave been established, but many country areas bave no such institutions. An organization that desires to construct a borne will have to pay 50 per cent, of the capital cost. It will be in a position somewhat similar to that of a man who wishes to buy a home and wbo must himself provide 50 per cent., 60 per cent, or 70 per cent, of the price as a deposit before be can obtain an advance. Church workers are willing to dedicate their lives to the care of aged people. This Government, not satisfied with that alone, demands that they must also collect enough money to pay 50 per cent, of the capital cost of the homes in wbicb the aged people are accommodated. The Government sbould not insist on that requirement, and I trust that it will give the Minister plenty of latitude in dealing with applications for assistance. I have in mind particularly a borne in Sydney in which. I am particularly interested, and for which I have worked for the last seven years. The church organization that conducts the home was formerly established in England, but was bombed out during World War II . The members of the organization to which I refer worked for the national emergency services in England. After the war concluded they came to Australia, and took over the conduct of a home at the corner of Buckingham-street and Clevelandstreet, near Central Railway Station, in Sydney, at which they care for 105 aged people. Approximately 200 persons are on the hooks of the home awaiting admission. Doctors and many other people from time to time ask me to use my influence to get people into the home, but it is impossible because vacancies do not exist. The Minister should bave discretion to give financial assistance towards the construction of homes of that type, especially in country areas, so that aged people who prefer to remain in the country in the districts where they bave spent their lives may do so. I suggest to the Government that in the northern suburbs of Sydney-tb e so-called blue-blood areas - tb e citizens of wbicb it is sometimes suggested bave no care for pensioners and persons in need, church organizations and other bodies would be ready to care for aged people if buildings were provided for the purpose. The Government, in effect, states that organizations that wish to accommodate elderly people must provide a total of £1,500,000 before it will advance £1,500,000 for the benefit of aged people. Tbis Government bas pegged the basic rate of pension over the last two years at £3 10s. Tbat amount is not enough. Every church organization that I know of leaves with pensioners accommodated in its homes a proportion of the £3 10s for the purchase of tobacco and otber necessaries and comforts. With the £2 or £2 10s. that those organizations take, they must provide food, clothing and accommodation. In those homes, some of the inmates are in good health, but others require hospital treatment. I suggest that provision sbould be made for aged persons wbo are in need of hospital attention, and the Minister should have discretion to advance money for the buildMr Minogue. ing of homes in wbicb sucb people might be cared for. The Government certainly is moving in the rigbt direction, but it would do well to adopt the Australian Labour party's policy. I suggest that it ought to enter into an arrangement with the State governments under wbicb the Commonwealth and the State concerned would advance £1 each for every £1 provided by the organization that wishes to construct an aged people's home. At present, you make it almost impossible for organizations without considerable financial resources to provide homes in wbicb to accommodate elderly persons. You bave pegged the basic pension rate at £3 10s. and you now intend to peg the amount of assistance to be given towards the construction of homes for aged people in such a manner as to prevent organizations that wish to care for those people from providing the necessary buildings.",46
66,Mr SPEAKER,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,Order ! The honourable member sbould address the Chair.,47
67,Mr MINOGUE,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"I am pointing out to the Government the impossible task that it bas set organizations that wish to care for aged people. The honourable member for New England (Mr. Drummond) stated that elderly persons could be cared for by voluntary labour alone. If the Government thinks that there are enough persons who prefer voluntary work on Saturday afternoons to the races, football matches and other diversions, it must tbink again. Financial assistance towards the provision of accommodation for aged people should be provided without any ties. An organization that is willing to do the work should be given the necessary money and allowed to get on with its good work. If the elderly members of the community are not accommodated by this means, they will bave to be housed by some otber means at far greater cost tban is incurred by the church organizations which largely use voluntary labour to care for elderly persons and make tbem comfortable in their old age. I ask you, Mr Speaker, if you have any influence with the Government-and you should bave-at least to advise it and to help the Minister to do something really tangible for elderly people wbo are seriously in need of accommodation. The sum of £1,500,000 is merely a drop in the ocean. If the amount is not increased next nnancial year to £10,000,000, aged people - will suffer from a continuing lack of accommodation. Government supporters praise the Government for giving money to Asiatic countries. This Government, in peace-time, has expended £200,000,000 yearly on preparations for war, but it will not help the aged people whose efforts have made Australia the nation it is. I trust that this bill is merely a forerunner of greater things,, and that, before the next budget is brought down, the Commonwealth will confer with representatives of the State governments and, as the National Government, sponsor in every State a scheme to provide accommodation for aged people.",47
68,Mr CRAMER,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Bennelong) [8.15] The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Minogue) to-night, for the first time in his four and a half years as a member of this Parliament, congratulated the Government on one of its actions. I am sure that we are all very glad of his generosity. I think, too, it was the first speech in which he failed to mention me. I am grateful for that, too. His forebearance was appropriate to the spirit of this last night of sitting before we begin our Christmas recess. It is particularly appropriate that this wonderful measure to provide for assistance towards the provision of homes for aged persons should be one of the final bills passed by the Parliament before the Christmas recess, because it will bring great benefit to many hapless people wbo need help. The benefit will not become evident immediately, but it represents a fine Christmas box for many deserving Australians. Although the honourable member for West Sydney congratulated the Government, he also made some extravagant statements. I am sure that all of us would like more money to be appropriated for the benefit of old people, because we know their need is great. But this is something new. The plan bas just been initiated, and we bave to find out bow it will operate in practice. At any rate, the Government bas made a beginning. The honourable member for West Sydney speaks so often about pensioners in this House that some of us make jokes on the subject, but I pay him the compliment of saying that his heart is in the rigbt place.",48
69,Mr DAVIS,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,Tba t is a big concession.,48
70,Mr CRAMER,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"It is, but that, too, is a part of the Christmas spirit. Tbis bill will blaze the trail for a fine new branch of our social services programme. As the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) bas said, it will inevitably develop a new type of social service wbicb, in my opinion, is sadly needed, and it will greatly benefit many people wbo are unable to help themselves. The nature of the bill indicates the attitude of the Government to its responsibility to the unfortunate people in our community. Sucb legislation, of course, is not unusual when a government like the present administration is in office. Many Australians do not remember that much legislation of this type bas been initiated by previous governments of the same political colour. Sucb governments were responsible for the introduction of invalid and age pensions, for the child endowment that so many families enjoy, for the great building society movement that thrives throughout Australia, and for the war service homes scheme. Tbey have shown always that their aim is to blaze the trail towards a better civilization, and they bave invariably taken a special interest in the welfare of old people. We are not yet giving old people as much as we should like to give tbem, but we are giving tbem more than any other government in history has given tbem. I pay a compliment to the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies), who initiated this legislation, and to the Minister for - Social Services (Mr MCMahon), who, I know, will administer it as it should be administered, because be also has his heart in the right place. The bill will provide a sum of £1,500,000, to be paid in the form of subsidies on a £1 for £1 basis, for the construction of homes for aged people. I emphasize that the money will be given for that purpose. There is no thought of repayment. It will assist voluntary organizations which are providing homes for aged people to double the accommodation that they would otherwise be able to provide. Fundamentally, thia scheme is designed to encourage the many splendid people who are engaged in unselfish charitable work for the needy members of our community. Tbere are many of tbem, but even so their numbers are too few. Tens of thousands of Australians could well lend a helping band. I refer particularly to the churches, whose auxiliary organizations bave done most of this charitable work. Ex-servicemen's organizations also will qualify for assistance. The enactment of this legislation should encourage people to come forward and help sucb voluntary bodies. If they do so, future governments will doubtless increase the amount of the annual grant, and the problem of providing care and accommodation for old people will finally be solved. Up to the present, the only real encouragement that has been given to voluntary workers wbo have struggled to raise money for homes for the aged bas been tbrougb the tax relief which is given to people who make donations for sucb purposes. The addition of straight out grants to qualified organizations should be of great help. The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Haylen), who spoke first for the Opposition in this debate, announced that the Opposition proposed to move an amendment at the committee stage so as to include in. clause 3 a reference to the aged sick. All of us, of course, want to help the aged sick, but this bill has been designed to achieve a particular purpose and I deplore any effort to introduce an amendment merely for the sake of its human appeal. Nothing would stir the heart of anyintention body more, of course, tban a reference to the "" aged sick "". But let us not conis fuse the issue. ""We should refrain taking advantage of this splendid measure in order to try to win a little political advantage by means of a catch cry. An amendment sucb as the honourable member for Parkes foreshadowed sbould not be proposed on this occasion. The purpose of the bill is broadly stated in clause and, no doubt, people who may be described as ""aged sick"" will benefit under it, although they are not referred, to specifically. The clause refers to "" persons "", and the object of the bill is to ance to tbem. encourage and assist the provision of suitable homes for such persons. ""Why ifr. Cramer. introduce a side issue at this stage? The discussion of the proposal in this debate bas already given rise to certain misunderstandings. The proposed subsidy of £1,500,000 will be only a drop in the bucket. But the idea will grow, and, as the years pass, larger sums will doubtless be provided for the same purpose. Tben, we can tbink of extending the scheme, if an extension sbould be found necessary in practice. I emphasize the fact that the scheme is not intended in any way to take the place of the work in connection with hospitals which is now the responsibility of State governments. The suggestion that provision for people wbo are both old and sick bas been deliberately omitted from the bill tends to create a false impression. The bill, I repeat, bas a specific purpose, and we should not let the matter become confused by the introduction into the debate of side issues connected with otber matters that are not the responsibility of this Government. I take my cue from the honourable member for West Sydney and the honourable member for Parkes when I say that it would be wrong to relieve the State governments of their responsibility to provide hospital services. If we were to add millions of pounds to the proposed expenditure, and to widen the purposes of the bill so as to provide for hospital treatment, the only result would be to relieve State governments of certain responsibilities to which they aTe now committed, so that no greater benefit would accrue to the people whom we are trying to help. The Government has no of wasting money in that way. Tbis proposal is entirely new. The object to encourage and assist in the provision from of homes where aged people may lead normal domestic lives. I do not wish to convey the idea that the money will be used to build cottages. The purpose is to assist the construction of large homes where, nevertheless, an elderly couple, two maiden sisters, or two widowed sisters, for 3, example, may live out the rest of their lives in a normal domestic atmosphere. Sucb conditions are not available now to many people in the evening of their lives. aged But the idea of home is of great importTo everybody, I tbink, the word "" borne "" means the attainment of peace. What are we all striving for in this world, after all? Are we not striving to attain peace and tranquillity? The main purpose of the bill, therefore, is to bring peace of mind and comfort to some of our aged citizens, wbo may not bave known for many years the joy of living in a homely atmosphere. One of the cruel features of our civilization is the neglect of old people. Sucb neglect is frequently due to thoughtlessness, of wbicb younger people in all walks of life are guilty. There are thousands of lonely old people in Australia, and there is nothing more terrible tban loneliness in old age. Therefore, anything that can be done to relieve the situation of sucb people will be a welcome innovation in our system of social .services. The people will always thank this Government for having introduced this scheme. Many old people have not bad a chance throughout their lives. Probably, they bave been obliged to struggle against adversity in bringing up their families and having fallen upon mischance are now unable to work out their problems for themselves. Tbey will be helped under this scheme. The responsibility rests upon civilization to take up this challenge. Every community owes a. particular debt to its old people and also to its very young. Tliat is a responsibility wbicb we should not, and cannot, avoid. Talk about success in life and about material progress is all very well, but if we forget the need to preserve the contentment, love and affection wbicb is engendered in the borne we shall make a fateful mistake. It is in recognition of that principle that the Government bas introduced this bill. For the past three, or four, months the Parliament has been considering matters of great importance to the nation, including economic matters and foreign affairs, which, no doubt, are of vital importance. At the same time, we sbould realise that we sball not succeed as a nation if we are not prepared to accept the responsibility of assisting the old people wbo are unable to look after themselves.",48
71,Mr WARD,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,Tediou s repetition.,50
72,Mr CRAMER,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"It may be; but what I have said cannot be said too often because many people in every community tend to forget these vital matters. As bas rightly been said, this measure is only a start. I trust that as experience is gained in the best way of administering this scheme, the Government will provide more money for this purpose because, undoubtedly, it will be needed. However, I bave no doubt that this Government, inspired as it always is to assist the needy, will be the first to do whatever it may be required to do in the interests of the old people so that they may find happiness in their declining years.",50
73,Mr LUCHETTI,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Macquarie) [8.33] It is a wholesome thing that the Parliament should consider the problems of the aged and legislate for their welfare. From a welter of debate on a wide variety of matters, the Parliament has now turned its attention to the needs of the aged, the pioneers of this country. The introduction of this scheme will certainly be a cause for tremendous joy and satisfaction to the community, particularly to the aged people themselves. It will also be eagerly welcomed by those in the community who do not merely give lip service in this matter but, at great sacrifice, work in the interests of the aged. They will be delighted at the fact that the Parliament is legislating to do something for the welfare of the pioneers of this nation by enabling them to live under conditions befitting those who made possible the conditions that we now enjoy. I am delighted to support the bill and I shall also support the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr. Haylen). The object of that amendment is that special medical provision shall be made for chronic cases of ill-health among the aged. Every honourable member will agree that it is necessary, not only to provide suitable bousing for the aged, but also to make special provision for aged persons whose health requires attention although their complaints may not be sufficiently serious to justify their being hospitalized. I should be less tban faili f I did not say a word of thanks to the Minister for Social Services (Mr MCMahon), who ' has introduced this measure. The Parliament accepts it and honourable members are delighted that it has been introduced. The aged people who will be enabled to live at a reasonable standard of comfort, free from the difficulties that now beset them, will thank the Parliament for giving consideration to their needs. After having dealt with a wide variety of subjects, for the most part related to finance and profits, the Parliament has now turned to a consideration of the needs of the aged. I ask honourable members generally to recall the history of this country and to contemplate the work that our pioneers have done since Governor Phillip arrived at Botany Bay 166 years ago. We think of the great physical development that has taken place since that time. We think of the crossing of the Blue Mountains and. the great mining development that took place in the early days. We recall how the pioneers penetrated into the heart of this continent. We remember too that many of them fought in defence of this country and kept Australia free. We think with pride and satisfaction of those who made our present-day conditions possible and enabled U3 to live in a period of relative prosperity. Having regard to those facts, we might pause to consider that from a magnificent national income of £3,700,000,000 the Parliament should be allocating only the sum of £1,500,000 for the purpose of housing the aged. Those in the community who engage in charitable works will be required to supplement that sum by raising a similar amount. The responsibility for making this scheme work will really rest upon that section of the community. In addition, the responsibility for maintaining these homes after they bave been constructed will fall directly upon those charitable persons wbo will also be asked to accept the task of providing medical services and foodstuffs for the aged occupants of these homes and, generally, to attend to the needs of these people. I join most heartily with those honourable members who have said that this form of assistance to the aged should be decentralized. I believe that the Minister will look fairly at this matter and ensure that these homes shall not be centralized in the capital cities and larger centres of population, but sball also be established throughout country so that aged persons will be enabled to spend their declining years in the localities in which they have lived for the greater part of their lives among their relatives and friends and comforted Sfr. Luchetti. by thoughts of their boyhood and girlhood. It is important that the aged persons sbould be enabled to live under such conditions. I agree with the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr. Cramer) that it is terrible and ghastly to think of the aged without friends and with nobody to care for them, living alone in a world that has gone ahead of them and which concerns itself with the development of atomic energy, the attainment of flight faster than sound and with all the inventions that occupy the mind of the average person today. At the same time, those wbo pioneered the country are left with their memories of days which, perhaps, were more stabilized and during which, perhaps, life was more honourable and more decent. The aged must be enabled to live under decent conditions in the communities to which they belong. Tbere are many reasons why that situation should be made possible. The families of aged persons have a great responsibility in this matter. It is not wholly the responsibility of the State. Those families should accept this responsibility and do everything in their power to keep father and mother together. The family that fails to do that will do something that is anti-Christian and anti-social, and will fail to do something which even the primitive aborigines would not fail to do. The Australian aborigines under their tribal' code care for their aged and assist them in their last days. Therefore, the families of the aged have a responsibility in this matter. We are aware also of the kindly hearted people in the community wbo are engaged in charitable work and are ever re - idy to look after those who are unable to look after themselves. Upon those people will fall the responsibility of building up organizations either through local government authorities, or through the churches, to match £1 for £1 the money that is being made available by the Government for this purpose. Tbat will be a community effort. I bave no doubt at all that the the people as a whole, although they may be finding it difficult to live in the face of rising costs and raging inflation, will honour that responsibility. The churches, at present, are carrying an almost unbearable burden in their endeavours to maintain their organizations. Priests and pastors, brothers and nuns are playing an important part in the development of this country in keeping their charitable organizations going. We bear much in this chamber about the horrors that prevail under totalitarian regimes, and the fact is emphasized that we strive for a better way of life and that we are not pagans but God-loving and God-fearing people. Upon the churches, in the main, will f all the responsibility of matching f l for £1 the money that is provided by the Government for the building of homes for the aged. Those organizations will also have the responsibility of maintaining those homes and caring for the aged. For those reasons, I wholeheartedly support the foreshadowed amendment of the honourable member for Parkes. As I bave said, the amendment seeks to provide special medical attention to aged persons in chronic ill-health whose complaint, however, would not j u s t if y their being hospitalized. I trust that as this measure is just the beginning of this scheme and is blazing the track as it were, the Government will give further consideration to that request. It must not allow the matter to rest where it is. Clearly, the sum of £1,500,000 to be promatter vided for this purpose under this measure will not be adequate other than to match finance that will be raised by Christian and patriotic members of the community who are prepared to co-operate with the Government in this matter. One organiorganizations zation in my electorate bas raised over £S0,000 for this purpose and has been awaiting the Government's decision. Organizations in every district have been waiting for the Government to introduce a measure of this kind. I trust that when the bill becomes law and the demand f these facilities is made known, the vernment will not restrict this for assistance, but will give every aid to those who want to help aged persons who have been lef t - without relatives and friends and are practically unwanted i society. Those people have served this country so well and, consequently, this is a responsibility, not of the State goon vernments, but of the Australian Governto ment. It is idle to contend that this is State matter simply because the States are responsible for bospitalization. people sbould not be abandoned to livein shabby conditions under which many of them bave lived in the past. . Only in today's press it is reported that a person on a chance visit looked into a. tent and found the corpses of two aged persons who had died as a result of neglect. They had been dead for some time. People whom I have known, have died in similar circumstances, and others, because of their feebleness, bave allowed candles or lamps to f all , which have set their humpies on fire and burnt the occupants to death in the general conflagration. All that has happened because those old people had no one to help or care for them. Adequate assistance to those people cannot be measured in pounds, shillings and pence. It must be measured in human kindliness and feeling for one another. In this day and age it would be a tragedy for us, and Australia would be regarded as a backward nation if we failed to realise the full significance of the plight of many elderly people and did not act along the lines laid down in this measure. A f t e r the bill becomes law I know that the officers who will have charge of the will deal with it in a sympathetic way, and I sincerely trust that there will be no delay in giving full effect to its provisions. It is urgently necessary to build homes for aged people, and I suggest that immediately various groups and bave made out satisfactory cases, money should be made available to tbem to enable them to provide as many homes as possible as quickly as possible. I have addressed myself only briefly to the matter, but I know that the nation appreciates this progressive measure that o r has been introduced by the Minister. I Goknow that he will be remembered and rem of spected for pioneering such a progressive piece of legislation, but I plead with him to give very favourable consideration to the proposal of the honourable member for n Parkes to extend the measure to embrace persons suffering from chronic illnesses. I ask the Minister on my own behalf, and bebalf of a great number of pensioners, ensure that as soon as possible the Goa vernment will match £ 1 for £1 the money raised by local groups for expenditure Aged on homes for the aged.",50
74,Mr DEAN,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Robertson) [8.48] - It is very gratifying to note tnat the Opposition is supporting this bill, which will provide funds to enable homes to be built for aged persons. This measure is a social services measure in its widest sense. There are all sorts of theories about social services, and some of thern bave been put forward in the House today to show that there are different methods of reaching the same objectives. We believe that the true Liberal objective is to foster the family unit as the basis of society. It has always been the true British custom to give the citizen and his family as much freedom as possible in his home, his work and his social life. Therefore, it has been interesting to see honourable members opposite, led by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr. Haylen), jumping on this very popular band wagon. The freedom of life that I mentioned is in some ways contrary to the objectives that honourable members opposite have expressed for a number of years. All too frequently they have asked people to rely on the welfare State, and have promised, in accordance with their socialist philosophy, that they will look after the people from the cradle to the grave. [Quorum formed*] I am quite aware that the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward), who bas just called attention to the state of the House, does not like what I am saying about the socialist objectives of the Labour party. The Australian socialists have promised that, they will look after the people from the cradle, totbe grave, but I suggest that nothing would more easily destroy our moral fibre, initiative and national character. The socialists want us to wait like animalsin our cages for the State keeper to come round and feed us. However, the welfare of the citizens is one of the first duties of any government, and, during the past decade, there has been a realization among the thinking people of the community that vve have a responsibility tothose wbo are growing older and those who are unable properly to look after themselves. As a consequence of that state of mind, the Government has stepped in and considerably widened the avenues of governmental assistance to the people. Through the measure at present before the House, the Government is now adopting a new approach to our social welfare scheme.' The Government now proposes to subsidize on a £1 for £1 basis the money raised by groups in the community to provide homes for elderly people. But, following the true Liberal philosophy, the Government is providing some money while expecting independent groups in the community also to provide money. As the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) said previously today, this measure lays the basis for much greater progress in social services. Although honourable members opposite have supported the bill in a general way, they have forecast that the Opposition will move an amendment to widen the scope of the proposal. It bas been stated that the Opposition will seek to amend the bill to provide for chronically ill people. In that regard I support the argument of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Cramer), who suggested that we should not confuse the issue before us. The bill sets out to do one thing only and that is to assist those who are at present j>roviding homes for tie aged. After this measure has been disposed of, it will be a matter for further consideration whether we can give some assistance to the chronically' ill. But do not let us confuse the issue, because the provision of homes for aged' persons is a most necessary service, and it is dealt with clearly and definitely in the bill at present before us. Even now, before the measure has become law, the Government has received applications from organizations for assistance which, if granted, will perhaps use up the amount of money that is to be made available. Consequently, it is apparent that there is a great need for homes for the aged, and we should therefore concentrate on this measure and not allow the issues to be confused. The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Luchetti) maintained that it was idle to say that the States were responsible for hospitalization. It is certainly uot idle to say so, because the fact is that except to the degree provided for in. the Constitution, hospitalization is quite definitely a State responsibility. The Commonwealth is the tax-gatherer of this country and it raises money under the authority of the Australian Loan Council, hut one of the functions of the States is to spend some of that money on hospitalization. Therefore it would not be for the good of the people if we were to relieve the States of that responsibility. Of course the States could voluntarily forego their rigbts and privileges and make hospitalization a Commonwealth matter, but they have never shown any desire to do so. In deed, it is very hard to persuade them to take back their taxing powers. The States have received all the loan money that they have required for their various undertakings, bnt they bave not been able to spend all the money they liave received. At the end of the financial year before last the States had £6,000,000 of such loan moneys left over, and last year they could not spend £3,000,000 of the money supplied by the Commonwealth. Therefore, although the address of the honourable member for Macquarie was quite interesting, he was not right when he said, that the States are not fully able to assume responsibility for hospitalization. This measure stresses that aged couples should not be parted, and consequently it will. make a great contribution to the social welfare of the nation. I believe that one could say that the measure is co-operative, and gives social services while preserving the freedom of the individual. This is a bill to deal with human values and human relationships; but while we are considering the needs of married couples, let us not forget the aged widowers, spinsters and bachelors. I hope that when consideration is being given to various applications by organizations, the Minister and the Department of Social Services will also consider giving monetary assistance to those organizations which are providing homes for aged single persons. I believe that such persons are the really essentially lonely people of the community. I am glad that the bill will provide money for the provision of "" homes"" for aged people, and not institutions. The word "" institution "" has a cold and lonely sound about it, and has become associated with a certain amount of regimentation and discipline. The Government apparently has no desire to set up institutions, because, according to the bill, it will not interfere in any way with the organizations that are at present providing homes for the aged. The Government will provide the money, and the organizations will carry on the good work. Those matters explain why this bill excites the interest and sympathy of honourable members. I sbould like to mention to the House that my colleague and friend, the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr. Wheeler), desired to speak on this bill. He and I have talked about :'t a good deal, and I know that be shares my views on this matter. I point out that be cannot be here to speak on the measure, because he is representing the Government at Remembrance Day celebrations. One matter that I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister is in relation to clause 5 (2.), which reads as follows:A trustee ov trustees undeia trust established for charitable or benevolent purposes shall, if the Governor General so approves, be deemed to be an organization referred to in the last preceding sub-section. There is a particular case, of wbicb 1I have some knowledge, that I desire to mention in this connection. A sum of money bas been left to an organization which has been considered suitable, within the definition of the will, to provide homes for the aged. At present, it seems that the agent for setting up a trust will be the shire in which this home is to be established. However, I find that clause 5 (3.) provides as follows:An organization conducted or controlled by, or by persons appointed by, the Government of the Commonwealth or of a State or a local governing body estalished under the law of a State, is not eligible for assistance under this Act. In the case which I have in mind, the shire will only be the agent or channel through which the money left by the will, will pass. The shire will set up its own committee, or trustees, to build and manage the homes. The committee is to consist of one or two representatives of the shire, and representatives of various local organizations, both men's and women's groups, for example, the president of the Country Women's Association and the president of the Old Age and Invalid Pensioners Association. This committee will be appointed for the specific purpose of providing homes for aged persons. I hope that it ""will come within the scope of clause 5 (2.) and will not be debarred by the next sub-clause, because the channel through which the money will come to the committee happens to be a shire council. I join with honourable members on both sides of the House who have congratulated the Government and the Minister on their vision in this matter. I also express my thanks to the officers of the department for the assistance which they have given in making available to this country such a humane measure. Mr W. M. BOURKE (Eawkner) 19.4] - This very important and desirable piece of legislation provides a happy note upon which the Parliament should finish its labours before going into recess for Christmas. Everybody in the House supports the general principles of this legislation. Most of the ground bas already been covered by previous speakers, and there is not a great deal more that can be said of the matter. Up to date, we, as a Commonwealth, in our social services legislation, bave accepted the principle that the people as a whole should make some contribution to the happiness, contentment and well-being of the aged people in the community. We have made that contribution by means of our general social services legislation in the way of pensions, medical benefits and so on. But I believe we all recognize the further principle that, in this matter, as in life generally, it is not merely a matter of money. Tbis vexed question of money, which causes all of us a certain amount of concern at times, is something which we must have if we are to meet at least our minimum requirements to enable ns to live; but we all have had enough experience of life to realise that money alone cannot purchase happiness. Indeed, it is a wellaccepted fact that, in many cases, too much money can be detrimental to the attainment of happiness. It is essential that the minimum requirements of our aged people, in the monetary sense, shall be met. We consider that people who have to rely entirely upon the base rate pension for their livelihood, because they have no otber income, are not receiving, sufficient to enable tbem to maintain those minimum standards. But I think this bill recognizes the principle, to which I certainly subscribe, that merely to increase the pension, and merely to look at this matter from the economic orfinancial point of view, will not solve the problem. Tbere are other matters in respect of the welfare, happiness and well-being of our aged people that need attention. I believe that many elderly people,, assuming that the basic financial requirements are satisfied, regard the provision of adequate bousing facilities at a nominal rent as the greatest necessity in their lives, to make them really happy. Some people in receipt of a pension areadequately housed. Tbey own their houses. But quite a number of otber people live under deplorable conditionsAll honourable members bave bad experience, in the course of their duties, of assisting the aged people with their problems. In my experience, this section consists mostly of elderly ladies-widow s or unmarried ladies-som e of whom have no relatives to help them-and some of whom, unfortunately, seem to have been forgotten by their relatives. Many of them struggle along as best they can. They pay higb rents-as much as 30s. a week and even more-ou t of their small pensions. Sometimes they are unable to care for themselves adequately, and are unable to cook for themselves. They experience great difficulty with such simple little problems as obtaining firewood, because of the economic burden of it, or, if the firewood is obtained, they are not able to have it chopped, and prepared for the fire. That is a very simple little matter which we would not give a thought to ourselves, but for elderly women who spend a lot of time in their rooms, the provision and preparation of that fuel sets quite a problem, which causes them a lot of hardship and distress. Eeligious bodies of all denominations and charitable institutions have played a great part in meeting the emergencies which come into the lives of many of our elderly people, and I sbould like to add my tribute to those paid by otber honourable members to the fine work that the various religious bodies bave done in providing for the welfare of the aged people. A good deal of experience has been gained in recent years in this country, and in otber countries, of the type of housing which is most suitable for the needs of our elderly citizens. Two general types of housing seem best to fit their needs. In some cases, small independent cottages in little groups, each one completely self-contained, with a little garden., are considered most satisfactory. That type of accommodation bas been provided mainly by religious bodies and charitable organizations. In otber cases, larger blocks of buildings are established, in which flatettes with bed-sitting rooms are provided. Communal facilities, such as dining-rooms and recreation rooms, serve quite a desirable purpose. It is an undoubted fact that among the peculiar problems which face many old people are the sense of loneliness, the sense of being left on their own, and the sense of frustration. These problems are met, to some degree, in these particular types of homes, wbere there are communal recreation rooms. A further basic fact which definitely should apply, and does apply in the case of homes which are conducted by religious organizations, is that the payment to be made by the aged persons should be a very moderate or even a nominal amount. Those seem to me to be the general principles upon which this problem of homes for the aged have been tackled, and it is along those lines that I think development will take place in the future. The Minister for Social Services (Mr. MCMahon) has made an important point clear in his second-reading speech, and that is that the Government does not propose to interfere in any way with the internal workings of the religious and charitable bodies which will be the main beneficiaries under this legislation. It is for those bodies to carry on the work in the manner in which they, from their knowledge and experience, think fit. The Government does not propose to interfere, or tell them how to conduct their business. It proposes to make this financial assistance in the form of a subsidy on a £1 for £1 basis to enable the religious bodies and charitable organizations to expand their activities. I , personally, am pleased that the Government has chosen this form of assistance-to help .to solve this very important problem so that this country may be able adequately to meet its obligations to its elderly citizens. Some people have suggested that governmental assistance sbould be provided in the form of governmental homes, and that the Government should actually build and conduct such homes as government concerns. I could not support a proposal of that kind. It is very doubtful whether the constitutional power resides in the Commonwealth to provide such a form of assistance, but quite apart from that fact I feel that it is much preferable, and much more desirable for the assistance from the Government to proceed in the maimer proposed in the bill, to help the established institutions, most of which are the religious and charitable bodies conducted by various denominations, to increase their activities. When we examine the bill, we realise that this legislation breaks entirely new ground. This is something that has never been done before in this country, and, as such, the legislations is necessarily of an experimental nature. We shall learn much as the scheme progresses. One honourable member who spoke earlier in the debate said that be regarded this bill as the most signincant piece of legislation in the social services sphere that has been introduced in this generation. I think that view is taking the matter too far, but I feel that if this scheme develops in the manner and to the extent that most of us hope and feel it will, it certainly will become a very important piece of legislation in the social services set-up of Australia. This bill is breaking new ground, and there will be a certain amount of trial and error as the scheme proceeds. The scheme will undoubtedly develop quickly, and I hope and expect this problem to be tackled effectively in the near future. I do not take exception to the fact that the amount of money to be provided under the bill is limited to £1,500,000. Some honourable members say that the sum is not enough, but I consider that it is a reasonable start. That amount of money is provided for the rest of this financial year, and. it is a reasonable start for legislation that is entirely new. We sball be able to see bow the sebeme works out, and wbere we go from bere in the. next financial^ year. However, .1 feel that clause 9 places an unnecessary restriction on the payment of moneys. It provides that the maximum liability that the Commonwealth may incur sball be one-half - of the capital cost of the home being subsidized. Up to that liniit, the Commonwealth will match only moneys that the institution or charitable body bas spent on the project, or money that it actually has in hand. That meansthat there is specific provision that the Commonwealth will not match moneys that the institution: intends to borrow. The result is that, if a religious or otber charitable body proposes to erect a home, or a series of bomeo, costing, say £100,000, the maximum amount that the Commonwealth would contribute towards the capital cost would be £50,000. If that body were toraise only £30,000 in cash, ' and if it proposed to borrow the remaining £2-0,000, the Commonwealth would subsidize only the amount of money in hand. In otber words, it would subsidize the £30000, but it would not match the. £20,000 that the institution proposed toborrow. That limitation on the scope of the legislation dictated, doubtless, by financial prudence* narrows the good work that will be done, because the Minister stated, and it is expressly set out in the bill, that recognized religious and charitable bodies will be the main beneficiaries. By reason of their very nature* those bodies bave to battle hard to get their money. They are obliged toraise it by public subscription. The general method by which they finance their very desirable and worthwhile projects is to obtain bank accommodation and assistance by way of overdrafts and loans. If these institutions that are carrying out the desirable and necessary work envisaged by the bill raise money themselves,, and if , in addition, they borrow money, the Commonwealthshould be willing to subsidize, on a £1 for £1 basis, the full amount that they are prepared toinvest in the project. Et is a minor machinery matter, but it is 1 one that the Minister should re-examine ilr. W. M. Bourke. so that the legislation may operate in. aB wide, and as beneficial, a manner as possible. I suggest also' that the Minister,, when workingout the details' of the scheme*, should re-examine clause. 2, which defines the capital cost of. a home. It is proposed, that the Commonwealth, shall pay up to one-half of the capital cost, of the home, but, for some reason, that I confess. I do not understand, the capital cost is defined, in the case of a. home that is being erected,, as the. cost of erecting it, including the cost of necessary fixtures in the home,, but not including the cost or value of any land. That seems to be an unduly restrictive and narrow definition. I cannot seeany reason why such a. restriction should be imposed. Surely it is common practice, and common sense, to assume that, in the case of a home that is bought by a private person, or i : i the case of a series of homes or a large block of buildings, including a number of flatettes, for the aged, the capital cost is the cost of the land,, plus the cost of the building, and plus the cost of the fixtures. I suggest that, when the details of this scheme are being ironed out later, the Government sbould remove that restriction. The only other machinery matter towbich I direct attention is that which is coveied by the amendment that has been, foreshadowed by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Haylen). I think most, honourable members will agree: that: the most pressing need is for the provision of: some form of hospitalizationfor aged people whose health has broken down,, and' who are. not able to care for themselves, and bave. nobody else to care for tbem. Unfortunately, public hospitals, generally speaking, are not willing toadmit such people, and it is only in thespecialized institutions, most of which are conducted by religious organizations thatcare for aged persons, that there is any prospect of obtaining a bed. There is an alarming shortage of beds for agedpersons who are ill . It seems to me that for the Commonwealth to providemoney for the establishment of homes foraged persons who> are in good health when' the. need of those who are ill is greater 1 is to make a narrow approach to the question. I suggest that, as the scheme develops, and as we learn more about it, a greater proportion of the money should be devoted to the provision of assistance fbr aged people who are ill . There are,, of course, some machinery difficulties associated with that aspect the matter. The question of the jurisdiction of the Department of Social Services on the one hand, and of the Department of Health on the other, arises. The Department of Health administers the payment of hospital benefits and, in the case of institutions that are caring for elderly persons in particular, the Department of Health would be paying hospital benefit. In other words, it would making a contribution towards the cost of maintenance.. It is proposed now that the Government shall make a contribution towards the capital cost of homes, but that it shall not make a contribution in the case of institutions that are caring for aged persons wbo are ill . Perhaps that restriction arises from the fact that both departments would be involved. At times I find it difficult to justify, own mind, the existence of the Department of Health. After all, health administration, in its broadest aspects, is not. a function of the Commonwealth. It is a function of the States. The Commonwealth Department of Health, carries out some important functions, but it is continually impinging upon the activities and functions of the Department of Social Services. The power of the Commonwealth Department of Health to engage in most of its activities is derived from the constitutional power of the Commonwealth to provide social services. I think it is desirable that most of the functions of the Department of Health should be brought under the jurisdiction of the Department of Social Services. To do so would prevent a lot of overlapping, and probably it would eliminate what I think is the reason for the restriction to which I have referred. I have put forward these objections to the bill, not as being fundamental, but as matters that should be considered as the scheme develops. The bill is a good bill. It establishes an entirely new and novel principle in this country. It recognizes that the Commonwealth has an obligation to help our elderly people, the pioneers of this country, to obtain adequate housing, and it clearly implies that those adequate housing facilities of should be provided at reasonable cost. In its broad and general principles, the bill is very, very sound, and I hope that, if the Minister is not willing to accept the amendment that has been foreshadowed, he and his departmental officers will give thought to these matters I bave raised, as the scheme develops. As I stated earlier, perhaps the most important direction in which the Combe monwealth may assist the aged would be to ensure that the alarming and growing shortage of accommodation for the aged sick is overcome. In Melbourneand I imagine that the position is the same in other cities-it is almost impossible to have an aged person who is ill admitted to a suitable institution or hospital SO' that he may receive adequate medical and nursing attention. It is a in my really pressing problem. Although the bill does not cover that position, I suggest that the Minister should give serious thought to it, and that, later, the Commonwealth should contribute financial assistance, not merely by providing finance for homes for aged persons who are well, but also by financing proper accommodation for aged persons wbo are not well. I tbink that this measure will go down in history as being a worthwhile and desirable piece of legislation and that we should regard it, not as being final in itself, but as a step forward towards bigger things and towards a. greater recognition of our responsibility to the aged persons of this country.",53
75,Mr ROBERTON,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Riverina) [9.26] With very great respect to those honourable members wbo may express the opposite point of view, let me state that, in my opinion, it is unfortunate that this very great piece of social legislation should have been introduced at the end of this sessional period. There is some haste for the House to rise. I have been absent for some considerable time, and I have no cause to take any exception to that, but, because of theimportance of this measure, and because of the haste to which I referred, I fear that some honourable members will be deprived of the opportunity of expressing their personal satisfaction at the introduction of it, and of seizing the opportunity to emphasize its salient features and its great advantages to the social scheme in general. I listened with very great interest to the remarks of the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr ""W. M . Bourke), who always makes a valuable contribution to debates, and I agree very largely with his statements. I have no doubt that there are other honourable members opposite who share his views, and I know that every member of the Australian Country party would like to have the opportunity of expressing his own personal satisfaction at the fact that the Government, at last, has brought down a measure of this description to serve such a splendid purpose. I should like to offer my sincere congratulations to the Minister for Social Services (Mr MCMahon) upon the tenor of his second-reading speech. I have listened to a great number of speeches in this chamber covering a great number of important bills, some of which have dealt with social services benefits in, general terms, and some in particular terms, but I do not think that I bave ever listened to a speech that has been pervaded by a similar degree of compassion and understanding, or by a greater sense of proper social justice, than the speech of the Minister when he introduced this measure. He stated that the purpose of the bill was to set up machinery so that the Commonwealth may make grants to recognized charitable bodies and institutions to assist them in the provision of homes for aged persons. Every honourable member will agree that that is a very laudable purpose, that it is something that needed to be done, and that it needed to be done urgently. The Government is to be congratulated on taking the decisive action that it taken. I congratulate the Minister, also, on the introduction of this very important bill. The sum of £1,500,000 has already been appropriated in the budget for the current financial year to meet expendiasked ture and grants towards the provision itr. Roberton. homes for aged persons. The question of the inadequacy of that amount does not necessarily arise. The cold fact remains that it is £1,500,000 more than has ever been provided before for this purpose by an Australian government in the 53 years since federation. That provision is a gigantic step forward. I support the other honourable members wbo have expressed the view that the expenditure of £1,500,000 must help considerably towards the solution, of the vexed problem of accommodating aged people. As the effect of that expenditure comes to be appreciated throughout the community, the responsibility to increase the appropriation will surely be recognized and accepted generally. No previous administration has had the same kind of social conscience that this Government has. No other government has attempted to introduce a measure of the social significance of this bill. The Minister stated that it breaks new ground. That was an apt statement of the position. The attitude of Australians to aged people has always depressed me, so that I often wonder where our social standards have gone in the last few years. There was a time when aged people were respected throughout the Australian community, and retainedtheir personal identity and respect, but in the last few years their position has greatly changed. [Quorum formed.] There was no need for the honourable member for Lalor (Mr. Pollard) to call for a quorum. I should not have detained the House much longer. I wish merely to express my appreciation of the introduction of this bill and my hope that it will be unanimously passed by the House. I had reached the point of saying that the attitude of Australians to aged persons has always depressed me. Indeed, Australians bave what might be described as a Goneril attitude to aged people. I remind the House of that wretched old man, King Lear, who, has having divided his kingdom into three parts-in contrast, most of our aged people have no kingdom to dividesought to ascertain the affection in which he was held by his three daughters. He them to indicate in some way the of measure of their love. You, Mr Speaker, will recall that that termagant of a woman, Goneril, expressed herself in these termsSir, I love you more than word can wield the matter, Dearer than eye-sight, space and liberty; Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare; No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour: As much us child e'er lov'd, or father found. A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable; Beyond all manner of so much I love you. The sentiments of that senseless woman have sometimes been expressed in precisely the same way by our young people in the expression of their attitude towards the aged members of the community. There was a time when our aged people occupied a unique place in the community, and I hope that this bill, if it does nothing else, will restore them to that rightful place. The greatest thing that our aged people can bave, altogether apart from good health, is personal dignity. During the last generation, I have watched a general depreciation in the personal dignity of our aged people. I bave watched grow old men and women who have served the community faithfully and well, and have toiled and slaved to improve the positions, in the first place, of their own families, and in the second place, of the community. Because of a great many of our senseless industrial laws, they have been thrown on the scrapheap, women at the age of 60 years and men at the age of 65 years. Those people bave been taught to believe that at those ages they have reached the end of their lives, that they cannot expect to retain their rightful place in the community, and that they are an obstruction to the younger members of the community whom they keep out of their rightful places in society and in the hearts and minds of others. We have watched, in recent years, the gradual approach of this dreadful state of affairs and the disappearance of the respect and affection that should rightfully belong to our aged people. As my electorate would indicate, I am a country man. I represent a rural constituency. Country citizens bave greater regard for aged persons than people in the urban communities. know that the old men and women of the Riverina electorate would much rather live in the Riverina, under any conditions, tban be moved elsewhere. I have seen men and women who have reached the age at which they can no longer obtain gainful employment, establish humpies on common ground at public watering places near villages where their friends live. Tbey occupy those humpies with much personal satisfaction and retain their personal dignity and stature in the community. They hold the personal respect that they bave always enjoyed. The old men are still addressed in the village by the title of M i . and the elderly ladies continue to receive the respect that rightfully belongs to the ladies. As a consequence, nothing would drive those people away from the country villages where they have lived. That is an excellent thing. It is nothing short of criminal folly to move people who are above a certain age from a town where they have had long and pleasurable associations to institutions in far-distant metropolitan areas. I tbink the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Haylen), wbo led for the Opposition in this debate, was the first honourable member to make reference to the welfare state. I hope that the time will never come when our aged people shall be left to the mercy of the welfare state. I can conceive of nothing more terrible than the spectacle of the aged being marched into great, gaunt institutions in the centres where the population is most concentrated, to be tended by uniformed attendants. That is the conception of their duty to the aged people that is held by the servants of the welfare state. This bill is certainly necessary in order that the work that has been done so competently and so well, though within strict financial limits, by the churches and other welfare organizations, may be continued. It provides for the extension of that work. I wonder what would have happened in our community if the churches and other charitable- I make no apology for using that word-organization s had not undertaken those onerous responsibilities. Where sbould we be today without our a churches and charitable institutions? have Unfortunately, it has now become I fashionable tn bold th« churches and religious institutions generally up to violent - criticism and derision, and to hold out to destruction conventional society, as conventional society is known to those institutions. It will be comparatively easy for a generation that was born into conventional society, - and enjoyed Christianity as we knew it when we weTe young, to retreat hack into Christianity and enjoy its standards as we knew them when we were children. But our children will not be able to do that so easily, and therefore we should recognize the very great work that the churches have always done for the aged and the infirm, for whom they have - worked industriously. I am very proud fhat this Government has been the first in Australia's political 'history to assist the churches in their valiant work for elderly people. Our aged people are really our important people. Our attitude towards them in recent years has ""been entirely wrong, and it should be changed forthwith. I believe that life can ""begin at 60 or '65, and that there are no limits to what a person can do so long as be has the requisite health and strength. I have --recently had the opportunity to visit other countries, and the most profound impression gained in my travels relates to this very .subject. In the United Kingdom I met again men .and women whom I had not .seen since T was a boy. Some of tbem are now 80 or 90 years of .age, and still hold the important place in the - community that they occupied - when I was a child. And they deserve - to hold it. They are still honoured in their own homes and retain the respect of the «ommunity in which they live. Their families pay tbem respect with .a regularity that is indeed touching in the eyes of a stranger from a country such as Australia in which one does not have that delightful experience with any degree of regularity. During my travels I saw all sorts of artistic and cultural organizations, and - a great leavening of the aged was in every one of them. I listened to orchestras, and the average age of the musicians was over 55 years. The aged were still playing in the orchestras. I listened to .some of the finest choirs in the world, and the average age - of the .singers was aibout 50 years. Again the Mr Roberton-. aged were .still playing their part. I saw pictures painted by aged people. I read books written by aged people. I bave .seen work of every description done by aged people, and so I say it is a delusion to imagine that, because pensions are provided for women when they .are 60, and for men when they are 65, that represents the end of their lives. It ought to be the beginning of their leisure. Limitless opportunities are available to each .one of them to live splendid lives right to the very end. I want to end my speech by referring a.gain to the excellence of the Minister's speech, and, with your permission, Mr. Speaker, I sball quote a few .sentences from it. He said, for instanceTie Commonwealth is anxious ""to provide leadership jn .assisting to nnd a solution of what is a delicate human problem-the care and companionship of aged people. That, coming from a comparatively young man, and a bachelor-if I may be permitted to reveal the fact-surel y demonstrates just what kind of a man he is, and I am very glad that he bad the opportunity to introduce this bill. Later in his speech, he said so succinctlyWe should be wrong if we thought that elderly people are concerned only with income That is a delusion that has ""been shared by too many Australians for too longand that .an increase in ^pension .will cure all the troubles of the aged. There are thousands of people who believe .that. He went onIncome is not 'the only problem. .Loneliness, rboredom, and the sense of not being wanted .are .also'""among the problems of old people. In my opinion, they are the greatest problems of - all. ""We cannot 'discharge our responsibilities to the aged with £1 notes any more than Goner.il could discharge her responsibilities to her father with senseless words. We have to try to restore our old people to the sanctity of - their own homes and give them the respect that is their due. I knoAv that what I bave said is not easy for those who share the opposite view to take. Their idea of helping the aged could be summarized in .this way: "" Give them £5 .a week. Give them the basic wage. To - bell with them as long as we give tbem enough"". That would not discharge a single responsibility. I make one final quotation from the Minister's speechAll of us would like older people to he able to remain contentedly in their own homes, and to have the feeling of independence. The family remains the most important unit in our society and the stronger the family unit with its mutual ties of love, companionship and care, the stronger will be our nation and our Commonwealth. These are sentiments that honourable members of the Australian Country party share absolutely.",58
76,Mr BRYSON,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Wills) [9.50] - After paying a visit to the aged people of Europe with the aged member for Riverina (Mr Roberton), I think it might be a good idea, Mr Speaker, if we returned to the bili. I acknowledge, of course, that the honourable member kept to the bill at least when he read passages from the second-reading speech by the Minister for Social Services (Mr. MCMahon), but that was his only contribution to the debate that was of any value to the liouse. I assure you, Mr. Speaker, that, unlike the honourable member for Riverina, I sball not endeavour to recite poetry during the short time for which I shall address myself to this measure. However, before I discuss the bill, I must refer to one statement by the honourable member. He spoke of his hatred of the welfare state and expressed t.he hope that he would never see a welfare state in this country. But, at the same time as be mouthed those sentiments, he gave his support to the bill and congratulated the Minister for introducing} it, and it is another step towards the welfare state. I welcome it because it is a step towards the welfare state. I remind the honourable member for Riverina that an earlier step taken towards the welfare state was the introduction of the age pension. This bill represents only a very hesitant step in the same direction, unfortunately. The idea behind it is very laudable, and I should like to congratulate the Government as otber honourable members have done, but I am unable to do so because, although I frankly admit that the introduction of the measure is a step in the right direction, I regret that the Government has been so nervous and hesitant in its approach to the matter, rt -[107] The plight of the aged poor of this community in relation to bousing is worse today than it has been for many years, and that is due very largely to the fact that we are somewhere near the top of an inflationary spiral. Living costs have increased to such an enormous degree that the improvements that we have made since the pre-war years in the provision that we make for the aged have not kept pace with the spiral. Although this Government is providing the highest weekly rate of age pension that has been paid in the history of the Commonwealth, the maximum pension of £3 10s. a week, does not provide as much comfort for the aged as did the pension of £1 10s. a week fifteen years or so ago. Certainly it is not providing as much sustenance or comfort as did the pension of £2 2s. 6d. which was provided by the Chifley Government in 1948. The unfortunate truth is that, although the present pension is the bigbest in our bistory, in terms of money, its actual value is very small.",62
77,Mr SPEAKER,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Order ! The honourable member said that he was going to stick to the bill, but be has not done so.",62
78,Mr BRYSON,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"I am coming to the point, Mr Speaker. The value of the pension is so low that aged people are finding it hard to obtain living accommodation. That is wby it is necessary for the Government to make a gesture, at any rate, towards providing housing for them. Aged people were able to rent a room for 5s. or 7s. 6d. a week fifteen years ago, but today they must pay £1 5s., £1 10s., or £1 15s. a week for a room. They just cannot afford to pay such, amounts for accommodation, and something must be done for them. Therefore, I welcome the first step that the Government has taken in this direction. As I have said, it is a hesitant, nervous, and very short step.",62
79,Mr BIRD,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,It is just a shuffle.,62
80,Mr BRYSON,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Yes , but at least it is a movement in the right direction. The first point to be noted is that the bill provides for the appropriation of £1,500,000 for assistance towards the cost of housing the aged poor of the community. But this is governed by the proviso that religious institutions, charitable institutions, organizations of former members of the defence forces, or organizations approved by the Governor General must also provide £1,500,000 towards the purchase of the necessary homes. Unless those organizations come to light with that amount, the bill will be meaningless. It will not serve to provide even one home for an aged person unless such an organization provides half the cost of that home. Even iso, I welcome the measure as the first hesitant step towards the proper care of the aged poor.",62
81,Mr WARD,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,It is a pittance.,63
82,Mr BRYSON,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Yes , but at least it is something, and I hope it will be improved upon. The provision of £1,500,000 to assist the provision of housing for the aged on a £1 for £1 basis sounds all right, but we find, when we examine the bill, that the scheme is hedged around to such a great degree that it will be exceptionally hard for religious or charitable organizations to take full advantage of it. I do not want to repeat unnecessarily anything that has been said before, but I wish to enlarge on some of the statements of the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. W. M. Bourke), who pointed out some of the apparent weaknesses of the bill. I shall refer to some of the details which the honourable member skimmed over very briefly. I refer first to clause 2, which provides a definition of the expression "" the capital cost"" in relation to an approved home. The honourable member for Fawkner pointed out that the cost of the necessary - fixtures in a home would be included in the capital cost, but that the cost or value of the land on which it stood would not be included. Well, if a religious organization wants to build half a dozen small houses for aged people, it must first acquire a piece of land, and, in order to do so, it must pay the f u ll market price for it. The cost of the land would probably equal half the cost of the homes to be built on it. Therefore, in that instance, the Government would contribute not £1 for £1, but £1 for every £2 which the religious organization provided. That is the effect of the first part of the definition of ""the capital cost"". The second part of that definition also is rather peculiar, and, I submit, should be reconsidered. It provides that the capital cost, in relation to an approved home, means the amount which the Director General is satisfied is(6) In the case of an approved home purchased or to be purchased by an eligible organization-tli e cost of purchasing the home and of making any necessary alterations or additions to it and installing any necessary fixtures, including the cost of purchasing the land on which the home is erected, less the value of any part of that land that is not required for the purposes of the home; Under that provision, if a religious or charitable organization desires to house, say, twenty aged persons, and it has in hand sufficient money to purchase a suitable house for that purpose for,- say, £30,000, the Government would provide £15,000 of that amount provided that the organization had the other £15,000 in hand. The point I make is that in that instance the total purchase price would include the cost of the land. Therefore, the second part of the definition of "" the capital cost"" is at variance with the first part of it. The position will be that if an organization decides to build a home it will have to pay the full cost of the land and half the cost of the building, but if it purchases an existing building the Government will pay half the total purchase cost as it will pay noi only half the cost of the building, but also half the cost of the land on which the building stands. Clearly, that is anomalous, and I should like the Minister to explain that provision fully. In those circumstances, organizations which are interested in providing housing for the aged, but which, necessarily, are obliged to obtain the requisite finance from sources other than from direct charitable donations will, in order to take full advantage of the assistance being made available under this measure, prefer not to erect new buildings but purchase existing buildings. If many of these eligible organizations follow that course, the result will be that instead of small homes being provided for the aged on a community basis, less suitable accommodation will be provided for them in existing buildings. I repeat that under this provision an eligible organization which erects a new building will be required to pay two-thirds of the total cost, including the cost of the land, whereas it will be required to pay only 50 per cent, of the cost if it purchases an existing building. In those circumstances, an organization will prefer to acquire an old family home capable of accommodating, say, twenty aged persons, instead of building a modern structure which would ensure complete privacy and comfort for aged persons. The ultimate result will be that many aged persons will be accommodated under mate-shift conditions, or at least under conditions that will not he nearly so satisfactory as would be provided in new structures. I again urge the Minister to reconsider the definition of "" the capital cost"" with a view to rectifying the anomaly that I have indicated. The Government has a definite responsibility to make provision for the well-being of the aged poor. Some honourable members bave said that this is a State responsibility. I do not agree witli that view. Under the Constitution, the National Parliament is empowered, and acts upon the authority, to provide pensions for the aged. That being so, this Parliament has a moral responsibility to make available funds to enable them to Hve in frugal comfort. Although, under the Constitution, the National Parliament is not specifically given power with relation to housing, it has a moral responsibility to make provision for the housing for the aged poor. To some degree it is accepting that responsibility in this measure under which religious and charitable organizations will be obliged to bear half the cost of providing homes for the aged. I bave no doubt that those organizations will be only too happy to co-operate with the Government in this direction. Nevertheless, that fact sbould not relieve the Government of its responsibility. Therefore, it should be as generous as it possibly can. Indeed, charitable and religious organizations would be making a great contribution if they were required under this measure, not to make any funds available, but to supervise the operation of this scheme, to maintain the homes proposed to be built for the aged and to care for the aged persons who occupy such homes. When the Government is prepared to make available the sum of £1,500,000 for the purpose of providing homes for the aged it should ensure that those organizations which will be required to provide a similar amount for this purpose sball be given every opportunity to do the best they possibly can in the interests of the aged. I suggest that in that respect the bili as drafted is too restricted. The honourable member for Fawkner also referred to clause 9 which deals with the amount of the grants to be made available. Tbat clause reads(I.) Subject to this section, the amount ot a grunt under this Act in respect of an approved home shall be nn amount not exceeding(a) one-half of the capital cost of the home, as determined by the Director General; or That is quite satisfactory (6) the sum of the moneys (if any) expended, and the moneys presently available for expenditure, by the organization towards the capital cost of the home, being moneys which the Director-General is satisfied did not become available ns a result of the borrowing of those moneys or any other moneys by the organization and were not received by the organization from the Government of the Commonwealth or of a State or from a local governing body or otlier authority established by a State Act, whichever is the less. I suggest that that provision requires to be amended having regard to the procedure that is usually followed by charitable and religious organizations in financing the building of benevolent institutions, including homes for the aged, hospitals and orphanages. The practice followed by the majority of those organizations is to proceed with the erection of a building long before they raise the total cost of it . For instance, if an organization decided to build an orphanage at a total cost of £.)0,000 and it had £5,000, or £10,000, in hand, it would go ahead immediately with construction and arrange finance to cover the balance of the cost which might not be paid off for a period of 50 years. The important point is that in the meantime the organization is enabled to carry on its charitable work. Under this measure, if an eligible organization decided to build a home for the aged at a cost of £50,000 it would be required to bave actually in Land half that sum before the Government would make the other half available to it. The Government should reconsider that clause and amend it to provide that it will make available 50 per cent, of the capital cost and thus enable the organization to go ahead with the erection of the necessary building and allow the organization to spread the payment of the balance over a period of years. If that were done, the position of eligible organizations in respect of this assistance woulcl be improved at least by 50 per cent. In any event, as the Government is undertaking to make available the sum of £.1,500,000 for this purpose, it sbould prescribe conditions that will enable eligible organizations, which will provide a similar amount in the aggregate, to follow the procedure which they are now accustomed to follow in the provision of buildings for charitable purposes. The Government should have no objection to iMiiciiding clause 9 along those lines. Jt should attack the problem from that viewpoint. If the Government waits until the various organizations raise £1,500,000 th rough donations, and by fetes and by otlier means, it will take the organizations three or four years to raise the money, and aged people will consequently be deprived of homes for that time. It would not cost the Government anything to make it easier for the approved organizations to go ahead immediately and provide homes for the aged people who are greatly in need of them. The Government should remember that whenever charitable and religious organizations accept a responsibility of any kind to raise money, they always manage to raise it ; consequently, there will be no risk to the Government if it adopts my proposal, but there will be a great benefit to aged, homeless people. Clause 9 (2.) roadsTlic Director-General shall not make, or nj-rec tu make, a grant under this Act to n eligible organization in respect of an home unless he is satisfied thnt the sum of the moneys (if any) cxjK'nded, and the moneys presently available for expenditure, by the orgiiiiizntion towards tlic capital cost of the homo, together with the amount of the grant, will not bc less than the capital cost of the home. That seems to me, although I may be wrong, to be more or less a repetition of paragraph (b) of clause 9 (1.), and Mr Bryson. therefore it needs simplification. If the matter is not further examined it will cause more delay in the provision of homes for the aged. I am very pleased to see that the Government, in this measure, is taking another step towards the welfare state to which the honourable member for Eiverina (Mr Eoberton) so violently objected earlier in the debate. We must accept responsibility for the care of the aged, but I believe that during past years this country has neglected that responsibility, and much more should have been done to help those deserving people. We are providing pensions for them, which, although only pittances, they have paid for during their working years. Similarly, they have paid for the homes that they should be living in at present. We should do everything possible to make tlieir declining years happier than they are now, and if we can do that we can say that this Parliament has been of some use to the aged people who are unable to fend for themselves and who deserve every consideration.",63
83,Dr DONALD CAMERON,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Oxley) [10.19] - I desire to say something about the nature and magnitude of the problem of caring for the aged, and I want to relate those remarks to the remarks made by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr. Haylen) when he was foreshadowing an amendment to this bill.",65
84,Mr HAYLEN,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,I foreshadowed one amendment in the committee stages of the bill.,65
85,Dr DONALD CAMEEON,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,I understand that the substance of the honourable member's amendment will be that homes for the aged should be provided in conjunction with hospital facilities.,65
86,Mr HATXEN,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"The amendment will concern the provision of a subsidy to institutions that care for aged, sick people, but which are not hospitals within approved the meaning of the legislation. [Quorum formed.']",65
87,Dr DONALD CAMERON,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"I understand that the honourable member for Parkes intends to move that some special provision be made for aged, sick persons. When I used the phrase, ""hospital facilities "" previously, I was using it in its broad sense, and I do not think that I misunderstood the honourable member. I point out to the House the undesirability of adding to the magnitude of the problem of caring for the aged, or of adding a provision to the bill which might restrict it to people for whom provision is made in other legislation. I intend to put some figures before honourable members, which relate to the size of the aged population in proportion to the general population, and indicate the rate at which that proportion is increasing. They refer to the population of England because I have not the precise figures for Australia, but I suggest that that will make no difference to my argument because the problem in Australia is the same as the problem in England, and the proportion of old people in Australia to the total population is increasing at almost the same rate as the proportion of old people to the total population of England increasing. In 1891, 5 per cent, of the English population were over 65 years of age. By 1951 the percentage bad risen to 11 per cent, and it is estimated that by 1980, which is not so far away, the percentage will have increased to 20 per cent, of the population. In other words, by 19S0 one-fifth of our population will be composed of persons over 65 years of age. Therefore, honourable members will appreciate the magnitude of the problem of providing sufficient homes for up to one-fifth of the people, though of course not the whole of this one-fifth will n?ed to be accommodated in them. The increased proportion of older people in the population is due to a falling birth-rate in England, which factor is also present in this country, and the increasing efficacy of general health measures which are prolonging life and altering the pattern of old age. Those measures are altering it by substituting for acute terminal illnesses, more longdrawn out terminal processes. The result of that will be that the duration of incapacity in the otber groups of the population will increase. It has been estimated that to about the age of 70 people are potential donors to the common effort, and after 70 years they are potential debtors to the common effort. Therefore, the problem is R -[108 ] not only one of providing homes, but also of doing something to defer the incapacity of old age. I believe that the present is a relevant time to point out to the House some of the measures which can be taken to help to diminish this problem of incapacity of old age. Some of them are extremely simple. Eor example, it has been discovered that the two most effective measures that can be taken to keep people in employment, and keep them active in their old age, are the provision of suitable spectacles and the provision of 'suitable hearing aids. As age increases, a greater stimulus of the sensory mechanism is required in order to produce the same results. Therefore, in addition to passing the legislation at present before us, we should realise that we can deal with the age problem not only by providing shelter for the aged but also by attempting to is diminish the size of the debtor group relevant to the rest of the community. In other words, we have to defer, if possible, the onset of old age. I believe that this measure, which is an excellent one, is based on proper principles. It does not approach the matter on the basis that it is primarily or - wholly a Government responsibility, and it is in line with the social services legislation that established the health scheme of this Government, which takes as its basis the belief that the community sbould make some effort and some contribution to social services and that the Government should assist that effort. That is the supremely important factor in this legislation. The bill is not designed to set up institutions controlled by the Government, or chiefly supported by government finance; it is designed to assist the people to help themselves. It is very important, for two reasons, that the legislation should be designed on these lines. The first is that it is immensely important that OUT social services legislation should not absolve the family from its responsibility, and the second is that it is doubtful, in the light of what I have said about the increase of the aged element of the population, whether the problem can be solved by the family alone, the State alone or institutions of the kind mentioned in the bill alone. It will require a common effort from all tliree groups to deal with this matter, and therefore I join with other honourable members in commending the Minister for having approached it on the basis laid down in the bill. I am sure that the measure will be effective legislation, because it does not lay the primary responsibility on the State for the provision of homes for the aged.",65
88,Mr MAKIN,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Sturt) [10.30] - I join - with other honourable members in expressing satisfaction at the introduction of this bill. I bave no doubt that the reason for its presentation to the House is that the social conscience of the community bas been disturbed by the fact that adequate provision has not been made in the past for the care of aged people. Honourable members will need to realise that this Parliament will have to accept to an increasing degree the obligation to provide suitable housing, and to make provision for the general happiness and well-being of that worthy section of the community. The sum of £1,500,000 which is to be made available this financial year to assist religious and other bodies to build homes for the aged, is not a princely amount. Australia would approximately that sum each day if it were waging a war. Therefore, we should not be tempted to think that we have satisfied all the demands of this problem by the provision of £1,500,000. Our responsibilities in this matter are increasing. People are now living longer tban they have at any previous time in history. As the result of the immigration programme, our population is also increasing rapidly. So, in future years, we must expect to be called upon to make provision for the care and well-being of increasing numbers of a'ged persons. I have some knowledge of the responsibilities that are involved in this matter. In the electorate of Sturt, which I have the privilege to represent in this House, there are institutions which make special provision for the care of aged persons. Certain religious organizations have done magnificent work in caring for them. Any one who has a knowledge of the splendid work that has been accomplished at the Felixstowe-road Aged Folks Home, sponsored by the Central Methodist Mission of Adelaide, cannot fail to be impressed with the marvellous standard that has been attained. That achievement is worthy of the highest commendation. So greatly has it commended itself to the general community that railway workers in Soutb Australia have made weekly contributions which, in the aggregate, bave financed the erection of two new wings to accommodate aged persons. In those homes, husband and wife are not separated. The greatest care, and the most sympathetic consideration, are given to those who are in the eventide of life. This lead is followed by many otber religious bodies and charitable organizations in South Australia, but it is time that some assistance is given to them to enable them to carry on the worthy work that they have undertaken. I believe that this kind of work, to j m increasing degree, must be accepted as a Commonwealth responsibility. The State does not adequately or satisfactorily make provision for the care of aged people. The Old Folks Home at Magill is totally inadequate for the purposes that it sbould serve, and does not provide the comfort that should be availexpend able to elderly people. What is most regrettable is that, in that institution, husband and wife are separated. I consider that accommodation of a better standard, more in keeping with modern developments in social care in otber countries, should be provided at that place. Honourable members who represent other electorates in .South Australia are aware that the shortage of accommodation for elderly folk is so acute in that State that arrangements have bad to be made to house them in the mental asylum in Adelaide. It is deplorable that people who are in the eventide of their lives, have the prospect of spending the remainder of their days in an' institution established for the care of mentallyafflicted persons. That is totally inappropriate and unsatisfactory. The splendid accommodation that has been established by religious bodies for the care of aged people is a pattern that the State should copy with its institutions. I hope the Government realizes that it is at the beginning of a substantial programme which will have to he undertaken if we are to provide the care which aged persons need. They have given the best years of their lives in work and service in Australia, and have thereby brought to us the well-being, advancement and general prosperity which exist in the Commonwealth today. We should be prepared to share some of our advantages with those who have made it possible for us to enjoy them, because we have a great responsibility to them. I feel that, in this legislation, there is an acknowledgment and acceptance of that responsibility. I support the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr. Haylen), which makes provision for the payment of a subsidy to institutions which care for aged sick people. Some folk in their declining years require special care and medical attention, although their condition does not warrant their admission to a hospital. Accordingly, they are accommodated in the sick bay of the institutions in which they live, and I believe that the benefits of the Commonwealth medical scheme should be available to them. For that reason I strongly support the amendment.",67
89,Mr BOWDEN,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Gippsland) [10.40] As was generally anticipated, this bill has given satisfaction to honourable members on both sides of the House, and some very generous commendatory remarks have been applied to it. Of course, we have had the odd, jarring note, that the amount of £1,500,000 provided for this financial year was not enough in some respects. Well, in my experience, any move of this description always brings forth the objection that the accompanying financial position is not enough. As long as we try to do something for one body of people, whether by way of subsidy, bounty, or any other form of assistance, another person will claim that he is equally entitled to the benefit, and, quently the result is that nobody gets anything. It is true that only £1,500,000 is provided for this financial year, but it is £1,500,000 more than has ever been provided before for a purpose of this kind. Tbis is only the beginning- a beginning which, I believe, will grow with the passing of the years, and it should be regarded from that point of view. - Some honourable members believe that the bill does not go far enough, and that certain other worthy institutions are being neglected. I point out again that this is only a beginning, and that the Government cannot provide for everything in Australia at the commencement of any scheme. The cost of meeting all the demands which some honourable members seem to consider should be met, would run into £50,000,000 a year, and I hope that no government would provide such a colossal sum for an experiment of any kind. The Government is to be highly commended for making this beginning, even though the amount i/i only £1,500,000. But if that small sum were distributed among all the States to subsidize hospital schemes and to help the sick, the effect would be so negligible that nobody would know that there was any benefit at all. Spent on the purpose for wbicb it is provided, and that is to build homes and cottages for old people to live in, the money will do a magnificent job in all parts of the Commonwealth, in the country districts as well as in the cities. For that reason, I rather regret that a jarring note bas been introduced, and that an amendment must be moved to a bill which all speakers have commended as a generous piece of legislation. The institutions which the amendment is designed to benefit are worthy institutions, but if they do not come within the ambit of this legislation, why do Opposition members try to delay the passage of the bill, or introduce a jarring note by saying that it is not enough, and that provision should be made for this, that and the other thing? If , in the experiment, we discover that certain worthy institutions are neglected in this legislation, let us register the vow that we shall see that they are included in a much larger allocation in the future. That fresuggestion may not be satisfactory to the institutions concerned, but if this bill had not been introduced, the £1,500,000 would not have been available this year, and they would still be no worse off tban they are today. I hope that the Minister will resist any attempts to use this money to subsidize large institutions. I hope, too, that he will ensure that country districts will be treated on an equal footing with the cities, at least in proportion to their respective populations. I seldom refer to my own electorate in this chamber, but I think that, on this occasion, I am entitled to do so, because the Anglican Church has commenced a scheme for the construction, in very pleasant surroundings, of a group of cottages known as Clifton Waters village. It is proposed to build cottages that will cost no more than £1,000 each, each cottage to consist of three rooms including a bedroom, a large lounge and dinette, and a large electrically-equipped kitchen. The cottages will be detached, and each will have its own vegetable and flower garden. The vUlage will he a credit to Gippsland, and to Victoria as a whole. Encouragement will be given to aged persons, who have £1,000 or £1,500, to expend that money in the erection of a cottage for their own use. All facilities, including sewerage, will be provided. Those persons will be able to own their own little cottages and live in them until they pass away, when they will become available for somebody else. I think it is a splendid scheme, and that it is one that the Government, or any other institution, sbould seek to help. It is proposed that there shall be a daily visit by district nurses, .who will attend to these persons in their own little cottages. The village is not very far distant from the general hospital. If the nurses think that, when, those persons become ill , they should go to the hospital, they will be sent there. Otherwise, they will be treated in their own homes. I have made an appeal to the Minister on behalf of this organization, and I know that he has registered that appeal, together with others. Tbat is why I make a plea on behalf of country districts. To provide such persons with detached cottages, where they may potter about and grow their own flowers and vegetables, is very much better than to herd them together in flats in the cities. I wish to commend, those who have had the foresight to establish that village in which aged people will be able to enjoy the society of one another amidst picturesque surroundings. The proposed provision of £1,500,000 is for the purpose of providing cottages of that description, not elaborate instisick Mr Bowden. tutions, the cost of which will run into tens of thousands of pounds. It is intended that the cottages at Clifton Waters shall be built with local labour. The scheme that is envisaged by the bill will provide such cottages on a maximum scale. The proposals that are envisaged in the amendment that has been foreshadowed may be implemented by the allocation of a greater sum of money on another occasion. The proposed allocation of £1,500,000 is too small to cover everything at once. I hope that the proposed scheme will develop from year to year so that many more people may be able to enjoy its advantages. My main purpose in rising was to make a plea for the Clifton Waters village. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Clauses 1 and 2 agreed to. Clause 3(1.) The purpose of this Act is to encourage and assist the provision o£ suitable homes for aged persons, and in particular homes . . .",68
90,Mr HAYLEN,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Parkes) [10.50] There seems to be some misapprehension about the amendment that bas been foreshadowed, and probably it arises from the fact that reference was made to it during the second-reading stage. I move That, in sub-clause (1.), after the word "" persons "" first occurring, the following words be inserted:--- "" and aged sick persons "". An examination of the bill reveals that, probably, it could be interpreted as including aged sick persons in addition to aged persons. The Opposition desires to bave the position clarified, and it is for that reason that the amendment has been moved. The honourable member for Oxley (Dr Donald Cameron), who is a medical man, seemed to be alarmed because be feared that the clause, as amended, would cut across the question of hospitalization, and that social services health schemes wonld be involved. Let me clarify the position by quoting an example. In the electorate that I represent, there are certain homes that are conducted by, I think, the Anglican Church and the Methodist Church. Those homes receive, chronically aged persons such as diabetic cases. Tliose cases woulcl be walking cases, bus they would need rest and, occasionally, treatment. Tp all intents and purposes, they are homes for aged persons, but they are sick aged persons. According to the statement of the Minister, and the provisions of the bill, such institutions would be excluded from the benefit conferred by the bill, because, I understand, they receive some form of bospital benefit. Nobody would be foolish enough to think that the proposed subsidy of £1,500,000 would go very far. The bill has been introduced for the purpose of formulating some sort of scheme upon which we may build, both by increasing the amount of the subsidy and by inducing various organizations to find the funds upon which the subsidy is based. If our first contribution to the scheme is to apply a rather harsh exclusion to aged sick persons, we will not achieve the desired result. There is no need to canvass the amendment. Either it is a good amendment, or it is not. Either it is acceptable to the Government, or it is not. It is not a question of attempting to have hospitals covered by the clause, as the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Bowden) seemed to fear. Let me illustrate the point in another way. Aged persons are received into many of the big homes, and are cared for in those homes. Such persons are healthy within the limits that are imposed by their age and physical condition. But attached to those home3 is a bospital annexe where they may receive treatment without leaving the home. Such institutions are covered by the clause, but if a cottage that is chased by some religious organization happens to be a mile along the road, and if the same sort of medical treatment is given at that home as is given in the former home, where sick aged persons are treated and rested, it is excluded from the subsidy. Let me urge upon the Minister for Social Services (Mr MCMahon) the urgency of this matter. It is necessary that aged sick persons be provided with accommodation as quickly as possible, and that this very good measure be implemented as soon as it becomes law. The first call upon the subsidy should be for the benefit of the aged sick persons. Tbat sick persons. is obvious. As every honourable member knows, the problem is one of getting sucb persons into homes, because there is a long waiting list. They are a cause of anxiety to the Government, to themselves, and to their relatives if they have any. It is for that reason that very many religious organizations have been concentrating on the acquisition of small homes. In the case of my own electorate; they may buy a home at Burwood or at Strathfield, furnish it very quickly, and wait until later to make general alterations. Tben they receive aged sick persons who have nowhere else to go. The State hospitals are full. Chronically sick people of any age are not received into many of the larger hospitals. These small institutions are easing the agonisingly desperate position. In fact, the Minister will be opening one such home in my electorate next Sunday. I am not making that statement as an advertisement, but in an effort to illustrate that progress is being made in the various suburbs of the capital cities in the provision of homes for aged sick persons as well as for aged persons. The amendment is. not intended to cut across anything for which provision is already made in the bill. The Government is laying the basis for something big, and I am prepared to say so. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment, but, if he is not willing to do so, be sbould be able to explain to us whether the clause applies to homes for aged sick persons. There will not be an immediate demand for assistance in the provision of such homes, bnt there, will be a demand purfor it in the future. Organizations that are interested in the erection or purchase of such homes are in need of the subsidy, so that they may erect more and more such homes: They have first priority in the care of aged people. A consequential amendment to clause 6 is implied, but I shall leave the position at that. I ask the Government, for the sake of the efficient implementation of the scheme, to include provision for aged sick persons. On the other hand, I ask the Minister to inform the committee whether there is implied in clause 3 provision for the payment of a subsidy upon the building of homes, or the purchase of existing homes, for aged",69
91,Mr WENTWORTH,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Mackellar) [10.58] - I am rather inclined to oppose the amendment. I full y appreciate the purpose for which it has been misapprehension. moved. I agree with many of the statements of the honourable member f Parkes (Mr Haylen), but I think that he is under some misapprehension. The clause contains the following words:The purpose of this Act is to encourage assist the provision of suitable homes for persons. . . . If the honourable member looks at clause 2, be will note that it includes a definition tion of the term "" aged person "" . Clause 2 statesIn this act unless the contrary attention appears"" aged person"" means a man who has attained the age of sixty five years or a woman who has attained the of sixty years and includes the wife or husband of an aged person residing or desiring to reside with the aged person. The definition does not make any achieve reference to the aged person being sick healthy, or anything of that description.",71
92,Mr HAYLEN,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,Tb e Minister Social Services does not take that view.,71
93,Mr WENTWORTH,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"I have no doubt that the term "" aged persons "" in clause 3, not only is capable of including, but also must include, the aged sick person. My view is that the inclusion of the words proposed in the amendment could add nothing to the clause. I fear that the inclusion of them might detract from the effect of other clauses. I know that, very often, questions of interpretation must come before the courts, but I do feel that, if the Government were to insert in clause 3 something which implied that "" aged persons"" did not include aged sick persons, except where specifically mentioned, it might well seem that a contrary intention appeared in other parts of the bill. Again I state that those matters of legal interpretation are difficult. I want to make the thing as clear and as plain as possible. The bill, as it is drafted, is clear on the point that the expression "" aged persons"" always includes aged sick persons, and there is ho reason to amend the bill in relation to that matter. I think that the honourable member for Parkes should be thinking rather of the meaning of the word "" homes "", and that he is under a The expression "" aged persons"" in or cludes aged sick persons, but the word "" homes "" does not include hospitals. I think that the honourable member has not looked closely at the drafting of the bill. and The purpose of the measure is primaril y aged to provide homes, and not hospitals. I am in entire agreement with the honourable member that hospital accommodaf or chronically ill elderly people should be provided. I believe that the problem in relation to that matter is even greater and more complex than the honourable member has stated it to be. But I do not tbink it is proper to attempt to solve it by amending the bill. age This measure is a far-reaching one, and no comprehensive amendment in it should be made now. The bill is designed for a good purpose, and we sbould not confuse the issue by attempting to make it also the objective that the bonoror able member bas in mind. I do not suggest that that objective is not worthy. It is extremely worthy. for The purpose of the bill is to provide suitable homes for aged persons. If the honourable member reads the whole of sub-clause (1.) of clause 3, he will see the words. . . and in particular homes at which aged persons may reside in conditions approaching as nearly as possible normal domestic life, and, in the case of married people, with proper regard to the companionship of husband and wife. That purpose does not in any way preclude the provision of auxiliary hospital bays in conjunction with homes, the provision of wbicb is the primary purpose of the bill. Persons who are accommodated in aged people's homes will , in the unhappy course of nature, naturally f all sick as they grow older, and therefore I hope that auxiliary hospital bays will be provided. I hope also that the provision of homes of the type envisaged will make easier the conduct of the admirable services that are now provided, in Sydney for example, by the Sydney District Nursing Association, and in States other than New South Wales by similar bodies under various names. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Parkes detracts from rather tban adds to the force of clause 3, which, in its present form, will allow to be done the things that the honourable member wants to be done. Por tliose reasons I am inclined to oppose the amendment, although I wholeheartedly agree with the honourable membeiabout the great and pressing problems that be has mentioned. No doubt tliose problems will receive the attention of the Government as .the opportunity occurs to attend to tbem. The bill does something clear and definite, and it constitutes a great forward step. We should not confuse the issue by trying at the same time to do something else. Finally, let me say that clause 3, as it is drafted, and quite apart from the provision of bospital accommodation, is wide enough to permit an ample number of applications which will absorb the entire £1,500,000 that will be made available for the purpose. Also-and this is much more important-it will enable the complete administrative resources of the Department of Social Services, at this experimental stage of the scheme, to be utilized to the full. We shall have to go slowly. The provision of hospital accommodation, which is apparently desired at. this stage by the honourable member for Parkes, although his amendment does not in my view further his purpose, can be made only at the cost of restricting the operation of the bill in other spheres. Since the bill is in a sense a lever to introduce social change, and carries with it great hope for beneficial changes in the long run, we should not restrict its operation at this stage by diverting some part of our monetary and administrative resources to an attack on the other problem that the honourable member for Parkes has mentioned. Again I emphasize that I am in entire agreement with the honourable member about the existence of that problem and about the need to turn our attention to it next.",71
94,Dr EVATT,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Barton-Leade r of the Opposition) [11.6] - The point made the honourable member for Parkes (Mr. Haylen) is simple. It is true that, in general way, the term "" aged persons includes persons who are aged, whether or not they are sick, but that is no answer to the arguments of the honourable meinber for Parkes. If the bill were intended to make provision for aged sick people it would not merely specify aged persons. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) agreed that the purpose of the honourable member for Parkes is worthy, but be stated that be was inclined to oppose the amendment, apparently because in his view the purpose could be best achieved by the passage of another measure. The honourable member sbould bave listened to the arguments of the honourable member for Parkes if be intended to participate in the debate on the amendment. I put it to the Minister for 'Social Services (Mr MCMahon) plainly that aged sick persons are a distinct class of people. The provision of homes for them as such is not quite the same thing as the provision of homes for aged people. A different type of agreement would have to be entered into for the purpose. The honourable member for Parkes has referred to the controversy over that matter. The deaconesses of the Church of England have pointed out that the buildings proposed to be constructed at Liverpool and Ashfield will be for the accommodation of aged people who are ailing, but are not, in the strict sense, hospital patients. They need something more than a home. They need a degree of additional attention, and they might properly be described as aged sick persons. They should be brought within the scope of the provisions of the bill. Either they are included in the term "" aged persons "" or they are not. If the Minister's intention is to exclude tbem, let bim say so. The Opposition takes the view that they should be included and that the matter should be put beyond doubt. That is the purpose of the amendment, and it can be achieved easily. There is no reason why homes for such persons should not be included in the scheme. They could be included merely by a specific reference to aged sick persons in the clause and by a slight adjustment in the requisite agreeby ments. Apparently the draftsman considers that they are not included in the a term "" aged persons "". I ask the Minis"" ter whether I am right in thinking that the draftsman takes the view that homes for aged sick persons are not covered the bill as it is drafted.",72

100,Dr EVATT,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Then there is no harm in specifying in clause 3 that aged sick persons shall be included. Tbat would put the matter beyond doubt, and would be the proper way to deal with the matter. That is the purpose of the amendment. Surely the Minister agree that the amendment is reasonable and would improve the bill. Therefore, there is no reason why it sbould not accepted. The main thing is that a degree of home life shall be provided in the institution. The mere fact that aged persons are ailing sbould not exclude that home from the provisions of the bill.",73
101,Mr WHITLAM,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Werriwa) [11.11] I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr money? Haylen) and supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt). The bill solves part of the problem of caring aged people in Australia. If they are so sick that they need hospital attention, they can obtain it in hospitals subsidized by the Commonwealth and by the State governments. The bill makes it plain that if they are well, homes that accomtowards modate them may receive a subsidy from this Government. I should have thought that it was very likely that homes for aged sick persons also would be covered by the bill, but I have had brought to towards the project. by my notice a precise and immediate example that reveals a gap in the provision that is made in this bill for the incare of aged persons. That example will relates to a settlement situated at Hammondville, in my electorate, and conducted by Hammond's Pioneer Homes, a non-profit company registered under the a Companies Act of New South Wales and, would think, in every way an pereligible organization witbin the meaning a of the definition in clause 2. The honorary administrator of the company the Minister for Social Serbe vices (Mr MCMahon) and was informed by the Minister that a new project, which I shall shortly describe, would not be covered by the bill. The Minister has confirmed with me that that project would not be covered by the bill because of the interpretation given by. the Minister, which is an interpretation that he may give in general terms to the Director General of Social Services, in whose discretion grants under this bill will be made. I believe it is necessary to fill the gap and to specify that provision shall be made for aged sick persons. In the last two or three years, will Hammond's Pioneer Homes has constructed several cottages, each comprising two distinct dwelling units be and occupied by two aged - couples within the meaning of the term "" aged persons"" in the bill. Tbere is no doubt that if the company contented itself with building sucb cottages it would be able hereafter to obtain grants under the terms of this measure from the Director General of Social Services. ",73
102,Mr WHITLAM,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Late r I shall give the honourable member an address to for which subscriptions may be sent. The company has in the process of construction, within the period specified in the bill, a nursing bome. If the building were not described as a nursing bome, the company would be eligible for assistance its construction under the terms of the bill, but because it has been imprudent enough to describe the building as a nursing home, it will not, according to the Minister,, be eligible for assistance Mi*. HAYXEN - If it were described as a sick bay assistance would be given.",73
103,Mr WHITLAM,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Yes . It will be integrated with the existing settlement cottages. They are adjacent, and they are held under the same title deeds. Apparently, as long as the aged persons are well, thej' can be accommodated in homes subsidized under this legislation. When they fall sick, they can go into a bospital if they are sick enough, but, if they are chronically ill and only need assistance, they cannot be accommodated in hospitals and they cannot be accommodated in homes subsidized under the bill. A time will come when persons who occupy homes subsidized under the bill will be no longer able to look after themselves and, unless they can secure admission to hospitals, they will rapidly grow weaker and the homes will quickly deteriorate. It is natural, and I believe recommended by geriatricians, that in such circumstances aged persons sbould transfer to homes where those things which they can no longer do for themselves can be done for them. Hammond's Pioneer Homes, in carrying out an integrated scheme, is now constructing a nursing home, which will be opened a fortnight from next Saturday by the Governor of New South Wales. I cannot see why the benefits of this bill cannot be made available to that home.",74
104,Mr TOM BURKE,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,The Minister is of just obstinate.,74
105,Mr WHITLAM,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Tba t is true, and be is obtuse. It is to guard against obstinacy and his obtuseness that this amendment has been moved and is being persevered with. The nursing home Hammondville will accommodate 41 aged persons as defined by the bill. They will all be pensioners, and, if they pay their pension, or the greater part of it, to the company, they will be accommodated in be catered for. the home for the rest of their days. Only because they are pensioners and, accordprecise ingly, can receive free medical assistance under the pensioners' medical scheme, if and when they require medical attenbeing tion in the home, is the company able construct, or to hope to maintain, such establishment. The honourable member for Oxley (Dr Donald Cameron) suggested that these institutions might be hospitals. This of nursing home will not be a bospital. The amendment proposed by the honourable member for Parkes and supported by the Leader of the Opposition does not contemplate hospitals. It refers, rather, to an intermediate stage. These nursing homes are integrated parts of homes for the aged, and all enlightened thought on the subject seems to agree that, instead of being added later to sucb settlements for 'aged persons, nursing homes should, in fact, be the nuclei of such settlements.

In other words, if the Government makes available £1,500,000 for the year, there should be a possibility at least £3,000,000 being expended during the year to provide homes for aged persons. But the narrow, interpretation that the Minister is going to impose on his the Director-General of Social Services will certainly not encourage eligible organizations to erect homes, whether at they are nursing homes or not, for aged persons who are not sick enough to go into hospital but who are too sick to look after themselves. Thus, the aged persons who need assistance most will not The instance at Hammondville, which I have cited, is a and immediate example of this gap in the legislation. I submit that the amendment is perfectly reasonable. It is persevered in because the Minister to has given an interpretation which will an exclude from the bill a most deserving section of the community-that section which consists of people who are unable to look after themselves, either financially or in the ordinary domestic sense.

Tbey are not completely aware of the situation in relation to the problem of bousing old people. Only £1,500,000 is to be made available under the bill for this work in the current year.",75
111,Mr CALWELL,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Why should it be only £1,500,000?",75
112,Mr HULME,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"It is all very well for the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) to interject critically. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Minogue) said earlier to-night that this work should have been undertaken ten years ago, and, at that period, of course, the honourable member for Melbourne was a member of a Labour government which showed not the slightest consideration for aged people. I believe it would be fair to say that, even at this stage, the Department of Social Services has received applications for subsidies under this legishave lation amounting to at least £1,500,000 for the current year. Probably the applications exceed that figure. Tbat means that, if the amendment were accepted, the applicant organizations would receive less from the total of £1,500,000 tban the Government wishes them to receive. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt) and the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Whitlam) clearly do not appreciate the main circumstances associated .with the task of providing homes for aged people. Earlier today the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Coutts) mentioned an outstanding example of an aged people's home, which is situated at Chermside in the electorate that I represent. The matron of each section of that' home is a qualified nurse, and every resident is able to obtain proper nursing attention for illnessess such as influenza and other complaints which last for a few days. The Government intends this bill to provide for the needs of institutions such as that, and, if it does not serve that purpose, my understanding of its terms is completely astray. I maintain that when old people reach a stage at which they cannot be nursed in such a home, a hospital is the best place for tbem.",75
113,Mr WARD,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,But there are not enough hospitals. What rubbish to talk!,75
114,Mr HULME,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"There is very little delay in obtaining admission to public hospitals in Queensland. This Government's record of providing assistance to people, whether they be aged or not, is outstanding, and it cannot be said truthfully that it has failed to give adequate consideration to the needs of all sections of the community in relation to the treatment of ilhiesses. I believe that, if the amendment were accepted in order to make provision for the aged sick, the principal purpose of the bill would be thwarted and many homes which are badly needed would not be provided. The most urgent necessity of aged people in our community is adequate housing. We have often been told that we should give them a larger income. I do not believe for a moment that a higher income would meet the principal need of a majority of our aged people. The essential requirement is accommodation. As we shall only £1,500,000 available this year, it would be a pity to draw upon that amount merely to cover a few special cases-and I maintain that they are very scarce-wher e a special hospital is set aside for the treatment of people who are old and sick.",75

The Government promised to subsidize, on a £l-for-£l basis, all institutions which care for the aged. Now we are told that people who are aged will be able to get something, but that, if they happen to be sick as well, they will get nothing under this legislation. In any case, the amount made available is to be limited to £1,500,000. Wby, heavens above, Australia spent £1,000,000 a day during World War II ! This Government now proposes to spend a day and a half's war expenditure in one year to look after old people. The Minister for Social Services (Mr. MCMahon) knows that there will be many applications in the files of the department very soon. The Government will have to conduct a lottery or use some other such method to determine which applications shall be successful! Perhaps the decisions will go, like kissing, by favour!

The purpose, according to clause 3, is to encourage and assist the provision of suitable homes for aged persons, and, in particular, homes at which aged persons may reside in conditions approaching as nearly as possible normal domestic life. Tbat is not good enough. I know the Australian community as well as most people do, and I know how the people within the British Commonwealth behave badly, in many instances, towards their aged parents. The provision of homes of the sort described in clause 3 will not solve the problem as it should be solved. The people of the British Commonwealth do not behave towards their aged as well as do the Germanic, the Nordic, the Teutonic, the Slavonic, the Greek and the Italian. Australians far too often put their old people into homes when times are good and take them out when times are bad so they can live on their pensions.",76

120,Mr CALWELL,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"This clause proposes that the money to be provided will be expended on the provision of homes for married couples. If that is not so, the final words of the clause are meaningless. I should hope that the Government would build flats on the European model in order to do everything possible to help the old people to lead a leisurely life. I make the suggestion to the Minister that, if ever flats are built under this provision, perhaps an aged couple who live in the building and who come within the ambit of this measure could be caretakers of the building. That would be in accordance with the European custom. The great tragedy is that many old couples cannot live with their families. Because of age and other considerations they are obliged to live in rooms and lodgings. They are finding it most diflicult to do so. Many may not be able to obtain accommodation in homes of the kind that are to be provided under this measure. The most tragic cases of all are those of people who are being exploited by' harpies who live on them and, on every occasion on which the pension or the basic wage is increased, raise the rental payable by old people. The condition of these unfortunate people grows worse. All honourable members desire to do something for the aged. The Opposition does not object to this bill. We support it. But if the Government is going to do something for the aged, it should set up an all-party committee along the lines of the old social services committee, with a view to finding a solution of this problem which confronts old people in the evening of their days. A lot of pharasaical talk is being indulged in throughout Australia on this subject. Old people to a large degree are a problem because medical science bas prolonged the average life span. Old people are not able to earn their living, and they must be provided with assistance of this kind. However, only the working section can provide all the requirements for the community, and I am a little afraid that unless we do something novel and striking in the way of looking after the aged this measure will not be sufficient. The Minister has said that the measure is a step in the right direction. It is too short a step. If the Minister has already received the number of applications which I believe he has received, and which, probably, would involve an expenditure of £6,000,000, he should introduce an amending bill when the Parliament re-assembles in order to push this matter further forward. By our treatment of the old we shall be judged. In the natural order, the young bird does not feed the old bird. Unfortunately, in our civilization, quite too many young people are set in the heresies of materialism and are neglecting the interests of the aged. Whilst the Government is to be commended on introducing this measure, it is perhaps giving an opportunity to that class of young persons to avoid their responsibilities further in this matter. I should like to see a change in the attitude of the community towards the aged and the introduction of something that would more approximate the spirit that prevailed in this country twenty or more years ago. To-day, our people do not look after their old as most Europeans and Asians look after theirs; The Asian people adhere to ancestor worship which also really means caring for the aged in the battle of life and, honouring their memories when they are dead, they at least make some return to tbose who reared them. [Quorum formed.]",76
121,Mr MCMAHON,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Lowe-Minister for Social Services) [12.6 a.m.] - The honourable member for Parkes (Mr. Haylen), in . a constructive speech, raised certain points which should be answered. Most of them were answered effectively, and accurately, by my colleague the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) who, if I may say so, gave a perfect explanation of the clause now before the Chair. In the light of what has been said, the Government rejects the amendment for several reasons. We have to ask ourselves what the puipose of the clause is. What does it mean? Quite clearly, it means two things. First, it relates not to hospitals but to homes; and, secondly, it relates to aged people, that is to women over the age of 60 years and males over the age of 65 years, or the husband or wife of persons of tbose respective ages. In each case, we have to determine the essential nature of the scheme. If it is to provide homes for aged people, we must apply that test. If an application for assistance under this measure relates to a home for aged people, that application will be considered. We must ask ourselves, first, whether the money is required for a bome; and, secondly, whether it is required for aged persons. If the answer to those two questions is in the affirmative, an application for assistance will be considered. That is the whole purpose of the measure, and it is demonstrated by applying that simple test. Honourable members opposite bave lost their sense of perspective in arguing about this matter. I assure the committee that the bill will be generously administered and that the Government will do whatever it considers good to do within the terms of the bill. It will exert itself to the maximum to ensure that good shall be done. Honourable members opposite are a little unrealistic when they endeavour to interpret the clause literally and, perhaps, a little extravagantly. I again assure them that the measure will be interpreted in a sensible way and that it will be administered to the satisfaction of most of the people concerned. Looking at the general definition, the test to be applied is whether the building is a home and whether it is a bome for aged people. Tbat does not mean to say that if a few sick people happen to be accommodated in the building, that home will be automatically excluded from the operation of this measure.",77
122,Mr HAYLEN,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,The Minister told his departmental officers that such a bome would be excluded.,77
123,Mr MCMAHON,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"If , in a home, there are a few sick beds, or something that is incidental to the main purpose of the home, it still remains a home and, therefore, would come within the scope of this .scheme. I shall mention three other facts of importance in helping the Government to make np its mind in the matter. The first of them is that in a scheme of this kind it seems desirable to go slowly at the beginning. It would be wrong as a matter of practice, or principle, to endeavour at this stage to cast our net too wide, because, if we did so, we should soon get into trouble. The amendment would add absolutely nothing to the clause as drafted. A common-sense rule in legal interpretation is that the whole includes the part. If , as is proposed under the amendment, the adjective "" sick"" were inserted in the clause, making its purpose to assist in the provision of suitable homes for aged sick persons, the clause, obviously would thereby be restricted. I repeat that the amendment would add nothing to the bill as drafted. On all scores, therefore, the Government rejects the amendment. It may be possible that what honourable members opposite had in mind was to apply the provisions of this measure to hospitals. Such an amendment, if accepted, would change the wliole purpose of the bill. For that reason the Government - cannot accept the amendment. I am disappointed that the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Whitlam) misrepresented my attitude in the case that he cited. The Government has said that it is not prepared at this stage to commit itself in an individual case. If an individual makes an inquiry, as the honourable member's friend did when he rang uie up and asked whether the bome which lie mentioned would come within the scheme, he will be told, as I told that gentleman, to put in his application and it will be dealt with on its merits and 'n accordance with the law. I was not familiar with Hammond's Pioneer Homes. I did not know their scope, or whether the organization conducted homes «r hospitals. The honourable member should recommend his friend to put in his application. If that is done, the application will be dealt with. I am sorry thai the honourable member's friend told bim that I had turned down his application. That is not the case and no one knows better tban the honourable member's friend that his application was not turned down. I repeat that the amendment would add nothing to the bill as drafted.

125,Mr CALWELL,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Melbourne) [12.15 a.m.] - The Opposition will not take its objection to this bill to the point of voting against it, but we consider it strange that in the dying hours of the sitting the Government should introduce legislation of this sort. The bill proposes to amend the Broadcasting Act by increasing the number of members on the Australian Broadcasting Control Board from three to five. If the Government finds it necessary to bave two part-time members on this board to assist three full-time members in bearing applications for television licences, the Opposition wonld like to know what is wrong with the present members of the board, even though it is true that a royal commission has recommended that the nnmbeT of members of the board sbould be increased. Wben the board was originally establisbed there were three members on it. The board was charged with the responsibility of co-ordinating commercial and national radio networks, supervising the general interests of broadcasting and making reports to t.he Parliament. Indeed, honourable members received one of those reports yesterday. The personnel of the board has changed during the years, and the gentleman wbo was once the third member of it is now the chairman. A second member has been appointed from outside the Public Service, and I believe that the present third member is a member of the Public Service. The Government is apparently not too pleased with the membership or competence of the board, because it now desires to add two members to the original three members while the board is inquiring into the important matter of the allocation of television licences. We do not know who the two new members will be. Will they be persons wbo have some competence in the science of television or radio telegraphy? Are they to be required to know anything about those subjects, or will they be people who have been faithful servants of the Liberal party? I raise that point because the Postmaster-General (Mr Anthony), who is ill-and I greatly regret that illness-remove d several members from another board and placed members of the Liberal party in their places. He found a place for Dame Enid Lyons at the expense of a woman Labour appointee.",78
126,Sir PHILIPMOBEIDE,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"That was very good appointment, too.",79
127,Mr CALWELL,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"In view of the interjection of the Minister for Defence (Sir Philip MCBride), it seems that the Government has a few more suitable appointees in view. If so, they will be appointed to ensure that television licences when granted will go to good supporters of the Government. The policy of the Labour party provides for the nationalization of radio services, and although it is too late to do anything about commercial broadcasting stations which aire operating on the medium wave band, we can at least prevent television from becoming a menace in the home if the motive force in obtaining television licences is to make a profit and is not to provide information or decent entertainment for the cultural advancement of the people. If honourable members on the Government side want to know more about this matter, they should read Lord Reith's recent book on the subject, in which they will find what members of the present Government said about broadcasting in earlier days. The name of the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) is also mentioned. However, I do not propose to read from that book at present. All I want to say is that there is much opinion in this country to support the view that we should not worry about television when we have much more to do to make Australia safe. If we are to be attacked in a few years, we should not be diverting labour and materials to provide television services for a couple of capital cities. TJnder this measure the board will be charged with the duty of bearing evidence about licences to be granted in Sydney and Melbourne. Now. Australians are a small people occupying a vast space. America is wealthy, and Great Britain is relatively wealthy. Let tbose countries conduct experiments on television, and we can enter the field later and obtain, through the results of their research, the latest methods of telecasting-as the term is-instea d of making the mistake of adopting a particular system and having to scrap it later. I cannot understand the insensate a haste of the Government to get commercial television established. In the days of the Chifley Government we wanted experimental television",79
128,Mr ADEKMANTST,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,The Chifley Government wanted to put a television station in each capital city.,79
129,Mr CALWELL,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"The honourable member for Fisher (Mr Adermann), who is not sitting in his proper place in the House and is therefore interjecting wrongly, sbould remember that the Chifley Government included his native State of Queensland in its plans; but this Government proposes to ignore Queensland. M i. ADERMANN - The people will have to pay for television wherever the stations may be established.",79
130,Mr CALWELL,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"That may be so, but the Chifley Government intended to conduct its particular experiments only to a certain stage, and at a later time it was to be decided what we should do about the whole matter of television. The Australian Broadcasting Control Board, which is to be the inquiry authority in the terms of the recommendations of a royal commission, only yesterday recommended that we should have frequency modulation broadcasting in this country. Apparently we shall soon reach a stage here when we shall be loaded down with all sorts of luxuries that we shall not be able to afford if Australia's position dangerous as we believe it to be. One thing that the press interests will not want is facsimile broadcasting, which is a method by which newspapers can be transmitted to people's homes over the radio in the same way as television programmes. I have an unhappy feeling Sir PHIL IP MCBRIDE - So you should.",80
131,Mr CALWELL,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"So I should have an unhappy feeling when a wealthy man like the Minister for Defence is in charge of this move to give benefits to his friends. I have an unhappy feeling about an article that I read in a newspaper recently in which it was stated that a combine in Sydney representing the Sydney Morning Herald, the Macquarie broadcasting network and other interests, was applying for a television licence. I do not believe that it is a good thing for the community to have monopolies of any sort in this country, and if we are to allow a big group of radio stations and metropolitan newspapers to have a television licence we shall be adversely serving the public interest. If we are to have television licences operated on a commercial basis I should like to see the Government make provision in this legislation for universities, schools, churches and all those authorities that cater for the intellectual and spiritual life of the community to be given an important interest chance. in the licences-if necessary completely free-in order that they may counterBritish balance the grossly materialistic elements and interests that will become associated with television for the purposes of exploiting some of the worse things that happen in human life. We have only to read some newspapers in order to see how selfish interests pander to sin and sorrow of all kinds.",80
132,Sir PHILIP MOBRIDE,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,The honourable member must have been reading the Tribune.,80
133,Mr CALWELL,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"There is a very good church newspaper in Melbourne called the Tribune, and there is a Communist newspaper in Sydney called the Tribune. I do not know which newspaper the Minister referred to. All I know is that what has happened in regard to television in the United States should not be is as allowed to happen in this country. Television in Great Britain is under national control, but even with the commercial setup which is soon to operate, television in Great Britain will be under far greater restraint than the restraint the Government proposes to impose on it here.",80
134,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,What may be said about colour television?,80
135,Mr CALWELL,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Colou r television is very costly. The Columbia network in America obtained permission a few years ago from the Federal Communications Commission to operate colour television, - but that permission was subsequently withdrawn. There are experiments with colour television going on all the time, and if we want it here-and it is better than black and white television-let us wait until the experimental stage in the United States has been passed. But there are unseen forces operating behind this Government, and pushing it into television. I do not believe that it will be in the public interest any more than I believe the British experiment will be in the public interest. The British Labour party has stated that when it is returned to office it will repeal the relevant British commercial television legislation, and the chances are that that party will win the next British election. Sir PHIL IP MCBRIDE - It has not a",80
136,Mr CALWELL,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"I believe that the Labour party has a better chance of winning the next British general election than has the Conservative party. But that is by the way. Whatever will happen is for the British people to decide. I suggest that this Government should not take a step which will make it difficult for subsequent governments to annul if they find it in the national interest to do so, to alter or scrap whatever may be done, and to start all over again. Television will not be a money spinner in this country. The experimental stage will be costly, and I believe that a number of private interests will come to the Government after a wliile and ask for subsidies on the ground that they are performing some great public service. Of course I do not believe that they will be performing such a service, because television would not be operating in country districts; it will be confined to the cities. This Parliament should not pander to those who are fortunate enough to live the 800 square miles of Australia which is occupied by more than 4,000,000 people. The people who live in that area are not the only good Australians, and it is far better that we sbould basten slowly on this matter and try to do more important things first. We have not been badly served without television, and I am not sure that we shall be well served with it. But I am concerned that television should not., fall into the hands of those who are more concerned with making profits for themselves and those behind them, than in teaching the children of Australia more about their country, and the people of Australia bow to enjoy a better and fuller life. Honourable members who represent widespread electorates will have to answer to their electors if , to the advantage of certain districts, they help to provide something for the swollen centres of population that are draining the economic life of Australia. bourne and Sydney flourish and grow strong at the expense of the rest of Australia. I cannot imagine why any government should, now that we are all talking about decentralization and development, do something which will help to centralize people in those two capital cities more so than in the past. Air. Gahoell. Therefore, while allowing this legislation to go through, we register our protest and give no. assurance about our future attitude towards any licences that may be granted by the board, three members of which we know and two prospective members of which we do not know. The Government itself will probably remain ignorant about the identity of tbose prospective members until somebody comes to a Cabinet meeting and says, "" These two people are highly recommended by the Melbourne Club, or the Union Club, or the Sydney Morning Herald, or the Daily Telegraph, or the Melbourne Herald. They will be useful and acceptable to us, so put tbem on the board. They will do what our friends want, and we shall get all the support we want on the radio, by television and in the newspapers in the next general election "". in Mr BRYSON (WiUs) [12.30 a.m.] I oppose this bill. I protest also at its introduction so late in the session, and at such a late hour. I believe that the Government bas bad plenty of time in the last few months to bring in this legislation. The bill seeks to increase the membership of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board from three to five by the appointment of two part-time members. The Minister for Defence (Sir Philip MCBride), who is in charge of the bill, has not given a reasonable explanation of the need for the proposed increase of membership. I recall'that when the original board was 'appointed, members of the Liberal party, and the Australian Country party occupied the Opposition benches in this chamber, and they protested strongly against the proposal to appoint a board of three to control the dis- broadcasting system. Tbose honourable members claimed at that time that a board of that kind was quite unnecessary, that the Labour Government was overMel- loading the broadcasting system with boards, and that more people than necessary were controlling broadcasts. They also objected to the existence of the Parliamentary Broadcasting Committee. When the wheel of fortune turned and the Liberal party and the Australian Country party became the government, the Postmaster-General (Mr Anthony) did not re-appoint the broadcasting mittee, which, for years, had done a deal of valuable work.",80
137,Mr FALKINDEB,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,What a shame!,82
138,Mr BRYSON,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"The honourable memhave ber for Franklin (Mr Falkinder) ridicules that committee. He was a afraid member of it for a time, and had he state given to the job the attention that deserved, he would know a good deal about broadcasting than his interjection suggests he knows. I believe that wasted his time as a member of that committee, because be did not attend his duties or understand his work. The Postinaster-General, at the begininterest ning of 1950, decided that the broadpersonnel casting committee was unnecessary because the broadcasting system was loaded with boards and committees. He bad objected to the appointment of the original Australian Broadcasting Control Board, but be got rid of the Broadreport casting Committee, and said that desired, the position generally had been imshould proved. The purpose of the bill now cial before the House is to increase the licences. membership of the control board from three to five. It was reasonable to expect that the Minister would give a detailed explanation of the reason the proposal, in view of the attitude the Liberal party and the Australian Country party to the board and to broadalong casting generally when they were in cial opposition. It is said that the board will have considerable amount of work to do with the introduction of television, but I suggest that the two part-time members will not take any work off the shoulders of the three full-time members. When the board meets., possibly once a month, the two part-time members will possibly add to the work of the three full-time members. I should also like to be of informed of the type of gentlemen whom the Government proposes to appoint as part-time members. I know that the bill provides that certain persons with financial interests, direct or indirect, broadcasting stations, will not be eligible, for appointment, but we have had television experience of appointments by this sary Government to boards and we have cause television. comto view this proposal with some doubts. good In other matters, the legislation has contained provisions designed to prevent persons associated with certain interests, from being appointed to boards, yet we found that the Government has been able to circumvent tbose sections. I am that if this bill is passed, a similar of affairs will arise in the future in it respect of the Australian Broadcasting more Control Board. When the Government was considering the appointment of the he royal commission on television, all sorts of promises were made to the effect to that the members of the commission would not be persons who had any personal in television. However, when the of the commission wasannounced, it was a different story. A overnumber of interests which were particularly concerned with the introduction of television into Australia, had representatives on that commission, and the kind of was made that this Government that is to say, that television be introduced, and that commerinterests should be granted television Personally, I object very strongly to that decision and I am inclined to for believe now that the idea of appointing of two part-time members of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board is to push with the introduction of commertelevision. I say definitely that Australia today cannot afford television, particularly a government system of telea vision with commercial television superimposed on it. It is suggested that, at the present time, two commercial licences will be issued for Sydney and two for Melbourne. Tbat suggestion means that there will be three television stations in 'Melbourne and three in Sydney, because there will be a government station in each of those two cities. An expenditure some millions of pounds will be incurred on the erection of the television stations alone. A large quantity of equipment will need to be provided, and a large number of highly skilled technicians will be in employed on tha work for a long period. That will be just for the erection of the stations, and to make the necespreparations for the introduction of I asked a question in trie House on Wednesday afternoon, and, in faet, I asked a similar question some time ago, about the provision of telephone services in the metropolitan area of Melbourne. What applies to the metropolitan area of Melbourne applies also to other capital cities and, possibly to every town throughout Australia. I have been informed by the Minister representing the Postmaster General that more applications for telephone services are being received than the department is able to handle, and that the waiting list is growing every week. In the metropolitan area of Melbourne alone more than 15,000 people are waiting for telephone services, and I have been informed by the Minister that one of the reasons why the lag cannot be overtaken is the shortage of skilled technicians. The work on the installation of new telephone exchanges and telephone services in general is highly skilled. The erection of television stations is technical work of a somewhat similar kind, and a technician who can do television work can also do work on telephone services. If six television stations are to be built, the demand for technical workers will be very great, and the provision of essential telephone services will be further delayed. We cannot have everything. When we are in that position, it is only sensible to decide to bave essential things first, and allow the luxuries to wait. Television in Australia is definitely a luxury. It is an expensive luxury for a small section of the community. So far, I have only referred to the provision of television stations. The next matter is the provision of television sets. We are told by the people who are eager to manufacture television sets that the cheapest sets will cost at least £140, and that a good set will cost about £200. So television at the present time is an expensive luxury which the majority of the Australian people cannot afford.",82
139,Mr OPPERMAN,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,They will buy television sets.,83
140,Mr BRYSON,REPORT OP PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"High-pressur e salesmen will be on the doorsteps, and unthinking people will buy the sets, as they have bought expensive luxuries over the years, and got themselves into trouble in doing so. The introduction of television to Australia at the present time is too expensive a luxury for the whole community. We cannot afford a luxury of that kind when we are short of essential services of a somewhat similar nature. Television is still in the experimental stages. The Government has not told us whether Australia is to have the English system or the American system of television. Colour television, which is more expensive than black and white, is in operation to a limited degree in the United States of America. I suggest, as the honourable meinber for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) has suggested, that it is a very good idea from our point of view to allow other people to continue with experiments until such time as they have this system perfected. When that day comes, Australia may be able to afford television. I know that advertising agents are clamouring for the introduction of television, and are endeavouring to form public opinion in favour of it, but as I see the position, the only people who are eager for the introduction of television in Australia in the immediate future are those who think that they can make a profit out of it. Combines are clamouring to obtain commercial television licences, and advertising agents are looking for a new field of business. Certain manufacturers see the possibility of making great profits from the sale of television sets, because some broadcasting receiving sets are lasting longer than the manufacturers bad. anticipated, and their sales are not so big as they would wish. Those manufacturers tbink that they will have a ready market for television sets, and make big profits. I am not interested in the desire of profit-making organizations to exploit the public with the sale of articles that the people can do without. I am definitely opposed to the immediate introduction of television in any form. I believe the Government should proceed very slowly even with the introduction of government-controlled television stations; but I am convinced that it is essential that commercial interests be kept entirely out of the television field. We have had sufficient experience of commercial broadcasting to be fully aware of the whole position.",83

The black and white system will then be out of date. Australia is able to do without television at the present time, and I suggest that it should continue to do without it. While we are doing without it, we can definitely do without additional members on the broadcasting control board. It is my belief that two part-time members would not take any weight of work off the shoulders of the existing members, but that they would add to their difficulties, their troubles, and their work. I suggest that the bill should be withdrawn. It is one that we do not need. It has been introduced too late in the session. It should never have been introduced. I definitely oppose it.

I stated that I would ask the draftsman to examine the clause to ascertain whether that point was covered with sufficient particularity.

I should like to offer Christmas wishes also to the Leader of the House, the Vice-President of the Executive Council (Sir Eric Harrison) and to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Calwell). I bracket them for this purpose because, between them, they have flogged ns through a great deal of work during this sessional period. I should like to offer to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt), to all other members of the Opposition, and to all other honourable members my warm good wishes for a merry Christmas and a happy New Year. As I have had occasion to remark before today, many people perhaps have a false idea of the happenings in the Parliament. I have heard it said that members of the Parliament should be paid for their work at so much for each day of sitting. That is all nonsense, because the work of the Parliament has become infinitely more rigorous and continuous than it was when I first entered this House. I have no doubt that honourable members on both sides of the House devote their talents and energy unremittingly to the interests of their electors, as they respectively see them. I should fail in my duty if I did not offer Christmas greetings to the whips, who, at all times, are whips and occasionally, no doubt, scorpions. I should like to offer our thanks and good wishes to the Clerk of the House and his assistants, and to the gentlemen of Hansard, who are at present under the threat of having to publish the reports of our speeches within a day instead of after the lapse of a fortnight, and who, at all times, do us perhaps rather more than justice.",86
170,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,What about a special message for the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) ?,87
171,Mr MENZIES,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"I ask for notice of that question. I should like to offer our thanks and good wishes to the officers of the Library, to the attendants of the House, to the refreshment-room staffs and to all those who cater for our requirements and attend to our needs as we discharge our duties. I am not at all sureI have been reminded of it by some onethat, if it is not a breach of the Standing Orders to do so, I should not offer our goodwill to our elder brethren in another place, because, by some remarkable dispensation of providence, they have, during the current Parliament, found it possible to agree steadily and uniformly with the Government. Therefore, I know that my friend the honourable member for  that we are greatly indebted to them. We go into recess on this occasion perhaps a little earlier than is usual for it is now only the middle of November. We shall, nevertheless, look forward to the work of the Parliament in a new year. We have had many exciting battles. We have had many differences of opinion. There have even been times, Mr Speaker, believe it or not, when some members of the House did not agree with your rulings.",87
172,Mr SPEAKER,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,Than k heaven!,87
173,Mr MENZIES,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"At all times, somewhat fewer than half the members of the House have found it possible to disagree most heartily with anything that I might say. But I always like to feel, and I say this after 26 years' experience of parliamentary life, that though we carry our differences with us, because we believe in tbem, we are able to go to the end of the year feeling that there is in this House a great deal, of goodwill and mutual respect. We may, therefore, all wish to one another a merry Christmas and the happiest of good new years.  On behalf of the Opposition, in the unavoidable absence of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Calwell), I take this opportunity to thank you, Mr. Speaker, the Chairman of Committees and the Temporary Chairmen for the service that has been rendered to us all, and to extend to you and to tbem, Christmas greetings and best wishes for a very happy recess. That goes, likewise, for all members of the Government and honourable members who sit behind the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies). It goes also, in particular, for the Clerk of the House, the Clerk Assistants, and especially for the Hansard staff. I do not know how they put up with us. It also goes for every member of the otber staffs of Parliament liouse. The Prime Minister bas spoken of the arduous session that we bave experienced and of the hard work which is the lot of members of this Parliament. It is true that the Ministers and the officers of the Opposition work strenuously indeed, but, in my opinion, the work of the average member of this Parliament is not comparable, when one takes differences of remuneration into consideration, with the work of the staffs of the Parliament, whether they work in this chamber, in the kitchen, or elsewhere in the building. The Prime Minister has said that this bas been a memorable session. That is true. There bave been some cheerful occasions, and there have also been incidents which have incurred my resentment, which still smoulders. One thing for which these sittings has been memorable more than for anything else has been the indecent haste with which members bave hurried into recess. It has also been particularly memorable for the disgracef u l application of the gag by the Governwhat ment. I daresay, if the records were examined, it would be found that an alltime record bad been set for this procedure. Those remarks, uttered in all seriousness, do not detract from the sincerity with which the Opposition wishes everybody-Governmen t members and others alike- a very happy recess. I hope that the comments I have made on the subject of the curtailment of the right of members to speak in this place will have some impact on the Government in our sittings in the new year.",87
174,Mr DAVIDSON,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"Dawson) [3.22 a.m.]. - I find myself this morning in the very privileged position of representing the Australian Country party in associating its members with the remarks which have been made by the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) and by the honourable member  behalf of the Opposition, in expressing appreciation and Christmas wishes to all tbose wbo have.been concerned with the work of the Parliament during the sittings that are about to conclude. It is well known that the privilege has fallen to my lot because our leader, the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Eadden), and our deputy leader, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr MCEwen), are abroad on urgent national business. Both right honourable gentlemen, realizing that they would be absent on this occasion, bave asked that they be particularly associated with the usual expressions of appreciation and goodwill which are offered at this time of the year. I ask you, Mr Speaker, to accept on bebalf of the members of the Australian Country party, in support of the expressions of the Prime Minister, our great appreciation of your work in this chamber. I say, with all sincerity, that we have a great admiration for the way in which you have treated us during these sittings. We know that you bring to your task a very wide knowledge of the Standing Orders and of the traditions which guide the deliberations, not only of this Parliament, but also of the Mother of Parliaments. We know also that you have brought to your task an obvious impartiality in dealing with the many problems that confront you. At the same time you have shown on many occasions I describe as a very human understanding of the frailties that all of us exhibit from time to time. We appreciate that, and this is the time when we express that appreciation. That expression of appreciation is offered not just to you yourself, but also to tbose associated with you in your office, that is to say, the Chairman of Committees and the deputies who assist you from time to time. We convey also our appreciation to the Clerk of the House and his assistants. We have good cause to know at times exactly - how valuable is the advice they offer to us from their deep knowledge of the procedures of the House. We have a great appreciation of the services rendered to all honourable members by the Hansard staff. As was stated a few minutes ago, we deliberated within the last few weeks on the possibility of some improvement in the reporting of the proceedings of' the House, but it is well realized by all honourable members that those deliberations did not in any way constitute any criticism of the actual work of the Hansard reporters. Many a time and oft we all of us have thought, when we looked at pulls of our speeches, "" ""What a splendid speech I made last night"". I said that to myself yesterday morning. Then there are the attendants. We press a button in front of us and we get quiet but effective service. To the attendants also we offer our thanks. The Prime Minister referred to the whips. As I am a whip, it may be felt that it would not be fitting for me to make any reference to them, but I think I should say on this occasion that I bave found there is a collaboration between the whips in this House to which I ought to pay tribute. We bave worked together as a team and have done our best to assist in the proper conduct of the Drummond. D. H. work of the House. I take this opportunity to thank the other whips for the work they have done. That remark applies, not only to the Government whip, but also to my colleague on the other side of the House, with whom I have bad much association and whose decency and straightforwardness I appreciate very much. I know that that feeling is shared by the Government whip. Finally, on behalf of the Australian Oountry party, I say that, at the end of the first sessional period after the last general election, a period in which affirmative. every promise made during the election campaign has-been honoured, we of the Australian Country party reiterate our allegiance to the Prime Minister, in whose sented :leadership we have the most complete confidence and whom we shall continue to support, as we have done in the past.",88
175,Mr WARD,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"East Sydney) [3.30 a.m.]. - I join with my colleague, the honourable  pressing sincere thanks to all employees of the Parliament who have assisted it to function smoothly.

176,Mr MENZIES,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"On the 26th October, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr. Griffiths) asked the following question:I ask .the Prime Minister whether it is a fact that yesterday he told the Federal Congress of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers, and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia which is meeting in Canberra, that he always wel-comed discussion with the federal executive of that organization in relation to matters which affected their membership, and that he has extreme confidence in every one of their federal - officials. If that is so, has his attention been - drawn to the resolution that was carried by the Federal Congress yesterday, which seeks clarification of section 47 of the Repatriation Aut, allegedly because tlic Repatriation Commission has failed to carry out the expressed intention of the act? If so, will the right honourable gentleman give consideration to the setting up of an all-party parliamentary committee to examine the Repatriation Act and, in particular, decisions that have been made by the Repatriation Commission in relation to section 47, and thereby show in a practical way that hc is really sympathetic with the problems of the members of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia? The honourable member will recall that the setting up of just such a committee as he now advocates was debated in this House during the passage of the Repatriation Bill last month. Indeed, the honourable member participated in the debate. I have nothing to add to the reasons which were then given why the Government is not prepared to accept the suggestion. NATIONAL SERVICE.",89
177,Mr MENZIES,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"On the 4th November, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr . Griffiths) asked the following question:Can the Prime Minister inform me whether Australian citizens when visiting the United Kingdom for the purpose of extending their education, industrial or otherwise, are liable for military service after twelve months' residence in the United Kingdom? In such circumstances can Australians be compelled to join the Army in England for a term of two years? If so, does this mean that such persons are unable to return to Australia until after their period of service has expired? If these are facts, are Australian citizens made aware of them prior to leaving this country for England? The United Kingdom National Service Act 1948 provides in Part 1, section 1 (1) that "". . . every male British subject ordinarily resident in Great B r it a in who has attained the age of eighteen years and has not attained the age of twenty-six years . . . shall be liable to be called upon to serve in the armed forces of the Crown . . ."". In regard to the phrase "" ordinarily resident"" section 34! (4) of the same act provides as follows:For the purposes of this part of this Act, a person who is resident in Great Britain shall be deemed to be ordinarily resident there unless(a) Ee is residing there only for the purposes of attending a course of education; or (6) The circumstances of his residence in Great Britain are otherwise such as to show that he is residing there for a temporary purpose only; or (e) Being a person who is, under the provisions of any Act in force in any part of His Majesty's dominions outside Great Britain, a national or citizen of that part within the meaning of that Act, or a person who was born or is domiciled in any such part of His Majesty's dominions or in a British Protectorate, a Mandated Territory, a Trust Territory or any other country or territory being a country or ' territory under His Majesty's protection or suzerainty, he has been resident in Great Britain for less than two years. Australian visitors to the United Kingdom for the purposes referred to by the honourable member would not therefore be liable for military service under the United Kingdom National Service Act. WOOL.",90
178,Mr FREETH,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice I. Has there been any change in the legal obstructions to payment of Joint Organization wool money to wool-growers affected by Poulton's case? 2. Have Poulton's solicitors indicated whether or not they intend to appeal to the Privy Council? 3. Have the Commonwealth's costs in the High Court ibeen taxed? 4. Will the Attorney-General examine the possibility of coming to an arrangement with the firm of Wilcox Mofflin Limited, in Western Australia, which has contracted in any event to pay the money to the wool-growers concerned, so as to avoid any further delay in payment of their money?",90
179,Mr MENZIES,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1 and 2. Despite our best efforts the matter has not advanced far since the High Court gave its decision in the Poulton case on the 16th December last. Future action depends upon the decision of the plaintiff whether to appeal to the Privy Council. It appears that the plaintiff has still not decided whether to seek leave to appeal, and Privy Council rules do not fix any time limits. Until the matter is disposed of, the Government cannot safely make a final distribution of wool profits, and we are therefore unable to say when a distribution will be made. We conrinuito press on the plaintiff's solicitor the urgency of a decision. The taxing of the Commonwealth's bill uf costs was completed before the taxing master on the 28th October, but the taxing master reserved certain items for further consideration and has not yet given his certificate. 4. With regard to this matter, I would refer the honoraible member to the terms of a reply which the Minister acting for the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture intends to make in the Senate today to a question asked by Senator Scott. I shall be happy to see that the honourable member gets a copy of this reply.",90
180,Mr MORGAN,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"the M in is A ir, upon notice I. Is it a fact that some life assurance companies do not accept any responsibility under life policies held by members of the Royal Australian A i r Force in the event of their deatli in an air crash, although the policies were taken out before they joined up? 2. If so, is there any procedure by which tlic Minister, or his department, or the Commonwealth Insurance Commissioner, could protect the interests of dependants in such cases? 3. Is it a fact that in the United States "" f America all servicemen are insured by the Government itself?",91
181,Mr TOWNLEY,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Policies issued by most life insurance companies in Australia before 1051, either do not contain a clause restricting benefits on death whilst flying with the Royal Australian Air Force or carrying a clause which has, in most instances, been waived. Since 105.1 most of the larger companies have inserted an air risk clause only if the applicant for insurance stated in his proposal that he intended to engage in service flying. Other companies, however, have inserted this clause in all policies. In all coses the insured can obtain full cover by payment of an extra premium. 2. There is no provision in the Life Insurance Act to compel an insurance company-(a ) to issue a policy to a particular individual, or (b) to vary the terms of a policy which is otherwise in compliance with the act. 3. I am advised that since 1950, United States servicemen are insured to a maximum sum of 10,000 dollars free of cost to the servicemen. This is distinct from private insurance policies taken out by the individuals themselves. I am informed that these policies contain aviation risk clauses and full insurance cover can be obtained only by the payment of additional premiums by the servicemen themselves. FLOUR.",91
182,Mr FREETH,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"the Minister representing the Minister acting for the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, upon notice What was the tonnage of flour shipped from the States of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia, respectively on Australian Wheat Board orders during the period the 1st September, .1953, to the 31st August, 1954?",91

This is in accordance with a request by the Federal Council of Flour M ill Owners. COPPER.",91
184,Mr SWARTZ,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"the Minister for Supply, upon notice I. Has the copper market remained steady so far this financial year? 2. Are any fluctuations anticipated in the near future? 3. Has the United States of America agreed to suspend the import duty on copper for a further year?",91
185,Mr BEALE,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"The answer to the honor- * able member's questions are as follows:1. The copper market has not been steady on the London Metal Exchange this financial year, rising from £ (stg.) 240 on the 31st August, 1954, to £(stg.)307 10s. on the 5th October, 1954. The present price is of the order of £(stg.) 275 a ton. The reasons for these fluctuations were the strikes ou the copper mines in Chile and the United States and the shortage of spot copper in the United Kingdom. 2. Threatened labour trouble in Northern Rhodesia may cause further fluctuations in the London Metal Exchange quotations. 3. The United States has suspended the import duty on copper for another year. HEALTH AND MEDICAL SERVICES.",91
186,Mr ALLAN FRASER,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"the Minister for Health, upon notice I. Are doctors in general practice in some places increasing their fees in accord with decisions of local British Medical Association branches ? 2. Ate typical increases from 15s. to 17s. for visit to the surgery and from 17s. 6d. £1 ls. for visit to the home? 3. Are these increases justified by any increase in cost of living' to doctors, in which case will the Government increase the Comemployed. monwealth subsidy accordingly so that the value of tlic medical benefit is not' destroyed? 4. If the increases are unjustified, w i l Government act to confine the operation of the medical benefit sclieme to doctors who agree to charge only approved rates of fee?",92
187,Sir EARLE PAGE,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"The answers to the industries honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Doctors, like other members of the community, have increased their fees to meet the altered economic conditions. These alterations in fees are made by the local associations which form part of the British Medical Association. The Commonwealth Parliament has no constitutional power to fix medical fees. 2. Medical charges throughout Australia have always varied in different districts. The customary charges throughout Australia are 15s. per consultation at the surgery and £1 ls. for a visit at the home. In several areas the fee at the surgery is 17s. 6d. Members of the British Medical Association attend pensioners at concessional fees under the pensioner medical service. 3. In the opinion of the medical profession, the increase in consultation fees, which were mostly made before the introduction of the Commonwealth medical benefits scheme, are fully justified. 4. See the answer to question 3. BUILDING ""WORKERS. Mr ""WIGHT asked the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice I. Is action contemplated to improve the numerical strength of the labour force engaged in the building industry, especially, in regard to that section engaged in the production of material for building? 2. Does the immigration policy being pursued take full cognizance of the shortage of labour in the building industry?",92
188,Mr HOLT,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. While it is difficult to assess precisely dimensions of the labour force engaged in the building industry, the Commonwealth Statistician's latest quarterly survey of building activity showed that at the end of June, 1954, the 107,795 persons engaged on the construction of new buildings represented an increase of some 0,500 during the previous six montlis. Precise information concerning the number of workers engaged in the various sections of industry producing building materials is not available, but regular surveys made by my Department of Labour and National Service, 6d. covering some 440 of the larger private estabto lishments producing building materials, show that over the nine months ended September, 1954, there was an overall increase of approximately 5 per cent, in the numbers of workers However, with the continued buoyancy of the economy, the unsatisfied demands for labour, both for building construction and l the for the production of building materials, are tending to increase, and I assure the honourable member that my department, through the Commonwealth Employment Service, will continue to do everything possible to assist these in meeting their labour requirements. 2. In planning the immigration programme for the current financial year, the Government has given special consideration to the labour needs of the building and allied industries and, under the various Commonwealth assisted passage migration schemes, substantial provision has been made for the recruitment of workers for these industries. All categories of workers have been provided for-skilled , semi-skilled and unskilled. BUILDING MATERIALS.",92
189,Mr WIGHT,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"the Minister representing the Minister for National Development, upon notice I. What positive steps have been taken by this Government to encourage or promote an increase in the production of building materials ? 2. What - increase in the production of the basic materials required for the construction of residential type buildings has occurred during the terms of office of this Government? 3. What are the materials which are principally causing delay in the construction of residential buildings today?",92
190,Mr CASEY,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w s : 1. The two major problems which beset the building materials industries when this Government came to power were a shortage of black coal and a shortage of labour. The production of black coal has been lifted from 14,900,000 tons in 1948-49 to 19,400,000 tons in 1953-54 and supplies are now adequate. Although there are still labour shortages the Government's migration policy has contributed more than 300,000 workers to the Australian work force since 1949. Migrant labour has been made available to essential industries the including the timber industry, tha clay products industry and the cement industry. The Governinent has also facilitated the import of materials in short supply such as galvanized iron, structural steel, cement and timber, and has continued to control exports. Customs by-law entry has been granted for building materials and for essential items of capital equipment for building material's production. Sales tax exemptions have been extended to include builders hardware and other miscellaneous items required fbr building construction. There are now no important building materials subject to sales tax. 2. The following statistics show the increases which have occurred in the production of basic building materials since 1948-49:Clay bricks Millions 617 Tiles, clay .. „ 44.2 Tiles, cement „ 28.3 Cement building sheets Million square yards 18.6 Fibrous plaster sheet '000 square yards 13,234 Galvanized iron '000 tons 84.0 Portland cement . . „ 1,031 Sawn native timber Million super, feet 1,184 3. The principal materials at present in short supply are clay bricks and clay tiles. The shortage of clay tiles is offset to some extent by an increased .production of cement tiles. Although local production of cement and galvanized iron is not at present sufficient to meet the demand, most of the shortages are being met by imports, and manufacturing capacity is being increased to meet requirements.",92
