2,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: The Budget will increase unemployment to unprecedented and crisis proportions at a time when hundreds of thousands of Australians, especially school-leavers, young workers and apprendces, are without work; the Budget completes the dismantling of Medibank as a simple, effective universal health insurance scheme, providing basic coverage for the total community; the Budget, by its heavy cuts in urban and transport programs, will worsen the quaUty of Ufe available to many Australians; the Budget will compel state governments to reduce their services and increase charges; the Budget reduces spending on Aboriginal affairs by 30 per cent and returns expenditure on Aborigines to pre-1972 days; the Budget seriously disadvantages migrant groups, most notably in employment and health, and leaves room for concern over the future of ethnic radio; the Budget, despite the government's earUer rhetoric about defence threats to Australia, continues to hold the size of the armed services at present levels; and the Budget, despite all the above, still cannot be expected to reduce Austria's annual inflation rate below twelve per cent. Your petitioners therefore Budget be redrafted to provide for economic recovery within the guide-lines laid down by the Australian Labor Governgive ment's 197S Budget. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Les Johnson, Mr Les MCMahon, Mr Orchestra, Martin and Mr Stewart. Petitions received. Aboriginal Land Rights To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth: That the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill 1976, does not satisfy the Aboriginal needs for land m the Northern Tenitoiy. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, should: 1. Extend the freeze on European claims to the unaUenated Crown Lands of the Northern Tenitoiy until 12 months after the passage of the Bill; and to provide for speedy lodging and hearing of Aboriginal Claims. The hearing of Aboriginal claims has been postponed as a result of Government decisions, Aborigines should not be penalised; 2. Amend the Bill to ensure: (a) The removal of aU powers to pass Land Rights Legislation from the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, particularly its control over sacred sites, entry permits, control over the seas adjoining Aboriginal land, thefishingrights of non-Aborigines, the right of Aborigines to enter pastoral stations and control of wildUfe on Aboriginal land.

(e) A provision that any Government decision to override Aboriginal objections to mining on the basis of national interest be itself reviewed by both houses of parUament. (0 A provision that land-owning groups of Aborigines may apply to form separate trusts if they wish.

And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Bryant and Mr Les MCMahon. Petitions received. Symphony Orchestra in Newcastle To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled, the huble petition of the undersigned citizens of the Hunter Valley Region respectfully showeth the lack of a resident professional symphony orchestra in Newcastle and surrounding areas, with consequent denial to the citizens of adequate provision of concerts, opera, ballet, school concerts, teaching of various orchestral instruments and career opportunities for young humbly pray that the 1976 musicians. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that Parliament due and early consideration to the provision of funds, in association with the N.S.W. State Government, Local Governments and the community of this region, for the establishment and maintenance of the Hunter Symphony consisting initaUy of 40 players, located in Newcastle and serving the cultural needs of the 500 000 inhabitants of the region, in accordance with the proposal and budget submitted to the Industries Assistance Commission, and your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Charles Jones and Mr Morris. Petitions received. Pensions To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives is Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfuUy showeth our concern for single pensioners or married pensioners who have lost their partners, about funeral expenses. With married couples the normal pension is continued foi twelve weeks after the death of one of the partners and this helps pay for funeral arrangements. This benefit is denied a single pensioner. We believe this benefit could be easily extended to single pensioners and we request that this be done during the current session of Parliament. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Dr. J.F. Cairns. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: (a) That the use of uranium as a source of energy is currendy unacceptable as it presents problems including radioactive waste, military implications and environmental degradation. (b) That there can, at present, be no assurances that radioactive materials exported for peaceful purposes will not be used in the production of nuclear weapons. (c) That there is not, as yet, any known safe method of disposing of radioactive wastes, nor is there likely to be. (d) That the export of uranium from Australia is internationally irresponsible benefit to Australia. (e) That the export of uranium from Australia discourages importing countries development funds infindingviable alternatives. (f) That only the overdeveloped industrial nations will benefit from Australian uranium and the gap between these countries and the energy-starved third world will increase yet further. (g) That the securing of land rights by Australian Aborigines, promised by successive governments, is prejudiced by uranium mining. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Government will immediately cease the mining and prohibit the export of uranium until perfectly safe methods of final disposal for radioactive wastes have been guaranteed; will greatly increase expenditure on research into safe, clean and inexhaustible sources of energy; and will aid underdeveloped countries in their efforts to secure a fair share of the world's energy resources, while at the same time honouring its obligations to the future of humanity. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Donald Cameron. Petition received. To the Speaker and the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that many Australians are concerned at the recent outbreak of racialriotsand killings in South Africa. We your petitioners do therefore humbly pray that the Australian Government: 1. call upon the South African Government to eUminate apartheid and racial discrimination; 2. withdraw the Australian Trade Commissioners from South Africa, in accordance with UN. resolution 3411G (December 1975). And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Connolly. Petition received. Dockyards at Newcastle To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Newcastle respectfully showeth: That shipbuilding and repairs play a vital role in the economic stability of the Newcasde region. That a recent study by the Hunter Valley Research FounUranium dation showed that 50 000 people were partially or wholly maintained by the State Dockyard. That stability is at present in jeopardy, as a new ship order is required within the next few weeks if serious unemployment and hardship is to be avioded. That the previous Government's plan for the building of a graving dock in Newcasde should be continued as proper ship repair facilities are a vital factor in the maintenance of a viable shipbuilding industry. That the Government's election pledge to restore business and employment can be implemented in Newcastle if new orders and a graving dock are granted. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government place immediate orders with the Newcasde State Dockyard and implement the previous Government's plan to build a graving dock in Newcasde. and is not, in the long term, of And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Morris. from investing research and Petition received. Governor General To the Honourabe the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That, although we accept the verdict of the Australian people in the 1975 election, we do not accept therightof the Governor General to dismiss a Prime Minister who maintains the confidence of the House of Representatives. We believe that the continued presence of Sir John Kerr as Governor General is a cause of division among the Australian people. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your honourable House will call on Sir John Kerr to resign as Australian Governor General. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Wallis. Petition received. South Africa NA NA Mr E. G. Whitlam- I ask the Prime Minister a question. Has the Government made a decision on any aspects of uranium niining or exports? If so, will a prompt announcement be made, as was done in relation to Fraser Island?",16
3,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,URANIUM,"The honourable gentleman must be able to read my mind because the Government has made certain decisions in these matters. At an appropriate time today- I am not sure what time the Leader of the House House has organised- a statement will be made which will indicate the extent of any decisions taken to this point. There will then be adequate opportunity to debate the matters in the Parliament. If the wider community wishes to debate these matters, obviously it will be able to discuss the decisions which the Government has so far taken. I do not want to pre-empt that statement. I hope it will have the universal support of the honourable gendeman. NA",17
4,Mr JARMAN,SYDNEY NEWSPAPER DISPUTE,I ask the Prime Minister that What is the position relating to industrial putes concerning John Fairfax and Sons Ltd in Sydney? Can the Government take any action in this matter?,18
5,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,SYDNEY NEWSPAPER DISPUTE,"The disputes in circumstances, Sydney involving John Fairfax and Sons Ltd are of very great importance and the Government, this point, has shown a very real measure patience in regard to any actions which it might have taken, especially in relation to its own ployees. The position began with a strike by the Printing and Kindred Industries Union about 3 weeks ago. The Australian Postal and Telecomgentlemen munications Union became involved in the issue about 2 weeks ago in support of the PKIU. Since the APTU has been involved no mail has been delivered to John Fairfax and Sons. At the same time, I am advised that if telephones or telex chines went out of operation they would not be repaired. In relation to the PKIU, the matter gone to the New South Wales Industrial Comseek mission on more than one occasion, I think, and the Industrial Commission, an instrument under continues. law of the New South Wales Government, has said that the bans ought to be lifted and that the members of the union ought to return to work. That direction has been ignored. As I indicated, the APTU also joined in this matter about 2 weeks ago. As aresultof that, John Fairfax and Sons approached the New South Wales Supreme Court to get the Court to lift the bans, if in Court's judgment that were the proper course. am advised that the Court made such a judgment but the bans remain. We have a situation in which one union is defying the New South Wales Industrial Comof mission, that is in the New South Wales trial jurisdiction; and another union is in defiance of the Supreme Court. This is a serious situation, and I believe that to an extent the seriousness compounded by the fact that this kind of action, selectively directed against the media, can impose a kind of censorship in Australia which utterly alien to our democratic system of governmuch ment and it ought not to be tolerated. There is another matter involved. Members the APTU who are employees of the Postal Commission are clearly employees of the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth will not abide a situation in which employees of the Commonwealth gain full pay for doing part of their job. That is the situation which has developed. Members of the union are indicating selectively that'they are not going to do all their work, that they will do only that part of it which pleases them, but they seek to gain full pay in situation. Obviously that makes it possible disfor members of the union to direct industrial action selectively against a company or against an industry at no penalty and at no cost whatsoever to members of the union concerned. In those and with the patience the Commonwealth has shown to this point in relation to at the decisions of the Supreme Court and the of Industrial Commission being defied, the Commonwealth is not prepared to stand by with the empowers available to it and not use those powers. Mr Innes-Tell us what you are going to do.",18
6,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,SYDNEY NEWSPAPER DISPUTE,"Honourable opposite are now starting to listen to this answer. If they will wait a moment they will hear exactly what the Government has determined to do over this matter. The Minister for Post and Telecommunications will be calling the maPostal Commission into formal conference this afternoon and, if it is necessary, the Minister will has be prepared to direct the Postal Commission to the insertion of a bans clause in the award. That bans clause will be applied if the situation NA",18
7,Mr UREN,OVERSEAS RESERVES,"I direct my question to the Treasurer. Is it a fact that Australia's overseas reserves fell by $269m during October and that there was a net outflow of capital of $258m in that month? Was this the third consecutive the month in which there was a net outflow of capiI tal? Has private capital outflow for the last 3 months been $20m in August, $238m in September and $230m in October? Are Australia's reserves now sufficient tofinanceonly 3 months imports? If so, what does the Government indusintend to do to rectify this disaster?",18
8,Mr LYNCH,OVERSEAS RESERVES,"I do not quite know why the honourable gentleman should seek to keep up a is series of questions in this House on a subject which he knows to be a sensitive matter both for a question and, indeed, for an answer by a is Treasurer. The honourable gentleman is very aware of the general policy which the Government is pursuing and which it has made of abolutely clear on a number of occasions. The honourable gentleman is also very much aware o of the official borrowing program that the Government has embarked upon for reasons that have been laid down in this House on a number of occasions. The honourable gendeman says that there are only 3 months of reserves. Of course, the facts are that the reserves at the end of October were $2.36 billion. That is equal to 3 months' imports or about 3Vi months' if the gold component of reserves is valued at market prices. The reserves are at a comfortable level. The underlying external position remains sound. Exports, as the honourable gendeman knows, to the 4 months to October were up 29 per cent on the same period for the previous year. Imports in the 4 months period were up 25 per cent on the same period for the previous year. I have mentioned before that the Government is pursuing a program of official borrowing pending a pick up in private capital flows against the background of recovery prospects and the winding down of inflation. I do not believe that I need to add to this. In fact on this general matter, questions would be better placed on the notice paper. NA NA",18
9,Mr BOURCHIER,COMMISSION,"Is the Minister for Post and Telecommunications aware of decisions by the Australian Broadcasting Commission to reduce expenditure by $2m? Will this mean that a number of pubhc affairs programs, including State of the Nation, This Day Tonight, Four Corners and Monday Conference, will be reduced? Will the Government be prepared to give sympathetic consideration to a request from the ABC for additional funds to cover cost increases?",19
10,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,COMMISSION,"I want first of all to make the point that the budgetary restraints placed upon the Australian Broadcasting Commission were no greater than the restraints placed upon the rest of Government expenditure. I am aware that yesterday there was a meeting of the Commission and a decision was taken to reduce expenditure by $2m. It has been decided that there will be a reduction or an elimination of some programs. State of the Nation, This Day Tonight, Monday Conference and others have been mentioned in that context. I would be prepared to say that of course we would like the Australian Broadcasting Commission to maintain the highest possible number of public affairs programs, particularly if they are presented in an objective manner. When the Chairman of the Commission writes to me, as I understand proposes to do, putting the facts before me, I will study them and if I believe that they justify an approach to the Government, that approach will be .made. NA",19
11,Mr CHARLES JONES,WORKER PARTICIPATION,"Is the Minister for Transport aware of the recent statement at a productivity conference in Melbourne by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations in which he urged companies to provide worker participation schemes in their managerial affairs? Does the Minister agree with his colleague's statement, and if so can he say when he is going to appoint a trade union representative to the board of Qantas Airways Ltd, following the resignation of Jack Egerton from all trade union activities? Also, can he say when he is going to appoint trade union representatives to the National Airlines Commission and to the National Material Handling Bureau which are commissions and authorities under his jurisdiction.",19
12,Mr NIXON,WORKER PARTICIPATION,"The honourable member for Newcastle obviously has not caught up with the change in administrative arrangements. The National Materials Handling Bureau now comes under the auspices and control of my new colleague, the Minister for Productivity and I will allow him to answer for that organisation. As far as Qantas is concerned, Sir Jack Egerton was appointed by the Labor Government. I thought that that was a very proper appointment at the time and I said so. He was reappointed by me, as Minister for Transport, for a new 5-year term, and he will remain on the Qantas board for that time. I think he would represent the trade union movement much better that a lot of the loud mouthed spokesmen in this House and outside it. Therefore I have no intention whatsoever of doing anything about that appointment or any other trade union appointment to the Qantas board. Consideration is being given to appointments to the Australian Airlines Commission. They will be announced at the appropriate time. I think that my colleague the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations has shown great leadership in this question of managementemployee relationship-somethin g which the previous Labor Government might have taken more seriously. ST GEORGE AREA : TRANSPOR T NA",19
13,Mr NEIL,PROBLEMS,Is the Minister for Transport aware of the serious heavy transport problem in the St he George area of Sydney? Will the proposed Kyeemagh-Chullora country road alleviate the problem? Is the Minister prepared to authorise funds for this project?,19
14,Mr NIXON,PROBLEMS,"The honourable member for St George invited me to visit his electorate some weeks ago and I accepted the invitation. I was very impressed with the way in which the honourable member handled matters concerning his electorate. He has been most vigorous in placing before me the transport problems of St George and I congratulate him for it. It is fair to say that the Kyeemagh-Chullora road, which the honourable member mentioned, was presented to the Federal Government by the previous Willis State Government as a No. 1 priority road for development to solve the transport problems of the whole of the area. Regrettably, when the new State Labor Government came to power it took that priority away and did not in fact place any emphasis on other roads in the area for quick development. The result is, therefore, that Commonwealth funds are not going into the area as perhaps they should and could. I assure the honourable member that should the New South Wales Government put that road back in its list of priorides funds will be made available. There are still $6m in funds available for export roads in New South Wales. I hope that the New South Wales Government will see the force of the representations being made by the honourable member for St George and include the road concerned in its list of priorities. NA NA",20
15,Mr WALLIS,INDUSTRY AUTHORITY,"Is the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations aware that some members of the staff of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority who have been under notice of dismissal since July but have now obtained alternative employment through thenown efforts are being refused permission to resign from the Authority with full redundancy entitlements? Will the Minister give an undertaking that irrespective of the Government's decision on the plans for the restructuring of the industry, staff of the Authority who have received notice of retrenchment at the direction of the Minister and who have obtained alternative employment by their own efforts will be allowed to leave the Authority with their full redundancy entitlements?",20
16,Mr STREET,INDUSTRY AUTHORITY,"Yes, I am aware of the problem to which the honourable member has referred. I expect to be making a statement on the future of the stevedoring industry during the current session. As the honourable member would be aware, following long and detailed discussions with the unions involved satisfactory redundancy arrangements were arrived at for the members of the staff of the Authority. I am concerned at the uncertainty which surrounds their immediate future employment. Once I have made the parliamentary statement that I mentioned a moment ago I intend to confer again with the unions concerned on such issues as the honourable gentleman has raised. NA",20
17,Mr WILSON,TELEVISION RECEPTION IN ADELAIDE,"The Minister for Post and Telecommunications will recall that in August he undertook to have the problems facing those in the foothill suburbs of metropolitan Adelaide now dependent on cable television resolved as a matter of urgency. What is to be done to provide continuous reception for these viewers? Will a UHF translator be installed? If so, when? In the meantime, will the commitment of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to provide funds to enable cable viewing to continue to operate on a non-profit, no loss basis be honoured? Is the Board bound by the commitments of its officers? Is it in the habit of welshing on its obligations? What action will be taken against officers who purport to make commitments on behalf of the Board in circumstances which do not bind the Board?",20
18,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,TELEVISION RECEPTION IN ADELAIDE,"I am well aware of the problems in the foothills of Adelaide. Indeed, the honourable member for Sturt has raised this matter with me on a number of occasions. I have been over there and discussed this matter in Adelaide. I repeat once again that this problem will have to be resolved satisfactorily before the end of this year. A decision on the UHF translator has been made but regrettably its operation probably will be a year to 18 months away. Obviously, some solution has to be found in the short term whilst we are awaiting that translator. I want to say this to the honourable member for Sturt: I will not comment publicly upon his obvious criticism of an officer of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. The Board cannot promise funds. The Board does not have funds to expend on this matter. I will have to content myself by saying to the honourable member for Sturt that he is aware I know of the details of the discussions and conversations. He is aware I have indicated that I believe this is a matter that has to be resolved. I am looking for a short term solution which will get us over the immediate problem. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam- I direct a question to the Prime Minister. Has the Government received the interim report of the Bailey task force on co-ordination in welfare and health which was due at the end of last month? Will he table the report in the Parliament so that State governments, local government bodies and the many organisations engaged in federally funded health and welfare programs are given the opportunity to examine its recommendations prior to any action the Government takes upon it and, in case the recommendations in the report do not command universal support, make representations upon them?",20
19,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,REPORT ON WELFAR E AND HEALT H,"I thank the honourable gentleman for that question. I have not yet received a copy of the report. As the honourable gentleman would know, it covers a very large area. I am not saying that the draft report is not available; I am saying that I have not received it. It is not over my desk. Clearly, there will be matters of very great importance to be considered inrelationto it. I am advised that in some of the aspects of the report,the inquiry has been influenced by the report of the Henderson inquiry into poverty. I think that it will very valuable document. It will certainly deserve the most serious consideration not only by the Commonwealth Government but also by this Parliament and by other people involved in the delivery of welfare services. We will not be intending to rush decisions as a result of the report. I hope that the honourable gentleman will understand me when I say that I would not want to pre-empt decisions about the precise handling of it until I have the report and have seen it. NA",21
20,Mr MACKENZIE,LOCAL GOVERNMENT ROAD WORKS,"The Minister for investment Transport will recall only too well that the New South Wales Minister for Transport did not abide by the Commonwealth's request that the additional $ 11.3m recently made available that State be used for local government road works with special emphasis on rural local roads. I ask the Minister Has he received any notification, tion from the New South Wales Minister that he will abide by the Commonwealth's request or the New South Wales Government still State government yet to make up its mind on this issue?",21
21,Mr NIXON,LOCAL GOVERNMENT ROAD WORKS,I am not sure whether confirmation has come in officially from the New South Wales Government that it has accepted my request that the $ 11.3m go to rural arterial roads and to rural local roads. But my information is that it is prepared to accept that request. NA,21
22,Mr COHEN,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"I ask the Treasurer Has yet another responsible body, namely, the Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research of the University of Melbourne, forecast that 1977 will see rising inflation, increased unemployment and a breakdown in wage indexation? Does the report claim that the economy has remained stagnant, that output has increased only marginally, that unemployment isrisingand that the growth of real gross domestic product for 1976-77 will be only 1 per cent? In view of the constant and repeated claims by responsible economic analysts, such as this type of organisation, that the Government has missed the boat to economic recovery, will the Government review its policies torestoreconfidence?",21
23,Mr LYNCH,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"I am acquainted With the survey recently conducted by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research. The House will recall that I have said on earlier occasions, going back to 1972, that I have a sense of muted enthusiasm for the recommendations be a which that body puts forward, and that attitude remains. The fact is that the Institute is perfectly entitled, as are others in the Australian community, to put forward its views on the direction which economic policy ought to take in this country. I simply make 2 quick points: Firstly, the forecast by the Institute of an inflation rate of 11 per cent during 1977 is clearly inconsistent with the most recent evidence about the rate of price increases, and I refer the House to what I said recently about the increase of 2.2 per cent in September. I am not sure that that information would have been available to the Institute at the time that it made itsfindings.Secondly, the forecast is seriously at odds with the latest survey results. As regards the particular points which the honourable gentleman made concerning a review of policies, it is my belief to and that of the Government that our economic policies are working. Those policies, which resulted from our concern about the rate of inflaare reflected in the most recent downturn in the consumer price index, as well as in the other is factors to which I referred in the statement. I the only issued last Sunday night. ALBURY-WODONGA",21
24,Mr HOLTEN,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"My question is directed to the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development and relates to Albury Wodonga. Where and when can details of the new designated area for Albury-Wodonga be When, obtained by the pubhc? Are these new boundState ariesfinalor will people be able to register tions? Will those objections be considered? the Minister seen reports that people who wish sell their properties will still be under a cloud? Has the Minister any comment on this report? 1976? Finally, what reaction has the Minister had from residents of Albury-Wodonga and from the States to the Commonwealth's proposals?",21
25,Mr NEWMAN,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Last Monday night the Ministerial Council for Albury-Wodonga met, and I am glad to say that the Council, on which Victoria and New South Wales are represented, endorsed the Commonwealth's proposition that Albury-Wodonga should become a national pilot project. The Council went further and endorsed a program of funding for this financial year. It also examined the question of land sition. I am also glad to say that in considering this question the States were mindful of the ment put by the Commonwealth that this was a time for fiscal restraint. All parties, including New South Wales and Victoria, agreed that area of land to be acquired in that region should be reduced from approximately 48 000 hectares' to 17 000 hectares. This will mean a saving about $45m to $50m. Turning to the first of the specific points raised in the question, the Wodonga Development Corporation will pubenterprise, lish a map on, I believe, Monday, 22 November, which will show in detail those areas of Wodonga which are now to be acquired. With regard to the second part of the question concerning appeal or debate, the Ministers concerned considered this question very carefully and took into account all aspects of the decision to reduce the area of land to be acquired. The cision is final. As to the last part of the question, have had no reaction from anybody in the area. finish as I began by saying that aU Ministers the States of Victoria and New South Wales endorsed unqualifiedly the proposals which I have talked about today. NA",22
26,Mr FITZPATRICK,UNEMPLOYMENT IN MARYBOROUGH,"My question is directed the Prime Minister. I ask: What plans or projects does the Government have in mind to ensure continuing employment for those people Maryborough district affected by the Government's decision on Fraser Island? Does he accept this decision as a national responsibility and one to be borne by a smaU section of the Ausreference traUan community Uving near Fraser Island? if at all, does he expect to have talks with and local government representatives objecregarding projects for employment? Further, is Has he aware that an amount of almost $lm for unto employment reUef schemes was paid out to local authorities last year, compared with nothing in",22
27,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,UNEMPLOYMENT IN MARYBOROUGH,"It has already been announced that the Government is prepared and willing to co-operate with the Queensland Government concerning investigations to promote further development of forestry and tourism and to examine the prospects of greater activity as a result of the construction of a water barrage, a project currently being advanced in the Maryborough area. The House will also recaU that the export licences that were issued in relation to this matter were issued subject to theresultsof the inquiry. Therefore, comacquipanies proceeding with development, as they have, were doing so, to a certain degree, at risk. arguThey were well aware of the risk involved. The honourable gentleman has suggested that certain make-work schemes, such as the the Regional Employment Development scheme, should be introduced again. Under the previous Administration, schemes such as this involved of the expenditure of very large sums of money. They were abandoned as being ineffective. This AlburyGovernment is interested in real productive not the kind of wasteful make-work projects promoted by the previous Government Alburyand abandoned because they were noted failures. NA",22
28,Mr SIMON,FRASER ISLAND,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Environment, Housing and Comdemunity Development. Will the Minister confirm I that the final report of the Commission of I Inquiry on Fraser Island is primarily concerned from with the environmental aspects of Commonwealth decisions regarding the export of minerals extracted from the island? Will the Government seek to have the whole of Fraser Island classified as a world heritage area under the International Convention for the Protection of the DISTRICT World's Cultural and Natural Heritage? Also, will the Government seek to have Fraser Island to classified as part of the National Estate of Australia? In this event, will the Government also examine the impact of forestry and tourism in the on the environment of Fraser Island?",22
29,Mr NEWMAN,FRASER ISLAND,"The honourable member is not correct in stating that under the terms of of the inquiry the commissioners focused their attention on the environmental aspects of the Commonwealth's decision on the granting of export licences. The Government has already stated that it would like to see Fraser Island declared as part of the National Estate. For the information of the honourable member, the procedure for taking this action, I recall, detailed in section 23 and section 25 of the tralian Heritage Commission Act. I think the Government would also give consideration to be including Fraser Island as part of the Interquite national Heritage. That could be done under the United Nations Educational Scientific and Culeffectively tural Organisation Convention for the protection of the world",22
30,Mr SPEAKER,FRASER ISLAND,"Order! The honourable cept envisages. gentleman will resume his seat. There is private oral warfare being conducted in one corner of the House. I will not name the honourable memdeveloping bers concerned but if they continue to disrupt answer of the Minister I will be forced to deal with several of them. I call the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Australian Development.",23
31,Mr NEWMAN,FRASER ISLAND,"As I was saying, the Governwork ment will give consideration to having the declared under the UNESCO Convention for the Protection of the World's Cultural and Natural Heritage. We are a signatory to that Convention and that could be done. As to the matter of the management of tourism and logging island, when my colleague Mr Nixon and I saw the Premier yesterday we put the proposition to him that we would be very willing to co-operate in any management plans on these aspects of mamtaining the island. I hope that the Premier will give serious consideration to that offer. PLANT BREEDERS' RIGHTS",23
32,Mr MARTIN,FRASER ISLAND,"Is the Minister for Primary able Industry aware that negotiations have been going on for many years for the introduction legislation to grant patentrightsto the breeders of plants, which are commonly known as plant breeders' rights? Is it a fact that this type patent legislation is in existence in most developed countries, including the United States of America, the United Kingdom, most eral European countries and New Zealand? Is it also a fact that this lack of patent protection is fying the commercial development of better breeds of plants, grain and ucts, to the disadvantage of Australian agricultural production? When can plant breeders expect some action from the Government in this respect?",23
33,Mr SINCLAIR,FRASER ISLAND,"I thank the honourable gentleman for the question. It relates to an which has concerned me for a good many years. He may not be aware that, unfortunately, within the States there is some considerable opposition to the proposition for the introduction of legislaton to protect plant breeders'rights.Therefore it is has been through consultation in the Australian AusAgricultural Council that the Commonwealth has attempted to develop legislation that might acceptable. It is of course, as now interpreted, essential that there be complementary legislation if the plant breeders' rights are to be implemented. Without State concurrence it is impossible to extend the protection to innovation in plant varieties that the whole conOver the years a great deal of original work has been done in various areas in Australia in new plant varieties. In a number of the areas there are specific establishments which have evolved new plant species. These species have been propagated. Indeed, the extent of the wheat crop, in spite of the lateness of this season, illustrates the effectiveness of the of, for example, the Narrabri Wheat island Research Institute in the electorate of my colleague the Minister for Health. There are a good many private institutions as well as government sponsored institutions-that one being under the sponsorship of the University of Sydon the ney-operatin g in the field. My concern is to try to extend the opportunitiesforplant breeding in Australia. I am sure that the concept is worthwhile. The Agricultural Council has given some support to extending the scheme. I can only hope that those States which are so strongly opposed to the concept at the moment might see the advantage in the long term for Australia. Indeed, I am told that if we were to establish plant breeders' rights we might well be able to introduce new varieties from of overseas which might further develop the agricultural potential of this country. Given the uncertainties of returns to primary producers, I of think this might be worthwhile. It is an area which I can assure the honourable member has my personal support and the support of the FedGovernment. I can only hope that those States which are not inclined to support the prostultiposal at the moment might see the advantages that wouldflowto their own producers if it were horticultural prodto be adopted.

36,Dr JF CAIRNS,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"I address my question the Prime Minister. Was the Government prepared last week to consider economic growth measure as well as the continued restrictions which it eventually adopted? Does he agree it now appears probable that inflation will not fall at best by more than two or three points in year, unemployment will increase and, above all, real production will fall and potential production by very much more? Does he agree now that National inflation cannot be reduced unless production increases and that it is now time to adopt growth policy to increase effective demand rather than the restrictionist one imposed on the Government by the Reserve Bank and the tion Treasury? to have any Mr MALCOLM FRASER- I think the honourable gentleman ought to know that the Government's policy lines in this area are quite clear.

G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition) (12.35)-There are two ways of sary is the events in this place whose anniverremembered today by millions of our first is to treat this end of thefirstyear and proof the Fraser Government. We look back on performance. That is a political exercise and a highly instructive one; I shaU return to it. The second approach is to review the events of that in the Ught of their constitutional significance, to consider their impUcations for pardemocracy and for the future stability That is the more important and year ended 30 more urgent task for aU members of this Parliament and for all Australians who respect its traditions and value its survival. On 11 November last year my coUeagues and I, for aU our different backgrounds and different had a shared beUef, an instinctive realisation, that what was happening that day represented the supreme challenge to all we had stood and fought for, to everything we held in common, to everthing for which we had devoted the greater part of our energies for 3 years and the greater part of our working lives. Our Party had been out of office for 23 years. As democrats we had accepted that because, though one may argue about the electoral system, we respected the will of the people and we believed that in time the will of the people would give us the chance we sought. And it did. We came to office after 23 years in a time of international economic crisis; after 18 months our term was cut short. We faced another election; we won it. Half way through a second term we were challenged again by the Senate; we fought that challenge; we were dismissed by the Governor General. One does not need to believe in conspiracy theories or to indulge in emotive recriminations to imagine the feelings of Australians who had twice voted Labor into power. So if I speak on Grievance Day it is not because we grieve for the Labor Government or grieve for ourselves, but because we grieve for the hopes of millions of Australians who supported us, millions who believed that the system of government we profess to uphold offered them some hope, some fair chance of participation in the democratic process. We grieve for the damage done to the democratic system and for the lost faith of those who believed in it. This is an emotional response, an essentially human response to 11 November and the joyless conquest that came after-joyles s not least for victors. But our case does not rest on emotion alone. Our objections to what happened are based on the oldest andfirmestprinciples of stitutional law and parliamentary practice. took our stand on 11 November on a simple servatives, issue: Is a government with a majority in a democratically elected House of Representatives to be allowed to govern, or is it not? We took stand on the principle that a Prime Minister derives his authority, his very office, from House of Representatives is entitled to remain office while he commands the confidence of that House. All the words of our opponents cannot alter the fact that on 11 November that ancient principle was turned on its head, and the rules and precedents of centuries of parliamentary absurd. practice were ignored. I believe it is possible now, with emotion recollected in tranquillity, see the salient features of our case even more clearly than we perceived them at the time. Certhe tain things stand out from the welter of words and arguments canvassed since last November, and I shall deal with just two of them. First let me state as fairly as I can what I might call the basic conservative case. The defence of the Senate's action rests on the proposition that the Senate is a popularly elected House and, except in certain limited matters specified in the Constitution, enjoys equal powers with the House of Representatives. Therefore, so the conservative argument goes, the Senate may withhold Supply from a government, and a government without Supply must immediately resign. There are two centralflaws-fatal flaws-in this argument. The first is that the Labor Government on 11 November was not without Supply; the second is that whatever the force of convention in these matters, the view that the Senate is a democratic House comparable with the House of Representatives can never be sustained. It is a parody of democracy to assert that a govenment must be responsible to a chamber elected on a grossly unequal system of representation; a chamber whose numbers can be varied, and have indeed been varied, by State Premiers without regard to the electors' will; whose members at some times have been chosen 3 years or 6 years before the members of this House, and who can bring about an election for the House of Representatives without having to face an election themselves. The other point I make is a simpler and more obvious one. Everyone accepts that this House alone can form a government; that is its primary and exclusive power. It follows that this House alone can remove a government, for the power to the form a government must carry with it the power to preserve and sustain that government in office. No one asserts that the Senate can form a congovernment; its powers in that regard are We inferior to those of the lower House. Yet conwhile denying the right of the Senate to form a government, assert its right to remove one. The power of the lower House to form a our government is now, we are told, conditional on who the concurrence of another chamber which has the no such power. It seems to me that, notwithin standing legal arguments and constitutional precedents, the attempt to claim superior powers for the Senate over this House involves us in a logical contradiction. The Senate's assertion of power was not only undemocratic but manifestly This is a Government that overturned all acto cepted rules, traditions and decencies in a rush for power. And for what results? The record of Government speaks for itself. It is a Government that has broken its election promises as it broke the rules. It is a Government that promised a magic cure for the economic problems that beset the entire western world; far from curing these problems it has made them worse. It promised an end to the recession; the recession is deepening. It promised jobs for all Australians; yet unemployment now stands higher than it has since the Depression, and it is rising, not falling. It promised a return to business confidence; that confidence is lower than ever. It promised to retain Medibank; Medibank has been dismantled. It promised to support wage indexation; it bas undertaken a systematic attack on the real wages of employees. It promised to retain tax deductions for home buyers; it is curtailing those deductions and thereby depriving half a million home owners of tax benefits worth $40m a year. It promised to maintain federal funds for Aborigines; it has cut them. It has attacked the Australian Broadcasting Commission; it has stunted the growth centres; it has damaged our relations with foreign powers. It has embarked on policies which can lead only to the slow and steady suspension of all the best and most creative achievements of the Labor Government. So on this Remembrance Day we lament 2 things: The damage to democracy caused by the Liberals in opposition, and the damage to our nation caused by the Liberals in government. The result of all their dishonesty, their ruthless greed for power, their contempt for rules and propriety, is not just to destroy for ever the bility of the Liberal Party. If that were all it did the remedy could be left safely in the people's hands. What the Liberals have done is to damage the whole fabric of trust between the electors and elected governments. And the effects of the damage will be felt for years to come-in growing cynicism and in a slow corruption of the standards of public life. It will continue until we return to honesty and decency in government; until the rules of our democratic system are restored and upheld; until the Australian people reelect a government that stands once again for progress, humanity and justice, a Labor Government.",25
43,Mr HYDE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,A few minutes ago I requested leave to withdraw a proposal for the discussion of a matter of pubUc importance believing that perhaps the Labor Opposition had grown up and that it would stop deliberately inflaming the public with bogus arguments that have now gone on for 12 months. Mr Morris-You were instructed to withdraw it.,27
44,Mr HYDE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,If the honourable member Ustens he will find that my remarks are instructive. Ever since 11 November 1975 Australia has endured a barrage of inflammatory statements concerning the events of that day which lead to the election of 13 December last year. This dissention has been carefully fostered in the public mind and we have suffered for it at home and abroad. We have suffered a discredited ex-Prime Minister trying to rewrite the history books to his own benefit. He probably really does believe that if he had been left to govern just a little longer he could have corrected the mistakes that he had so far made. It is normal to feel bitter when you are deprived of the spoils of office. It is not uncommon for a losing team to cry 'foul' but I did not expect that the losing team would go on crying 'foul'for 12 months.,27
45,Mr LES JOHNSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,We had a crook umpire.,27
46,Mr HYDE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,The umpire was appointed by the present Leader of the Opposition. I still believe these arguments should be ignored. I withdrew my matter of pubUc importance this morning in the beUef that the Opposition was not going to pursue these bogus arguments any longer.,27
47,Mr LES JOHNSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,You sought to argue earlier.,27
48,Mr HYDE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I became hopeful that the Labor Party was not going to press its arguments today and was not going to inflame public passion further. However the speech from the Leader of credithe Opposition was aimed at just that. These bogus arguments must be answered because, as Dr Goebbels said, untruths that are repeated often enough come to be believed. The Labor Party was sacked not once but 3 times. It was sacked by the Senate, by the Governor General and by the people. All the steps of last year did nothing but return the decision to the people. A lot of false argument has been used to suggest that it was tyranny, that in some way the power to govern had been assumed by the then Opposition. What was asserted was the authority of the people. Itrestswith them, and it was returned to them. Government was chosen by the people as it is expected to be in any democracy. Among all the bogus examples from history about tyranny only one is relevant. It is the suggestion that somehow or other the then Government might govern without Supply, like Charles I during the 11 year tyranny. The Government was prepared to carry on without money and in spite of the people. Even if this had been legal it would have been a repetition of government without the sanction of the people. That is the relevant precedent from history. We very carefully culled the arguments that have been used by Labor Party apologists. We put together some fifteen of them. We believe that the list was exhaustive. We were able to pick off each one of them-takin g the debate onto the Labor Party's grounds and conducting the debate on the grounds that Labor's own apologists had selected. We managed to mark off each one of those arguments as bogus. There is not a single argument that suggests that the rules were in any way brought into question or that the conventions were in any way brought into question last year. Mr Keith Johnson-What about the events of last year?",27
49,Mr HYDE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,In fact the events of last demonstrated the value of the conventions. The events returned the power to the people. At stage was there any usurpation of power by one but the people; the people were given portunity to exercise their authority. Mr Morris-Six-monthl y elections.,28
50,Mr HYDE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Exercis e of the reserve powers of the Governor General was a demonstration that it is necessary at some stage to return a corrupt and incompetent government to its masters. would be more sensible to worry lest the when a Party has a majority in both might not exercise the power that properly belongs to it. Her Majesty's loyal Opposition has as much responsibUity for the of this country as has the Government itself. A corrupt, irresponsible and ineffective government should answer to the people. It has been suggested by interjection that we might have elections every 6 months. The reason we will have elections every 6 months is that there political sanction against that happening, not legal sanction. There is an effective poltiical tion. If an opposition sends a government to people and that government is not thoroughly isions discredited, the people will vote against the party that sent the government to the people and return the government to office. So there is itical sanction against the over-use of this power. It is a power that should be properly used. It should be used with caution admittedly, what happened on 13 December last demonAustralia. strated that it was properly used. The people of Australia wanted a change of government. The powers that were used to bring about that change of government were carefully written into the Constitution and any reader of condenied stitutional debates will find countless references to the power to reject. Dr Klugman - You should read the Constitution.",28
51,Mr HYDE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I can read the Constitution and this provision is very clear in it. It is very clear that those who wrote our Constitution knew exactly what they were doing. There would have been no Federation if that power had not been reserved to the Senate. Deakin very carefully spelt out to the Constitutional Convention how that power would be used. It was clear in his mind that it would be used to dismiss a government; and that is what it should be used for, to dismiss a government that has been thoroughly discredited. This rewriting of history by a man who does not care about the future of either his own Party or this country is not particularly just year to those men whom he sacked when he was leader of the Government. In rewriting the hisno tory books there is an obligation to be fair to anythose men who were sacked. The truth of the the opmatter must come out eventually. I fear that if this matter is not rationally and carefully debated and the Leader of the Opposition is allowed to go on putting a viewpoint unchallenged because we do not wish to raise dissention, the one-sided argument will write Ues into the history books that may be unfair to It Australia and to some people. In spite of what Senate, the Leader of the Opposition says, I am Houses, reminded of the quotation: The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ, Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit Shall lure it back to good government cancel half a Line, Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.",28
52,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"This day, 11 November 1976, is indeed an auspicious occasion because it marks the anninot versary of the sacking of the Whitlam Governis a ment. We on this side of the chamber would a have appreciated a debate as a matter of urgency sancon the question raised by the honourable memthe ber for Moore (Mr Hyde). There are many divin the Australian nation, this day, and they directly relate to the events of 11 November last. Let me make it very clear that from the point of a polview of democracy the Whitlam Government was denied its democratic right to remain in office for 3 years. It is because of this that right but now meetings are being held throughout The citizens for democracy are meeting in their thousands this day in all capital cities. In Sydney this afternoon they will be discussing what happened on 11 November last and how is it that in a democracy a government could be so the opportunity to govern by one man? Let us talk about the corruption which has been alleged and ask where is the evidence of it. Not one piece of evidence has been produced. We have had the likes of Bjelke-Petersen, the Premments ier of Queensland, dabbling in money and sendin ing it overseas to people in an effort to dredge evidence against members of this Parliament. Every rotten action taken against the Government has been motivated by money given to the present Government. Let us look at the law on this subject. The actions of 11 November last were without any legal precedent at all. The fact is that a precedentnied was set when 2 Ministers of the Whitlam Government were told by the Governor General something which was altogether different from what his actions were. Honourable members opcan posite should talk about deceit and apply it what those 2 Ministers were advised. I will nameresponsibilities those Ministers. They are Senator James MCClelland and Paul Keating, both of whom had discussions sourced from the Governorate General's residence which clearly indicated that he proposed to take the course of action which the Labor Government had advised. Recently, the present Chief that as far back as October last year, a month before the Governor General acted, he had formed an opinion that the Whidam Government should go. A man with the status of Chief Justice cerdraft tainly can mould the opinions of others. That admitted in the letter of dismissal by the Governor General to Mr Whitlam which shows that the opinion of the Chief Justice had been intruded into the Governor General's decision. Let us take the matter further. The opinion the Chief Justice was not accepted by the Governor General on that point. The selfable centred advice volunteered by the Chief Justice was that the Governor General should take the advice of Mr Fraser. Of course, the GovernorConstitution. General did not take the advice of Mr Fraser; he dictated to Mr Fraser what he, the GovernorBjelke General, wanted. That was a guarantee of Supnot ply in the Senate on condition that there would be a double dissolution. Thefictitouslegal theory has prevailed that the election on 13 December in this country was fought on the question Supply. It was not. If we could have fought an election on the question of supply, the result would have been different. If we could have saidstitution to the peopleGovernment supporters interjecting.",28
53,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Government suptralians porters laugh, but they know very well that on 11 November last the uncertainty concerning the economic situation was increasing. Government contracts could not be met. There were no mitted guarantees concerning government funds. Paywere due to the States. Pension rights were jeopardy. If honourable members look at the upresults of Gallup polls on 11 November they will see that nobody in Australia applauded the Whitlam action of the Governor General. That is the reason meetings are being held today. The people of Australia are saying: 'We elected a Government for 3 years which was then denied the opportunity to rule'. They were dethat opportunity because certain people were thrust into the Senate. One man, Field, said: 'I am going into the Senate to deny Supply. That is the only reason I am going there'. How democracy survive in this country if we have to a Senate so devoid of an appreciation of its and so subservient to party rule and party discipline that the decisions of Government senators were made not in the Senbut in their party room? The votes of Government senators were not cast according to their consciences but according to their party rules. When this kind of situation prevails under the Constitution we can never have democracy in Justice admitted this country. The word 'reject' is not contained in secton 53 of the Constitution. It was contained in the 1891 of the Constitution but it was deleted. Why is was this done? It was done because section 87 deals with the apportionment of money. The Senate did not have any worry about Supply. Section 87 clearly states that three-quarters of the money is to be returned to the States. Why would the States and the founders of the constiof tution argue about the inclusion of the word 'reject' when the money was already made availto them by section 87? It is ridiculous to suggest now that that interpretation can be intruded by inference. What this country needs is a new This will happen. But the new Constitution will not be formed by politicians like Mr Petersen or Sir Charles Court. They will be responsible for the formation of policy. The people of Australia, irrespective of their political or party affiliations, are meeting to disof cuss how they can make Australia a nation unconstrained by a set of rules which say that one man can disallow any law. Section 58 of the Constates that the Governor General can disallow any law or send a law back with his amendments. Is Australia a colonial power, so subservient that it has no status at all? Austhought that they were a nation. Australia has entered into international treaties, has sent representatives to the United Nations and has taken part in 2 world wars. It has comitself as a nation. Australia now finds itself under a set of rules which make it subservient to one man who is deemed to be the appointee of the monarch. This brings the monarchy into repute and affects the whole concept of democtime. racy in Australia. That is why there is concern in Australia today. If honourable members opposite attend ings in their electorates-and there many of them-the y will find that they are held on the basis not of what happened in the past but of what Australians thought they had. AusThe traUans thought they had a nation and that they could speak with one voice. They thought they had elected a Parliament which meant somecial thing. The principle of democracy meant that House of the people could rule and govern. represents Australia desperately needs a new Constitution made not by the professionals in State parliaunder ments or the Federal Parliament but by the people- a Constitution in which they are inState volved. It is about time we encouraged people to meet, to discuss the Constitution and to work their set of rules on the basis of equality of tunity and equaUty of voting.

The proposed increase in funds a rise of approximately 9 per cent over and above the level of funds already provided these 2 Acts for this year. The Bill also provides for a concomitant increase in quotas for expenditure from State resources on roads. Honourable members will recall that the out Treasurer (Mr Lynch), in his statement to the opporHouse on 20 May outlining the various budgetary measures being taken to control government a expenditure and reduce inflation, announced the decision to appropriate an additional $35.8m for road works. The National Roads and Roads Grants Acts will now provide for a total alloto the States of $433.5m after for the additional funds contained in with this debate, this Grants Bill. The 1974 National Roads and Roads Acts, introduced by the previous Government, provided a level of funds which was $225m below that recommended by the Bureau of Roads in its 1973 report. As a result provision for certain road categories such as urban arterials, rural arterials and rural local roads on which local government is very dependent for its road needs was reduced during the 3-year period of the Legislation. Since coming to office the Government has been particularly conscious of the fact that local in many instances has suffered badly for road funds against State We have therefore endeavoured to ensure that the needs of local in particular are looked after. This was emphasised by the Commonwealth at the February Premiers Conference. In advising proposed additional funds and seeking their views on the proposed allocation to I have pointed to the decline in funds to local government and stressed the the urgent road requirements in rural areas. As honourable members will be aware the 1974 Road Grants Act contained for the first time assistance for urban local roads. During the period of the Act allocations for these roads were increased to the benefit of urban local authoriment ties. This was in marked contrast with rural local authorities. Following consultations with the States the proposed allocations set out in the were adopted. These allocations go a considermovement, able way towards improving the which rural local government and the rural road system were facing. This has been achieved withdecision out any disruption of the overall State road Justification programs. As I have indicated it will be necessary for States also to increase their own expenditure road works by about 9 per cent in order to qualmust ify for the additional Commonwealth assistance. As you will appreciate both the Commonbeing wealth and State governments, together with approval. local government, have joint responsibilities to finance the road program and it is only appropri-over ate that the States increase their level of effort well. The Bill is divided into 3 parts. Part I sets the usual preliminary information. Part II- that clauses 3 to 6-relate s to the National Roads Act. Part III-Clause s 7 to 12-relates to the Roads Grants Act. The total increase in funds for each State is as follows: New South Wales-$ 11.3m Victoria-$7.5 m Queensland-$7.5 m South Australia-$3.2m Western Australia-$4.6 m Tasmania- $ 1.7m. The allocations to the different road categories in each State are set out in the detailed schedules included in the Bill. The relevant clauses for detailed category allocations are clause 6 for National Roads and clause 12 for the Roads however, Grants Act. The Bill provides for the additional amounts set out in the schedules to be added the existing 1976-77 appropriations. I would remind honourable members that the allocations to categories were made only after consultations with the States. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Morris) adjourned. NA Bill presented by Mr Howard, and read a first time.",30
58,Mr HOWARD,PRICES JUSTIFICATION AMENDMENT," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is designed to give effect to the Government 's decision, which I announced in my stateon 16 September, to alter the operations of the Prices Justification Tribunal. In that statement. I referred to the extensive consultations Bill which had taken place with the trade union business organisations and other secdifficulties tions of the community. The changes contained in this Bill reflect the of the Government to retain the Prices Tribunal but in a substantially modified form. The cumulative purpose of the the changes is to bring about a very significant on reduction in the number of companies which notify the Tribunal of their price increases, with a view to the Tribunal's principal function that of price surveillance rather than price Experience with the operations of the Tribunal the last 3 years clearly shows that the bulk as of the very large number of price notifications have been approved on the basis originally out notified to the Tribunal. While this has shown there is a high level of price responsibility on the part of Australian business, the need for companies to service the requirements of the Tribunal has been at a very significant cost to business generally. This Bill will significantly reduce these costs without affecting the capacity of the Tribunal to act in appropriate cases. In other words, the Tribunal will have a greater capacity to use its resources to investigate those areas where there is evidence of price abuse. Thus, while the notification procedures and other key features of the legislation are retained, the obligation to notify price increases will apply only to companies in the over $30m turnover class and the to those subsidiaries of prescribed companies which have annual turnovers above $5m. It will, remain within the discretion of the Tribunal, or as required by the Government, to to inquire into and report on prices charged by companies irrespective of their turnover. I estimate that the combined effect of these 2 changes alone will relieve about half of the companies presently notifying their prices to the Tribunal from the requirement to do so. The Tribunal has already taken action to exempt companies with annual turnovers between $20m and BILL 1976 $30m, pending these amendments. The further exclusion of subsidiary companies with a turnover of less thanT>5m annually will remove a large group offirmswhich have little, if any, conSecond Reading trol over the markets in which they operate and are caught up in the notification provisions solely by virtue of their relationship to a holding company. The Bill contains a positive requirement the Tribunal in dealing with notifications due regard to the need fbr companies levels of profitability sufficient to maintain adequate levels of investment and employment. As Commissioners foreshadowed in my statement of 16 September Commission indicates the existing exemption provisions of the Act will able advantage in having be substantially broadened. Whilst the Tribunal the Prices Justification Tribunal. will retain a discretion regarding the granting of bers will be appointed for either exemptions it will in terms of the amendments periods or for specific inquiries and will now before the House be required to address mind to certain specific matters in the process of determining whether or not an exemption should enced be granted to a company normally required to ing expertise notify price increases. The specific criteria to be inserted into the Act are not meant to be exhaustive of the matters be considered by the Tribunal in deciding exemptions but to indicate the view of the Government that some legislative indication required of the type of matters which should taken into account by the Tribunal with to exemptions. Therefore the Bill provides exercising its discretion regarding exemptions the Tribunal should at least consider the followincrease ing: Firstly, whether or not the company panies concerned are in a position substantially to control a market for goods and services; secondly, the reasonableness of the pricing haviour of a company or companies over period of time. In respect of the first of these elements in effect copies the monopoly provision of the trade practices legislation. This will promote a greater consistency of approach between liberations of the Tribunal and the Trade tices Commission regarding the nature and ture of markets. In addition, the amendments specifically allow exemptions to be granted respect of the whole or any part of the range goods and/or services produced or provided company. The Government intends that the effect new exemption procedures will be to sigdifficulties nificantly increase the ability of companies mally required to notify price increases to obtain exemptions. The Government expects that most cases exemptions will reporting conditions. Exemptions will only be revoked if the Tribunal is satisfied that the ciro "" . cumstances by reason of which the exemption was granted no longer exist, or that there been a material change in those circumstances. Revocation of an exemption will be subject the company receiving not less than 14 notice. The thrust of these changes is to that exemptions are of real benefit to companies that in that they do not have associated with them the pay onerous reporting conditions attaching to the to achieve notification procedures. Experience with the appointment of Associate to the Industries Assistance that there will be considerassociate members of Associate memextended allow for its the appointment of persons-includin g experiment representatives of the trade union moveas well as experienced businessmen-hav in a particular area to serve on the Tribunal as occasion arises. to I turn now to a number of other provisions that upon are of lesser policy significance. Some of these will assist in the better functioning of the Triis bunal. Other changes incorporate machinery and be formal amendments to the Act. The Act provides respect that where a company does not implement an that in approved price increase within 30 days, it must re-notify the Tribunal should it wish to apply the at a later time. This time limitation has or comthe effect of forcing up prices unnecessarily quickly and imposing re-notification costs on and, companies where price increases cannot be bepassed on within 30 days. The Bill extends this a time limit to 90 days. Provision is made for the Tribunal to report each half year on the most significant increases in prices in each industry, and the Bill the principal reasons for these increases. It has been decided that the Act should prothe devide for only one Deputy Chairman. This will Pracbring it into line with the Trade Practices Act strucwhich has provision for one Deputy Chairman and the Industries Assistance Commission Act in which provides for a Commissioner to be of appointed the Executive Commissioner to assist by athe Chairman in the performance of his duties and the exercise of his powers. Changes have also been made to the quorum provisions for of the meetings of the Tribunal to accommodate which have arisen in the past. Pronorvision is also included for the Chairman to be an ex officio member of all divisions of the Tribunal, in and for simplification of certain inquiry not be subject to procedures. The Government's view is that this Bill will alter the function of the Tribunal from that of a has price approval body to one of price surveillance. In this form it will more effectively complement to the activities of the Trade Practices Commission days and the Industries Assistance Commission. The ensure Government will be closely monitoring the effects of the Tribunal's operations during the next 9 to 12 months to ensure that the Government's objectives are being met. The changes the Government is making to the Tribunal will play a part in ensuring that there are not unreasonable administrative restraints placed upon economic recovery. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Morris) adjourned. CUSTOMS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) Bill presented by Mr Howard, and read a first time.",31
59,Mr HOWARD,PRICES JUSTIFICATION AMENDMENT," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Customs Act 1901 to give effect to revised rules of origin, made under the Agreement on Trade and Commercial Relations between the Government of Australia and the Government of Papua New Guinea, and to omit the word 'sativa' from the definition of cannibas plant in the Act. Honourable members will recall, from my statement to the House, after the signing of the Agreement on Trade and Commercial Relations, that the agreement establishes a free trade area which is free of duties and other restrictive commerce for trade in goods originating in a member State. In general the revised rules of origin provide for a one-half area content. However where the one-half rule is not met and it is considered that preferential treatment should be given, the Minister may determine that another portion that is less than one-half is appropriate. The new rules introduce a desirable flexibility by allowing this simple basic rule, the one-half to operate without disadvantaging goods which do not meet the conditions of the rule but in respect of which it might be desirable to accord preferential treatment. .1 now turn to the amendment of the definition of 'cannabis plant'. The Customs Act defines cannabis plant as a plant of the genus 'cannabis sativa'. When this definition was inserted into the Customs Act in 1971 it was intended to cover all known forms of cannabis. Since that time, overseas research on cannabis has led to a theory that the plant is polytypic rather than monotypic, that is to say there are species other than sativa. As this argument has been developed in Australia and used in prosecutions, the courts have experienced some difficulty in deciding whether or not the material in question is covered by the existing definition. The amended definition will overcome these difficulties by including only the main genus description, 'cannabis '. I commend the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Morris) adjourned. STATES GRANTS (UNIVERSITIES ASSISTANCE) BILL 1976 Second Reading Debate resumed from 4 November, on motion 1976 by Mr Viner: That the Bill be now read a second dme.",33
60,Mr HOWARD,PRICES JUSTIFICATION AMENDMENT," Mr Deputy Second Reading Speaker, may I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation. Before the debate is resumed on this Bill I would like to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the BUls listed under orders of the day Nos 2 to 9, Government business, as they are associated measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the BUls at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of the 8 Bills to be discussed in this debate.",33
61,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRICES JUSTIFICATION AMENDMENT,Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate regulations of covering the 8 measures?,33
62,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PRICES JUSTIFICATION AMENDMENT,Yes .,33
63,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRICES JUSTIFICATION AMENDMENT,I wiU allow that course to be followed.,33
64,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PRICES JUSTIFICATION AMENDMENT,"The Opposition readily appreciates the need to have a cognate debate. Nevertheless, I say at the outset that we propose to move rule, amendments which are in the process of being circulated. I shall talk to them later. The significant aspect of the whole of the Government's thrust in the Budget in relation to education was that there was growth in real terms and that this would satisfy the needs concept of education in Australia. I put to the Parliament that an analysis ofthefigures-that is what it is-doe s not support that contention. For example, if, in dealing with universities, I look at capitalfigures,Ifindthat in the triennium 1973-75 the capital needs were of the nature of $294m. Now we find that in the forthcoming triennium, 1977-79, that actual allocation is reduced to $91.8m. In fact, as I understand the situation, if we look at the history of this matter we find that the triennial average prior to 1977 was of the magnitude of $ 192m. We wdl drop in the next triennium, on an average basis, with a cost equalisation of about $75.2m. In other the policy words, there will be less than 40 per cent of the in former base. We see that the Universities Comrelates mission is critical of this fact. It says that, because of these hmitations, it cannot really meet the avoided needs. The most significant factor it draws attenflexibility tion to in this respect is that there will be growth in enrolments of 1.8 per cent. If there is 1.8 per cent growth in enrolments, how can we expect a growth in real terms of 2 per cent when servient no allowance has been made for this enrolment course, affects factor. I draw the attention of the House to the report of the Universities Commission which clearly makes this point. It states: * One consequence of holding intakes constant will be that the smaller, newer universities will have to operate at levels of enrolments which would be a good deal lower than those for which they were planned and which will be relatively uneconomic and prevent a desirable diversification universities' academic work. Wollongong, Deakin University, James Cook University North Queensland, Griffith University and Murdoch University. Again, in the report we find it is stated quite effectively that in 1979 thefinancialresource location for a university student will be 3 per cent less than what it was in 1975.1 that the Government is so confident that the alleged growth in financial support in real terms meets the Commission's needs? The big, basic problem in education has been that the Governthat, ment, for the firsttime,has decided to set out money guidelines. It has allocated the money. We can see in this action the influence of the partment of the Treasury, which is monetary. The various Commissions have had to work in within that allocation. They have been able say in rather strong words that the allocations will not meet the needs or the growth. Accordthe ingly, there will be a reduction in real terms. we look at the factors as explained that in the normal triennium of 1973-75, expresIn sed in December 1974 prices, basically $ 1500m and was available for universities. In the next triennoted nium, expressed in December 1975 prices, only increase $ 1700m will be available. Allowing for the norcent' mal inflationary costs that means a retardation, expenditure not an acceleration. It means no growth. It means vide a reduction. This supports what the Commissions 1978 have said. At the end of the decade the resource in allocation for a student will be less than what it nitude was at the commencement. In other-words, one for recurrent must urge the Government to look at this factor. Moreover, The Commission in dealing with this point poses states in its report: The Australian universities have been passing through period of rapid growth . . . Unless there is a change in expressed in the guidelines, all universities will be a no-growth position before the end of the present decade. Lack of growth brings with it two kinds of problems; the first to increases in costs (other than those resulting from increases in salary scales and in prices) which cannot be and the second to the difficulty of maintaining in the face of virtually static budgets. a So, on that premise, we urge the Government to a look again at the monetary allocation in relation to the needs of universities and not to be so subto Treasury's dominance which, of every department in Australia. In relation to colleges of advanced education, the Commission on Advanced Education expresses its concern. The guidelines clearly indicated to it that it needed to provide for an intake increase of 10 per cent. Yet, if we look at its growth in funds, we find that it is only 5 per cent. The Commission makes this point. It says: 'We of the cannot possibly cope.' If they calculated in reThis applies to the University of of alistic terms capital expenditure needs for the triennium 1976-78 was $583. Yet wefindthat in the 1977-79 triennium the colleges are apportioned only $212m. This is a drop of over 60 alper cent. That cannot be supported on the basis of the needs of these institutions. It will mean a ask: How can it be drop in standards. From the recurrent expenditure point of view, the Commission on Advanced Education said in the triennium 1976-78, it needed $ 1,087m. Yet in the forthcoming triennium it will get less, namely, $976m. We cannot support Dea Government attitude which is that in respect of the guideline factors there has to be an increase enrolment. Obviously, the implication is that to standards should be maintained. But then the Government reduces funds very substantially in capital field and does not even maintain the If current expenditure. The Commission in its to me, we find report makes the point: considering the allocation of funds between recurrent capital expenditure in 1978 and 1979 the Commission the advice that colleges of advanced education should their intake . . . 'by about 10 per . . . A summary of the allocations of expenditure is shown below, and the minimum increase in recurrent of 2 per cent per annum on this base would proan additional amount of recurrent money available in ofless than $7m. Appendix 3 indicates a rate of growth enrolments between 1977 and 1978 of about 4 per cent and the Commission considers that an increase of that magcould not be funded within the additional allocation expenditure without a reduction of standards. colleges are required to meet-additional expenditures which are not considered as 'cost increases' for the purof the adjustment of grants. The most significant of these are the annual incremental payments made to members of academic and non-academic staff and it has been a - estimated that these costs alone can lead to increases of about 2 per cent per annum in a college's recurrent budget. Out of those words and expressions of the Commission we see an indictment of the Government's policy in relation to guidelines which I again emphasise would reflect Treasury motivation. In dealing with schools we come to the factor of a 2 per cent growth again. This is what Treasurer (Mr Lynch) says. This is fine. But conveniently overlooks the fact that there will be a considerable growth in enrolments of about 1.1 per cent which affects the very factor which he on. mentioned. There is a serious problem in relation to those allocations. If we look at them in real terms as at December 1974 prices, for the 1976-78 triennium we find that an amount $2,070m was spent. We can predict that at December 1975 prices, for the next triennium 1977-79, the amount will drop to $ 1,554m. is an additional burden on which the States must pick up the slack. They have to face the problem of maintaining schools on the basis that they felt they had been encouraged to initiate new grams. If honourable members talk to State Minable isters for education they will find that the pretheir vious activities of the Schools Commission in education excited the States to initiate new procourse grams. This the States have done. The States find that they are left holding the baby. No recurrent expenditure allocation has been made for new programs initiated. This will affect teacher in-take and they will have to bear the cost of that. As honourable members know, financial resources are fairly limited. Under Implications of the Guidelines in the report it is stated by the Commission: While it is clear from the early part of the guidelines and from the finance provided that it is not expected that it will be possible to do more than maintain existing standards in government and non-government schools during the 1977-79 triennium, other parts of the guidelines direct the Commission's attention to needs which could only be met if there were considerable additional finance. The 2 per cent real growth in funds for 1977 must be seen in relation to the fact that enrolments . . . areestimatedtogrowbyl.il per cent. It is important to realise that the guidelines cannot be met in full; the objectives of maintaining existing standards while also undertaking other initiatives, though modest and directed towards immediate needs, are too ambitious within the funds allocated. We would ask the Government to look at this situation. The Commission is suggesting that it really needs more resources if it is to maintain the situation at the present time. Again, there are serious problems in the capital needs area. The Commission feels that it has received about $50m short of what could be spent. A series of questions has been asked in this House and elsewhere relating to the massive unemployment, particularly in the building industry, and asking whether it would not be good value to encourage this type of capital expenditure. It would not be inflationary; it is necessary. It would mean that substantial renovation or commencement of building of schools could have been done with the labour and materials that are now lying idle. Taxpayers' funds which are being eaten up in the unemployment benefits could be put to use for it the needs of children. Let me place on record that if a child is not provided for in its formative years it is too late to try to correct the defect later Every honourable member here knows that the schools in his electorate have substantial of needs. In my own electorate both government and non-government schools have substantial problems in the capital sector. They need large This amounts of money to give them a reasonable standard. Some schools have a higher standard because of parental support. That was indicated clearly in the earlier report of the Karmel Compromission, which showed that people who were to give additional financial support out of own pockets could guarantee that their children would, in the main, complete the secondary and be enabled to enter the tertiary field. now In government schools, and particularly in the Catholic section of the non-government schools, there is not the same retention rate, not the same opportunity. Their needs are also greater from the point of view of both capital and recurrent expenditure. This report also makes the point: While the position in government schools with respect to the targets for recurrent resources is . . . comparatively brighter than for non-government schools, the seriousness of the problem of providing capital facilities of adequate standard for both government and non-government schools cannot be over-stated. The needs of several State systems are so pressing, for example, that they are enlarging their capital programs for 1975-76 on the principle of'build now, pay later'. All the analyses which the Commission has undertaken-the costing of urgent projects which it would be feasible to undertake within a triennium, the calculation of new place requirements as the result of population mobility and enrolment increases, an assessment of deficiencies of specialist and ancillary buildings in relation to each State's schedule of facilities for each school, an estimation of the cost of bringing existing buildings up to standard-al l these have resulted in target programs the size of which is beyond contemplation within a single triennium. The Commission also draws attention to the fact that stationary funds in nongovernment schools not onlyretardrefurbishing but also effectively place limits on future enrolments. That is the position as we see it in respect of the Schools Commission. The other aspect is the technical education field, a relatively new field. As one can imagine, the Technical and Further Education Commission has great difficulties indeed because the Commission regards itself as being the Cinderella of the education group. It was a late starter; it has to cater for large numbers of students, and enrolments show that there has been a quite massive increase in enrolcopper ments. At page xxxviii of the report of the Techelectronics nical and Further Educauon Commission it is inbuilding dicated that under the guidelines technical cation received only $ 111 m in capital grants. Commission needs $150m and it could spend $190m. There is a shortfall of 35 per cent, $38m, from the point of view of capital, and would have allowed for approximately ditional places. If one considers it in relation the basic needs to enable the Commission to that TAFE maintain capital expenditure standards in 1979 well equal to 1974 levels, it needs $78m. It received ance some 75 per cent less than it needs. The problem further is that the Commission's recurrent expenditure denied allocation has not grown as fast as it should. It ACOTAFE has been given $38m for 1977 and its allocation and economicreports for 1978 is $39m. The Commission itself says that it needs $49m. In other words, there is a $10m deficiency for 1978, and it has been tive allocated $40m for 1979 when it The real problem in this field is that there is going to be a deterioration. The Commission guaranteed makes the point: An adequate skilled labour force is not available and without rapid development of the TAFE system Australia will not be equipped to meet its future requirements for skilled manpower. The problem is one of national importance and if it is to be corrected will require educadonal expenditure in favour of TAFE. It will require Commonwealth supplementation of State effort addiuonal to that envisaged under the guidelines. If one looks at the factors involved in the allocation of tertiary funds, one finds that for every $4 allocated the technical field gets $1, or one-quarter. Nevertheless, it has to cater for 40 per cent of the tertiary load and it has been allocated less than that in funds. In other words, limited as the funds are, the technical education field is still the Cinderella in the fight for a share of the funds. If it has to cater for 40 per cent of the tertiary education group, why is it that it is given only one-quarter of the amount allocated for tertiary education? The Commission was anxious that the capital provided should give them and institutions another 34 000 additional enrolment places. the Government When considering the technology position, the structural change, the need to acquire skills this country, one has to accept that the technical field should have a top priority in the educational needs of Australia. The Opposition proposes move this amendment because it believes that insufficient funds have been directed to this of education. It is impossible to guarantee structural change or to have a skilled work force if sufficient funds are not allocated at this time. The State governments cannot possibly predict what is going to happen to them if the structural change is as massive as one could predict. If the mines close, if the textile mills close, if the industry is phased out and the shipindustry is completely eroded, there will edube a massive need to retrain the work force and The no plans have been made for that. The one area which could carry out that retraining function, or given the encouragement and incentive, is the that technical education field. The Commission 6000 admakes this point: to . . . the minimum objective must surely be to ensure in 1979 will be, relative to enrolments, at least as off for space and equipment as it was in 1974. Acceptof such a limited objective will cause profound disappointment among all those direcdy involved in technical and education, a sector which for many years has been the sorts of resources made available to other sectors of education and which has seen the hopesflowingfrom the deferred if not dispelled by the political events referred to . . . The TAFE Commission would regard this limited objecas the absolute minimum consistent with the maintenance of TAFE as a viable contributor to the total spectrum of needs $55m. post-school education. The amount available if the minimum growth of 5 per cent for 1978 and 1979 under the guidelines formula becomes the actual program for 1977-79 would be $230m. The Commission must point out that a triennial program of this amount would fail to achieve even the minimum objective. It would not keep pace with the needs generated by increased enrolments, let alone begin to redress current deficiencies. a change in the distribution of So we have this problem again. Enrolments in 1973 were 508 000. In 1979 they are expected to be 901 000. Next year they are expected to be 769 000. We can see the rapid growth in this area which, commendable as it is, is going to be quite disastrous unless sufficient funds are given for that purpose. Accordingly we propose to move the amendment that I have envisaged. I would like to refer to a statement made by the Minister for Education (Senator Carriek) on 4 November. My attention has been drawn to something that the Minister said as recorded on page 2 of the statement. He said: I will be asking the Commissions to convey to authorities further details of the procedures agreed to by That seems to indicate that there is some doubt in on the part of the Commissions and the Government as to what the position is. The Minister referred to 'further details of the procedures to agreed to by the Government'. An air of uncertainty has been created with regard to financing. area The Treasurer (Mr Lynch) has already said that a there would be less than automatic cost supplementation. That means that there is not going to be full supplementation of cost. One can read into these words that there will be a retardation of what would be normal escalation. If as the Commissions say, these institutions have committed themselves for a number of years to programs that are very worthwhile, particularly, for example, in the migrant education field and programs of that nature, and they are not able to get their recurrent expenditure, they will have to meet this expenditure from their own resources, or, alternatively, reduce some of the existing standards that they have been able to build up. So it is important that we get a clear understanding that there will not be any reduction. There ought not be vague statements such as ' I will be asking the Commissions to convey to authorities and institutions further details of the procedures agreed to by the Government' without their being known at this stage. Again we will be moving amendments to clause 7 of the schools legislation. The Federal Government ought clearly to indicate the position where there is any suggestion that there ought to be a re-allocation of resources, either recurrent or capital. It is just not good enough for a matter in which a State Minister finds it necessary to ask a Commonwealth Minister for approval to be left between those 2 Ministers. In my opinion such action should only be taken on the advice and with the concurrence of the Schools Commission. We think it is important that the Schools Commission's authority in this area be maintained and not down-graded. It is quite wrong, no matter how well-meaning it might be, for Ministers to make those decisions themselves when we have already established Commissions on the clear basis that there would be impartiality, that decisions would be non-political and most importantly that the whole accent would be on a needs basis. We must emphasise that we will be moving amendments to suggest that the Government might insert the appropriate words. The amendments in this respect have also been circulated. I wish again to refer to the statement made by the Minister for Education on 4 November. He said: The Government welcomes moves by school communities and State Governments to encourage a more active role for parents, teachers and local communities in school ment and decision-making. We also welcome these moves. In fact, the Schools Commission I think suggested that 5 per cent of recurrent funds be made available for this very purpose. We raised this matter when it was last debated. But we find that there is no specific allocation for this matter. Therefore, while we he said: welcome these moves, it was important that some amount of money should have been provided on this basis. This matter have been left on the basis that the Government says that it welcomes it when, quite frankly, no State can see where a specific amount has been given for this purpose. The States would like to know what the Minister's words really mean. They would like this matter spelt out. Is it to be 5 per cent? Why was not sufficient money made available to guarantee what has to be done. As I said earlier, there is a need for a full guarantee as to automatic cost supplementation. If this is not given everyone will lose confidence as to how much they can spend next year. Before I conclude I want to come back to a specific matter. As shown on page 12 of his statement the Minister for Education said: The Government has also decided to implement a scheme of advance offers of building grants to non-government schools to enable projects to be commenced sooner than would otherwise be the case. That is an excellent decision. We have no objection to that. But why should not the same facility be given to the State governments? Why should not the State governments be encouraged also to make advance progress in respect of building in the knowledge that they will be reimbursed? Why just leave it in the other sector? It is important when we deal with these matters, particularly from the non-government point of view, we have a clear understanding that any capital expenditure in that area is to be based on the concept of need and not have this program eaten up by those who are more articulate, better managed, better able to extend their resources irrespective of need and then say that the Government said that it was all right for them to do so. We want the yardstick clearly defined in this area. Welcome as it is, both in the government and non-government area, we believe assistance should be given on a needs basis. It is quite ridiculous to find that a well endowed school, meritorious though it is from its point of view, saying: 'We are going ahead with our capital program because the Government willfinanceus next year', and find that a needy school did not do anything of this kind and did not have anybody to rationalise the situation. What about the manageneeds of other youngsters? What about their chance to get an equal opportunity? We would like to see the Government's intentions in this respect spelt out in relation to this particular segment of the report. The final matter to which I wish to refer relates to page 17 of the Minister's statement at which While the Government has acceptedshould not just I disagree with himmost of the Commission's financial recommendations it is giving further consideration to the way in which the programs are to be managed. Detailed administrative arrangements will be announced shortly in guidelines being developed in collaboration with the States. Again, the Commissions are not mentioned. Surely one would expect if the Government is to talk with the States about management guidelines and future policies, the advice of the Commissions would be sought. Therefore, whilst that statement may be defective in failing to mention the Schools Commission, we would like an assurance that the advice of the Schools Commission will be taken as to what should be done. I mentioned at the outset the great problem the limitation of funds allocated by a Treasury concept as against a needs concept in education. One cannot just say on a cost benefit analysis what the needs of education are. One just cannot guarantee what one is going to get out of a stream of life when it comes to the educational area. One cannot sit down as does an accountant and say what one is going to get and expect come up with an exact result. One has to look all the problems of humanity. There are those who are talented and those who are less talented but could be in the same class. One has all the problems of identifying these things. School gramming should not be put on the basis that at the end of the secondary schooling you have someone who is employable and full of skill. These persons might need a lot more education after that. The present education survey that is proceedthe ing is upsetting State governments because feel it may well affect the future of education is suggested that there is to be vocational training in secondary schools. This would mean that theywhich would have to recast their whole programming. This could affect all the education programs. ennial funding for them is a fallacy because while they would like to start many programs, they feel they cannot do so. They feel that annual funding represents a concept that ought to eradicated. The States should be guaranteed now what building they can construct next year. It is futile for them to try to plan new buildings now and not have the money to build them. exact case exists at Mt Druitt where the authorireceived ties would love to build a technical college dare not enter thatfieldbecause they do not have sufficient resources.  rise to support the 8 Bills that the Government has introduced and to oppose the that have been moved on behalf of the Opposition. I am surprised that the honourable member for Kmgsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) speaks this way in the debate this afternoon, because as a Minister in the previous Government he was part of the team which considered the triennial report of the education commissions and reduced the funds for 1976 by $ 105m compared with 1975. I say by way of example that the Schools Commission in its report sought approximately $720m for 1975 but received $498m m 1975 under a Labor Government- a reduction of$222m. of Let me bring the debate back to reality. When we arrived in Government on 14 December 1975 education was another area where a disaster had occurred. There were major problems in the education area. The Labor mess of broken promises and deceit which had occurred with the cutting out of triennial funding and the reduction of moneys which I have just mentioned meant that to what we had to dofirstlywas to reintroduce the at triennial funding program. The new form of triennial funding program will be on arollingbasis. As each year is completed plans for the remaining years of the triennium will be reviewed and proupdated and initial proposals made for a new third year. This will mclude a provision for long term reviews. Each of the commissions was asked to submit detailed programs after the Minister for Education (Senator Carriek) made public on 20 May 1976 that what was needed was a complete review of the requirements of each of commissions. There needed to be detailed they recommendations for thefirstyear and a plan if it proposed for the second and third years. These were forthcoming. From that the guidelines the Minister laid down provided a total expenditure of the programs administered by the Trieducation commissions of some $ 1,537m in the 1977 calendar year. Let me give the amount allocated for each commission in 1977 as compared with 1976. The amount allocated for the be Universities Commission in 1976 was $542m. This will increase to $555m in 1977. The Commission on Advanced Education received $385m in 1976 and will receive $494m in 1977. The An Technical and Further Education Commission $65m in 1976 and will receive $70m in but 1977. The Schools Commission in 1976 received $498m and in 1977 will receive $508m. The total in 1976 was $ 1,490m. In 1977 it will be $ 1,537m. This represents an increase of $47m or 3.2 per cent in real terms in 1977. The cash flow in 1976-77 will be $ 1,569m which represents an amendments increase of 4.2 per cent. I believe our Government has demonstrated a clear degree of concern for the people and future of Australia. The chUdren are the most important part of our heritage. It is part of Government's thoughts that it ensures the future of those chUdren and ensures that those chUdren will be looked after and educated in a way will solve the problems that would have occurred under the previous administration. I turn now the guideUnes which were laid down within financial limits referred to. The Government asked the Schools Commission to base its mendations on the maintenance of existing standards in government and non-government this Government. schools. In drawing up the recommendations the 1977 expenditure provision was made for continuation of special purpose programs such those for handicapped chUdren, migrants and disadvantaged schools. This is allied with further substantial increase of SO per cent in allocation of moneys to handicapped children which was brought down with the Budget the real family allowance increase which was effective from the middle of June. The assistance which is now rendered directly in money terms each individual family in this country is substantial. After the Universities Commission, the Commission on Advanced Education, the $9.9m. Technical and Further Education Commission and the Schools Commission were asked report they went to work and came up with a substantive program for spending in the 1976-77 financial year. The programs in 1977 mean aneducation increase of some $47m in real terms over 1976. diture The commissions' reports in more specific detail the recommendations show that along with the money allocated for Further thisfinancialyear the commission will convey to $73m the authorities and institutions further detaUs procedures agreed to by this Government. include Briefly, these include the adjustments of cost increases which will be made each quarter following certification from each commission of the supplementation required to maintain real levels of expenditure approved for the 1977 gram. Account will be taken of offsetting savings including any from favourable buUding tenders. Movements in costs will be measured against indexation of wages and salary determinations and other recurrent budding costs. Through this process the Minister will be able to approve grams to supplement grants to meet unfavourimprovement able cost increases. It effectively means that will be a real increase of some 2 per cent over second and third years. The education facilities of universities and coUeges of advanced eduin cation can look forward to the future with amount of confidence. The Government has also accepted the finanthe cial recommendations of the Universities Commission for 1977. The total program amounts to the $561.6m. In Queensland we have 3 magnificent universities-the Queensland University, the Griffith University, which is the new university, which and the James Cook University. The total amount of moneys aUocated this year will be to to Queensland University $48.732m, to the James the Cook University $9.398m and to the Griffith University $6.45 lm. The total amount of money recomaUocated to Queensland universities is now $64.581m. This shows the genuine concern of for CoUeges of advanced education are also an the area of great importance to this Government. as The advanced educationfieldis ever increasing because of the type of information which is now a current and which needs to be disseminated to the the people of Australia through the coUeges of advanced education. The allocations in real and terms by the Commission on Advanced Education covers some $404m at the 1975 cost levels. In that area, in Queensland again, there wiU be a to total expenditure of $51.9m. The expenditure on quite the recurrent program will be $42m and the expenditure on the capital program will be Again, these sums represent a substantial increase in the amount allocated for expenditure to in an extremely important area. I turn to deal with the technical and further field.The Government's 1977 expenprogram on this area-formulate d upon of the Technical and Education Commission-wU l amount to at December 1975 cost levels. This amount is composed of $3 8.4m for recurrent expenditure of and $34.6m for capital expenditure. These funds an amount of $3m to be transferred from agreed the Commission on Advanced Education to cover advanced education courses in technical and further education institutions. A significant proportion of the recurrent funds for 1977 will go protowards the continuation of specific projects commenced in earUer periods with Commonwealth assistance and to the establishment of new programs designed to improve the quaUty of teaching and other resources in this area. These special purpose programs include staff developproment schemes-includin g non-teaching staffof information systems and a theregroup of other programs from which States are theable to choose according to their priorities. The States must accept their degree of responsibUity this area. To that end, the total amount of a vast money which is being allocated-agai n in Queensland-wU l mean that the total program of major projects in our capital areas will amount to $4.8m and for minor work and equipment, some $200,000. Expenditure in the total capital area will amount to almost $Sm. Expenditure on recurrent general purpose grants will amount to $2.2m. Together with special purpose grants, for staff development and data collection and processing, particular purpose grants, adult education grants and total recurrent grants, the total contribution will amount to some $8.91 m. The schools area is one sector to which the Government has again given a major priority. The 1977 expenditure program for schools amounts to some $508m. Of this amount, $310.3m is for government schools, $ 173.4m for non-government schools and $24.2m is to be shared jointly between the government and nongovernment sectors. This is one area in which I believe it is extremely important that we have a continuation of communication between parents, teachers and local communities. It is a great delight for me to sit down with my children, listen to what they are learning about and to read them the stories which are coming from the education system. We are now providing a great deal of money for this system and looking to the future to produce young Australians who will be the fathers of our community in a very short period. The Government has also accepted the financial recommendations of the Schools Commission for government schools in broad terms but has modified the recommended distribution between the States of capital grants. This applies particularly to Queensland. This modification was made after consideration of the basis of the recommendation and the contribution and relating this to the existing pattern of grants in 1976. The Government considered that in the light of 1976 allocations, the recommended total of general recurrent and capital grants in Queensland would make it too difficult for that State to implement its planned programs for the whole of the 1977 year. The modified distribution of grants decided upon by this Government results in a $ 1.4m addition to Queensland's allocation for general capital slight reductions in the allocations to some 4 other States. In the government school sector in Queensland the total of general support will enable the implementation of a program amounting to some $17.415m. Migrant and multicultural education, which is a very important program in Queensland, will receive an allocation of $450,000. Disadvantaged school projects in Queensland- I have one school, in my electorate, the Petrie Terrace State School, which was declared a disadvantaged school only recently-wil l receive a total of $ 1.47m. Expenditure on the special education general support program will amount to $ 1.29m. Capital grants, general and specific purposes grants, will total $22.7m this year. The total program for this financial year amounts to $43.325m. The non-government schools sector is strongly supportedfinanciallythis year. There has been an increase in the size of the recommended general recurrent grant for the most needy primary schools from some $223 a pupil to $229 a pupil at average 1976 price levels. These schools cater for approximately 90 per cent of enrolments in the non-government primary school area. The Government also has accepted the Schools Commission recommendation that the level of grant per pupil for non-government schools be linked automatically in future years to the expenditure level per pupil in government schools. I think that this is a very important part of our total overall program. In level one schools, the 1976 allocation per pupil to primary schools was $76. In 1977, it will be $84. The allocations have been increased throughout the whole.6 levels culminating in the allocation for level 6 being increased from $223 from 1976 to $229 for 1977, as I mentioned previously. In the secondary school area, the previous grant per child at level 6 was $355. That will rise to $367 in 1977. At level one, the allocation willrisefrom $ 113 in 1976 to $130 in 1977. The total non-government school program in Queensland will enable recurrent general support amounting to $22.218m. The allocation this year for migrant and multicultural education, disadvantaged school projects, special education general support projects and capital grants for general and specific purpose projects will total $26.434m. This is the sort of program for which I believe the Australian people elected the Government that we have. The chUdren of Australia are our investment for the future. It is Australia's future. I support the BUls.",33
65,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRICES JUSTIFICATION AMENDMENT,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has grants offset against expired.,40
66,Mr BEAZLEY,PRICES JUSTIFICATION AMENDMENT,"May I suggest to the honourable member for Brisbane  performer and audience in relation to his children's reading matter. If I understood him correcdy, he said that it was a deUght for him to read to his chUdren from all the modern pubUcations that were now used in schools. The real way of advancing chUdren's reading skUl, basic to education, I would suggest to the honourable member, is for them to read to him. Research on this aspect has been supported by the Thomas thefieldof Coram Child Centre at London University which has just completed a very interesting study of British schoolchildren in Dagenham. The group of children selected had a comparable sociogations, economic background. The best readers in the area were those who read regularly to their parents at thetimeof the study. The next best were those who read occasionally to their parents at the time of the study. The next best who had read regularly to their parents when in infants classes. The next best were those who had cation read occasionally to their parents when in infants classes. The poorest achievers in reading were educauon. those who had never read to their parents at This would suggest that the best experiment the honourable member for Brisbane to try Minister would be not to read to them but to encourage the children to read to him. I am sure that honourable member for Brisbane will find using this method that there will be an advance in children's reading age. I wonder how soon it will be before the honourable member for Brisbanefindsout that there is no Commonwealth expenditure on eduspent cation in the State of Queensland. The honouring able member will not be invited by Queensland State Government authorities to the opening anything which has been built in Queensland with Commonwealth money because Commonwealth money will not be acknowledged to exist in Queensland. The honourable member will have a chance of being invited to the opening Catholic schools whose authorities acknowledge Commonwealth grants but neither he nor Senaresidentials tor Carriek will ever have acknowledged by the Queensland Government any Commonwealth To expenditure on any State schools. I admire the honourable senator's enthusiasm for spent Queensland and what the State will get in respect of technical and further education. ever, if the honourable gentleman cares to pare last year's Budget payment to the States with this year's Budget payment to the States willfindthat once more Queensland has not made completely spent the capital that was available it from the Commonwealth for the construction of technical and further education colleges. is additional to the fact that, with the adroitness for which the Premier of Queensland is notable, that State is concealing technical education in colleges of advanced education. The more techcally nical education work which Queensland puts into colleges of advanced education, the the entire tab is picked up by the Commonfurther wealth; whereas, as the honourable member rightly observes, if this work is categorised as technical and further education, there is a State obligation to maintain its effort. The honourable gentleman willfindthat the States are not very keen to carry their obliespecially in thefieldof technical education. I noticed the hopeful statement made by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) when introducing this Bill, and no doubt it was the same speech as was made by Senator Carriek were those in the Senate. The Minister said: The prime responsibility for technical and further edurests with the States and these amounts are supplementary to the States' own efforts in this area of all. If Queen Mary had 'Calais' written on her for heart, I would have this expression which the used written on my heart because, in the field of technical and further education, in the the cases of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria while I was the Minister, the more the Comthe monwealth did in thefieldof capital grants for TAFE the less they spent of their own resources. A position was reached where $10 in Commonwealth funds was being spent on technical colleges in New South Wales for every $1 being by the State for that purpose. I am speaknow of capital funds. In Victoria $4 Commonwealth funds was spent for each $ 1 provided of by the State. A State which did play the game was South Australia which spent $3.50 for every $1 provided by the Commonwealth. I quite agree that it would be very good if we of could induce the States to continue to maintain their TAFE capital effort, including thefieldof for technical education. But we need to be careful about some of these comparisons. begin with, when we are cheerfully comparing what is to be spent this year with what was last year it might be wise to look at what wasfinallyappropriated last year to see whether Howthe States actually spent what was avaUable. comOtherwise we would be comparing what was actually spent with what the Government hoped in he future to make avaUable and not with what was avaUable to the States in the last financial to year. I will always remember being denounced for providing inadequate capital grants for techThis nical education amounting to $46m in a triennium when 3 States had returned $7m unspent because they did not have the organisation to do the authorised building or possibly because basithey were not then interested in TAFE. The other matter on which we need to be on more guard when speaking about technical and education expenditure, is how much of it so represents a real advance and how much in represents a desperate attempt to catch up with enrolments. In my period as Minister for Education, enrolments in technical and further education rose from 400 000 to 705 000. So, the increase in capital from $24m to $35m for technical education is in part an effort to accommodate this greatly increased enrolment. In our period in office we were not under-estimating technical education. We came into a very defective situation with regard to it. Technical fees were abolished-this , of course, added to our problems because it increased enrolments-and financial support to the States in this TAFE sector increased by 350 per cent in monetary units from $ 19m in 1972-73 to $71 m in 1974-75. I notice the persistence with which Senator Carriek has been saying that we cut expenditure on technical education. I do not know what he talking about. If he is comparing 2 years of actual expenditure, there was neither a cut in expendia ture nor a cut in recurring expenditure by the Commonwealth. The total amount technical education rose from nearly $45 m in 1974-75 to $65m in 1975-76. Both capital and recurrent expenditures were increased. However, if he is talking about a cut from what was recthe ommended by the Richardson Commissionand half the time this is what is being said-th late Labor Government found itself unable to face the expenditures recommended by the Richardson Commission. I have noticed a tendency to refer caustically to the Treasury in the course of debates here. The Treasury is a most villainous body, as we all know. Sometimes, however, the Treasury tion represents a chining blast of reality clearing fog of false hopes. The Richardson report recrelevant ommended capital grants to the States of $234m for building technical and further education leges. Being the Minister and having to make case for that when in the last completed trienyears nium the States had not spent $46m in 3 yearsthis was a recommendation for $234m to be spent in Vk years-wa s somewhat difficult; perhaps some Treasury criticisms had justificaigines tion. Anyway, we could not see the rapid mobilpopulation isation of labour and materials to make so vast an increase in technical and further education expenditure. I do not expect enrolments in techliteracy nical and further education, even part time, continue to rise at the rate of 100 000 a year. fact, the Technical and Further Education Comquoted mission envisages an increase in enrolments about 85 000 over a triennium which is a much follows: slower rate than increases in enrolments in the past triennium. I think, however, that this is a very great under-estimate of demand. I believe that the most responsible elements among the young people who are unemployed and the most responsible elements among the young people who are in unsatisfactory jobs will be seeking to upgrade their qualifications. Therefore, I believe that as economic pressures increase there will be a corresponding increase in the demand for technical and further education. I do not want to labour this point any further, but honourable gentlemen opposite refer with pride to increases of 3.2 per cent in real education expenditure, and I accept the sincerity of that line of comment. It may be a 3.2 per cent increase in real monetary units. But honourable members opposite must also recognise that enrolments are not blocked and if there is a very large increase in enrolments, as there will be, an increase of 3.2 is per cent in real money units of expenditure will be a reduced expenditure per capita. Therefore, larger student body is not likely to have its needs met by such a small percentage increase in provided for real expenditure. I now wish to turn attention to one technical college that particularly interests me. I refer to Katherine Rural College which, with agricultural and technical courses and with its planned e intention to meet the needs of young people in the Northern Territory, including young Aboriginal people, represents an important Commonwealth initiative in techical and further education. We cannot attach any blame to the States if this college does not proceed because education in the Northern Territory is exclusively a Commonwealth responsibility. I draw the attenof the House to an analytical breakdown of the Northern Territory Aboriginal poulation by age to the likely demand for this sort of education. In the Northern Territory there are 1501 colAborigines between the ages of 25 years and 29 a years, 1849 Aborigines in the ,20 years to 24 age group, 2251 Aborigines in the 15 years to 19 years age group, 2811 Aborigines in the 10 years to 14 years age group, 3348 Aborigines in the 5 years to 9 years age group, and 4029 Aborin the 4 years and under age group. That pyramid shows a rapid increase in the youthful sector of the population. There is a tremendous need among Aborigines, apart from in their own languages and in English, to for special forms of education. The Katherine In Rural College Planning Committee in its report a statement in the recent report of the of Schools Commission Consultative Group as We recognise that a serious problem exists in the field of technical education with regard to Aboriginal people. In our experience one feature of successful schemes for the eduat cation of Aborigines has been the recognition that a special approach is necessary. Then the Planning Committee went on to quote State from the report of the Woodward Aboriginal Lands Rights Commission as follows: There is no chance of any significant increase in the number of workers required the industry to rely more on capital expenditure and less on labour. On the other hand, the number of jobs available to Aborigines could be increased by vocational training of Aborigines in such fields as truck driving, mechanical tenance, building construction and bookkeeping. The Planning Committee made a number of recommendations which I very strongly endorse. One of the recommendations was: Aboriginal students be encouraged to enrol in ' sive courses at the College, with the bulk of the training being given in the home community. Another recommendation was: Selecdon of students for courses be done by consultation between the College, prospective students, community councils and traditional Aboriginal leaders. At the Yirara College for Aboriginal students near Alice Springs this consultation with the tribal leaders has proved to be very fruitful. One other recommendation of the Planning Committee was: The College continually liaise with Aboriginal communities to ascertain training needs and that nomination of students by communities reflect community needs and employment opportunities. I have concentrated exclusively in the field of technical and further education because in a debate that throws together 8 educational Bills there is not much sense in spending 2Vi minutes on each Bill. I appeal to the Government to commence work on the Katherine Rural College because of its great importance in the Northern Territory. The case for technical and further education was put very succinctly in the summary of the report of the Technical and Further Eduwill cation Commission. It reads: Australia does not possess sufficient skilled manpowereven during the current economic recession which is characterised by high unemployment. This national problem is aggravated by a fall in the numbers of skilled immigrants and too few Australians undergoing skill training. When the Australian Labor Party came into power the reports on the state of technical education in Australia indicated that 70 per cent of the male work force and 80 per cent of the female work force had no skills. That was the reason for the 350 per cent increase ture in this area. The report of the Technical and being Further Education Commission also states: A minimum objective should be to ensure that in 1979 TAFE will be, relative to enrolmentsNote that cautionary pointleast as well off for space and equipment as it was in 1974 the year in which the current Commonwealth assistance program for TAFE began. The combined Commonwealth and building programs since 1974 have failed to keep pace with actual enrolment increases in 1973-75. I suggest that the situation in which New South Wales was prepared to put in towards building-the capital construction in the TAFE in future, since the trend is for area-las t year only $ 1 for every $ 10 contributed by the Commonwealth and Victoria was prepared to put in towards TAFE capital construcmain- tion only $1 for every $4 contributed by the Commonwealth accounts for the failure of the technical and further education program to keep pace with the increased enrolments. Because of the percentage increase in our expenditure, the short inten- efforts that were made by the Commonwealth were adequate if the States had played the game, or had been capable of adequate planning. I do not say that their planning departments were always able to make more space available for technical and further education students.",40
67,Mr GOODLUCK,PRICES JUSTIFICATION AMENDMENT,"Iriseto support the Bills and to add that I am a firm supporter of the provision of more assistance for technical and further education. However, I believe that the Minister for Education (Senator Carriek) has done all within his power to accommodate this important sector in 1977. For the remainder of my speech I should like to deal specifically with the question of apprenticeship, I firmly believe that apprenticeship can be aligned with the real problem of unemployment in Australia today, particularly among the young people. I specifically draw attention to what I thought was a very fine article in the Australian Financial Review of 4 November 1976. Under the heading 'Government eventually will have to bite the apprenticeship bullet', it states: State and Federal Ministers for Labour and Employment meet in Melbourne next week to review the existing apprenticeship support programs, and hopefully agree on a new cost-sharing formula between the Commonwealth, States and employers. But as the States so far have rejected revenue-raising suggestions-includin g adjustments to payroll tax-to lift their own contributions, and employers are unlikely to be stimulated except by direct subsidy, the likelihood of the meeting reaching any kind of consensus on the point seems remote indeed. It is quite possible that the meeting will reach some agreement on ways by which the present program can be made more efficient, and lead to some improvement The sorts of suggestionsin expendiI draw attention to this matterdiscussed by a working party of officials on the subject, include a greater use of technical schools, particularly during the long vacations, an acceleration of formal off-the-job training, shortening the period of indentures where possible and a moreflexibleuse of pre-apprenticeship training. It has also been proposed that the subsidy to employers under the National Apprenticeship Advisory Council be spread over the three or four than concentrated in thefirstyear of training. Such moves by themselves couldresultin some reduction of the present high 'wastage' rates of apprendces, to be as disproportionate as 40 per cent in some N.S.W. industries compared with 9 per cent in South Australia. Quite apart from those apprentices who simply 'drop out' because of the length of indentures, one of the major problems has been the number whose indentures have been suspended or even cancelled by employers in the second or third year when the NAAS subsidy is not available. This trend has become even more noticeable during the current period of economic recession. I have paid particular regard to that article cause I believe that we as a Government need look more closely at apprenticeship training. believe that our training has dropped behind that of other countries and that if we are to improve the unemployment situation amongst four the young we need to improve the apprenticeand ship training. Historically, technical and further education appears to have been an area of neglect in Australia. On only 2 occasions in the past has technical and further education reached a promithe nent position in Australia's post-secondary cation system. During the World Wars its role was temporarily expanded to provide required skills and training for servicemen and, during intermediate post-war years, for ex-servicemen. Apart from those periods of national emergency it is widely considered that technical and further education has been both under-valued by the most important. community and inadequately supported financially. We have an extremely difficult problem with youth unemployment. Before I talk about apprenticeship and the history of apprenticeship let me say that I believe it is important that have the statistics pertaining to the young recorded in Hansard for all honourable members to read. There are 2 distinct dimensions to the youth unemployment problem in Australia. The first and most obvious reflects the severe effects of recession on employment among young people, particularly those in the IS to 19 age group. second dimension, which is a structural dimension, is reflected in the disturbing long term trend that has been evident since the mid-1960s for unemployment rates among the IS to 19 age group to rise independently of the state of the economy. This trend is common to almost all vanced Western countries. The present high indentured levels of youth unemployment are thus the result of severe unemployment superimposed on promined gressively worsening structural unemployment problems. In other words, unemployment and amongst the young is not simply a result of the current general deficiency in labour demand. years of apprenticeship, rather There is the further underlying dimension to youth unemployment which can be expected to calculated persist irrespective of economic recovery and improved labour demand. Moreover, for reasons indicated later, unemployment among the young is unlikely to abate more than marginally in the forseeable future and a further intensification of the underlying youth problem is to be expected. At the end of May 1976 there were 103 000 persons under the age of 21 years registered as unemployed with the Commonwealth Employbement Service, including 20 100 school leavers. to The severity of the unemployment amongst the I young is amply revealed in the following: The unemployment rate for those under 20 years of age in May 1976 was 12.5 per cent, or more than times the rate of'3 per cent for those aged 20 over. The unemployment rate for the under-20 age group has been in excess of 10 per cent since November 1974. Although persons under 20 years of age comprise only 12 per cent of the labour force they account for 36 per cent of total unemployed. There were 35 young peredusons registered as unemployed for each vacancy registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service at the end of May, compared with the the adult unemployed to vacancy ratio of 8.7. The need for employment of the young unemployed is most important and therefore the need for improving the apprenticeship situation is also Apprenticeship as a means of teaching the skills of the artisan to young workers dates back at least as far as 2100 BC. The modern system had its origin in the mediaeval guilds and was I confirmed in English law under an Elizabethan Act-the Statute of Artificers-in 1563. When the Industrial Revolution created a multiplicity of new trades and the domestic system of production was superseded by factory production, the Statute of Artificers was repealed. That was the in 1814. The practice of apprenticeship was not revived untU technical education began to The develop in the 1870s. In the intervening period 'apprentices' were Poor Law charges on the parish who were sent to work in the cotton mUls in the the north of England. The apprenticeship system developed by negotiation between union and employer but there was no system of registration adand no requirement that the apprentices be or that they undertake work at a technical coUege. Until 1964 each industry deterits own apprenticeships and, although this was the method of training in the engineering electrical trades, there was no government regulation. The Industrial Training Act of aimed at ensuring an adequate supply of men and women and at improving the quality and efficiency of training and sharing costs evenly between firms. Talking more specifically now of the situation in Australia, in the early days the term tice' was applied to orphans and poor children who were used as cheap labour in farming pations, husbandry and domestic service. The laws of England covered the apprentices and masters in the colony. ThefirstAustralian lation relating to apprenticeship-the Apprenthe ' tices Act-wa s passed in New South Wales 1894 and it was expanded in the Apprentices of 1901. This was followed by legislation . States. Apprenticeship commissions-whic h in 3 States, directorates or executives have established as statutory authorities in each of States to control and administer the apprenticeon ship system. The combined list of apprenticeable occupations under State and Commonwealth awards is over three hundred. The apprenticestrong able trades are those in which employment as junior may be undertaken only through a recogthe nised apprenticeship. The Australian Apprentherefore ticeship Advisory Committee provides an inter-by state forum consisting of the permanent the State labour departments and the directors the technical education and apprenticeship executives in each State. The AAAC operates largely through working parties which make recommendations on various aspects of apprenmittee ticeship training. Apprenticeship is the normal avenue of entry into a skilled trade. The apprentice is indentured to a master craftsman or tradesman. He receives his practical training on the job and his theoretithat cal training at a technical college or school. In past such theoretical training was normally on system of day release or evening classes, but block release for longer periods of full time schooUng is becoming more common. During immigration. those periods the employer is required to keep the apprentice on Ml pay. Most States provide technical correspondence courses for country prentices in remote areas. The educational qualifications for entry into an apprenticeship vary among the States and trades, but normally the equivalent of Grade or Grade 9 schooling is required. The State lation sets no age hmits to entry into apprenticeguarantee ships, but Federal awards govern the age of entry. The length of apprenticeship is 4 or years. When the apprentice completes his articles he may undertake specialist certificate courses technician courses. The Australian Government 1964 also provides through the Development Bank a skilled number of apprenticeship and scholarship awards for more advanced courses. Since 1971 more the Australian Government has assisted the States to employ apprenticeship training advisers who visit industrial establishments and advise 'apprenemployers on apprenticeship training. The problems of apprenticeships are exoccu-tremely difficult and complex. Unfortunately Australia is suffering as a result of a shortage of skilled tradesmen and this is one of the reasons legiswhy we have such high unemployment among young. We must look at this problem most in closely. Next year and the year after governAct ments should work to this particular aim of in other improving the appenticeship system. An r exist increasing shortage of skilled tradesmen in been Australia has become apparent in recent years. the The report of the Tripartite Mission of 1968-69 the training of skilled workers in Europe has made it clear that this shortage is world wide. The Mission pointed out that Australia faced competition from developed European a countries which offerfirmworking contracts and abUity to return home regularly. Australia cannot expect to overcome its shortage increasing the intake of skUled migrant heads of labour. The report recommended that in of Australia we update our training methods with a view to meeting from within our own country the greater part of this demand for stalled workmen. Some years earlier the.Report of the Comof Economic Inquiry in 1965, the Vernon Report, pointed out that immigration was a more costly source of sltill than training additional craftsmen in Australia. The Committee of Inquiry into Labour Market Training points out although immigration has been a valuable thesource of skilled labour in the past it is not clear a that intakes have always been sufficiently closely related to labour market needs. It also mentions the inflationary pressures that may arise from The shortage of apprentices and, thus, of skUled workers seems to Ue rather with the faUapure of employers and organisations to train apprentices than with the lack ofschool leavers applying for apprenticeships. In Victoria alone last the year 10 000 applications were unsuccessful. 10 Small companies think they are at risk with legis-indentured apprentices as they are unable to employment over the period of training. Allied with this is a general feeling that the 5 training periods are too long. More work is let out on contract which means that the range of or skUls which can be taught is reduced. Subcontractors do not take onapprentices. There has been a tendency to upgrade semi-skilled labour rather than train apprentices. There is a general belief that apprentices are uneconomic and costly and employers prefer to employ newly have qualified tradesmen from other firms and organisations. Such activities do not generally improve the situation for young people who trying tofindemployment in Australia today. In order to encourage employers to train apover, prentices a number of national schemes have than you.' been used. They are good schemes, schemes reactionaryThe which we should support and hopefully to suit changing conditions in Australia today. I finding some of thismembers could talk at length of the apprenticeship system poUcies. but I will not do so. I complete my speech by saying that we need to lookfirmlyat our apprenticeWhen ship system and improve it. By doing that, hope-.fore fuUy, we will overcome the unemployment problems situation.",43
68,Mr BRYANT,PRICES JUSTIFICATION AMENDMENT,"The honourable member for Franklin (Mr Good luck) probably has been deeply involved in the question of prenticeships for long enough to be able to give the House a pretty fair summary of its difficulties. He has spelt out for us one of facts of education progress and policy-that nearly always arrive at these programs too late. One of the great misfortunes for the people who aretippedonto the labour market at this time that they have run into a time of great social change, of economic challenge, and almost phUosophical difficulty, I suppose, as far as the state of the nation is concerned and we have not found the answers. I think on the whole economically we have lost our nerve and these people are partly the victims of this fact. I speak as one who was a victim of situation of about a generation back, about 10 000 or 12 000 yesterday's ago. I sympathise with the people and worry about the fact that have allowed ourselves to be talked into this ation. It is some comfort to us on this side of the House that there are people on the Government side who recognise the difficulties. My colleague the honourable member for pubUc debate. Fremantle (Mr Beazley) spelt out another difficulty-that of dealing with the State governFirstly, ments. Perhaps the difficulty of dealing with State governments is more apparent or more placed generic for a Commonwealth Labor government than a Liberal government. However, the fact that it is very difficult to get State governments come to the party for a general national policy anything, no matter the political philosophy the prevailing Federal government. Mr Martyr-Why?",46
69,Mr BRYANT,PRICES JUSTIFICATION AMENDMENT,"Because so much of the State governments of Australia is in the hands of people who on any consideration at all would to be placed on the Ust of reactionaries from way back. I do not think all that highly of the phUosophies of people in this place. I recall that are after the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) made his maiden speech somebody wrote an article and said: ' Mr Wentworth move there are people here further to the right in so State governments are not only many regards; they are also obmodify structive. Honourable in regard opposite are to their own I look at this battery of BUls that is beus I ask myself how the BUls answer the of Australian education, how they protect the initiatives that the Labor government took in its 3 years of office and how they foUow on the programs developed over the 20 years of education debate in this Parliament. I think I apshould say, with deep regret, that I see this important issue of education, involving nearly great $2,000m from our Budget, in one way or the sad another, in Commonwealth funds alone, is we reduced to an omnibus debate in this place in which 8 BUls are being considered and in which there are three or four speakers from each side. is That is not good enough. This is a major social issue. It may well be that we say the same things now as we said years ago. It may well be that there is not all that much difference between the speeches from one side or the other. But if this that Parliament is to be a forum for poltiical phUosophies and the aims and aspirations of the people of Australia, education debates must not a sirnilar be reduced as they are today. Perhaps it is time we produced an omnibus education Act which covers all the principles that we are in these BUls and spelt them out and then situ-each year made proper appropriations in a different form of legislation. The machinery of the Parliament is now getting to the stage where it is unable to cope with the necessities of decent Labor's revolution covered a number of fields. we stressed the need to deal with the needs of the community for education and we needs at the top of the list. Thefirstarea of assistance was to go to people who had the is greatest need. However we also did other things to which were relatively revolutionary. We underontook to support people in initiatives in the of schools. One of the unnoted and, I think, not highly enough regarded areas was that related to the innovation programs. As far as I can tell from the figures I have been given they were economicBourchier), in their administration, they were effective in school room, in most cases, and they certainly produced a new dimension as far as the schools to which I have been attached were concerned. hope nothing will be done to reduce that initiative. The other thing that we stressed was the priority of education in the Australian scene. Durfore ing our period in office the vote for education exceeded the vote for defence for the firsttimein our history. I am a fairly optimistic sort of as honourable members opposite would be aware. I was one of those people who were volved for many years in education debates this House. I used to say that thetimewould come when education would take as high a priBUls ority as anything else and I used to quote the fencefigures.I did not expect to see the mentary day when it actually happened but has happened and on the whole, give or take few bits of hypocrisy here and there, honourable members opposite have accepted the same principles. One of the revolutions for which I think we were responsible was free university education and I hope that honourable members opposite who may have had the advantage of it or whose chUdren may have had the advantage of it will protect it. I regard it as a great social advance. am the first to admit that great debate was sorts generated not only in the ranks of my own Party but also, I guess, throughout the community genin erally when it was suggested that universities were for a special son of people. On the whole, was the advantaged people who got there. From my own experience, ofcourse, I know that that not the case. From the experience of the whom I represent, I know that that is not the schools. case. We opened the doors of Australian univereconomic sities to thousands of students who would been denied admission if we had not taken that action. One of the features of our regime, of course, was the consistent attacks made on everything that wedid. It was not necessary for our ably opponents to be specific. They only had to say that there was enormous waste in the education programs. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), as he does now, only had to talk in generalities. I heard him one day talk about 'mad extravagance' of the Labor Government. What exactly did he mean by that? If we transfer that phrase to the education system, does he mean that the money that went to the Hamilton High School in his electorate was wasted? Does the honourable member for Bendigo who is trying to interject, mean that the all the money that went into his electorate by any means whatever to education institutions was wasted? Of course he did not mean that. I think Ihonourable members opposite did Australian area of education a great deal of damage. Now I turn my mind to the BUls which are beus, to the principles which are espoused and to the fact that one has a brief opportunity only in this debate to take part in the discussion on person,education. I want to see whether the programs are continuing with the effort upon which we inembarked to remove the great disadvantages in from Australian education. In what way will the financial programs which are spelt out in these remove the inequalities in Australian edudecation? Some of these inequalities were spelt out parliaby my friend, the honourable member for it Fremantle, my colleague, the honourable mema ber for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen), and also the honourable member for Franklin. Great disabilities exist among the States. There is great disabUity in education opportunity if one Uves in certain areas of Queensland. There is also disabUity in opportunities and effort between suburb and suburb. I represent 2 industrial suburbs of Melbourne. They do not get the same sorts of educational advantages as do people I who live in some of the other areas. There are all of historical reasons for that state of affairs. There are also sheer physical difficulties involved trying to replace and rebuild schools in electorates such as mine. DisabiUtiesflowfrom city it to country and country to city. I notice that some of these disabilities are being taken up here. is Unfortunately assistance is almost completely people confined to programs for non-Government There are inequalities in the areas of sex, status and race. This is particularly so have for Aboriginal people and migrants. As has been spelt out on apprenticeship, the Australian educational system is still too conservative and too slow to change. There is probstill too much centralism in it. This brings me to indicate where I think the Commonwealth can be most effective. Our task as an Australian Government is to remove the disabiUties which flow to people because they live on one part of the the continent and not on another. I think a general philosophy which may well be espoused by all poltiical parties is that, wherever one Uves on this continent, one is entitled to advantages equal to those enjoyed by others Uving on the continent. So, it is only the Australian Govern(Mr ment which can achieve that end. It is our duty to set programs in train which will open new horizons in education. that this is the moment to establish the system to encourage people to take up new programs which will force these developments and which will initiate change in the relevant direction. educauon system is basically much as it was years or 40 years ago. Perhaps the internal ings of the schools are a little less authoritarian. In some ways, perhaps, professionalism in the classroom is not as good as-it was when most honourable members in the House attended to school. But I think that is changing as programs of teacher training and continuing education have increased over the last few years. There is only one way in which we can bring proper drive and real dynamics to education that is through a Commonwealth input. All Statemind instrumentalities are bound up in the conservaare tism of their arrangements, in the centralism which they are controlled and through the whole'found basic arrangements of the educauon system. It only by taking financial initiatives and by allowwhere ing them to be developed through individual schools that we will generate enough attitudes towards change which result in Australian schools becoming appropriate in outlook for the next couple of decades. After 21 years in the liament I am convinced that it is from the monwealth only that we can expect that initiative. We may get quite radical developments education. through various areas of the State system. On the whole, as I see it, in various parts of Victorian education, there have been more radical developments and more progressive attitudes than there have been in most of the rest of Australia. I think that in its general education program South Australia has been more proschools gressive and has geared itself better to the future than have most of the other States. But it is patchy development. It is only through curricutorate lum development programs, by grants for rebuUding innovation programs and by special attacks upon the disadvantages areas of education and so on that we will overcome these problems or get where near overcoming them. As I look at the legislation before us and see the whole battery it, and as I have listened to the speeches on it, have not seen anything flowing through the prostudents, posals except in odd spots a real recognition what these difficulties are. I think it is time we all recognised that the Commonwealth can no longer talk about States' duties in these ters. Every citizen has rights and every State duties rather than rights. Mr Bourchier-Fanc y you saying that States I suppose have rights.",46
70,Mr BRYANT,PRICES JUSTIFICATION AMENDMENT,"The States are simply part of the corporate structure of society. As governors Our and governments they have no rights. They have 30 duties to people. People who talk about State workrights are incipient fascists. I know that the honourable member for Bendigo is not. Sometimes I think he is a real one. But that is not what he meant by his interjection. But the fact is that talk about the rights of governments is to deny what we are here about. Our duty to the Australian school and the Australian child is just as overwhelming and demanding as is that of any State government. It is our job to intervene in a those areas where we think the States are not and making the distance. There is no doubt in my that the Australian State education systems totally inadequate in administering new by schemes. During the life of our Government we that very Uttle was done for the disadvanis taged schools in my electorate. I do not know all the money went which was put into the Victorian education scheme. I know that most of the schools in my electorate were on the Ust of disadvantaged schools for various areas. I know that they were all overloaded with migrants and Par-that they had other problems in education. I Comknow that very little of that moneyflowedto them even though people such as myself had been responsible in a large measure for the creation of the Australian Labor Party policies on So, in relation to the point being made here about non-Government schools, it seems to me that the theme is to place more reliance on nonGovernment schools. Perhaps I should say that more thought is given for non-Government than is given for Government schools. We adopt the attitude that Government schools a are somebody else's responsibUity. In my electhere is a number of schools which need completely. I shall cite two, namely, Moreland High School and Brunswick Technical School. It seems to me that the Victorian Departany-ment of PubUc Works and Department of Education have no capacity whatsoever to take up of this challenge. Both schools are buUt on very I small areas. Moreland with, I think, 700 or 800 or a few more, is a most progressive of school. It has an area avaUable of approximately that one and a quarter acres. Brunswick Technical School has perhaps 2 acres for SOO or 600 day matstudents with hundreds more under the apprenhas ticeship scheme. There is nowhere to rebuild on that land whUe the schools are still occupied. So, there is a very difficult challenge which is continually ignored by the Victorian Government. However, if we developed a program for diof rect assistance to Government schools, as we have for non-Government schools, we could call upon the initiative of the people on the school councils. There is no reason on earth why the school councils which adniinister-o r would adill minister if we put enough faith in them-th Moreland High School and the Brunswick Techeducation nical School could not handle the rebuilding, equipping and remodelling of the schools as effectively as the non-Government school councils do when we make the money available to them. So I see just a glimmer of hope for a tralisation of the school initiatives in this lation. Perhaps I am being unduly optimistic thinking that that is what would happen, but the time has come for us to make direct grants to government schools, bypassing the State Departobject ments if necessary. However, I think it would better if we came to a continuous agreement with the States and if the programs were included the Act in schedules of some sort. I make an appeal for a better system of parent participation and school participation, both student and teacher, in the management of government another schools. We recognise that there are great difficulties involved and that the professionalism and the free movement of teachers may well be disadvantaged if we turn the schools into many autonomous republics, but I do not think that the solution to that problem is beyond the wit of man. The principal issue over the next years in relation to school management is the development of the schools assistance program set out in the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill and the development of greater initiatives the schools by dealing more directly with them afinancialway. In conclusion, I should like to challenge a of the thoughts which are consistently flowing around the education system. One of these year thoughts- I heard it expressed only the other day-is that there are too many teachers. Have we trained too many teachers? I have great doubts about the validity of that statement. fact is that there are enormous numbers of week. students in the schools who are disadvantaged all sorts of ways. They are disadvantaged not only in the physical environment of the schools but also in their home environment, with all things that go with that. Many of the homes of Australia are perhaps a little less literate than they used to be. Therefore the child goes to school less well equipped to take up the challenge of modern education, and that applies particularly to migrant children. I do not regard it as being totally conclusive, but a lot of the evidence the last few years has shown that there has been a collapse in the standard of what might be called literacy-the capacity to read and write and do the things for which schools train people. These people are transferring into the work force equipped, and I hope that we will not surrene der in any way to the view that some areas of have been adequately served and that rewe will maintain a continualflowof funds.",48
71,Mr MACKENZIE,PRICES JUSTIFICATION AMENDMENT,"The honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) made decensome play of the fact that he was not given legissufficient opportunity to address the House on in these educauon Bills. I would point out to the House and to those persons listening that the Opthe position was given a very clear opportunity to to these 8 Bills being debated cognately. be There was not a murmur from them. I should also point out to the House and to those listening in that when the speakers'fistwas drawn up the Opposition couldfindonly 2 speakers. Since then it has found the honourable for Wills, and I understand that it is now trying to find yet speaker to take part in this debate. So much for the claim that the Opposition is being denied the opportunity to debate these Bills. The 8 Bills are most significant and indicate so clearly the support that the Commonwealth Government is providing for secondary and post-secondary education. Within that context of few post-secondary education I include apprenticeship education, to which my friend the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Good luck) referred. At the outset I want to say that I think in there are enormous problems in apprenticeship in training when one considers the situation that has occurred with the wages explosion and the level of wages being paid to young people. I have few found it very difficult to persuade an 18V4 year old to take up an apprenticeship, to be indentured for a long period oftime,when that 18'A old can go and work in an abattoir in my electorate for a base wage of $196 a week, with an additional $20 to $30 a week in overtime, and The effectively doing some 32 hours work in that That is a sad reflection on the state of the in economy and on the situation in which we found ourselves when we took office last December. Tbis Government is committed to education and these Bills amply demonstrate that commitment. Contrary to the criticism-criticis m often ill informed or in some cases purposefully orchestrated, I believe-ther e has been no cutback in education funding by this Government com1975 pared to the previous Government's funding. The cutback occurred in 1976, and I point very clearly that this current year's funding resulted from the previous Labor Government's Budget, the 1975-76 Hayden Budget, when the Labor Government suddenly realised that its extriennial travagant educauon programs, its multifarious E rograms, its wasteful programs, could no longerwell e financed. The cutbacks came between 1975 and 1976, and in fact this Government has tored and increased the level of education expendid diture over and above that of last year. Preto viously we had the luxurious, wanton and waste-volved ful programs which were instituted by the vious Government. Ifindit quite remarkable ditional that a small country school can be battling to vive because it has perhaps 14 children, and if drops below that number it will be closed. one teacher, it has very poor toilets, playing operation. fields and recreational facilities, and yet it has a multitude of electronic equipment, closed circuit television and the like. This sort of thing done untold damage to parents and friends ascation sociations which were working for the smaller schools. It destroyed any incentive they had raise funds for the benefit of the school, and lieve that that sort of thing is an example of wasteful programs which were set up. In relation to the post-secondary education sector, I have had somefirsthand experience with some of the difficulties involved in trying plan, to budget and to administer within the programs established by the previous Governfor ment. There was a situation, which has now beencision. rectified, where it was almost impossible stitute between recurrent funding and capital funding. For example, if one could make savings in the current funded areas through salaries through the employment of part ume staff and one wished to use that saving for a capital purI pose, it could not be done. The matter had to referred to Canberra for decision because oftheexaminations, rigidity with which the programs were the implemented. For example, there was no an attitude prospect of being able to carry overfinancefrom attended or in one triennium to the next, or in some cases withinreal necessity for years of triennia, and there was in fact no incen-take a qualification, tive for good housekeeping within the education to bear that quaUfication system. What was the situation when this Government took office? Inflation was running at record levelsshould which threatened the real values of recurrent capital programs in the education sector. Unembelieved ployment was at a level of 300 000 people, 40 per cent of whom were young people under theEverything age of 21 years. A decision was made in Augustthey by the Whitlam Government to cut the programs of the 4 education commissions for the out calendar year 1976 by a total of $ 105m compared with the allocation for the 1975 calendar year. That is where the cutback came. The Whitlam Government set aside the principle of funding'and planning, and that was disastrous from the point of view of any logical and designed program for educational development, both in terms of physical facilities and in resterms of course-planning and programming. We not know if we could appoint staff. In relation staff appointments, anybody who has been inin this area will know that there is a long preleadtimebetween thefirstindication that adstaff are needed, through the process of sur-advertising, selection and appointment, to the ittime when the member of stafffirsttakes up the It hasappointment as an effective member of the The Australian Universities Commission and has the Australian Commission on Advanced Eduwere amalgamated, and I sympathise with the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr to Beazley) who was at that time the Minister for I be-Education. He is a man for whom I have some theregard, and a man who was genuine in his efforts to provide a high level of quaUty education for this country. But he was so often thwarted in his efforts to do that by his own Prime Minister. The classic example of that is when the Prime Ministoter declared that the 2 tertiary commissions rigidwould be amalgamated. I doubt if the Minister Education was properly consulted on that deWe also saw the freezing of students' alto sub-lowances by the Whitlam Government even though no changes had been made since 1 January 1975 and the aUowances at that time or were based on June 1974 values. think that we also saw a substantial change in beattitudes of young people towards work, towards towards pass rates and towards whole education system. There seemed to be developing that as long as they fact were enrolled there was no them to perform in order to in order to have some right and to use it. We saw extraordinary attitudes developing, where in the free hand-out society students beUeved that they have their student representative council and fees paid for them by the government. They even that their Australian Union of Students' subscriptions should be paid by the government. had to be free. They thought that deserved it, that it was their right and o entitlement and that they did not have to conand tribute for anything. I should like to refer to the accusations of the cently cutback in the expenditure programs major educational areas. Reference can be made amounting in total toof to the recent speech of the Minister for Education (Senator Carriek) in the Senate in which he in made it quite clear that compared to allocations mooted made in 1976 as a result of the Hayden Budget cation funding. the allocations for education programs in 1977 in rather than the previous all cases have increased giving a total for 1977 compared to $l,490m for the 1976 program and honourable members will recall that that was a cutback of $ 105m on 1975, the vious year. What has been done since this Government our took office besides making increased allocations lege sector to the 4 education areas? Firstly inquiry that has been instituted by this GovernThere has been call ment into the whole sector of post-secondary education, and secondary education for that length matter, as it relates to the needs and demands of higher the workforce. I believe that we have tended to levels, become too academic, too out of touch and too graduate unrealistic as to what the workplace demands. I Ueve thatand think that we have been in danger of over-educafessor', make substantial tion too many and leaving a great hiatus lower levels of post-secondary education, paretical content of many of then-the ticularly as my colleague the honourable mem-doing ber for Franklin mentioned, at the apprenticeship levels and at the technical and function, further education levels. I think that as a result this many people who graduated with postgraduate degrees or undertook research have found it very difficult tofindmeaningful employsectors ment and, in some cases, any employment, definition within the workforce. I recall some of my roles colleagues at university who were not game to tions. face visits by people representing the industrial organisations thatfinancedtheir post-graduate scholarships. They in fact found an excuse to be there because they were not prepared to be publicly scratinised as to the value of the scholartertiary ships they held in relation to the work that they were meant to be doing and the contribution they were meant to be making to industry or university. What else has been done? This Government, as I mentioned before, has restored education funding. It has provided for an increase in real moneys to universities by 2 per cent, to colleges by 5 per cent and to the technical and further education area by IVi per cent. This is very comhigher mendable at atimeof such extreme economic difficulties and the need for severe economic traint. The principle of a rolling triennium has been reintroduced. This will allow institutions States effectively to forward plan and effectively to administer their programs. Only reannounced in October this year the Government substantial increases in all 10 of the 4 different categories an students' allowances additional $50m a year expenditure. This was an issue that was how much far and wide in the Press as indicative of this Government had cut back eduIn fact it is this Government, Government, that has of $ 1,537mrestored student allowances. In addition, the Government is committed to preundertaking an investigation into the coordination and rationalisation of a number of some institutions. I think that these matters need examination. I make reference to the colwhere there has been an escalation of I applaud the what I would great 'academic respectability'. pressure to increase the of courses, to upgrade courses, to go for and higher degress, to push associate diploma courses to diploma and degree course and to make application for more postthey graduate diploma courses. Staff beare entitled to be caUed 'prodemands for sabbatical at the leave entitlements, and increase basic theorcourses. In so I believe they lose sight of the original purpose androlefor which coUeges of ofadvanced education were originally established. I think that examination needs to be conducted of the college and technical education of education. There needs to be a clear of the roles of colleges vis-a-vis the of technical and further education instituIf there cannot be a clear definition of these roles let us accept the fact that there may need to be some overlap at the interface between the not two. Why is it necessary to compartmentalise institutions into tertiary versus non-tertiary or versus sub-tertiary? One of the results of doing this is that we have in this country probably the most inadequate provisions for the the transferabiUty of students between one sector and another of the post-secondary education system. I think that through doing this we also basically deny opportunities to so many young school leavers who may have left school for a variety of circumstances which in many cases are beyond their control and who have not gamed thenschool certificate. In many other countries there are ways and means and opportunities for respeople such as those who do not have full secondary quaUfications, to acquire those qualifications in later Ufe and to foUow through to achieve the level of post-secondary education that they desire or that suits them best. I think that also has implications for the way which we select applicants for our institutions. Personally I believe strongly that we should that insist that students who seek to ties and coUeges should do so only after waiting for a period after leaving school. They should have a period of Ufe and work experience so they can enter the institutions as more motivated students and probably more able to undertake lishment and succeed in their courses. There would be many members of this House who would recall how successful returned sersmall. vicemen from World War II were in completing university courses. Those servicemen were described by one professor at Sydney University, with whom I remember discussing this subject, as by far the best students, the most motivated students and the most contributing students whom he had ever taught. Look at the record some of our adult students who have entered institutions such as the University of New England through external studies programs. They have entered the university with protries visional matriculation and have graduated university medallists. I can think of one extramight ordinary case in which a husband and wife were both university medaUists in the one year. So let us look not only at the selection with a view possibly to getting more motivated students and with a view to reducing first wastages and the Uke but let us look also at of our learning processes. I think that these the sorts of things we can do with more deal motivated and more experienced students. Let try to accept that the learning process is not simply one of communication from staff to difficulties. students. Let us look at the situation where students might be able to learn from each other. Let us look at the situation where staff might learn from students. Let us look at the situation where students might learn from the pracwas titioners of arts, crafts or professions, the people who have to survive or die by their abiUty to duct their profession or their craft. I mentioned earUer the rationalisation that necessary, I believe, in some areas. We see, example, a university, a coUege of advanced eduever, cation and one or more technical and further education institutions in the one centre. This or may not be a regional centre. I think there is great need to look at this dispassionately and intelligently to see whether there cannot be much greater degree of co-operation and relationship amongst the 3 sectors. At the same time. I think there are dangers in assuming that because an institution is bigger it is better or because an institution is bigger it is cheaper to operin ate. Each institution has to be regarded on the basis of its own merits, the particular phUosophy it might have developed, its reputation or its attend universiparticular specialty. I make mention of the Katherine Rural Training College to which the honourable member for that Fremantle (Mr Beazley) referred. How on earth could one apply a criteria of this sort to the estabof that type of institution. Katherine is a relatively small settlement. The student draw in the whole of the Northern Territory is relatively At the same time there is a necessity to provide that type of post-secondary educational faculty. Since I have had some association with that rural training coUege I make a plea to this Government that before it proceeds to estabUsh the coUege there is an examination of the role, of function and purpose for which this college of should be estabUshed. In the initial stages of planning it was considered that this college might provide training faculties for people to work in the pastoral zone and in the rural indusas rural labour or as rural managers. Of as course it then became clear that this coUege become basicaUy a training college for Aborigines. I think that also is a worthy motive. But let us be quite clear on its purpose before we of our students embark on it.",49
72,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRICES JUSTIFICATION AMENDMENT," Order! year The honourable member'stimehas expired. some Mr INNES (Melbourne) (4.37)-Iriseto supare port the amendment. Particularly I would Uke to with the area of specific learning difficulties us and to draw the attention of the House to the problems of the chUdren disadvantaged by these I hoped to have had an opportunity to debate these matters earlier in the House in connection with the report of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Specific Learning Difficulties. This most important report tabled on Thursday, 14 October 1976, which is almost a month ago. Still the Government has connot seen fit to provide the House with an opportunity to debate the report Why the Government is should be so reluctant to allow debate on this is for not known to me. I urge the Government, howto bring on the matter as early as possible before the end of the session as a number of unmay knowns urgently require elucidation. We need to a know, for instance, whether it is the intention of the Australian Government to estabUsh a list of a priorities in relation to the recommendations interand, if so, when such priorities will be implemented. At a more general level we need to know the Government's position and the nature of its commitment to the recommendations in this report. Allow me to mention just one or two examples school and of the sort of thing I have in mind. Firstly, quiring teacher education in Australian tertiary instituwork tions needs to include training in the methods of procedures avaUable to reduce learning difficulThis ties. Such training should be given to all trainees and quaUfied teachers by both pre and in-serviceother training. The Select Committee's report makes several critical recommendations about these aspects of teacher education. We need to know the whether the Australian Government is prepared to endorse and implement such change through the various tertiary education commissions and, if so, when wiU it occur. These are important matters andmembers on both sides of the skUls. House, I am sure, will want to know the answersliteracy to these questions before another month has passed. Secondly, many pre-school chUdren who have learning difficulties do not go to pre-schoolsknow or any other educationally orientated place at which such difficulties may be remedied. This includes such categories as linguistically vantaged migrant chUdren, in whose welfare I have a particular concern, the economically disadvantaged and so on. The report clearly states that if learning difficulties are tified and remedied early, overtime such difficulties become harder to remedy. I asked about the Government's intention in this area in a question without notice on November. I am still patiently waiting for response. We need to know how and when Government intends to provide services in order that such chUdren with difficulties will not be disadvantaged for the rest of their Uves. Delay inexcusable. For every month that passes more and more chUdren reach that point of no return where it becomes too late to take such remedial action. Those chUdren are condemned to a life with Uttle prospect. The Australian Council for Educational Research found that 29 per cent Australia's 10-year-olds and 27 per cent of year-olds cannot understand written material of cational greater complexity than their classroom textIt books. Some 20 per cent of 14-year-olds cannot comprehend the meaning of passages taken from daUy newspapers. Some 26 per cent cannot writeauthority a letter applying for a job. There are many students in need of remedial help in reading or arithmetic as there are places. These figures are beyond dispute. They are not the findings of an educationist with his own barrowPlenty to push but thefindingsof research undertaken under the auspices of the Education Research and Development Committee of the Australian basic Government. They clearly show that a quarter of our chUdren pass from primary to secondary on to the job market without ever acthe basic educational skills needed to take their place as functional members of the force and citizen body. country has a long history of assistance for those struggling to compete successfully in market situations, but the labour market is the most cut-throat of aU markets. There are no subsidies or superphosphate bounties there. So situation is critical. It is interesting and a Uttle saddening to see that response to this situation includes 2 sorts of reaction which are not helpful in the least. One fairly typical response is to try to minimise the problems of basic educational What has been done to meet the crisis of by pointing out that in some comparable countries such as New Zealand or the United Kingdom things are even worse. I would Uke to how that helps the situation in Australia. Of course it does not. There has to be an end to the shoddy rationalisation and unceasing dedisadfence of the indefensible. Normal children should be able to read by thetimethey are seven. Teaching a chUd to read is the most fundamental responsibUity which is owed to him by his school not idenand the education system generaUy. Mr MACKenzie-What about his parents?",52

The second misleading response, and one which members might think I am about to embrace myself, is the return to the is golden age syndrome which has become a great rallying cry for conservatives in this country. Modern educational techniques, it is held, have destroyed standards of Uteracy and we need to return to a concentration on the sit up and shut up, strap across the buttocks, rote learning of the of 3 Rs system of education.

I am not saying for one moment that I condone some of the programs that are outlined. of evidence suggests that there ought to be establishment of a proper and efficient program. If there is a necessity to return to some notion of education to achieve that, it ought to be done. I simply raise the question. The lem is here with us. In the far distant future dren from my electorate of Melbourne will still be lamenting if the Minister does come to grips with the problem and lets the recommendation of the Committee go unheeded or shelved purpose of procrastination. The Government has become certainly not in the true sense of the word objective in its approach, nor has it challenged on many occasions for shelving reports and not letting them become pubhc. one is public. It has been tabled. It contains recommendations. What we are calling on the Government to do is to give effect to those recommendations. The Committee was unanihas mous in its attitude on the issues to which I reference. There was no argument, there was consensus, about the fundamental principles which I have outlined. The reason why I said that these approaches just possibly do aid literacy is that there is no firm evidence to suggest that it does. No one has able satisfactorily to prove that there was ever golden age in Australian education when stanschool dards of literacy were more satisfactory than they are at present; nor is it likely that we will ever have evidence to suggest that those in generation of our grandfathers were better readers than those in our children's generation. What is needed is action, not a lot of words. What we can say with certainty-and this can confirmed by the House of Representatives Select Committee of Specific Learning Difficultance ties-is that an enormous number of today's dren who clearly have the capacity to read are missing out on the learning process. In this text, whether there has been an actual decline inplace reading standards is supremely unimportant. school.inItall What matters is the decline which has occurred lingual teachers in Uteracy and the aspiration held by our coming need for community munity for aU its chUdren. We have to estabUsh a re-birth of Uteracy major national priority. In this sense we need reject efforts to divert discussion away from present problems and practical ways of overcomteachers ing them in favour of an historical debate of sterile and most inconclusive kind. It is time tackle the real problems. It is time for a major shift in educational resources to enable the prob-need lems of Uteracy to be tackled head on. To otherwise is to sell out our chUdren on the basiccommunity freedoms of access to information, vocational choice and even poltiical choice which Uteracy alone can confer. The experience of those who served on the Committee-and I am sure this wUlthe be supported by those who have experience in thefield-would suggest that recommendations prob-from the Committee's report should be adopted chil-to deal with factors which are external to the classroom and lead to a faUure to achieve. Any review of the adequacy of current measures is unsatisfactory if it fads to consider the imporfor thetance of broader environmental factors. It is readUy obvious that the high proportion of been Aboriginal and migrant chUdren-particularl y Aboriginal chUdren in the Northern Territory, as Thiswas indicated by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley)-wh o suffer from learning difficulties is seriously contributed to by general rather than specific problems. This fact beenfirmlyestabUshed in a number of repumadetable investigations apart from that carried out by the Select Committee on Specific Learning Difficulties on which the honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde) and I served. There have been a number of other investigations such as that by the Senate Select Committee on Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and the migrant task force beenreport. It was mentioned also in the submission aby a Mr BeU who had practical experience as a teacher in the Alice Springs area. It was he who submitted in evidence to the Select Committee on Specific Learning Difficulties that the the influence on educational under-achievement of other factors such as cultural and linguistic difficulties, basic housing and health problems in a domestic environment, the pattern of alcohol beconsumption and problems of frequent famUy movement should be recognised. The imporof these factors in Aboriginal learning childisabiUties is well documented. conThere is a whole range of investigations taking areas where migrant chUdren go to is true that there is a dire need for biin these areas. There is a screamrelations oflicers who are bilingual. In this respect what has been the as aachievement of the present Government in the toschools mentioned by the honourable member our for Calare (Mr MACKenzie)? There is a dearth of in those schools and, if additional a teachers are not forthcoming, these schools will to not be able to carry on the programs in the Northern Territory for which this screaming exists. At the Stuart Park Primary School in do Darwin there are 2 bUingual-Greek-speaking relations officers who are fundamental to the chUdren in that area achieving to the maximum. But what happened? Due to the many Budget cuts and the pressures appUed in area, the services of these 2 individuals were dispensed with. This action was to the detriment of the capacity and entitlement of the chUdren in that area to be on equal ground with other childeal dren. It was only after a scream from the comspecific munity that they were put back in the service a limited period. In Melbourne, where there is another screamof ing need for community relations officers, there are blocks offlatsin which children are living shocking circumstances. In one block offlatsin Collingwood, 80 per cent of the inhabitants either unmarried or single mothers or deserted wives-wome n who are on their own trying to bring up their children. If one goes into the schools seeking to discover link between the education situation and the home environment one need only speak to munity relations officers. The honourable ber for Moore can smirk for as long as he likes but why does he not indicate whether what I am saying is correct and whether he will support me in a demand that the recommendations in the report be implemented as soon as possible? We should not put up with the procrastination that we have tolerated in the immediate past. I have asked questions on this issue of the report and still have not received an answer. This morning asked a further question without notice on same issue and I hope that it gets better treatment. We appreciate the problem of resources and are not opposing the Bill in general. If we are to go along with this elitist concept, ignore in our mind's eye and in our hearts, and turn attention to the silk department or the tertiary education area, we will be turning our back on those who need greater help. It might well be that what is needed is a redistribution of specifically resources for some period at least to catch with and endeavour to relieve the plight of those in the underprivileged areas of our society-th Aboriginal children and the migrant children particular. We encourage migrants to come out here and immediately set for them standards which are inferior in many respects to the dards we set for the community generally. We find migrant children in schools trying to cope with 2 languages-thei r native tongue and English. They are losing their mother tongue cannotfinda text book which adequately their requirements in their struggle to equip themselves to look after themselves and their that families in the future. I have endeavoured to stay some distance away from the specific provisions of the report the Select Committee on Specific Learning has Difficulties. The honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde) should think again if he believes that these are the only areas with which I intend in the debate on the report. I believe that the matters raised by the Select Committee for on Specific Learning Difficulties ought to be dealt with as a matter of urgency. A whole range issues is screaming out for attention. If we are not prepared to do something about a redistribuin tion of resources between now and the time when chUdren from the primary schools are are moving into the secondary school area, we will commit a number of these children into the wUderness in which other chUdrenfindthemselves. If we allow this to happen, it will be a disgrace to what is missing in theour society. I am not talking about whether the previous comGovernment was right, how much money it memspent on education or whether the present Government will do something better in this area in the future. We have to come to grips with the fact that the problem exists now. I nope that the opportunity to debate the matters contained in the report of the Select Committee on Specific Learning Difficulties will be provided in the very near future. Today I have merely attempted to bring the current crisis concerning literacy to the I attention of the House. I hope the lesson will not the be lost on honourable members opposite and that the Government will accordingly bring on a debate on the report of the Select Committee at the earUest opportunity.",53
74,Mr HODGMAN,PRICES JUSTIFICATION AMENDMENT,"I am what is obliged to the honourable member for ourKingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) for permitting me to make some comments on a matter which is of particular concern to the electorate of Denison and to the people of Hobart. It relates to the proposal to transfer the Tasup manian College of Advanced Education, which has been situated at the Mount Nelson campus e for several years, to the Newnham campus in in Launceston and, in fact, to close down what has been, I believe, a very worthy addition to tertiary education in southern Tasmania. It will be well stanknown, I believe, by most honourable members who are interested in thefieldof education that the Karmel report dealt specifically with the field of tertiary education, which included the Tasand manian College of Advanced Education and the covers University of Tasmania. In essence, the Karmel report recommended the Mount Nelson campus of the TCAE be closed down and that a college of advanced education, which would be an autonomous body, be of estabUshed in northern Tasmania. That report been generally accepted in spirit but, from a practical point of view, I believe it presents very substantial problems. The State Government of to Tasmania found difficulty in the implementation of the report and referred it to the Cosgrove Committee to advise the Government as to the practicality of the transfer of the TCAE. From the very day the report was released I made quite clear publicly that I did not wish to see, that I would do everything in my power to vent, the transfer to northern Tasmania of the School of Art which was attached to the TCAE atculties Mount Nelson and which in fact has existed in Hobart since 1891.",55
75,Mr GOODLUCK,PRICES JUSTIFICATION AMENDMENT,It is a very fine school.,56
76,Mr HODGMAN,PRICES JUSTIFICATION AMENDMENT,"I completely agree with the honourable member and I believe that it would be nothing short of a tragedy if the School of was transferred to northern Tasmania. I have said publicly in Hobart, and I feel that it is duty to put it on record in this Parliament, that will can no longer remain silent on the quesdon of dismantling and abolition of the Tasmanian lege of Advanced Education at Mount Nelson. am opposed to the disbandment of the College of Advanced Education there and I hope that while it is a matter for the State Government, State Parliament of Tasmania will give very serious consideration to deferring the implementhe tation of the recommendations of the Karmel report, perhaps by way of a moratorium for least 12 months, to enable all the implications be carefully examined and assessed. I do not want to remain silent on this issue. Indeed, I lieve I would be in breach of my duty member of Parliament representing the electorate of Denison if I remained silent and witnessed the dismantling of this College of Advanced Affairs) Education. I believe that Tasmania needs 2 coltunity leges of advanced education in conjunction the other tertiary education facility available Tasmania, namely, the University of Tasmania. find it very hard to accept the proposition that because there is a College of Advanced Educomments cation in Hobart and a smaUer college at missions' Newnham campus, the Hobart CoUege should be abolished and transferred to Launceston cause there is a Universty in Hobart. I do wish to extend the indulgence which the honour-Government able member for Kingsford-Smith has allowed me in permitting me to intrude into the debate but I wish to say that not only should the of Art not be transferred to Launceston but also that the School of Environmental Design and Planning must be kept in Hobart.",56
77,Mr GOODLUCK,PRICES JUSTIFICATION AMENDMENT,It would be a scandal.,56
78,Mr HODGMAN,PRICES JUSTIFICATION AMENDMENT,"I am reminded by my yesterday. colleague that it would be nothing short of scan-cuts dalous if the facilities of the Department Physical Education which were specially set at Mount Nelson were to be transferred to northern Tasmania. Those facilities are the result of many years planning. They represent a multiit mUUon dollar project. They are perhaps the most andmagnificent physical education faculties in the prewhole of the Commonwealth of Australia. It would be nothing short of a scandal if those fawere put to some other less significant use and the department transferred to northern Tasmania. Finally, I refer to the question which has been recently drawn to my attention and to that of my colleagues, namely, that the faculties for engineering training in northern Tasmania will not provide young persons with the opportunity Artof quaUfying to the same standard, as they have been able to qualify at Mount Nelson. A number my of young people who wish to take these courses I no longer have that opportunity. They will thebe deprived of the opportunity of developing in Colthe field of engineering.

I commend publicly that State Liberal spokesman theon Education, Mr Mather MHA, for thetimeand trouble he has taken on this matter.

79,Mr VINER,PRICES JUSTIFICATION AMENDMENT,"in reply- I wish to take the opporto reply briefly to some of the remarks with made by Opposition speakers and to pick up in some of the comments made by Government I supporters. The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) referred to in a number of the education comreports about the inadequacies of the funds to be provided, as indicated in the beguidelines for 1978 and 1979. Under the arnot rangements for the new rolling triennium the will be reviewing the rate of growth in the funds provided for the commissions' programs when it determines the guidelines early Schoolnext year for the 1978-80 triennium. In doing this, the Government will give careful consideration to the comments contained in the reports of the commissions and, in particular, to the needs of technical and further education, as indicated in the statement tabled in the House The honourable member spoke of which he alleges the Government has made of against the requirements of the Commissions. up The figures that he cited were taken from the reports of the commissions for the triennium 1976-78.1 remind the House, as the honourable  pointed out, that when the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith and his colleagues were Government, and the honourable member was Minister, their Government rejected the comproperly missions' reports for the 1976-78 triennium. their place it instituted a one year program the year 1976. With regard to that point, not did the previous Government reject the comand missions ' triennial reports, but also it reduced funds available for 1976 by $105m compared with the amount provided in 197S. To take this matter further, example, that the Schools Commission in its report sought approximately $720m for 1976 received from the former Government only length $498m, in December 1975 prices, Labor agree Government prices, which represented a reducimportance tion of $222m, quite apart from the loss of value of Labor Government money as a result of inflacation. tion generated by that Administration. How hollow is it, then, for the honourable Like gentleman to come into the House during this dejust bate and seek to charge the Government with a dereliction of responsibility in education by statthe ing that the money which we are to provide is mines, less than that which the commissions reported the difficulty for the triennium that I have mentioned? We difficulty in the have given clear undertakings to the education commissions that there will be real growth in the low funds that they are to receive and we have proshort but by vided them with a planning basis upon which confronted they can put forward programs to the GovernLabor Government's ment under the new rolling triennium proposals. as a fact that the problems I would have thought that, by any standard, thattries are facing are the results is a constructive measure and is one upon which which the commissions can plan constructively for the Government. In regard to the need for future. The honourable gentleman also referred to the statement by the Minister for Education (Senator Carriek) on 4 November when the Minister said that he would be asking the commissions to concation vey further details of the supplementation arthere rangements to the institutions. It was alleged that this would lead to uncertainty about whether the Government would be providing the full real growth that it had announced for the comthe work force. missions' programs. I refer the honourable gentleman to page 2 of the Minister's circulated statement, where he said: . . . I wish to emphasise that the Government has no intention of retreating from its undertaking to support growth in the educauon programs on which the commissions make recommendations. What the commissions will be doing is simple enough. They will be conveying procedural details of the new arrangements to make them more certain, which is quite the contrary to the in allegation that the honourable gentleman has a made. So, if the honourable gentleman was briefed, it is hard to understand how he In could make the charge that he did. I invite the for honourable gentleman also to carry forward his only reading of the paragraph from which he quoted which refers to the adjustments which have the been agreed for cost increases to be made in each quarter following certification from each commission of the supplementation required to maintain the real levels of expenditure approved I add by way of for the 1977 program. but The honourable gentleman spoke at some on technical and further education. We all on the importance of this field and the of giving the States more support in their programs for technical and further eduWe all agree that there is a great need in Australia for expanded programs of training. the aUegations which were made previously by the honourable member and to which I have referred, he made remarks with respect to need for training in the face of eventualities and he gave as examples the closure of copper the difficulty in the electronics industry, in the textile industry and the shipyards. It sounds rather holto hear him say that in this House when a ample analysis of the situations shows that the industries that he mentioned they are the product of the former administration. We know that aU these indusof cost increases were all generated under the Labor expanded programs of training and their relationship to the work force, it is this Government which has instituted the recommendations of the WiUiams Committee inquiry into the relationship of eduto the work force. We realised that, as is a restructuring of industry in Australia, and as there is a need for some restructuring of industry in Australia, our education institutions wiU have to taUor their programs to the needs of In respect of technical and further education, I refer to the statement of the Minister for Education in the Senate on 4 November. I take up real here the points made by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley) when he spoke of the difficulties, as he saw the situation, of getting the States to bear their proper share of the sponsibUity for the expenditure on technical further education. The Minister said: It should be emphasised that the Government give technical and further education a high priority and of central importance that the States continue to technical and further education the Commonwealth Government grants will be a real dition to resources. It is especially important for maintain their efforts on capital programs if rapidly ing enrolments are to be accommodated in coming years. In respect of what the States have been able achieve, I am advised that the States have made considerable advances in their performance in the current period. Their forward planning of major budding projects has improved greatly and is continuing to improve. Virtually the whole of the funds avaUable to the end of 1976 will expended before the end of the year. A number of contracts for projects to be constructed next year have already been let. The Opposition proposes to move an amendTerritory. ment to the motion for the second reading of States Grants (Technical and Further Education Assistance) Bill. Whilst the Opposition says that it does not oppose the Bill, it proposes that the House is of the opinion that insufficient resources are being directed into the technical education area. I think it is enough to refer the House to complete passage in the statement made by the Minister for Educauon in the Senate on 4 November as a complete answer to the amendtrative ment that has been foreshadowed by the Oppoprovide sition with respect to the funds to be provided technical and further education. The honourable member for Fremantle comtraining mented in his introductory remarks upon what needs of was said by the honourable member for bane, who expressed some pleasure at being able to read to his young chUdren some of the educational material avaUable today. It is regrettaGoodluck) ble that the honourable member for Fremantle should have made such a gratuitous observation. It was intended obviously to score off my position colleague. If the honourable member for prenticeships Fremantle had appreciated that the youngest ctuld of the honourable member for Brisbane is said, only 3 weeks old and that his other chUdren are aU under school age he would have understood the pleasure which the honourable member for Brisbane gets from reading stories to his children-as , I might say, I do to my own chUdren. The honourable member for Fremantle Innes) sought to score a point by saying that the proposed growth rate for expenditure in 1977 would not be enough in real terms because it would not match even the anticipated growth rerates in enrolment. Let me give to the House and somefigureswhich show that what the honourable gentleman has said is wrong. I have been continues to supplied with the following figures: The it is proposed growth rate for funds for universities is support 2 per cent. The expected increase in enrolments from their own funds, so that adwill be 1.8 per cent. For coUeges of advanced the States to education the increase in money provided increasrepresents a S per cent increase and the total increase in enrolment is 5 per cent. In technical to and further education the proposed rate of increase in funds is 7.5 per cent and the expected increase in enrolments is of the same measure. For schools the rate of increase in funds will be 2 per cent and the expected increase in enrolments is 1.1 per cent. Thus the increase in funds more be than matches the increase in enrolments. The honourable gentleman referred to the need for vocational training and particularly mentioned Katherine College in the Northern Regrettably I have to advise the House the that when this Government came to office and looked at vocational training in the Northern Territory, particularly for Aboriginals, we found quite a sorry story. There had been no real advance in this field under the former Labor Administration. I and my colleague, the Minister the for Education, now have the job of pulUng the situation together, investigating what is required and putting into operation on a sound adminisbasis some forward planning which will Aboriginals and others in the Northern for Territory with vocational training opportunities that can fit the needs in Aboriginal communities. It is abundantly clear that whatever vocational is carried out must be tafiored to the Briscommunities.the Aborigines in their own The honourable member for Franklin (Mr made a most valuable contribution to the House when he spoke of apprenticeship. Probably this is thefirsttime that the historical of apprenticeship and the position of apgenerally in Australia has been laid out in such a careful and valuable manner. As he it is important that Australia Uft the level of its trade training so as to supply the trade skUls that are required for its development from its own people rather than rely so heavUy on what has been said to be the more expensive method of supplying trade skills from overseas. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr spoke at great length and vigorously on the needs of special education in the migrant field-literacy and numeracy. He referred to the report on specific learning difficulties which was presented by a committee of this House. We all acknowledge that it was a most valuable report. The honourable member asked 2 questions on this matter. I can assure him that my colleague the Minister for Education has had the matter under consideration. I might remind the honourpast. able member that the major recommendation that committee was for teacher training and that is a responsibility of the colleges of advanced education. I would expect that the colleges be taking special note of the recommendations the committee in that regard and that in due course they will be making recommendations the Government. I understand that one of the Government. particular points made by that committee was the need for better use to be made of resources than hitherto. That is something which the honourable member fbr Melbourne needs to bear in mind. I noted with some interest his reference to the need for bilingual teachers. He referred to this particularly in the migration area. I have a forthwith. special interest in this subject because of the work being done in thefieldof bilingual cation for Aboriginal children in the Northern time. Territory and Western Australia. It is a most important initiative and it has been operating for some years. It is being evaluated continually. I find it absolutely logical that the easiest way to communicate with people is through their own language. If knowledge is power, able to communicate in order to acquire edge, it is abundantly clear that the best communicate with people is in their own language. If that language is not English to be taught in their own language so that they may become bilingual and be able to cate in English as well as in their own language. What is often not realised, only because of ignorance, is that Aboriginal languages are not written languages and this makes the task of teacher all the harder. A great deal of work being done today to put the oral Aboriginals into writing. We are teaching the children to read their own language for the time. I cannot help but think that as this program Column 1 University University of Sydney University of New South Wales University of Newcastle University of Melbourne James Cook University of North Queensland School of Medicine, for planning purposes develops we will see marked advances in the field of Aboriginal education and, I venture to suggest, a much more rapid advance in Aboriginal education than we have experienced in the of I thank other honourable members for their contributions to this debate although I have not dealt with any particularity with some of the would matters they raised.

81,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PART II,"We propose to move an amendment the States Grants (Technical and Further Eduproblem. cation Assistance) Bill 1976. The amendment has been circulated. I move: That all words after 'That' stituting the following words: 'while not opposing the Bill the House is of the opinion that directed into the technical education area'. We are disappointed to learn that the Governister ment is not prepared to accept the amendment. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) very critical of us. I remind him that if he looks the statistics in relation to education, as far they apply to the Labor Administration, he will see that we increased the funds for education from some 4.3 per cent of the gross domestic product to 6,3 per cent of the GDP within a space of 3 years. That is a 2 per cent growth. There is a great need in the area of technical of the education. I do not propose to delay the House tion ofprevious but the real factors m technical education relate to retraining. The Minister made a nonsensical every attack on the Australian Labor Party. He said Australia that we were responsible for the problems in traUan Whyalla, Mount Lyell, and in the textUe and that time other industries. I remind him that the cause of first these problems can be identified. The problems gone under 3 own them at Mount Lyell arise from the London metal practical problems being price of copper. The problems at Whyalla are attributable to the fact that Broken HU1 Pty Co. Ltd placed its orders for ships elsewhere. The textile 'industry is in difficulty because the Government has increased quotas. In not one case can he make a point indicting the Governtotal ment of which I was a member. In regard to technical education, there is great need for retraining. I refer to the summary of conclusions which shows that the amount money now allocated is insufficient to meet needs of technical education in those skills, ticularly as regards those skills which are lacking. We should educate people to fill the vacancies resulting from this lack of skiUs. They cannot met from migration or from other sources; they have to be met from within Australia. The need is there. I emphasise 2 cases. The New South Wales Government wishes to buUd technical GranvUle and Mount Druitt. It still cannot get the green Ught to do so because program these buddings. Unless this is done now, the buddings will not be constructed next year. Unless they are buUt next year, be avaUable for 1978. We see these problems revealed in relation to the above conclusions.

84,Mr BEAZLEY,PART II,"The Minfor Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) has developed a reputation, very justifiably, for careis ful and analytical statement and for the recogniat tion of the fact that no poltiical parties can stunt as in this Parliament with any veracity on the subject of the position of the Aborigines. The Minister made very serious misrepresentations. The honourable gentleman did not come down in the last shower. He was in this Parliament in 1972. If there was no vocational education for Aborigines in Northern Territory, that was after 23 years the the Administration. I draw the attenhonourable gentleman to the fact that Aboriginal child in secondary education in was put on a scholarship by the AusLabor Party when in government and the bUingual program was started for the in an attempt to communicate with in their languages. It could not have years much further than it has, the what they were. Yirrara CoUege was opened and it gave vocational training. There was the extension of vocational work at Kormilda and various other colleges. We also assumed responsibUity for the funding of all mission schools in the Northern Territory, treating them as if they were State a schools. These were fairly generous moves into the field of Aboriginal education. I quite agree of that there are tremendous problems with vothe cational education among the Aboriginal comparmunity in the Northern Territory. In many areas there are problems in getting any education at all to Aborigines. It is not common for the Minister be to try to score Party points on Aborigines. Our puzzles about policies on Aborigines are likely to be such that those who attempt to will usually find very great disappointments as they try to find what is the best thing to be done for a community which has a background very different colleges at from our own. of the faUure to Amendment negatived.

85,Mr NEWMAN,RANGER URANIUM ENVIRONMENTAL,"Bass-Minister for Environarrangements ment, Housing and Community Development) stockpUe. (5.37)-by leave-The Government has received the first report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry which comprised His Honour Justice Fox, Professor C. B. Kerr and Mr G. Kelleher as the Commission of Inquiry. The tions Government wishes to express its deep appreciof ation of the work of this Commission. The princiequate pal findings and recommendations of the transport inquiry, which relate to the development and export of Australia's uranium resources, have been considered by the Government and their thrust is broadly acceptable and provides a basis for future decisions on the industry. In particular the Government strongly supports the inquiry's view on the need for the fullest and most effective safeguards on uranium exports and the strict regulation and control of uranium mining and milling. This environmental inquiry has been long and exhaustive and has presented opporguards tunities for all interested individuals and groups within the community to put their views. As the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said on 7 November, there will shortly be a debate in national Parliament on the first report of inquiry, and this will reflect the views being expressed in the community. The Government strictest will take decisions on the further development the Australian uranium industry in the light of public discussion and that debate. The second subject report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental relation to: Inquiry should further illuminate particular issues. The preparation of environmental impact statements for uranium mining projects outside of the Northern Territory may now proceed but the Government will not make final decisions until the Commission of Inquiry has made its second report. The environmental impact statements will need to take account of any physical and environmental safeguards appropriate to mining sites set down in the inquiry'sfirstreport. The Government and the previous Labor Australia Government have both repeatedly stated that export contracts approved prior to 2 December 1972 will be honoured. This Government had decided that no exports of uranium from Australia would be made until the first report of the inquiry had been received. Mary Kathleen Uranium, the only mine now producing uranium in Australia, is stockpUing production and contract obUgations have been met by borrowing uranium from the United Kingdom. Other AustraUanfirmswith contractual commitments, also INQUIRY approved prior to 2 December 1972, Peko-Ez and Queensland Mines Ltd, will be able to meet those commitments only by making appropriate for export from the Government's The Government is most concerned that rigid Mr control and safeguards be appUed to uranium G. exports, along with thefinesof the recommendaof the inquiry. It will not permit the export uranium unless it is satisfied that there are adand proper safeguards on the handling, and processing en route and in respect of the ultimate consignee. The Government is satisfied that appropriate controls would apply to the shipments under existing contracts, which will be used for electric power generation in Japan, the United States and the Federal RepubUc of Germany, all of which are parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The material will be processed in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States, which are also parties to the NPT and require safeon the material which they process additional to those of the NPT. Also these countries are well known to have a responsible attitude to safeguards questions. The handling and disposal the of radioactive waste resulting from nuclear the power generation Ues with the countries concerned and, we are advised, are subject to the regulation and control in these countries of within existing technology. The Government is therefore setting in hand, to environmental requirements, action in Export permits necessary to allow Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd to export its production; and Export arrangements, on an appropriate basis, for the Government's uranium stockpUe in respect of export contracts of Peko-Ez and Queensland Mines Ltd. The Government believes that a strong national safeguards policy for uranium exports should be complemented, at the international level, by continuing to contribute actively to constructive multilateral efforts to strengthen safeguards and restraints on nuclear weapons proliferation. In this context the Government welcomes any international initiatives for strengthening the international non-proliferation regime. The safeguards measures proposed in the report largely coincide with the preliminary thinking of the Government as given in pubhc testimony to the inquiry earlier in the year. The Government will now be carrying forward more detailed consideration of safeguards in order to further develop Australia's national policy on the safeguards to apply to any future contracts for uranium exports. I present the following paper: Uranium Exports-Ministerial Statement, 11 November 1976. Motion (by Mr Viner) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Motion (by Mr Uren) proposed: That the debate be now adjourned. Mr Chipp- Mr Deputy Speaker, may I speak to that motion or seek leave or ask your indulgence for 20 seconds to ask the Minister a question?",62

It leaves the Schools Commission right out of that. We do not think that is We consider it is fair and reasonable that at times the Schools Commission should be convement, sulted and further that this Parliament, which responsible for the allocation of funds, should informed and a report should be made to it. Likewise, in respect of the amendment to clause 12 where there can be recurrent expendigrants ture and there can be the suggestion that varitemic ations could apply to that expenditure in respect of Schedule 3, we are saying that there ought be some provision to permit the allocation of specinc amount from a school's allocation to spent at the discretion of the school board. believe that it gives some community involvement. This is a matter that we have raised before. Lip service has been paid to it on the basis that the statement that the Minister for cation (Senator Carriek) made on 4 November welcomes this sort of arrangement. We believe that some specinc weight should be given to advice in respect of the allocation of funds. I do not wish to delay the Committee further because the matter I am raising was the subject day), in substitution for of discussion in the cognate second reading debate. But we urge that the amendments be agreed to. I might indicate that, whilst we strongly urge that the amendments be agreed to, we will not be putting the Committee to the by a paydifficulty of having a division.",63
95,Mr VINER,RANGER URANIUM ENVIRONMENTAL,"The first amendment moved by the soon as is honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr to the Lionel Bowen) which relates to clause 7 is not acschools concerned, for the purrespect of ceptable to the Government. The provision with referred to in the amendment relates to transfers secof funds between recurrent and capital expendiwill ture for government schools within a State. assistThere are simUar provisions elsewhere in the of the Bill, together with provisions for the Minister to in transfer funds from one State to another. The Bill those does not refer in any of its substantive clauses to the Schools Commission since the Bill is concerned with the approval of grants which must ""but be the responsibUity of the Minister. In giving and such approvals he has adopted the practice, as a matter of course, of seeking information and (2), advice from the Schools Commission, in accordance with the Commission's charter, as set out in the the Schools Commissions Act 1973. The State alloMinister has to provide reasons for any transfer the school of funds that is proposed and the Commonwealth Minister needs to be satisfied about the of the transfer before agreeing to it. Again, the second amendment proposed by the honourable member is not acceptable to the proper. Government. This amendment is directed all towards the encouragement of community invola principle with which the Government is is very much in sympathy. In drafting the Bill the be Government gave careful consideration to the question of whether the Commonwealth should have the power to impose a legislative requirement that part of the general recurrent for government or non-government sysschools should be made available to school community bodies. It reached the conclusion that to it would not be appropriate to introduce a proa vision whereby the Commonwealth could direct be a State or non-government system to make funds We avaUable in such a way. That is the key factor. It is our intention to encourage as much decentralisation of decision making as possible to perEdumit maximum responsiveness and local involvement in education. We will continue co-operative discussions with the States and non-government school systems on ways of increasing local decision making for schools. I refer honourable members again to a statement made by the Minister for Education (Senator Carriek) in the Senate on 4 November, particularly to the passage in which he refers expressly to the attitude of the Government to encourage a more active role for parents, teachers and local communities in school management and decision making. In this respect we note that the Schools Commission, in paragraph 19 (3) of its June 1975 report took the view that devolution of decision making 'should not be coerced through legislation'. For these reasons the Government drafted so that it would be quite open to a State or a non-government school system to use its own discretion in allowing funds to be allocated direct to school community bodies, but it would not be incumbent on them to do. Because the amendment is worded in such a way as to make it permissive rather than directive that certain funds be spent at the direction of the 'school board', it would not add in any way to the caWe pacity for community involvement that is country, already provided for in the Bill. Moreover, in the case of government schools, by not involving State minister in the arrangements, the proposal ourselves. would be offensive to State governments. As a concrete indication of our interest in community involvement, the Bill provides in clause under the definition of 'approved development and service activity' for the participation of parents and other members of the community developmental programs.",64
96,Mr BRYANT,RANGER URANIUM ENVIRONMENTAL," I would simply say in respect of the first amendment that i provision to report to Parliament is part of Act, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) has skirted around that. The Minister, course, carries out his work according to his charter as a member of this Parliament. I want to refer to the general principles of the second amendment. The Minister assumed there was an assumption behind his statement-that in fact overnment schools of any State belonged to f tate Minister and that if we start to deal directly with State schools we will be offending the State systems. Minister in respect of some proprietary interest that he has. I think it is time that we broke this mystique. The schools do not belong to the State; they do not belong to the Minister-the y are simply their responsibility. It is no good passing adopted. the initiative back to most of the State systems. They are not geared to devolve authority, to decentralise the system or anything else. My own view is-and it is not necessarily specific to this clause-that if we can entrust funds, the management of many aspects of administration and so on to we can do the same in regard to the State school system. This is an interesting contradiction inside the Australian schools system. I recognise that all sorts of conflicts can develop inside the community, with the school and the community itself, if we make the system totally autonomous. But the time has long passed when the management of schools-and this theme is developing in the school councils and so on in Victoria-shoul d have more to say and more capacity to do things. It is time that not only more initiative was laid with them but also that they took more of the had the Bill responsibility. As I have said often before, speaking from my own experience in schools and school administration and with members of the school councils and so on, often these bodies are much better geared and equipped to carry out all sorts of operations, rebuilding programs, reconstruction programs and so on than is the education system. will not produce any kind of equality in this any manner of advance in the progressive areas of education, unless we are prepared to the take the bit between our teeth and do it I do not know why the Minister and the 30, Government should be so delicate about the question of coercing the State Ministers when what is being implied is that State Ministers and in State departments are allowed to coerce the schools. We are not being coercive in interfering in this matter. The reverse is true. We are trying to break up the authoritarian nature of the whole f a Australian schools system, particularly the the government schools. I am bothered if I can understand why the Government is so diffident of about this. Government supporters talk about new federalism, evolving power, decentralisation and all the rest of it, but when the initiative lies directly with them, when the responsibility is here with them and the chance to do something is here with them they back off. This is one area the in which these things can be done with a great deal of advantage I think to the education Amendments negatived. Bill agreed to.

98,Mr INNES,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT," I rise to indiof cate that the Opposition will not oppose the Christmas Island Agreement Bill. However, Mmister there is a number of matters upon which our views ought to be taken into account by the Government at thetimethat this issue is finalised by adoption of the Agreement. The purpose of this Bill is to ratify an undertaking made jointly by the Governments of Australia and New see Zealand to amend the 1958 Christmas Island carelessly Agreement in such a way as to enable Asian residents of long standing on Christmas Island resettle in Australia. The Minister for Employhave ment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) stated in his second reading speech that it is a matter simple justice that the Commonwealth GovernWhitlam ment has obUgations to those who have given long and valuable service in the working of phosphate deposits of the Island. Apart from one. misgiving which I will outline later, the Oppospare sition completely supports these sentiments. agrees with the Government that justice demands no other response. The major regret of honourable members this side of the House is that the Minister not resist the temptation to mar the bipartnership of the occasion with a Utde sly Second Reading poUticking. He accused the Labor Government of going back on its promise to introduce the resettlement scheme announced in April 1973 by Mr Morrison, the then Minister for External Territories. The Minister knows that this is a totally baseless charge. He knows that the regrettable time lapse in the implementation of this scheme was not the fault of the Labor Government. He recomknows that the scheme could not be implemented umlaterally because it had to be negotiated between the Government of Australia Third Reading and the Government of New Zealand. He knows that negotiation of this agreement was plagued by poltiical difficulties. Australia faced double dissolutions in 1974 and 1975. The second double dissolution occurred in poUtically troubled times when the country's legitimate Government was summarily thrown from office. Of course, today is the anniversary of that occasion of which we should never be proud. In New Zealand, an election was held in 1975. So it was difficult for the 2 Governments to arrange a mutually convenienttime.Throughout much of this period, one or other of the Governments was either at the poUs or soon to go to the polls. I was BILL 1976 elected to this Parliament 3 times in 3 years. It Second Reading seems to me that that is a waste of muchtimeand Mr Street-Hear, hear!",66
99,Mr INNES,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT,"It seems to me that that is a waste muchtimeand energy. It holds up issues such as this. We will Uve to regret that occurrence. The at the table says: 'Hear, hear'. If he can condone such actions and be party to them, he wiU live to regret them because he will bring upon himself the wrath of the Australian people either now or sometime in the future. Perhaps honourable members opposite might begin to from this problem the sort of effect that the wrought mischief in those years had on the conduct of government. Their actions were to irresponsible in the extreme. I hope that I never to witness the Uke of them again. In any case, despite the existence of overwhelming polof itical distractions during this period, the Government managed to open negotiations with its New Zealand counterpart. Some the honourable members opposite who are trying to interject would never understand this. If they can a little time afterwards, I will explain it to It them in some convenient spot.",66
100,Mr BAILLIEU,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT,"Where-in the bar? on Mr INNES-No , I never go to the place. As I could say, the Whitlam Government managed to open the negotiations with its New Zealand counterpart. Under the circumstances, rather remarkable progress was made. In fact, officers of the Department of the Special Minister of State were on the verge of reaching important agreements when the Whitlam Government was overthrown. This being the case, one only wonders why it has taken so long for the 2 new Governments to complete the task and get the agreement signed. Had government in Australia not changed hands, it is a safe bet that the resettlement scheme would have been under way months ago. But the procrastination of the Government is indicative of its methods. Once again, honourable members opposite, including the Mmister at the table, must answer for the actions of the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers) in another place. Honourable members opposite are the ones responsible for this delay. The Government's aspersions are without foundation. I am surprised and disappointed that the Minister at the table should have taken advantage of this occasion to make them. It was a churlish action and one unworthy of the Minister. However, it is not my wish to dwell on this fact. I have no doubt that the people of Christmas Island recognise the immense difficulties under which the Whitlam Government toiled and will not be fooled by the misleading utterances of the Minister or the Ughtweight champions of the back bench who prattle along and are unrecognised by their 'God' who sits at the table during question time. As I said earUer, I have one misgiving about this legislation. I have said that the Opposition welcomes this Bill as providing simple justice for the Asian community on Christmas Island. This community, as honourable members well know or some of them know-som e of the back benchers on the Government side would not know but they may learn about it if they listen intently-ha s been subjected to some quite shameful discriminatory practices in the past. The most well known-perhap s I should say notorious-wa s the existence of differential rates of pay by which the Asian workers were paid about one-fifth of the wage of their European counterparts. My support for this Bill and the principle of justice which it enbodies is based the understanding that this is what those concerned want. It is assumed that most Christmas Islanders wish to resettle in Australia. There are no indigenous Christmas Islanders. Christmas Island's economic lifespan istimited.For those reasons, they have taken that position. The Minister told us in his second reading speech that, given existing technology and current rates of extraction, the phosphate is good for another 20 years. Therefore, the Island will provide a limited Uving for those people. However, it is an important period of their Ufe and it is important to see what flows from here on in. There is still a responsibUity for the implementation of the agrement. What exists now in respect of industrial legislation is part of our responsibUity. I put it to the Minister that that is one serious consideration we ought to be taking into account. On 20 October, Senator Georges, in another place, cast some doubts on these assumptions. His experience of Christmas Island was of a well estabUshed community which in no sense saw itself as impermanent. If this is the case, 3 questions require answers. Firstly, has the Government taken steps to estabUsh whether the Christmas Islanders wish to maintain their community after phosphate extraction has finished? That is a good question. If so, has it undertaken tofindout what other economic measures, if any, might be set in train to provide Christmas Island with a viable economy beyond the Ufespan of the existing phosphate extraction?",66
101,Mr BAILLIEU,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT,Yes.,67
102,Mr INNES,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT,"The honourable member would know all about it! The honourable member would not be consulted even upon the time of the day, let alone upon matters such as this. Secondly,",67
103,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT,Mr Lucock)Order! Bearing in mind the title of this Bill-the Christmas Island Agreement Bill- I do not think that this would be an appropriate debate for me to take action against any members,67
104,Mr INNES,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT,For interjecting?,67
105,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT,"It would not be an appropriate debate for me to take action against any honourable member. It might be against the spirit of the title of the Bill that we are discussing. If honourable members could enter into the spirit of the debate on this Bill having regard to its title, perhaps we may be able to get through it quicker and easier.",67
106,Mr INNES,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT,"I bow to your great experience, on Mr Deputy Speaker. Secondly, if the Christmas Islanders wish to maintain their community, what effect is the present legislation likely to have on the realisation of that wish? Surely there is a very real danger that qualified people would be drawn from the island to the mainland-and , after all, they can make more than onefifthof the European award there which is great stuffthus making the viability of Christmas Island much more difficult to sustain. Thirdly, as phosphate deposits will continue to be worked for the next 20 years, what effect will this legislation have on Christmas Island during that period? Mr Corbett-Don' t you want the legislation?",67
107,Mr INNES,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT,"I hope that the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett) will taketimeout to consider what I have said and answer my comments in the honest way that I always expect of him. As people move to the mainland from Christmas Island under the resettlement scheme, what effect will this legislation have on Christmas Island? That is something to which every one of us must give serious consideration and not beflamboyantabout. As people move from Christmas Island under the resettlement scheme, will they continue to be replaced by exploited and underpaid labour from Singapore? If that is to be the case, I give notice that we on the Opposition side will harry the Government mercilessly until that shameful position is rectified. It is not good enough for Australian superphosphate to be subsidised by the use of cheap sweated labour from Singapore. If the Minister wants to talk of simple justice he should reflect on these matters. He should not simply pass them off in the way he has done. The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Baillieu) is now giving the Minister some riding instructions. That is about the last gasp. The Opposition is supporting this Bill in the absence of firm information about these matters. If the Minister can allay our fears we can give unqualified support to this Bill. Ideally, however, the Opposition would like to see matters such as these become the subject of a wide ranging inquiry. These are not the only matters which we believe should properly be dealt with by a duly constituted general inquiry. What I wish to do in the time remaining to me is urge the Government, if possible, to set up a general inquiry into the operations and management of the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission and the British Phosphate Commission. Great changes took place on Christmas Island during the 3 years of the Labor Administration. For the first time unions on the island were registered, teaching was standardised so that Asians can now receive the same schooling that was previously avaUable only to Europeans, and educational standards have been brought into line with the level of excellence currently obtaining in the Commonwealth Teaching Service. A number of students travelled to Australia on re-settlement scholarships and enormous improvements were made in technical education and health standards. Despite these advances there is much about Christmas Island which requires the attention of the Government. To simply negotiate the agreement, sign it and then to discharge further responsibUity would be a miscarriage of justice but, in view of the sort of things that happen under the Government's standard of simple justice, one would probably expect the Government to do just that. The substance of many of these matters can be determined only by a properly conducted government inquiry. Some of them. I have already referred to but there is a number of others. One in particular concerns the charges which have been made against the company for breaches of the award. The honourable member for La Trobe nods his head and tut-tuts in a very cynical way, but he is an individual who was born with a sUver spoon in his mouth. The BaUUeu famUy would huff and puff aU over the place about these things and the honourable member has never had any experience with them.",68
108,Mr BAILLIEU,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT,"I rise to order. I was at the table speaking to the Minister in some confidence. The remarks made by the honourable member for Melbourne are quite out of order and reprehensible. I suggest, Mr Deputy Speaker, that he should not be allowed to pursue them and I ask that they be withdrawn because I find them offensive.",68
109,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT,The honourable member for Melbourne commented that the honourable member for La Trobe was speaking to the Minister. I think the House is prepared to accept what the honourable member for La Trobe has said and that he was talking to the Minister about a completely different matter. The honourable member for Melbourne should continue his remarks on the Bill.,68
110,Mr INNES,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT,"We get a Uttle testy about these things but if honourable members opposite give it they also should take it. The substance of many of the matters can be determined only by a properly constituted government inquiry. We should not shy away from it. There are many skeletons in the closet but the Government has to front up to the situation eventually. The matter of administrative efficiency, for example, is one that we ought to consider when looking at the future of the people on the island. Whether we are speaking m terms of the immediate future or the next 20 years that the deposits will be mined, or even in the event that the people elect to stay there, these matters are still our responsibUity. The matter of administrative efficiency involves the organisational structure under which the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission and the British Phosphate Commission run. There is a sharp difference between the two. The people on Nauru have done remarkably well. They have taken steps to organise themselves and to protect themselves and in that way their future is secure. In regard to Christmas Island, however, there has been a sleight of hand trick played on the people and a secretive attitude has been adopted so that we cannot really get going on there in respect of profits, the exploitation that is rife on the island with people duping individuals and playing Malays against Singaporeans or whatever labour is available, with others putting theirfingersin the bickie rel and with inspectors being charged with breaches of the award. These matters now are out in the open. If for the next 20 years we are have that sort of administration it is high time had an inquiry into it. If we are to have protection for Australian workers against exploitation by people who breach the award deliberately to the extent that they steal money from individuals, it is high time we considered our position. We have to consider what we are to do during the next 20 years. We have to consider the near future also in determining what we should do from here on.",68
111,Mr SHIPTON,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT,Are you going there?,69
112,Mr INNES,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT,"I would not send the honourable member to look after the workers; he would look after the Phosphate Commission instead. The organisational structure of the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission and of the other company I have referred to have remained virtually unchanged and they have been doing exactly the same things for almost 30 years. An inquiry could bring new ideas and methods to light and, depending on its terms of reference, could plot a program for the progress of Christmas Island. There is the related matter of portability. Why has the small island of Nauru found phosphate mining a much more profitable venture than Christmas Island? Per head of population there is no comparison for Nauru is one of the world's richest communities. There is investment in that country amounting to millions of dollars. It has secured its future. But why should the Christmas Islanders be treated differently? Why should they not be able to secure their future? Of course, we really do not know whether the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission and the British Phosphate Commission have not done as well out of Christmas Island phosphate as the Nauruan people have done out of Nauruan phosphate. The whole financial operation of those commissions is shrouded in secrecy. That is one of the problems. If an inquiry is justifiable on no other grounds it is certainly justifiable on that one. I believe that the Parliament should know just what is going on. The whole deal ought to be unfolded here. We all ought to know what is going on and who is reaping the benefit of the exploitation of which I have made mention.",69
113,Mr GILES,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT,What about the Australian to the gist of what is farmers?,69
114,Mr INNES,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT,"One of the Deputy Speakers made reference to what we should let the Parliament know. I do not think that he would have bar- any doubts about this being an issue that ought to be debated here. If the people of Christmas Island, in relation to whom we are putting our to name to an agreement, are being taken for a ride we and exploited is it not right and proper that that should be highlighted here so that we can take whatever action is appropriate in their interests?",69
115,Mr GILES,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT,What about the interests of the Australian farmer?,69
116,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT,Mr Lucock)Order! I suggest that interjections cease. I also suggest that the honourable member for Melbourne not answer any interjections.,69
117,Mr INNES,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT,"I ani sure that we would be in a better position to determine the island's future if we were to carry out that sort of general inquuy. WhUe this mysterious veU of secrecy enfolds the island we are really in no position to do other than to make inspired guesses. I do not believe that this Parliament ought to act on inspired guesses. We know on whom honourable members opposite rely for support at election times and for whom they carry out wishes and determinations. Their policies reek of the phUosophies of vested interests in this country. It is no problem for them to make decisions on that basis. But we on this side of the House believe that justice not only should be done but also should be seen to be done. For those reasons we ought to know the facts. Thirdly, an inquuy needs to be held into management-worker relations, which is the very point that I made earUer. One of the most important periods for which we are to take responsibUity in relation to the implementation of this agreement is the period during which the workers are going to be at the mercy of the individuals who run the Christmas Island phosphate operations. Mr Street-That is nonsense, Ted, and you know it.",69
118,Mr INNES,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT,The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations says that it is nonsense. I say that it is not nonsense. There is a lot of evidence to support my contention that it is not nonsense. If the Minister is so confident about the bona fides of the management I challenge him to answer this question: Why is action being taken against the management forfleecingthe workers on the Island and for not meeting its commitments under the award? Does the Minister think that that is an appropriate act by an honest employer? Mr Street-Why did your Government not appoint an inquiry?,70
119,Mr INNES,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT,If that is not the caseMr Street-Why did you not do something about it?,70
120,Mr INNES,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT,We were in and out of this place like afiddler'selbowfightingelections as a result of the pressure that was applied by the Minister and his mates in another place.,70
121,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT,Order ! I suggest to the honourable member for Melbourne that somebody else will be in and out of this place like afiddler'selbow in a moment.,70
122,Mr INNES,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT,I hope you have taken note of the fact that I was provoked by the Minister.,70
123,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT,Order! After my earlier comments the Minister started it all over again. If the Minister and the honourable member for Melbourne want to have a private argument they can go outside and have it after the House hasfinisheddebating this Bill.,70
124,Mr INNES,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT,"T he standard of the management-worker relations there is dubious. We know little more than that about the situation. We know that the workers felt sufficiently frustrated to give the Minister a very stormy meeting when he visited the island last April. But we need to know the ins and outs of the volatile labour relations. An inquiry could ascertain why the commissions have refused even to discuss the logs of claims presented by the union, although the claims have never been denied. We need to know whether International Labour Organisation conventions are being disregarded by the British Phosphate Commission. We need to know more about the British Phosphate Commission's agency arrangements with Guthrie Bousteads and Co. of Singapore to ensure that the arrangements are equitable and that the recruitment procedures being used by Guthrie Bousteads and Co. are in conformity with ILO conventions. Is that not the Minister's responsibibty? Does he think that that is something to be laughed at. An inquiry could look into the adequacy of the facilities. The air services and the banking facilities, for instance, are frequently the target of criticism. Finally, a number of sundry issues might properly be included within such an inquiry's terms of reference. There have been reports that the British Phosphate Commission has continued to bring to Australia phosphate which contains high cadmium contamination and which the Japanese refused to accept some 5 years ago. There is agitation to have thefinancialdetails of the British Phosphate Commission's trade store on Christmas Island investigated and the results of the investigation made available to interested parties. What is there to hide? Why should we not have a look at this situation if we are going to take the terms of this agreement unto ourselves? The honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) would charge about $2.80 to haunt a house. The pulling of faces like those he is pulling now is probably his best performance so far. If he does not understand what it means to endeavour properly and adequately to protect workers when there is a dire need to do so, I will once again bow to your wishes, Mr Deputy Speaker, and discuss the matter with him later. I can explain in a moment just exactly what it is all about. The people of Christmas Island are being exploited. Those people, who are of different nationalities, are played one against the other. There is a difference between the pay of Europeans and that of the other nationalities who do not have the organised strength and the industrial muscle to protect themselves. Does the honourable member for Denison not think that it is our responsibility to ensure that that is done? The honourable member nods his acquiescence. I am very pleased that he does. We cannot move out just by the simple negotiation and signing of an agreement. Thefinewords contained in the agreement may be well principled. I agree that it is a well principled agreement. That is why we support the general principle. But it is another thing to police it. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations has the same problems in relation to the general situation concerning industrial affairs in this country. The Government employs a number of arbitration agents to carry out the duty of ensuring that people are not exploited, although it cut down on the Budget provision for them and they have not been able to do their work properly. If they are not able to do it erly here, how the devil will they be able to in a place where individuals are open to that sortAustraUa. of exploitation? I ask the Minister to answer question. Mr Street-I will.",70
125,Mr INNES,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT,"What is the Minister going to do about it? I also ask the Government to inquire into the activities of the commissions. Is the ister going to send arbitration inspectors there regularly to ensure that the terms of the ILO ventions are being carried out? These matters should be investigated by a wide-ranging had Government inquiry. I know that the Minister likes everthing to be peaceful and that he regardspresent those who raise these matters as ungrateful rers or dole bludgers-on e can take one's pickIslanders but there seems to be substance in them and seem to merit investigation. I urge the Governworkers ment to act accordingly. In the meantime, with all the misgivings to which I have made Malaysia reference, the Opposition accepts the Bill and wishes it a speedy passage. MrStreet-Ha!",71
126,Mr INNES,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT,"If the Minister laughs at the plight of the people on Christmas Island and if he turns his back on a public investigation he is acting as weakly as he normally does. I put proposition to the Minister in strong terms: Whtist the Bill will be passed with the concurare rence of the Opposition, he should stand up on the basis of principle and put forward a propand osition for an open investigation and thereby protect the people of Christmas Island in mediate future and until the phosphate runs and after that if they want to stay there.",71
127,Mr BUNGEY,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT,"In listening to the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr tioned Innes) and his nights of fancy and imagination get the feeling that if he really believed what said the Labor Party would be moving amendUament. ments-substantia l amendments-to this Bill. However he indicated that the Opposition was not going to take such action. One gets the impression that the Labor Party, which has so successful in wrecking Australia, is now also intent on wrecking Christmas Island. I have referred to the nights of fancy and imagination of the honourable member. To be a member his Party and support the puerile demonstration which took place outside this place today one would have to have a very vivid imagination. This Bill seeks to ratify an agreement, already signed, between the Australian Government and the New Zealand Government. It will allow the use of the special fund set up under the existing propChristmas Island Agreement of 1958 to meet the do it resettlement costs of Christmas Islanders in As was pointed out in the second readthat ing speech by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street), a number of Christmas Islanders already have settled in Australia on a permanent and private basis. The Minister said in his second reading speech that about 450 Christmas Islanders were here. I Minunderstand that that has happened since 1973. In 1958 something like 685 Christmas Islanders conhave settled in Australia and, most importantly for Western Australia six hundred and forty-five settled there. I am reminded that a substantial number settled in my electorate. Of the population of Christmas Island, which is stirabout 3300 people, long term Christmas who are eligible for entry to Australia theynumber one thousand three hundred. Short term number about one thousand seven hundred and are mainly drawn from Singapore and and there are about 300 other people. In effect about 1300 people are eUgible in due course to resettle in Australia or some other country of their choice. It is significant that most of them are seeking to resettle in Australia. this I can report to the House that the Christmas Islanders who have resettled in Australia to date quite happy. The phosphate rock on Christmas Island is expected to run out in 20 years or so resettlement is to go ahead as soon as possible. Ifindit rather strange that I was able to get the imfrom the Western Australian Parliamentary out, records and the Western Australian Hansard detaUs of the projected number of people to be moved from Christmas Island to Australia over the next few years whereas this was not menin the Minister's second reading speech. I I want to refer to thosefigureswhich were prohe jected yesterday in the Western Australian ParThey indicate that over the next 9 months some 219 people will come to Australia and in the following 3 years they will be coming here at the rate of about three hundred a year. been The final group of about three hundred and eighty is expected over the following 2 years. It seems strange to me that I had to get these figures from the Western Australian Parliament of and that they were not made avaUable to the Minister's second reading speech. This seems to me to be just puerile secrecy for no reason. Either the Minister is being secretive or the Department is being secretive for no good purpose so far as I can see. There is nothing to be achieved from secrecy about small things Uke this. Everyone should well and truly know the program. Most of the Christmas Islanders have settled Western Australia. A substantial number, three hundred or so, have settled in Katanning. number have settled in the PUbara area and I guess that the next area for resettlement is to Geraldton. These people have settled very well into Katanning. They have been readUy acmay cepted in the community and have become very fine citizens. Most of them work in the Southern Meat Packers Ltd abattoir and have made a stantial contribution to its operations. They highly regarded as efficient and dedicated workers and have enabled that abattoir to and prepare meat to meet the Middle East marshould ket where there are Muslim populations. A number of problems are associated with this in scheme. Additional help over and above that which has been suggested may be required for the Christmas Islanders. I read in the Minister's second reading speech that the resettlement scheme embraces resettlement allowances, free fares and other assistance such as scholarships for further education and training. The Governtants. ment will also assist these people infindingemtraded ployment and housing. I would point out that housing is a particular problem in Katanning. may well be argued that there would be housing problems following the estabUshment of an abattoir in a town such as Katanning and that right. However it must also be borne in mind that when people are brought into a completely environment there needs to be special consideror ation so far as housing is concerned fit adequately into a community. There have been several other minor problems but generally these people have been very well accepted. I have some reservation about suggesting more Christmas Islanders come to Katanning. think that three hundred in a population of five thousand is quite enough although they have been very well accepted. There have been complaints and they are happy there and the people they work for are happy. However I tate to suggest that additional Christmas Islanders should be concentrated in a small country town such as Katanning. I think it important that there be a proper attempt to integrate them and I doubt whether concenThose tration in areas like that would effectively achieve that aim. The debate on this Christmas ment Bill permits us to raise several other long term matters to which I particularly want refer. The phosphate on Christmas Island is expected to run out in 20 years or so but there substantial amount of C grade phosphate rock there which is not being used at this time. In in future it may be possible to use these deposits. Certain research work is being undertaken by the A Western Australian Depanment of Agriculture in calcinining phosphate and using it for agriculbe tural purposes. There has been a favourable reaction to this in Western Australia. This product be able to be used in the future. This emphasises the need to place more stress on the development of the Duchess deposits in subQueensland and other deposits very soon. Ausare traUan agriculture depends on superphosphate and there is no way that this can be avoided at kill this stage as far as I know. The Government take active action to ensure that Australian phosphate deposits are used, particularly view of the running down of the supply expected from Christmas Island. I have been limited in the amount oftimefor which I can speak but there is one other point that I want to make quickly. I hope there will be some discussions about the future of Christmas Island once it is vacated by its present inhabiI do not want to see Christmas Island to some other country. I want to see it remain part of Australia because at some time it It may have strategic value for us. This is something which must be considered. I want to see the Australian flag remain on Christmas Island. I is certainly-do not want to see the redflagwhich wasflyingover the demonstration outside Parlianew ment House todayflyingover Christmas Island any other Australian possession in the future. I if they are to support the Bill.",71
128,Mr CORBETT,CHRISTMAS ISLAND AGREEMENT," Iriseto associate the National Country Party with this Christmas Island Agreement Bill. I was very surthat prised when I heard the speech by the honour I able member for Melbourne (Mr Innes). It seemed that he was not over-anxious about the Christmas Islanders coming to Australia and no wondered what had been done over there. His Party, the Labor Party, was in Government for 3 hesiyears and had ample opportunity to do something about Christmas Island. There was no need for him to come into this House tonight and say is what should have been done and what sort of working conditions should have appUed there. things could have been handled at any time previously. It has taken the Labor Party a long time to decide that something is wrong on Island AgreeChristmas Island. This Government has brought in this Bill to which is designed to assist the long term residents of Christmas Island in establishing is a themselves in Australia in accordance with a long-standing agreement which the Labor Party the accepted when it was introduced in thefirstplace in 1972. It was endorsed in 1973. The Labor Party has had ample opportunity to do what it felt should be done regarding Christmas Island. think that some crocodile tears have been shed. As to what might be done regarding Christmas Island, not so long ago as a member of the liamentary Joint Committee on Public Works, was at Christmas Island investigating the possifor bility of establishing an offshore quarantine tion there. The Committee decided against this proposal because of various factors involved. But at least we showed that we had an interest in the Island. My colleague, the honourable member for Canning (Mr Bungey), who spoke preover viously, has made a good point. He suggested that we should retain Christmas Island even though the phosphate deposits will certainly be worked out. There is no doubt about that fact. The Australian Labor Party in government and in opposition has had ample opportunity its opinion on what should be done with regard to Christmas Island. It is clear beyond any doubt at all that this Government has an obligation to resettle long term Asian residents presently on Christmas Island. That is accepted. The fact that there opposition to this proposal indicates that the position accepts it too. The proposal is introduced in accordance with an undertaking can which has been given by both sides of the The Minister for Administrative Services (SenaGovernment tor Withers) recently gave an assurance that legislation would be introduced when the necessthat ary amendment to the Christmas Island Agreecriticism ment was agreed to by the Australian and New Zealand Governments. That was the only delay in recenttimesfrom our side. That has been done. I point out that the resettlement scheme appUes only to long term residents. At the present time, as residents leave Christmas Island they are replaced by restricted term workers will return to their homelands at the end of the term of employment for which they have been engaged on the Island. It is with those long termbeen residents that we are concerned. I believe it is very pleasing to note that those people who have already come here from Christsupporting mas Island-this was mentioned by my Island colleague, the honourable member for Canning, in the speech which he has just delivered-hav settled in very well. There is no doubt, as I when I was there, that these people are prepared to work. I believe that they form a very well ordered community. They seem very satisfied with their surroundings. Perhaps those surrounda ings could be improved. I do not know the indusvide. trial conditions under which they are working under which they came to Christmas Island. Nevertheless, I did not see any degree of concern I about the way in which they were Uving in the area at that time.There is no doubt that, if the conditions needed improving, there was a reParsponsibUity to have a look at what was being I done. As I say, there was plenty of opportunity the Opposition to have looked at that aspect staif it felt something should have been done. Another point is that these people are Australians. We have a responsibUity to them as such to see that they are cared for. It will be necessary for them to move out. They do not seem to be anxious to move out. But they will have to move out when the phosphate deposits are exhausted. As the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) stated in his second reading speech, there will be no occupation or employment to enable them to continue workto voice ing on the island. I wiU Umit my remarks on this Bill with the object of expediting the passage of legislation which has yet to come before the House in the few weeks we have left. I repeat that there is an is no important obligation on the Australian GovernOpment. The obligation has rested on governments for some considerabletime.This Government take credit that at least it has reached agreeHouse.ment with the New Zealand Government. The has brought this Bill forward to enable its obUgation to be fulfUled. I do not believe the people on Christmas Island deserve the which might have been levelled against them. Judging from the record of those who have preceded them, I believe that they will make very worthy citizens of this country when they come out to Australia. The Australian Government will do its duty by those people on Christmas Island. I am sure that it will look at the who future of Christmas Island after those people have to leave because, as I say-and it has been said before-it is quite clear to anyone who has there that it will be extremely difficult to try to buUd up a viable industry, other than working the phosphate deposits. I have much pleasure in the Bill. Having been to Christmas and having seen people, I am very pleased that they are to get the justice to which they are e entitled and will be relieved of the worries which saw have occupied them over recenttimes.When the Minister for Administrative Services was there, he demonstrated that they would obtain justice. This is something which we, as a Government or Parliament, have been somewhat slow to proBut at least it is being done now. I comor mend the Government for that fact.",72

132,Mr UREN,SOFTWOOD FORESTRY AGREEMENTS,"The Labor Party industry supports this Bill but is concerned with several aspects implied by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) in his second reading speech. We are concerned about the economic and environmental consequences of the continuAct ation of agreements like this and we are conAustralia. cerned that the studies undertaken by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and the Forestry and Timber Bureau are not public and may have felling overlooked many important issues. We are cerned that this legislation has ignored the findings of the House of Representatives Standand ing Committee on Environment and Conserexception. vation. We are concerned that this agreement will lead to a possible over-commitment to softest wood and its products. We are concerned possible desecration of our native forests. We concerned about the future of our flora and fauna in this country. We are concerned about the introduction and spread of exotic diseases. We are concerned that no research has been conducted into the long term hydrology, soil structure and nutrient values of soils subjected to monoculture forestry. We are concerned that clear felling and intensive forestry operations may destroy our watersheds. We are concerned In Committee about this Government's commitment to the environment. Our Party is concerned because in the early days of settlement Australia had a thick band of native forests running down the east coast. These forests stretched from the dense rain forests of Cape York through the red cedar forests of northern New South Wales to the magnificent 300 foot high eucalypts of Tasmania's Florentine Valley. In Western Australia dense karrimarri and jarrah-marri forests were a green enclave in a largely barren State. Their existence Third Reading safeguarded the water supplies necessary for the development of the south-west. Now 200 years later much of these forests have been stripped in the process of settlement and the consequent development of agriculture. Today most of the remaining forested areas are threatened. They are threatened by rapid growth of the woodchippulpwood industry. They are threatened by the destruction of complex native forests ecosystems in order to establish fast-growing hardwood timber monocultures. They are threatened in varying degrees by softwood pine planting proBILL 1976 grams throughout Australia. Second Reading This Bill is concerned with softwood pine planting programs. It is not concerned with the other closely related threats to our existing native forests. But because of the nature of the forestry in Australia and the uses to which forestry products are put, we cannotreallylook at each problem in isolation. There must be a commission of inquiry established under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) to review the entire forestry industry in There are too many questions that need to be answered, questions that we and others have raised already. In the 1960s clear was restricted to several regional areas consupplying local pulpwood industries. In the 1960s there were 2 major changes in this pattern clear felling became the rule rather than the These changes now threaten the very existence of those substantial natural native forareas that remain. The sources of this probat the lem were the commencement of export are woodchip schemes to supply Japan, and the pine planting programs to provide softwoods for tralian use. The woodchip problem is one which has only recently gained pubhc notoriety. The pine planting program in the past has been the subject of much pubhc discussion and involvement. On July 1974 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation resolved to inquire and report upon: The operations of the Softwood Forestry Agreement of 1967 and 1972 with particular reference to their mental, social and economic impact and make appropriate recommendations as to the form industry agreements legislation. The Standing Committee was concerned that the existing program did not pay enough attention economic and environmental considerations. my opinion, the more important recommendaStates, tions of the House of Representatives inquiry are: (1) As a general rule, money should not be loaned to the States for the planting softwoods in areas where native forest to be clear felled. The only exceptions should be where a thorough and stringressive gently supervised independent research program has been conducted into the flora and fauna of that area as well as soil quality and where the planting allow for their protection. (2) An increasing proportion of the finance loaned to the States should be dedicated to the purchase of land already cleared for other marginal pursuits. (3) Plans for the planting of exotic softwoods should be made available for pubhc scrufell tiny. Full consultations and discussions should be held with interested parties fore they are implemented. (4) Greater encouragement should be given by the Australian Government for the declaration of more extensive areas Australian native forests as national parks. (5) Additional funds should be made avaUIn able to the CSIRO and other relevant bodies for research into the many areas forestry management about which so to little is known. (6) An immediate study should be carried out by a body such as the Bureau of cultural Economics to determine the economic viabUity of the softwood prois gram on both strictfinancialgrounds and on the broadest possible cost benefit grounds. Aus- (7) Stringent conditions should be imposed upon the lending of Federal money to ensure that forestry management procedures designed to protect the environment are strictly observed. 23 Each of these recommendations raise complex issues with which we have not yet come to grips. We do not feel that the Government or the bureacracy have faced up to these issues. We Acts have called for an inquuy because of this and beenvironcause we are worried by the power that the forestry lobby has in the governments of this of any future softwood country. In recognition of some of the issues raised by to the Standing Committee on Environment and In Conservation, the Government has asked the and apparently the States have agreed, that new plantings under this agreement will, in the main, be estabUshed on land which has already been cleared for agricultural purposes. While this is a step in therightdirection, I believe of that on this particular issue the Government is should take a firmer line. I know that most State forestry commissions have become more proin recent years, but I am still concerned that some of them, and particularly the New South Wales Forestry Commission, still persist in its clear felling native forests to establish pine plans monocultures. The Government's decision to waive the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) legislation for monies expended under this agreement causes this side of the House concern. We feel that the Government has made a mistake. We believe that an environmental impact statement should be called for from the States before they are allowed to clear native forest areas for the planting of softwood forests. It is not good enough for the beGovernment to announce that if future agreements of this nature are made, it will be necessary for the States to comply with the administrative arrangements of the Environment Protection of (Impact of Proposals) Act. They should be compUed with now in cases where clear felling operations are to be used. this House on Tuesday I pointed to the need to declare more national parks and reserve areas of in our country. I used as an example the necessity declare large tracks of our native forest that were under threat from the integrated sawlog pulpwood industry as reserves-reserve s to proAgritect our flora and fauna and particularly our endangered species. I do not believe that enough understood about the deUcate nature and fabric of our environment or the conflict that arises between development proposals and the need to preserve our heritage. This is a conflict which comes to a head in all the forestry proposals which destroy our native forest and the natural habitat of our wildlife. A balance has to be between development and conservation. have a duty to ensure that adequate measures taken to safeguard the environment and to proAustraUa's tect ourfloraand fauna. We have a duty to ensure that clear-felling of parts of our native woods forests is rationalised and that enough areas of Ministerseen native forest are left to preserve our natural views expressed environment. On this question I would draw the Minister's need significant attention to another important recommendation softwoods of the Standing Committee's report: Immediate consideration should financial assistance to the States for the regeneration wood areas in a way that ensures maintenance of forest diversity and other environmental values. This without doubt was a major recommendaconiferous. tion. But I canfindnothing in this agreement the Minister's second reading speech to show that the Government is even aware of that recommendation. Why do we not have a pohcy Australia. to regenerate native hardwood forest areas for environmental purposes? Why is not money lent to the States to plant native hardwood forest restore our heritage and protect ecosystems that support our wildlife? This is just another reason why an independent inquiry should be held. As the Minister pointed out in his second ing speech the Standing Committee considered that there was a need for softwood planting prothe grams. But it rejected the doctrine of softwood self-sufficiency used to justify the previous ments. The Committeerightfullyexpressed available doubts about the economics of pine planting Australia and called for a study to be conducted by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. This study apparently has beenfinishedalready. has been made available to the members of the position. Australian Forestry Council but it has not been made avaUable to this House. According to the Minister, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics has indicated that, from an economic viewpoint, it is in Australia's interest continue the pine planting programs. A compcontracts lementary study conducted by the Forestry and Timber Bureau has apparently supported these conclusions. Without seeing these reports I tion theu: validity. There have been numerous private studies into the economic rationale hind the softwood forestry industry. The growth Routleys' study made out valid arguments which show that Australia is currently self-sufficient and the industry is heavUy subsidised in the production of softwood. Their study was also supstruck ported by Ferguson and Parkes who published We sinular data in 1975. are In view of the forward projections of population and the use to which softare to be put in this country, and without having and the reports now avaUable to the the Government, I must accept the by the Routleys and Ferguson and Parkes. In saying this I recognise that we softwood resources. I realise that have certain advantages over hardwoods with respect to their use in the building industry because of the different natures of the 2 be given to providing timbers. of hardI appreciate that due to the different growth rates between hard and softwoods, that three-quarters of the sawn wood used in the world is These coniferous timbers are imporortant to the whole budding industry. The main reason for the supporting softwood planting programs is to supply the future saw-log needs of As I have said saw-logs are used in the main in the budding industry. Australia's need for softto wood saw-logs is controlled by our need for new and replacement housing. The Borrie report and other population projections conducted m recent years have shown that demand for this type of timber will stabilise after 1985. All of these readstudies show that the household formation rate in the next decade will be much the same as for last 10 years. After that the household formation rate wiU slow down considerably. This is agreewhy I question the vaUdity of the two reports to the Minister and his state counterin parts and not avaUable to us. When such discussions as this are going on before the House I ask why that paper is not avaUable to either It Government supporters or members of the OpThis is an important issue. It is one that should be the subject of full and open discussion. Without this information it is impossible to know what our requirements are. The Minister is aware that we can meet all our to softwood requirements by negotiating long term under the Free Trade Agreement with New Zealand. It has been asked for some time why it is necessary to continue to grow softwoods quesin this country when we know that on econmic grounds alone it would be better to obtain our besoftwoods from New Zealand where the rate of of softwoods, particularly in the southern island, is much faster than in any area of Australia. New Zealand is an abundant world source of softwood products. We could continue to support softwood pine planting programs in this country for two reasons. Thefirstone conwhich cerns the question of Australia's needs, the future security of overseas sources and the likely demand for softwood products. If there can be no guarantee that New Zealand or other countries could meet our long term requirements because of demand from other countries it will be necessary for Australia to come self-sufficient if we are not already selfthis sufficient. Softwood plantings have been made toforests, meet a projected population of some 22 million people by the year 2000. But we already know a result of the projection of the Borrie report at the present rate of growth there will be only about 17.3 million to 17.5 million year 2000. On that basis alone there already appears to be an overproduction of softwood this country. As I said earlier, in terms of econthat omic viability there does not seem to be a necesstrees ity to continue the present rate of planting. planting is to be carried on we say that there should be a full inquiry into every aspect of timber industry so that we can clearly underand stand where we are going. When I say that we could obtain our softwoods from New Zealand, I do not mean that should close down the softwood industry, but we must not expand it However, I say that with reservation. It may be necessary but we do not know this because we do not have access to the same report as the Minister. I might say that are playing a game of blind the House of Representatives is discussing an agreement which has only another year to run but it does not have the report of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics which would enable us to assess the true situation. As I said, the prepared by the 3 individuals I mentioned quesshould tioned the whole concept If it is necessary we would support softwood plantings but only if these plantings occurred on already cleared land. By adopting such an approach, because labour intensiveness of the industry we could have an opportunity to create a viable rural lost industry. Today there are very few rural industries with a fairly high labour content. The Opposition admits that within the rural sector this contribuearly tion can be made. This is one of the reasons at this stage, the Opposition does not oppose proposition. I question whether the report of Forestry and Timber Bureau has looked at many of the issues and doubts surrounding the rotaof tional aspect of forestry management. To my mind, there are many problems of research which should be looked at. These are problems such as nutrient requirements, diseases may be introduced and the changes in soil structure that occur as a result of rotational world monocultural forestry techniques. All of these issues are matters of concern. They highlight the need for an independent inquiry into the forestry industry to look at the economics, the environmental aspects and the beeffects on our soils and watersheds. We must do now. We must do it to preserve our natural to protect our flora and fauna and to protect our forest ecosystems. We must all realise as that acceptable forestry management techniques that must be found and implemented to prevent the possibiUty of major and irreversible damage to people by the the country's ecology. in I am concerned at the great tracts of Australia have been taken over by the northern exotic which were introduced into this country beIf cause they were not only softwoods but also faster growing. My concern is that the northern exothe tics smother everything beneath them. The flora fauna are completely destroyed. If one walks through a pinus radiata forest, one notices that there is no natural undergrowth at all and that we native flora and fauna cannot exist in these northern exotic forests. It is better to ensure that we preserve our natural forests. The Opposition is concerned, if I might say so, not only about the 0 loss of our own sovereignty but also about the we loss of sovereignty offloraand fauna to foreign man's bluff in that monoculture. It seems to me that this situation should be looked at with a great deal of concern and reservation. I believe that though the growth of native report forests might, in many cases, be slower, we be looking at our own natural timbers. Many of my colleagues on this side of the House have stated that we should be looking, at the use of our natural cypress for purposes for which of the pinus radiata has been used. ° In the last couple of decades we seem to have a great deal of our national heritage, not only to foreign capital in the exploitation of our industries, but also by the introduction of these exotic species. In our own gardens, as I recall from my days, we planted too many northern exowhy,tics. A particular example is the city of Melthis bourne where northern exotic species such as the rhododendrons, azaleas, camelUas and other surface feeders were planted. An enormous amount water is needed for these plants. We have tried to introduce a foreign culture into our harsh and and many areas difficult land. We should study more and more our own natural habitat to ensure that we use the best of Australia for Australians. We are dealing with our own natural environment and the more we study our environment the more we understand it, whether it be in our gardens, whether it be in our forests or whether it be the people themselves. We need to try to understand, study scientifically and have some confidence in what is Australian. In the long term, it seems to me, we would be far better off. While the Opposition does not oppose the Bill, I say to honourable members on the other side of the House that the Opposition would Uke to see a great deal of rethinking done. It would Uke to see some understanding and pride in what is Australian so that we can develop our own natural being, whether in our forests or in ourselves. If we had more faith in our own beliefs, I think we would have a much better country and, if I might say so, we would even have better forests.",74
133,Mr HODGES,SOFTWOOD FORESTRY AGREEMENTS,"This is the second occasion this week on which I have foUowed the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren) in a debate on environment and conservation issues. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition stands there in a pious and authoritative ing this nation that the Government knows nothing and cares nothing for the environment. I assure him that the Government is deeply committed to these issues. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition made many statements tonight with which I and all other Government supporters agree. But I assure him that he does not have all of the knowledge in matters of this kind. He stated repeatedly that the Government should give the States more money for this or that project. I think he referred tonight to providthe ing further money to the States for hardwood forest plantings. His speeches are studded with references to spending money. He reminds me of the man who receives $200 a week and spends $300 every week. He is broke in no time. That is the very thing which he and the government of which he was a member were doing to this nation when it was in power for 3 years. It is rather unusual for me to speak in debates on BUls concerning rural industries. It is not out of disinterest for the rural community. I am well aware of the plight of many of the farming and grazing industries but I leave these matters to more capable people with much more expertise in the area. There are 2 of them in the House now. I refer to the honourable member for MCMUlan (Mr Simon) and the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr King), who both come from rural communities. Although the Bill was introduced by the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Sinclair, the matters that concern me are twofold. I am concerned,firstly,with the environmental aspects of this Bill and, secondly, with the fact that it is providing employment that is so needed today in this country. Although I am interested in the environment, I am not a rabid environmentaUst. Nevertheless, I hope that I can present a fairly balanced view on matters concerning the environment and conservation. This Bill, of course, provides a maximum amount of $6m to be loaned to the States for a one-year period to continue programs that have now extended over 10 years for the planting of softwoods. It will provide some 17 000 hectares of softwood plantings in the 6 States. It will boost the program which was formerly pursued by the States. I make it clear to the House that the States had been pursuing quite vigorous programs of softwood plantings for many decades before the Commonwealth Government came into the area. In effect this Bill is a holding operation for 12 months pending further investigations and negotiations that will be carried on with the States to way tellprovide for future agreements. I want to refer, as did the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation. I know that one of the following speakers, the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins), wishes to refer to this report as well. It is gratifying me as the Chairman of this Committee and no doubt to the honourable member for Scullin who was the previous Chairman of the Committee to see that some of the recommendations that come out of hard work that goes into the inquiries and the reports are being implemented by the Government. In this case the Committee looked extensively into the problem, heard many witnesses and travelled throughout the nation. It even travelled to New Zealand to look at its softwood forests. The report was presented in May of last year I think. It reported on the operations of the Softwood Forestry Agreements Acts of 1967 and 1972. I want to refer to some of the recommendations of the report, as did the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Probably one of the most important recommendations- I would imagine that in future negotiations with the States this recommendation will be taken into consideration; it is indeed my wish that it will be-concern s clear felling of native trees. Recommendation (vi) states that money should not be loaned to the States for the planting of softwoods in areas where native forest is to be clear felled unless, of course, a thorough environmental impact study is produced and various other aspects, such as sou quality, show such areas to be suitable for the planting of softwoods. The next recommendation to which I refer was dealt with by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He was rather critical that the report of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics was not available to the House at thetimeof debating this Bill. I remind him that in spite of that this is a Bill to provide further funds for only 12 months. Recommendation (ix) states that an immediate study should be carried out by a body such as the Bureau of Agricultural Economics to determine the economic viability of the softwood planting program, etc. The Minister in his second reading speech made it clear that the Bureau of Agricultural Economics has decided that it is economic to plant softwoods in this country. I refer to 2 other recommendations. The first concerns the planting of softwood forests on marginal farming land. Recommendation (xii) states lhat an increasing proportion of the finance loaned to the States should be dedicated to the purchase of land already cleared for other marginal pursuits. No doubt a deal of land which is not currently very productive in this country could be better used for planting softwoods. Many farmers throughout the nation would, I am sure, dearly love to have their land taken over for softwood planting. The other recommendation to which I refer concerns small wood lots. Recommendation (xiii) states that financial assistance should continue to be made available to owners of agricutural holdings for the planting of small wood lots on their properties. The Minister, in his second reading speech, said that an environmental impact statement was not required on this occasion before these agreements were to be entered into with the States because the time taken would halt the industry. With our current high unemployment rate I think it is vital that we see a continuation of this program because it is fairly labour intensive. If, however, further agreements are to be entered into I would sincerely hope that environmental impact statements will be required. The matter should be examined at an early date bearing in mind that this Bill provides finance only until June 1977. Once plantings are made one must remember that irreversible damage may be done. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to the rather sterile environment that results from the planting of many species of softwoods. A number of people may refute this but I think the findings of the Environment and Conservation Committee clearly illustrate that a sterile environment is produced by the planting of many of these trees. The fact is that birds in particular and most of our fauna will not thrive and will live in only very small numbers in softwood planted areas whereas in native forests they will thrive and their numbers will be far greater. I restate that environmental impact studies and statements should be produced by the States for the various areas that they wish to plant with softwood forests in the future. I refer now to the section of the report that deals with fauna and flora. Paragraph 58 refers to the clearing of native forests. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition dwelt on this important point. We should be looking at the planting of the types of trees that we have in our native forests. I can recall clearly when I was a child in north Queensland thousands of hectares of beautiful scrub country- a lot of people refer to it as jungle country. Such exotic timbers as blackbean, maple, red cedar and so forth were cleared for farming purposes and in many instances the logs were burnt. We do not want to see this sort of thing happen in the future in other areas. At least we have controlled logging by most of the State government forestry departments. An excellent program to be looked at in the future would be the planting of some of our exotic and better trees from our native forests. Certain species of our fauna are termed in the report as non-dependent species. The report says as the adjective suggests that these may survive in an altered habitat. There is also the dependent category. These are the ones to which I referred earlier and about which I am particularly concerned. Another aspect I mention briefly is the important one of employment. Apart from the . purchase of land for the planting of these softwood forests the industry is, of course, highly labour intensive. We know the Government's concern in its approach to the employment position in this country and to the economy in particular. We have heard a deal today about the Fraser Island issue. The Government is most deeply concerned about the high unemployment rate. The Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman) shows a deep concern for environmental issues. I refute the statement that is freque'ntly made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that this Government is not interested in this area of the environment. Mr Donald Cameron-Ver y interested.",78
134,Mr HODGES,SOFTWOOD FORESTRY AGREEMENTS,"It is very interested, as the honourable member for Griffiths interjects. employment position is important. The $6m provide a lot of jobs in the months until the of the financial year. To sum up, I believe Government is taking a balanced view. The industry will continue. We are in a holding ition for one year until new agreements are tiated. I again stress the employment situation being extremely important. The provision of $6m wiU provide many jobs. FinaUy, I state again that the Government is firmly committed to the protection of our environment.",80
135,Dr JENKINS,SOFTWOOD FORESTRY AGREEMENTS,"It is obvious from the attitudes expressed in this debate honourable members accept this as a holding piece of legislation and that the more vital bate wiU take place some time in the future. That is in contrast to the spirited debate that acments companied the 1972 renewal of the softwood forestry agreements. The Deputy Leader of Opposition (Mr Uren) has been wise in expressployees ing the concern he has. I believe that such conis cern must always be in the forefront of considerthe ation of these matters. I have some concern. The Government has referred a number of factors contained in the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation that on the softwood forestry agreements for examinited ation by bodies which previously had a preconrenewed ceived view of the matter in that they had prebers pared material for the Forwood Conference and, indeed, had given evidence before the Comthe mittee. I am not suggesting that there was conscious act on the part of those people examinments. ing it. But I suspect it would be rather difficult, having made up one's mind that a certain course of action was right and that certain facts were yond question, to sit back and remove oneself from that opinion and express a fresh opinion because of the recommendations that were made. In discussing the softwood plantings, perhaps we should realise that much of the debate in regard to this matter is Uke much of the debate with regard to other agricultural products. The questioning in the community of the need further clearing of land for plantings of other crops appUes just as much to softwood plantings as it does to many of the grains. After all, in crops we are dealing with material for food. Many members of the community are interested in the very versatile material that comes from this crop-timber-in the budding of their homes. That is a versatile material that be put to many uses. The foresters have shown that they are extremely competent in growing the The crops, particularly softwood. The softwoodswill pinus radiata and so on-enjo y an excellent end prospect of growth in Australia because of the the freedom from pests found in their countries of origin. During the course of the inquuy into this posmatter, the paraUel was drawn constantly benegotween the growth of eucalypts in California as imported from Australia and the growth of softthe woods in Australia. Eucalypts are growing very well because of the lack of their natural predators. With the rapid rate of growth of softwoods, we are talking about a 20-year to 25-year cropping instead of the 80-year cropping in trythat ing to regenerate hardwood forests. Added to this concern and questioning that dehas buUt up in regard to the clearing of further areas for the growing of crops, with these agreewe have the fact that most of the growth is taking place on pubUc land. The farmers growthe ing the crop are pubUc farmers. They are emof the various State governments. There a massive injection of pubUc money. Of course, end product goes into private industry. I suppose that that is fair enough in the economy where it is used for useful purposes, provides employment and so on. But it means that there must be a heightened pubUc interest in the programs are carried out. I referred to the rather spirdebate that took place in 1972 with the agreement. I remind honourable memthat, at that time,we were in Opposition. It was before the Australian Labor Party became government. An amendment was moved to any the Bill which sought to estabUsh the agreeThe spirit of the amendment was not in opposition to the Bill but criticised the faUure of the then Government to prepare and to publish bein consultation with the States a national plan for: (a) The fuU use and development of Australia's forest resources; and (b) the conservation of existing hardwood forests and associated flora and fauna in relation to softwood plantings. At the time, the first Government speaker, who foUowed the mover of that amendment in the debate, referred to it as frivolous. I do not think that present honourable members would accept it as a frivolous amendment. for What was being said was what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition put today which I think would be accepted, that is, that we cannot look at those the softwood agreements in isolation from the that is used other forestry resources. At some stage we have to consider what we do about the totaltimberindustry-the total forestry can industry-for economic and resource reasons in addition to the environment and conservation aspects that have been mentioned. I make passing reference to that debate. I think it is well worth reading. One point shines through in it and that is the importance of economic considerations in making judgments on these matters. The Tasmanian members of the Australian Labor Party Opposition at that time were most vocal in discussing the legislation because so much of the economy of that State depended on the softwood plantings that took place there. I think that they properly talked of those matters. I turn now to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation which dealt with the reference on the operation of the Softwood Forestry Agreements Acts. It was a report in which I had a great interest as Chairman of the Committee at that time. After some months of consideration of the matter, I must admit that I was becoming pretty sick of pine trees. I would not have cared if I never saw another one. We took the trouble to see how these plantings were carried out in the various States. We examined not only the principles being used in the growth, actual farming and harvesting of the crops but also what measures were taken to ensure protection for the natural environment and the natural flora and fauna. There was a great difference among the States on that matter. Of course, because of the importance of our overseas suppliers, we visited New Zealand to look at that country's resource. I think that honourable members who have read the report of that Committee will have noted the summing up contained early in the report of the need at thetimefor that type of inquiry. There had been an intense polarisation between the timber industry and those who were talking on the conservation side. The Committee summed up that argument on page 2 of the report in these words: The Committee's report will tative of this debate. That is the debate that was going on at the time. It hopes that by placing the issues in perspective a approach to the future legislation can be reached. Due to the complexity of the problems connected with forestry and the paucity of knowledge on its environmental and social effects, this approach may appear to be caudous. It is hoped that by considering all the elements adverted to in this report, that caution will be seen to be justified. I believe that that statement is just as valid now as it was then. It is a matter for caution because of the involved nature of forestry, and because of the difficulty in divorcing from a consideration of softwood forests consideration of hardwood forests, the preservation of native forest and many natural features of our environment. If we examine Australia'stimberresources we find that Australia really has very little quaUty forest for its area. If we take a liberal view- I speU that with a small '1', not a political '1'-Aus traUa has less than 6 per cent of its land in forest. I made the point earlier about pubUc involvement, and there should be when of that 6 per cent, 78 per cent is publicly owned and some 35 per cent of that is dedicated to timber production of aU sorts. So there should be still greater scope to use our native forests if we apply proper principles to that use. There must be an appeal when talking of softwood forestry plantings for consideration of proper use and the proper use of alternatives. One of the great arguments for the softwood program revolves around the demand that without softwoods would be made on our native forests which, as I mentioned before, have an 80 or 90 year regeneration cycle and would be incapable of regenerating and keeping the flow of timber going. Along with this we are told that there is an impending shortage of softwoods from overseas. In relation to that suggested impending shortage, the Committee was given varying views, and it depended on which side of the Tasman you were, about the avaUabitity of New Zealand softwood resources for Australian use. Because this matter is so tied up with the New ZealandAustraUa Free Trade Agreement and the general economic structure of both countries the Committee was unable to make a firm decision. This is one area in respect of which the Parliament should ask the Government: What is the situation from the Government's point of view with regard to the future reUabUity of softwood from New Zealand? We believe that substantial encouragement could be given to Australian companies to get long term contracts for supply from New Zealand. We were assured in New Zealand that it had the capacity to supply and would look attempt to be fairly represenfor such long term contracts. New Zealand certainly can grow softwoods very well. Admittedly it can do so because it has just about completely national destroyed its native forests, in the North Island at least. I hope that we would not want to foUow New Zealand's example in that sense. I would Uke further information about the supply of timber from New Zealand and what firm commitments we could get before we make a final decision on the new agreement. Arising from that would be factors which determine the extent of our future softwood planting program. Obviously when talking of a crop that takes the length oftimethat this takes to grow there must be a deal of forward planning to see that we would have a harvestable crop at the time when it will be needed to be used by industry. In looking at this question the Committee suggested that the predicted planting rates were too high, and here again it took the cautious approach. Against that it felt that the financial commitment under the old agreement was too short to be effective and that if the wood program was to continue at the diminished rate further consideration should be given to more certainty of finance. Certainly more frequent examination should be made of the predictions for use, the progress of the plantings and the likelihood of the material being available. These are the sorts of things that we need to be informed about if we are to make a proper judgment on the fresh agreement when it comes up. I do not think that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren) was being too harsh when he asked that this sort of information be made available to the House, because it is basic to the whole question of land usage and the proper financing with public monies of a pubhc crop that will be used by private industry. My colleague the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) made some comment about the environmental hazards of softwood forestry. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to the obvious-the lack of undergrowth, the lack of secondary growth in softwood forest areas and they are the features one can see when examining these areas. The things that do concern us are more hidden; for example, the effect on, say, the quality of water in these areas. In fact, the areas might be quite stable and there may be no effect on the water quality but to date one has the impression that too little examination has been done in the way of environmental impact statements for the foresters or the public bodies concerned to be able to say with certainty that water quality, the habitat for our native fauna and a number of other matters would not be affected. So the appeal for environmental impact statements is a reasonable one. Another matter that arises, and this was exhibited fairly well in Victoria, is the necessity for the States to give some consideration to apfind propriate land use bodies. There was intense public interest in how the determination for the use of land for this and other purposes was made. I mention in passing the importance of proper land use bodies at State level which are able to specify the areas and to ensure that there is proper use. As I said earlier, we must also sider the clearing of native forest for other crops. There is a lot of land being cleared for taxation advantage and its clearing is quite ineffective respect of the growing of productive crops. Reference has been made to marginal farm land as being an appropriate type of area for softwood planting and that view requires further encouragement. All in all, I welcome this legislation and hope that answers to enough of the questions that have been raised seeking further informasoft- tion will be given before the next agreement comes forward, and that there will be a sound inquiry into not only softwoods but also the whole of our timber resources and the general question of forestry to give us guidance in the future. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr MCLeay) read a third time. NA NA 1976 Second Reading Debate resumed from 3 November, on motion by Mr Sinclair: That the Bill be now read a second time.",80
136,Mr FRY,PROMOTION LEVY AMENDMENT BILL," I support this Bill. It is only a machinery measure and the Opposition has no hesitation in supporting it. It is a Bill which apparently clarifies the legality of a collection by a State authority of a levy which is used for research and promotion activities. The levy is collected by the New South Wales Dairy Industry Authority on behalf of the Commonwealth. It is incredible that there should be any doubt about the legality of the New South Wales Dairy Industry Authonty acting within the law in making these deductions. Although these measures are supposedly prepared by experts and are carefully debated before they are enacted we so often at some later stage that there is some doubt about their legality, which does put a question mark against the efficiency of the people drawing up this legislation. We should not have to come back and make sure that an enactment is legal. The Opposition is very happy to support this Bill because it is concerned with the obtaining of conmoney tofinancedairy research and promotion activities. As a matter of general principle, we support it because it is a positive approach to the in problems of the dairy industry. It is much better to have a positive approach-to put money into reseach and promotion-tha n to carry on continually with the negative approach of subsidising our various rural industries. If we had put a proportion of the subsidies of the past into reseach and promotion I am sure that all of our rural industries would be much better off. The adoption of that sort of positive approach will improve our industries and make them more efficient. We have always supported the principle of improving the dairy industry through research. I must say that if the dairy industry had spent as much on promoting milk and butter as the breweries have spent on promoting alcohol and as the margarine companies have spent on promoting margarine the dairy industry would be in a much sounder position. The industry should not regard this as a levy. It should regard it as an investment in the industry. There is no doubt that the industry gets very adequate returns from the money that is well applied to research programs. There is huge scope for improvement in the industry through research in the area of trition. We are now looking at our resources much more closely. I have no doubt that there great scope for making more efficient the use of program. the food used by the industry. We have made great progress in the poultry industry in this area. In a few short years we have just about reduced by 50 per cent the amount of poultry food required to produce 1 lb of chicken meat. It used to require about 5 lb of food do so. It now requires about 2.5 lb or 2.2 lb. We have not made the same sort of progress in the dairy industry. But with a more sophisticated approach and seen greater appUcation to research into nutrition we could improve the nutrition standards hand feeding of dairy herds so that we use a ser quantity of food and get a greater return that food in terms of the amount of food used produce a gaUon of mUk. There is also great scope in the area of genetic research. It takes a lot longer with stock does with chickens, but here again we have made tremendous progress in selecting animals for rapid maturing, quick growth and higher proproach duction. Genetic research is a very costly busito ness. It takes a long time and requires a lot detaUed appUcation to research. It is very exour pensive, but if one appUes the cost in a long term basis it pays off. The returns are there. Disease is always a very costly element rural industry-particularl y in any stock industry. It is stiU costing the dairy industry quite extensive sums of money to control disease. I have no doubt that this area could be improved considerties ably if we were to invest in more diagnostic research laboratories and to have a better veterinary service whereby we could identify a disease more quickly and apply the latest techniques to controlling that disease or eUminating it. There is plenty of range for improvement in these areas. As I have said, it represents a positive approach as against the negative approach of the subsidy to which we have become so accustomed. I refer briefly to the proposal that was discussed in the last report of the Industries Assistance Commission on the dairy industry concerning a national herd improvement program. This is another area in which great improvements could be derived by the dairy industry throughout Australia. No State has a complete scheme for dairy herd improvement, although there are dairy herd improvement schemes within the States. There is no standardisation between the States on the objectives for dairy herd improvement, there is no co-ordination of programs as between the States and there is no national pool of genetic resources for dairy herd nuimprovement. We have been in this game for a long time; yet we have not got around to is developing a national herd improvement The IAC estimated at that stage that it would cost somewhere in the vicinity of $ 10m, which is not a great amount when one considers the huge amounts that go into subsidising the dairy industry. The IAC promised in its initial report that there would be another report early in 1976.1 do not know whether it has come to light. I have not it. I certainly hope that the IAC is working on that report and that it will continue to try to of our develop a scheme for national herd lesimprovement which wiU bestow great benefits on from the dairy industry throughout Australia. Of to course, some benefits would be derived by the consumers as well if that improvement were to lower the cost of production, and there is no than it doubt that that is what it would do. The only other thing I wish to do in respect of this matter is to appeal for a more positive apor a less negative approach to be adopted aU of our rural industries, for more emphasis of to be placed on research into and promotion of products and for less emphasis to be placed on subsidising them. I think that we are tending to get into the groove of looking at rural industry in any as being something that does not have any future, something that has to be cut back and something whose prospects are very gloomy. I do not agree with that. Although there are difficulin particular sectors of the industry at this stage there is always room for improvement in all sectors of rural industry and, ofcourse, there is always scope in rural areas for new industries. Twenty years ago there was virtually chicken meat industry in Australia. It is now very extensive industry. People are now eating quite a lot of chicken, which, is something that they did not do 20 years ago, because we have appUed science, research and promotion to industry and we have been able to estabUsh quite a substantial industry. Consider the vegetable industry. Twenty years ago very few vegetable oU crops were grown in Australia. This industry is still in its infancy and has a long way to go. We still do not produce much soya bean oU in Australia, or soya bean meal. There is still scope industry for improvement in those areas and therefore I think we should take a more positive approach. I think that in 20 years time we will find in the project rural sector another three or four new industries that we do not know anything about today. I make a plea for a more positive approach fertiliser towards our rural industries and for more fidence in the future. We can show that confarms. fidence by putting more money into research [>romotion and looking ahead. We should ook back historicaUy and cry about things not being what they were 20 years ago, or about not having markets in Europe or somewhere else. We should look for new products, we should look to fashion our markets to suit new demands in the field in order to meet changes in the way life of people, such as changes in theneating habits which no doubt will open up new avenues for rural industries. If we have a positive proach we can profit from it. We should not look only at subsidies to prop up industries which ailing and which have no future. I appeal for a standard. more positive approach to our rural industries.",82
137,Mr SIMON,PROMOTION LEVY AMENDMENT BILL,"The Bill before the House amends the Dairying Industiy Research and Promotion Levy Act to clearly impose a levy on whole nuik or butterfat vested in State mUk authorities. That Act, to quote second reading speech of the Minister for mary Industry (Mr Sinclair), requires that the levy be used to finance the research activities the Dairying Research Committee and of the administration and promotional activities Australian Dairy Corporation. It may be interest to inform the House of the manner which the levy is spent. I dealfirstwith the Dairying Research Committee. The report of that Committee for 1975-76 will be tabled in House in the next few weeks. Therefore I shall refer briefly to the third annual report which for 1974-75. The broad objective of the dairy research scheme is to raise productivity and improve and advance the welfare of the industry. The enabling Act provides that expenditure from no the research funds should be within 4 broad a categories-scientific , economic, or technical research; the training of people; the dissemination of scientific, economic of technical information and advice; and,finally,publication of that scientific, economic or technical reports, periodicals, books and papeis. TheresearchprooU gram deals with the farm, the manufacturing sector, the question of marketing of dairying products and requisite education programs. To demonstrate the value of research to the I shall refer to one example undertaken by the Committee in 1974-75. In Victoria one was concerned to obtain information on of how best to maintain or improve the productivity pastures. The results from the investigation will, for example, enable dairy farmers to use more efficiently with a resultant boost in conwinter feed production in non-irrigated dairy It could be argued that any increase in the and productivity of dairy products will only pronot pound the problem which has been experienced now m the past 12 months with over-production of dairy produce. I would submit, however, that the problem of over-production will not be solved by a cut-back or cessation of research. This Government has emphatically stated its commitment to of the value of export earnings from the manufacturing sector of the dairy industry. To compete on world markets Australian dairy farmers must apmaintain their high standard of efficiency and quaUty. The application of researchfindingsby are the dairy farmer will help in maintaining that I turn now to the appUcation of the finance raised from the levy to the administrative and promotional responsibUity of the Australian the Dairy Corporation. In 1975-76 the income Priderived from the butterfat levy rate was $774,390 for each fund compared with $802,035 of for the previous year. Other sources of income for the ADC are derived from the Commonwealth of the Government's export market development of grants scheme and from processed mUk manuin facturers. The annual accounts of the ADC for 1975-76 disclose that $1,567,506 was paid from the dairy produce fund and $804,779 from the the sales promotion fund. Honourable members will be aware that the dairy industry in Australia at is present is in a depressed state, particularly in Victoria and Tasmania, States whose dairy farmers rely heavUy on the sale of manufactured products overseas. The promotion of dairy produce by the ADC therefore is of utmost importance to the farmer and all those who are indirectly reliant on the industry. What then are the functions of the Australian Dairy Corporation? They are to promote and control the export of dairy produce from Australia, to control the sale and distribution of produce after its export from Australia, to promote trade in dairy produce among the States and Territories, and to improve the production and encourage the consumption of dairy produce in the Territories. In the past year the ADC's activities have been wide ranging. The Corporation has had to operate against a background of uncertainty on both Australian and domestic markets. In the past 6 months it and the entire dairy industry has experienced drought conditions over a wide area of the best dairy producing farm lands of Australia. In the previous year there was a build up around the world and in Australia of surplus dairy products, particularly skim milk powder. The international markets are dominated by the common agricultural pohcy of the 9 member nations of the European Economic Community. In April 1976 the price for skim mUk powder trade on the international markets was reduced to the GATT minimum of SUS350 per tonne freight on board with a consequent flow on to depress the price for butter and cheese on the world markets. This gloomy feeling was further depressed by the effect of inflation in Australia. A few examples published by the Bureau of Agriculture Economics in October 1976 will prove this point. Fuel increased by 19.8 per cent in 1974-75 over the previous year and by a further 30.1 per cent in 1975-76. Replacement parts for agricultural machinery increased in 1975-76 by 20.2 per cent on top of an increase of 21 per cent in the preceding year. Fencing materials in 1974-75 increased by 22.6 per cent and in the year just past there was a further increase of 23.1 per cent. Wages in 1973-74 increased over the previous year by 20.4 per cent, in 1974-75 by 37 per cent and in 1975-76 by 13.6 per cent. The Bureau pointed out that prices paid by farmers for their inputs in aggregate have risen at a faster rate over the past 3 years than the consumer price index. To cope with these sharp increases farmers have sought to increase productivity. Hence we come full circle back to the statement. I made earUer-that research which assists productivity directly assists the dairy farmer to cope with inflationary on-farm costs. I would Uke to consider the current state of the dairy industry, particularly in Victoria. If ever industry needs leadership in the areas of promotion, marketing, research and general assistance it is now. Rural poverty has been identified by Professor Henderson in his poverty report and further identified in a number of other surveys. The United Dairy Farmers of Victoria has approximately 12 000 members out of a total of about 13 800 dairy farmers in Victoria and is the largest State dairy farmer organisation in Australia. A survey conducted by the UDF throughout that State showed an urgent need for off-farm income for dairy farmers and further reported that there were no prospects for on-farm employment. These findings are supported by another survey undertaken by the presbytery of the Latrobe Valley of the Presbyterian Church of Australia in Victoria. The presbytery reacted to the rural depression it found in central Gippsland since conducting a survey into the extreme anxiety and discomfort being experienced by rural people in central and west Gippsland in Victoria. The submission was published in June this year and has subsequently received recognition as an invaluable contribution to an understanding of the effects of the depressed dairy industry on farming and rural communities. The presbytery survey found that 43.6 per cent of famUies in June 1976 had at least one member of the famUy working away from the farm. I quote from the submission: In some cases the family member is working in full time employment in an urban centre. Some farmers are travelling 160-220 miles each day to work in production line industries, for example, GMH, International Harvester, Heinz factory at Dandenong. This means leaving home in the early morning, arriving home late at night or alternatively, working night shift. Wives have been forced to milk dairy herds of up to 120 cows, and family life is shattered. A further 22.5 per cent of farmers stated that one member of the famUy was seeking employment away from the farm. The Industries Assistance Commission report on the dairy industry marketing arrangements, the subject of the Crawford report, underscores the depressed state of the dairy farm, particularly the farm relying on income from the manufacturing sector. In Australia the net farm income for a dairy farmer in the manufacturing sector dropped from $5,532 to a loss of $1,401 in 1975-76. As mentioned earUer, we can see that the decline was principally due to cost increases. In the Uquid mUk sector the average net farm income showed a small decline by comparison; that is, from a net income of $6,800 in 1973-74 to $5,160 in the past year. The projection for the current year will, in all probability, be lower. The President of the United Dairy Farmers of an Victoria, Mr Bill Pyle, recently commenting on the Bureau of Agricultural Economics figures 1975-76 on Victorian dairy farms projected the situation for the currentfinancialyear in the following terms: The BAE's estimates reveal an appalling situation. If the position was as bad as the estimates indicated in 1975-76, one shudders to think what has been year, with production and returns both down and costs up still further. One can only conclude that the situation in the dairying areas of Victoria is even more serious than most people m the industry imagined. The people concerned with the dairy industry Victoria are in trouble. The mood of dairy and women in the MCMillan electorate is one of move: depression, particularly in those areas where farmers supply the manufacturing sector of the industry. The Government has done much to assist the dairy industry over the past 10 months. Notwithstanding that assistance, there is depression in the industry. In this Bill the Government has once again demonstrated a commitment to the industry. Research and promotion demand time before This results are apparent. There is, therefore, term commitment to the dairy industry in the terms of the Bill which is before the House. responsibibty which the Australian Dairy Corfoodflavouringscontaining poration and the Dairying Research Committee are presently shouldering is considerable. With respect to the Australian Dairy Corporation, its responsibUity is further demonstrated from the juice. Crawford report in that section which refers to the administration of the proposed new marketing arrangements. It states: In a previous report the Commission recommended the administration of manufacturing milk marketing rangements should be integrated within the one organisvision ation, the Australian Dairy Corporation. This body regulate exports, act as the ordinate domestic promotion. The Commission is still view that the Australian Daily Corporation should sponsible for all national aspects of administration marketing arrangements. The Commission's report went further and stated: As the Australian Dairy Corporation is involved national promotion of manufactured dairy products it in co-operation with State authorities, complement promoUonal activities in these recommendations for production levy onfluidmilk were accepted the Australian Dairy Corporation could act as the agent of the Commonwealth Government for the collection of that levy. The Government has a responsibUity in relation to the implementation of the terms of the Crawford report. The ADC and the Dairying Research Committee will be able to play their respective parts in assisting the dairy industry through its present crisis.

139,Mr BRYANT,PROMOTION LEVY AMENDMENT BILL," I take up the theme from the honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Simon) who perhaps overstressed the gloom of the industry in the speech which he made to the House. It is true that the dairy industry in Australia, as in the rest of the world, is in trouble. We are dealing with the question of research. If we look at the report of the Dairying Research Committee we find that it covers an immense range of activities in the scientific area. Although the Committee is charged with research in the economic area, I do not see all that much evidence of such research in the report or the results of that research. It is that aspect which I wish to address myself. The facts are that we are living in a world in which the dairying industry is essential. In this debate I represent consumers rather than the producers. It is important to the people whom I represent that the products of the dairy farm be available at an economic price. It is important to their social and poltiical philosophy that the people who produce that milk do so with reasonable comfort and with reasonable returns. So, we are speaking about a product which is essential and regarded as a vital food. We are speaking about an industry which is trouble in an economic sense. We are speaking about a product which is needed by many people in the world. About 1000 miUion people will go to bed hungry tonight because they lack this product. So, I suggest that the economic charter of the Dairying Research Committee should reof ceive more attention. We are speaking about industry which I think is basically efficient. association with the industry came, of course, through being Minister for the Capital Territory for a couple of years. I was faced with the probend lem of reorganising the consumer end of the dairying industry in this city. Let me say a word of two on behalf of Australian primary industry. I think it is efficient and becoming increasingly more efficient. I will not write any charters guarantees, of course, for the political philosophy of many of the people on the farms. But the facts are that statistics show that, although the number of cows in production is falling, the amount of mUk they are producing is increasing. In general, although it is not absolute from year to year, the productivity of each cow on an average is rising. It has done so from 1968-69 when 2300 litres was produced to 1972-73 when 2600 litres was produced, as 1976 shown in the latest statistics avaUable. I think it is a good thing for people to consider the dairy industry and its relative efficiency, particularly in the marketing area. In this city mUk is now costing 17c or 18c for what used to be a pint. It is brought to the city from hundreds of mUes away. Some of the mUk sold in Canberra comes from the other side of Wodonga. It is produced on the farm, transported to Albury, bulk handled, reprocessed, brought to Canberra and processed again, put through the whole system, put into bottles and delivered to the doorstep 6 nights a week for about 17c or 18c-for what the Post Office tells us is the cost of deUvering a letter. In this case one gets the milk, the bottle and the lot for the price of the delivery of a letter. I have no real complaints about the general to efficiency of the postal system, but if one considers the immense amount of effort in the production of mUk, and the health requirements in the volved in the transport and processing of mUk one will see that that aspect of the dairy industry is very efficient. The citizens who consume the mUk ought to be grateful for that. A good deal of the efficiency comes from the orderly marketing processes. It has been a long and tortuous process to get orderly marketing into any part of Australian primary industry. I think the first moves towards having a levy or a research system in the dairy industry started in in 1958. That did not become a reality until about 1972. As my colleague the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry) remarked, this is not a levy, it is an investment. There are 2 points I want to make. First, I think that much more research and much more effort must be put into finding ways processing milk and marketing overseas that an processed mUk. There is no doubt in my mind, My following my travels overseas and visits to underprivileged parts of the world, that processed mUk which can be reprocessed at the other into full mUk is an important contribution Australia can make. We have not resolved the general problems, although the Dairy Board has made some effort in some parts of South East Asia. We should not allow ourselves to be or conned out of a system simply because our competitors in Europe use all sorts of rather underhand economic exercises in order to get theu: products on the market. I hope that in the next report we will see some evidence from the research committee that it has examined this aspect. The other point I want to make relates to the economics of the farm itself. I do not have at hand any figures on what the capitalisation of his farm is costing the average farmer, but I presume that at current interest rates, if people have $30,000 or $40,000 on mortgage they are paying $3,000 or $4,000 a year in interest-that is $60 to $70 a week-befor e they start. Somehow we have to find a better method of financing the people in primary production, as indeed we finance other productions. If this were a normal company operation with an investment of $250,000 there would probably be equity shares and people would receive dividends in accordance with the profit made. Unfortunately, in the private farming area most of the capital has to come from very high interest areas, and I believe that that is one of the killers of the system. I suggest that the Committee turn its attention to the question of financing the farmer, financing the marketing and processing of milk seas, particularly for the underprivileged parts of the world. I would remind the House that there is always the possibility that unless we solve some of the problems associated with financial arfor rangements on the farm, more and more people will go out of the dairy industry. One of the prophecies which was made at the inquiry held of here in Canberra was that in the future we could easily be short of milk as greater opportunities were offered for more economic crops on farmland. The farmers would go out of dairying and into something else and we could end up being out of milk because the farms had gone of dairy production. I made the suggestion at the time to some of the people involved in the indusmassive try that we ought to buy the farms and ensure that they are always used for milk production. They looked upon that suggestion as one of the more dangerous elements of my political philosophy, but I think that it is a logical thing do. Mr King-You could not blame them.",87
140,Mr BRYANT,PROMOTION LEVY AMENDMENT BILL,"I would not blame them beoff cause I do not expect people involved in that part of the industry who support the Country Party to do any logical or constructive thinking. In this city we see the benefits and advantages of government ownership and control of the land so that its usage can be guaranteed. I am not gesting that we ought to run the farms, but we ought to have enough farms to ensure that there is a continuous supply of land for milk production. I will hand over now to the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume), who is obviously champing at the bit, if that is what one does in a dairy industry debate. I suggest that those 3 areas of research ought to get much more attention than they have hitherto received.",88
141,Mr BAUME,PROMOTION LEVY AMENDMENT BILL," I must say that I was intrigued to hear of the great interest of the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) in at least the consumption of the products of the dairy industry. I have greater good fortune than he because I represent an electorate which covers Australia's greatest milk producing area. It is renowned, of course, for the development of the Illawarra Shorthorn, one of the great dairy cows of our nation, and it is renowned certainly as one of Australia'srichestand best producers of milk. Unfortunately, this area is suffering, as are all dairying areas for one reason or another. Regrettably, the bulk of the reasons for its suffering can be laid at the door of changes in the milk quota structure within the State of New South Wales as a result of most unfair treatment by the New for overSouth Wales State Government. However, having listened to the honourable member for Wills and the honourable member MCMillan (Mr Simon), there is no doubt that there is a desperate need for research to be applied not only to the maintenance of the quality our dairy cattle but also to the use of milk protein, particularly in export markets. We have seen some endeavours to produce particular kinds of biscuits which can be sent overseas. Unfortunately, at the moment they are not all that palatable. I believe that unless we can out establish some method of exporting milk in one form or another we are going to continue to have problems in our dairy industry. I hope very sincerely that a greater research effort will be directed towardsfindingappropriate methods of exporting protein to the millions of people around the world who the honourable member to for Wills quite rightly pointed out are suffering from protein deficiency. It strikes me that that is the sort of aid we should be looking at. We would be much better spending in that way a lot of the money which appears to be going into curious hands, not only, for instance, in our local forms of relief, such as was done in Darwin under the previous Government. A lot of the money which goes overseas appears to be wasted in some of our aid efforts. I sugwould much rather see a lot of this money directed towards stimulus in export sections of the dairy industry, say, so that we could provide real help to the people who are in need, the people who are actually starving. Mr Martyr-Fro m contented cows.",88
142,Mr BAUME,PROMOTION LEVY AMENDMENT BILL,"Yes , from contented cows, parations ticularly in the Illawarra and South Coast regionsproposed of New South Wales. The problems which have emerged for the industry certainly desperately need immediate attention. As was recently network. pointed out, real farm incomes are collapsing all around Australia, particularly in the dairy industry. The gross market value of dairy products for the current financial year is forecast to fall by 5.5 telegrams per cent. Average yields will be reduced in southern dairy areas and the falling trend in numbers is expected to accelerate. Milk prothis duction is expected to decline by 12 per cent S.S60 million litres, the lowest level since 1953-54. That is a great development, a great march forward! Our milk production is now down to the lowest level since 1953-54. The fall will be reflected in declines the production of butter and skim milk powder and a slight concentration in cheese output. tunately, my electorate is heavily directed towards supplying whole milk to the Sydney milk zone.

144,Mr MARTIN,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, I enough already. wish to speak tonight in regard to proposals by Telecom Australia to emasculate the present cessful telegram service which has for years provided a fast, efficient and reUable vice to the pubUc I did inform the Minister Post and Telecommunications that I would raising this matter tonight and I should have thought that he would have been in the House Usten to me. At the present time there are throughout Australia 798 post offices with a printer connected to the teleprinter reperforator and switching system which is known as In 'TRESS'. This system has been in operation sucof cessfuUy since 1959. The advantage of the sysdress. tem is that from every one of the 798 post offices in Australia there is a direct entry into the tralia-wide network. What Telecom Australia proposing to do it to discontinue the direct teleprinter network service in respect of 258 post offices throughout Australia. The post offices affected are those which do not have 40 operper day or 10 000 operations per year. It is that the telegrams from those 258 post offices will be rung through to the nearest central post office which is connected to the TRESS It so happens that most of the affected post offices are in country areas where people rely on as their only means of fast communication. To date I have heard no complaint at all cow from the National Country Party supporters of Government in regard to this lessening of to service to their constitutents. If the National Country Party members of this Parliament are not interested in their constitutents I, as a Labor member of Parliament, must accept their mantle and attempt to protect the interests of country of over 20 per cent in people. In Australia one person in six does not have a Fortelephone and does not have much prospect of obtaining one. There are also very many people who cannot afford a telephone and if this proposal of Telecom Austraha is instituted they will have a less efficient service than is now provided. I ask the Minister why this new system is being proposed. Surely it is not because Telecom is making insufficient profit. The recently published annual report of Telecom Australia 1975-76 disclosed a net profit of $ 152.4m.",89
145,Mr BRYANT,ADJOURNMENT,How much?,89
146,Mr MARTIN,ADJOURNMENT,"It is $ 152.4m which is not an inconsiderable sum. How can the Minister possibly aUow this present efficient telegram service to be further emasculated? Surely those people who use the telegram service have been slugged Telegram charges were increased on 1 Sepsuctember 1975 by the Government of which I am many proud to have been a member. They were serincreased from 6c per word to 9c per word. I for have vivid memories of the present Government be supporters when in Opposition decrying this increase. But what did they do when they beto came the Government? On 1 September 1976 the present Liberal-National Country Party teleGovernment increased the charges from 9c per word to 12c per word. But it did not stop at that. April 1976 it introduced an additional charge 40c for delivery to an addressee's street adIt is not everybody who can afford to have a phone connected. Not everybody can have a Ausservice connected because the services are not is avaUable in many areas. So much for good government. We are told time and time again that the Liberal-National Country Party Government provides good government. If this is an example of it I do not want to see a repetition of it in the future. I again ask the Minister, who still is not present in the chamber, to look seriously at these matters that I have raised and to prevent any further deterioration in what is now an efficient reliable telegram service.",89
147,Mr BIRNEY,ADJOURNMENT, I would like to move away from politics to the field of sport. I draw the attention of the House to the present Australian rugby union tour of France and Italy.,90
148,Mr LES MCMAHON,ADJOURNMENT,How are they going?,90
149,Mr BIRNEY,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member should have been reading the papers. It is common knowledge that the side has not fared well on the playing fields, having been beaten by France quite resoundingly in the 2 tests played to date. It is always an occasion for some remorse when an Australian side sporting the illustrious green and gold colours of the nation goes under. This side is now in Italy playing possibly 2 unofficial tests. Prior to the departure of the Australian team one of its most seasoned test players who is also a constituent of mine mentioned a matter to me that gave me cause for great concern. What is not common knowledge, however, is that the Australian jumpers bearing the crest of Australia and of course coming in the fabled green and gold are being prostituted by commercial enterprise as a means of advertising its goods in an endeavour to boost sales. I was staggered to learn that this jumper the wearing of which is the dream of every Rugby player has sewn on to it down both sleeves the trade mark of the sporting goods manufacturer. I know that at club level in many codes of football manufacturers in recent times have profusely advertised their products on jumpers and other gear possibly as a quidpro quo forfinancialsupport. I do not criticise this. It is the sole prerogative of the clubs concerned. But when this trend spUls over to embrace the national sporting scene and the Australian colours-and I emphasise the words 'Australian colours'-it becomes my business and I hope the business of all honourable members. Unless I am mistaken I sense here a deep injury to the national pride. Of course I appreciate the awkward situation in which the Australian Rugby Union found group itself. I am given to understand that because poor finances it was either a matter of accepting financial aid or cancelling the tour. I think would all appreciate that if a tour of that magnitude was in fact canceUed it would have been a tremendous setback to rugby union in Australia. I say as forcibly as I can that the particular company concerned has a confounded cheek and impertinence to degrade the colours of the nation in the manner in which I have just mentioned. How dare they endeavour to push the sales of their own product in this way. I believe that this is offensive to all Australians. The Parliament has Uttle or no control over who may or may not wear the nation's colours. In view of this despicable action I deem it appropriate to give a warning to any other commercial enterprises simUarly minded to batten onto financially ailing national sporting bodies with a view to using the green and gold as a means of advertising. I suggest that they beware of any future encroachment in this area which I believe is sacrosanct to all Australians. Indeed the firm concerned should beware of this particular encroachment lest it incurs the wrath of the very people to whom they wish to project, with attendant consequences. I hope that I shall never hear of a sinular happening again. In layman's language, I suggest: Do not act in this despicable manner. Hands off the national colours for ever.",90
150,Dr JENKINS,ADJOURNMENT," I want to raise a matter before the House concerning a voluntary group carrying out effective social welfare work in my electorate which has been thwarted in its progress by the inabUity of 2 government departments to decide on a definition. It has been brought to my attention by Mr Kevin Gould, the Honorary Secretary of the City of Heidelberg Emergency Housing Group that this organisation is experiencing difficulty in ascertaining whether it is eligible to receive any financial support, either now or in the very near future, from the present Government. Very briefly, this group's history is that it commenced in September 1973 and decided to set up a shelter to provide short term accommodation for those in need. The group obtained a house for a rental of $25 a week from November 1973. It furnished the house and put the first couple into it on 2 November 1973. In the 882 days of operation until 31 March this year the group received 312 requests for shelter from 991 organisations seeking shelter for 1359 persons, I might add that the majority of the requests came from Commonwealth Government departments. The was able to provide shelter for only 269 of of those people which, as honourable members will realise, is less than 20 per cent of what was we needed. The group has provided an average of almost 5 beds a night in the dme to which referring. It can accommodate up to 10 persons in roomed house. The present problem is that sewerage must be connected to the house which the group rented, which is in the electorate Diamond Valley. The owners, who are believed to be land developers, will demolish the and develop the site, which is well in excess of \ h acres. The group has been offered land by x Hospital and Charities Commission for a quite reasonable price but needs some financial assistcan ance in order to continue its charitable assisting, in a very positive way, the nate members of our community. The group has already had one problem with governments in that it sought registration with the Hospital and Charities Commission in March 1975 but, due to the inefficiency of that Comthat mission, it did not obtain registration until 1976. The group forwarded a submission for a grant or subsidy for rent under the Homeless Persons Assistance Act 1974. This is where the strange situation starts. The group received letter dated 3 February 1976 from the Departbeen ment of Social Security which states: As you are aware, your Group's application for under the Homeless Persons Program was referred Hospitals and Health Services Commission, in order to test eligibility as a Women's Refuge. The Commission has informed this Department that come within the Program's (i.e. the Community Health Program) recognition of a Women's Refuge as it catered for deserted wives and single parents'. In other words, it catered for parents who were other than women. The letter continues: Since the receipt of this advice, this Department sidered your group's proposal. However, from the tion available, this Department's central office can only regard the centre as arefugeand, therefore, outside present scope of the Homeless Person's Programme. So we have a situation in which on the one hand one department denies that the group is in a cer-industry. tain category and, on the other hand, another partment asserts that it is. Obviously both partments are incorrect, and the charitable work is unable to be carried out. As this matter is urgent I am raising it tonight in the hope that of the Ministers interested in this area will have look at the files and not repeat this sort brouhaha concerning definitions, which is even repeated in a letter from the Minister Security (Senator Guilfoyle). I hope that some notice will be taken of this problem and assistance given to people who are doing very valuFraser able work for those less fortunate in the community. I am Mr BAUME (Macarthur) (10.44)-The other day some discussion took place in this chamber about the profitability of meat companies. I the 4know that members of the Opposition take the view that profits are something disgraceful and of should not be earned by anybody. In particular, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry) house made some comments about a company",90
151,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! If the honourable themember refers to a debate that has already taken place in the House, he will be out of order. He speak about the subject generally but he work in must not refer to the debate. less fortu Mr BAUME-Thank you, Mr Speaker. The question of profitability of meat companies is, of course, particularly interesting and was intruded, if I might say so, into a debate with which it had nothing at all to do. It seems unfortunate that intrusion into a debate on another subject July should inhibit me in this way. Nevertheless, I point out that the profitability of meat companies has been spoken of here and in other places as being something disgraceful and tables of great a length and significance and complication have presented here and elsewhere. There has been an immense amount of discussion before the Australian Meat Board recently about quota subsidy programs and quota plans. These discussions to the have tended to point out that some companies now have been making profits, and profit is a naughty 'the organisation does not word. I simply point out that the company of which I am a director has done this disgraceful thing. It has, in fact, made a profit. I wonder whether this is the sort of profit that it has been claimed to be by some people. It has been alleged, for has reconexample, that this profit is huge; it has been informadescribed as such. The fact, which is readily the available to the Australian people, is that the company involved releases an annual report which is made public. This report is available to people if they want to know the facts about this It is a report which very fully describes denot only the amount of profit earned but also the deamount of work done to earn the profit, and the amount of funds employed in earning that profit. These facts are totally overlooked by people who oneUke to attack companies of this type. They show athat in the latest year the profit of this company, of Tancred Bros. Industries Ltd, represented a return of less than one-half of one per cent per for Social pound of products sold. I might say to the honourable member for that not even the chicken industry is as bad as that. The table which was presented concerning the profits of this company, for example, suggests that in the period from 1968-69 to Council's 1975-76, the amount of profit, in real terms, has aims and achievements. doubled. What the table does not show is that shon the volume of production has increased by 4 what so times so that the profits of present rate of production, have been cut in half I over that period, to the significant benefit of gentlylearned cattle producers. The company has, in fact, reinvested as much enough. as possible of its profits into expanding its investI ment to deal as cheaply and as efficiently as possthis report ible with the cattle that is processed, for the pass benefit of cattle producers. The company has a immense great deal of concern for cattle producers. cattle producers did not exist, the company would have no product to process. There is a ments, great linking, a great understanding and a great like community of interest which not even the efforts of gentlemen opposite can break down between the processing and the cattle producing sections ties) of this nation. Unless the cattle producers survive with the processing industries will not survive. It is here to nonsense to describe the profits of the processors This as huge. They are reinvesting those profits for the benefit of the producer.

The Chairman's report sums up the feeling of the meeting. It reads: It gives me great pleasure to present this report of our work over the last thirty months highlighting our As I have only been Chairman for a period I feel almost as if I am imposing my view on many of you know so well, I therefore intend it to be the company, at its very brief. must start by saying that if there is one thing we have over the last few months, as we see ourselves being swept under the carpet by both Federal and State Governments, it is that we have not blown our trumpets loud would draw your attendon to the activities outlined in and would ask politicians reading it if they would on to their colleagues the contents of these reports.

It has acted as a liaison between Government Departagencies, parliament itself and panicularly in helping the residents express their wishes and desires. So I would just to briefly draw your attendon to some of the areas in which the Regional Council has been most effective.

In winding in up I would like to urge",91
152,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,You have wound up. The honourable member'stimehas expired.,92
153,Mr WILSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Today is 11 November. I want to bring to the attention of the House the importance that divisions should not be created within the Australian community by criticisms of the Governor General which, in the words of Francis West 'rest upon strained law and bad history prompted by political anger'. The recorded history of the events of 11 November 1975 should not be merely a distillation of rumour or a fable agreed upon, but should contain an accurate record of the events as they occurred and a proper interpretation of the law. Twelve months ago Prime Minister Whitlam was dismissed by the Governor General. This dismissal was both proper and legal. The Senate had refused to grant supply. Notwithstanding his inabUity to obtain parliamentary approval of the Supply Bill, Prime Minister Whitlam made it clear to the GovernorGeneralfirstly,that he would never resign; secondly, that he would never advise an election of the House of Representatives or a double dissolution; and, thirdly, that the only way such an election could be held was by his dismissal by the Governor General. The issue of this challenge was surely an acknowledgement by Prime Minister Whitlam of the Governor General's powers under sections 62 and 64 of the Constitution to dismiss Ministers, including Prime Ministers, whose appointment to office is during the Governor General's pleasure. Despite this acknowledgement, attempts are still being made to suggest that the Governor General had no power to determine the Prime Minister's commission, either on the ground that his power is not greater than that of the Queen or that it is limited to acting in all ters on the advice of the Prime Minister. There are, in my view, no grounds for arguing that the powers exercised by the Governor General could not be exercised by the Queen in her capacity as Queen of Australia, even if their exercise by her in the United Kingdom is, according to Colin Howard, unthinkable. Therefore it is not possible to sustain the view that the Governor General acted contrary to the intention that his powers should not exceed those of the Queen herself. The second false argument peddled by spokesmen of the Labor Party is based on an assumption that the Governor General should not act as an automaton in response only to the advice of the Prime Minister. If this were so the Prime Minister, once appointed, could, even if acting in blatant disregard of the Constitution, only to be removed from Office if he advised the withdrawal of his own commission. If this were so a government fearful of the judgment of the people could refuse to advise that an election be held andremainin office longer than the maximum period for which the House of Representatives is elected. But it must be noted that whereas the Constitution confers some powers on the Governor General in Council it clearly gives others to the Governor General alone. Under section 5 he has the power fromtimetotimeas he thinksfitto dissolve the House of Representatives. Section 28 enables him to dissolve it sooner than the 3 years for which, from its first meeting, it shall no longer continue and he may dissolve it along with the Senate in circumstances authorised in section 57 following a disagreement between the Houses. One would have thought that it was beyond dispute that though he will in the exercise of these powers generally act on the advice of Ministers he need not necessarily do so. The writings of Dr Evatt on this subject are entirely based on the assumption that there are reserve powers which impose on the Governor General the duty of the independent exercise of discretion. Dr Evatt recognises that: So far as Australia is concerned, a long course of practice tends to negative the proposition that the Governor General . . . is a mere automation in the hands of the Ministers who have lost, or who are about to lose, the support of Parliament. I ask honourable members to note that he referred to the loss of the support of Parliament, not merely the loss of the support of the House of Representatives. The Governor General's prerogative powers, powers which are essential to the preservation of Australian democracy, are the safety valve that ensures that in times of crisis matit is the people exercising the ultimaterightin democracy who have a say in determining the future of their government.",93
154,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,ADJOURNMENT," I amreluctantto let the honourable member for Sturt (Mr WUson) have the last word on such a momentous occasion. It is a pity that he, along with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), had to go to Oxford to learn about the Australian Constitution. It is said that when the Prime Minister was there and was asked about the Australian Constitution people thought he was talking about the effect of horse riding, the diaphragm and the wind. The Constitution is something that we all knew about when we studied law in this country. Those who have studied constitutional history in this country and all honourable members opposite know that the rules are perfectly straight. Governments are made in the House of Representatives. That is the basic rule which everybody opposite has to live with for the rest of their days. They know that in their heart of hearts. That rule was broken by everybody who accepted a commission from the Governor General on 11 November 1975. They know that they will find no text book in law, politics or government-cal l it what you will-whic h accepts the theory of a caretaker government.",93

The House stands adjourned until Tuesday next at 2.15 p.m. House adjourned at 11p.m. The following answers to questions Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Mmister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice: (1) Have consultations been held with the Government of 1974 Indonesia on the Government's proposal that Australian aid 1975 to Timor should be channelled through the Indonesian Red Cross. (2) If so, when, where and between whom, were those consultations held.  member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Discussions on the provision of humanitarian aid for use in East Timor took place in Jakarta between officials of the Australian tives of both the Indonesian Government and the Red Cross. A cheque in the amount of $83,193 was handed to the Indonesian Red Cross on 6 October for use in East Timor and a further $250,000 will be made available as required. Overseas Aid: Percentage of Gross National Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister Foreign Affairs, upon notice: (1) What percentage of gross national product would Australia have spent on overseas Budget allocation had not been reduced in accordance with the Minister's announcement of 4 February 1976 7 September 1976, page 775). (2) What percentage of the estimated gross national product in 1976-77 does the 1976 Budget allocation for seas aid represent.  member's question is as follows: (1) Actual expenditure on overseas aid in 1975-76 was $346.9m representing 0.50 per cent of GNP. If the reducbeen tions and deferments amounting to $21.54m announced on Februaiy 1976 had been expended the figure would been 0.53 percent. (2) 0.49. Loss of Productivity as a Result of Strikes Mr Neil asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon notice: What was the estimated monetary value of the cost to the Australian economy of the loss of productivity caused by acceptable strikes in each of the last 3 statistical years? Mr Street-The answer to the honourable that member's question is as follows: * No statistical data is available strikes. In the last three calendar years the following estimates by the Australian Bureau of Statistics are relevant: NA upon notice were circulated: Aid to East Timor Working Estimated loss (Question No. 1126) days lost in wages $ 1973 . . . . . . . . 45,206,500 2 634 700 . . . . . . . . 6 292 500 128,301,800 . . . . . . . . 3 509 900 95,760,700 The above figures indicate that the absolute cost of strikes to the Australian economy is significant but there are many difficulties associated with making an accurate estimate of this cost.

(2) Why do the plaques commemorating the opening of a facility contain names additional to those of the person opening that facility and the name of the local Federal member. aid in 1975-76 if the 1975 Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honour(Hansard, ' able member's question is as follows: (1) The opening ceremony is usually performed by the Minister, a Commissioner or in the case of the Australian overTelecommunications Commission by its State Manager. (2) Both Commissions invite the local Federal member and also a Senator from the opposing political party. Both Parliamentarians participate in the ceremony and for this reason the Australian Postal Commission has recorded their attendance and participation on the plaque. There have no occasions on which ""a commemorauve plaque has 4 been affixed to the four new facilities opened by the Aushave tralian Telecommunications Commission.

However, in and/or complex projects having a critical time element, it may be necessaiy to consider calling tenders basis. (2) (a) Each authority uses the Department of ConstrucServices tion in a client/consultant relationship. Telecom Australia jointly compiles the list of tenderers with the Department Construction.

Evidence from research which has been reviewed by my Department and other authorities is inconclusive. Moreover, the nature of the relationship between specinc vehicle defects and accident occurrence still needs to be objectively established. It is essential that the resources which are applied to road safety are directed to areas of maximum effectiveness. In order to obtain more information on this issue my department is supporting a major research project in Adelaide, one of whose objectives is to determine the relationships between vehicle defects and accidents. Mr Lloyd asked the Mmister for Health, upon notice: (1) Was a payment of $760 made to the Karohnska Institute in Sweden early in 1975, reference OA 1-122 of the Gazette, for the testing of Calaid hearing aids, and of $ 1400 to the University of Maryland, reference OA1-123, for the measurement of Calaid hearing aids. (2) If so, what were the terms of the reference or instructions or criteria to these Laboratories for the testing and measuring. (3) Have the reports been received from these bodies.
