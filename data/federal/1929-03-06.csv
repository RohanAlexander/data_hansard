Commonwealth Government. view of that authoritative statement,, the Prime Minister take action, similar to that taken against the Timber Workers' Union, against the owners who have thrown 12,000 miners out of employment?",11
5,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,One of the things that makes necessary immediate action to improve the state of the coal-mining industry is the intermittency of employment. It is definitely established that very many men get only a few days' work per fortnight.,11
6,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Mr Bavin referred to the men who are in work.,11
7,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"I have discussed this matter with Mr Bavin several times, and am quite certain that he has not sugthat a eoal-miner in regular employment does not receive the basic wage. The trouble is that, although the daily wage is sufficient to ensure the regularly employed worker a weekly return at least equal to the basic wage, the intermittency of employment is such that the earnings of many men are below that standard. The object of the proposals of the Commonwealth and New South Wales Governments is, by increasthe output to increase also the number of days per fortnight that each mau can work, and thus assure to all at least the basic wage. With regard to the second part of the honourable member's question, I stated yesterday that the Governwill take all steps necessary to ento the coalforce Commonwealth laws.",11

It the Matson Navigation Company is prepared to carry the fruit freight free, farther shipments will be sent regularly. If the Government is not prepared to allow the children of Australia to have good bananas at a cheap price, will the Minister for Trade and Customs allow the gift bananas for the hospitals to be admitted free of duty?",12

16,Mr BRUCE,VISIT OF OVERSEAS SHIPPING,"Recently a board was appointed of representatives of all the big exporting primary industries of Australia, such as wool, wheat, mutton, beef, dairy produce, processed fruits, and so on.

21,Mr BRUCE,SETTLERS IN CENTRA L,"The first part of the honoraible member's question was apparently designed to convey some information to me. The second part of it was an inquiry as to whether I was aware of how much, if any, research work honourable members opposite had done on a certain subject. I have not the slightest idea.

The Prime Minister informed us subsequently that inquiries had been made through the Premier of South Australia.

Seeing that this report was made on the recommendation of a joint committee of this Parliament, does not the Prime Minister think that it should be made available to honourable members immediately?

This report was described as scathing, and I submit that honourable members should be informed of its contents.",13

CANBEEEA. NA BLOCK. Mr C. EILEY - Some time ago, I asked that the whole of the papers relating to the foundations of the administrative offices be laid upon the table of the House. Some papers were laid on the table, and on examining them. I found that a number of important documents had not been included in the file.

What sum has been contributed for the above purpose by (a) the British-Australasian Tobacco Company; (6) the Commonwealth Government; and (c) the State Governments?",15
33,Mr BRUCE,EEPEESENTATIV E FOE TH E,"The replies to the h o orahle member's questions are as f o l l o w : 1. In August, 1920, the representative of the British-Australasian Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited, when giving evidence before the Tariff Board, made an offer on behalf of the company to provide a sum up to Â£50,000 for expenditure in conjunction with the Commonwealth and/or State Governments on a Â£ for Â£ basis for the development of the tobacco-growing industry in Australia. The Development and Migration Commission and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research subsequently discussed this offer with the company, with the result that a definite proposal was submitted by the company and agreed to by the Commonwealth Government. The arrangement is that over a period of three years, the company will find Â£20,000 rateably with the sum of Â£10,000 to be found by the Commonwealth and/or State Governments for the purpose of carrying out investigations and field experiments. If , at the expiration of the three-year period, developments are sufficiently satisfactory to warrant further effort, and it is mutually agreed that further expenditure is justified, the company will provide a further Â£30,000 conditionally upon the Commonwealth and/or State Governments providing a similar amount. The total amount that may be applied to this work is, therefore, Â£90,000. The Commonwealth Government has made au arrangement with the Governments of the live mainland States, under which it is provided that, over the first period of three years, the Commonwealth wil l find Â£5,000 and each State Â£1,000, and over the second period the Commonwealth Â£15,000 and each State Â£3,000. Under the terms of the agreement, an executive committee to control the policy and general direction of the investigation was constituted, and it was agreed that the contributing State should nominate the Directors of Agriculture, or such other officers deemed suitable, to act as an advisory committee. It was also a condition of the agreement that the executive committee should consist of a representative of the Development and Migration Commission, a representative of the Executive of the Council For Scientific and Industrial Research, and a third member to be jointly appointed by these two bodies. The investigation will cover the whole field of the economic production of tobacco in Australia. 2. (a) Experimental work has been started in each of the mainland States of the Commonwealth, and it is hoped to obtain as rapidly as possible, data on the cured leaf qualities of the tobacco grown in many widely separated districts of Australia. This is what is called exploratory work. In addition, a considerable variety of work is already under way dealing with time of planting, 'methods of handling seed-beds, variety tests, field cultural methods, methods of harvesting and curing, and so forth . Investigations are also in progress in regard to overcoming the Blue Mould disease, one of the most serious troubles with which the Australian tobacco-grower has to contend. (6) By the Australian Tobacco Investigation in conjunction and in co-operation with the various n - State Departments of Agriculture, (c) The experiments are obviously of such nature as to make it impossible to achieve definite results within the short period in which they have been conducted, but, nevertheless, much valuable data are being collected and in some instances favourable and hopeful indications are manifesting themselves. 3. (a), (6) and (c ) . The total amount contributed to the Tobacco Investigation Fund up to the present is Â£12,000, of which the British-Australasian Tobacco Company has provided Â£8,000 and the Commonwealth and State Governments Â£4,000.",15

What was the total amount of interest that was paid and subsequently deducted from the purchase price? 3. Is it a fact that had the Government consented, in the first instance, to finance the private sale of houses, many public servants could have obtained higher prices for their property and would not have lost twelve months' interest as well?",17
46,Mr ABBOTT,EEPEESENTATIV E FOE TH E,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The arrangement made by the Government for the purchase of officers' homes in Melbourne contained a condition that the officer must undertake to build or purchase and reside in a home in Canberra within twelve months after his arrival in the Territory. The arrangement further stipulated that, if the officer did not fulfil this undertaking the amount held on his behalf in the Canberra building account would be refunded to him, after the expiration of twelve months from the date of his arrival in Canberra, less the amount of interest already paid thereon. It is not proposed to alter these conditions of the arrangement. 2. Â£642 18s. 7d. 3. It is a fact that under the scheme of sale by private treaty some officers have obtained higher prices for tlieir homes than the Government valuations. It is impossible to state at this stage whether it is a fact that, if the scheme of sale by private treaty had been in force when the officers of the first wave were transferred to Canberra, higher prices would have been realized. Officers who take advantage of the scheme of sale by private treaty are bound by the undertaking to build or purchase and reside in a home in Canberra in a similar Â£ s. d. manner to officers who accept the Government's valuation If they do not fulfil this undertaking they are not paid interest on the money held in the Canberra building account.",17

Can the number of officers with State rights in respect of service in Western Australia, who up to date have not transferred such rights to the Superannuation Board, be 4. Having regard to the scattered locations of the officers in the Commonwealth Service in Western Australia, and of the difficulty in obtaining satisfactory and assuring information regarding the provisions of the Superannuation Act, why were these officers not allowed a longer period than twelve months in which to make their choice? 5. If officers declined to transfer their State rights to the board in 1923, owing to the prospective pensions and benefits, then actuarially calculated, seeming too low, would there be any serious objection to the calculation of these benefits being made at the time of retirement, or at death prior thereto, when the actual, and not speculative, position concerning salary, length of service, dependants, &c, would be definitely known? 6. In view of the intention of the Government to amend the Superannuation Act in certain directions, will it consider the advisability of amending the sections concerning the transfer of State rights, so as to enable those officers with such rights, who declined to come under the provisions of that act, to now do so, and, also, of making the valuation of these rights at the expiry of service instead of at the date of transfer to the board?",17

78,Mr FORDE,NATIVE TROUBLE INNE W,"the Prime Minister, upon noticeBALLASTING . 1. Has he perused the following report in the Sydney Morning Herald of the Sth instant:-""Comment has been caused in federal circles on the fact that the terms of reference to Brigadier-General Griffiths, who has undertaken an investigation into disorders among natives in New Guinea, have been restricted. The terms, as framed by the Administrator of the Mandated Territory (Brigadier-General Wisdom) limit the investigation to 'matters relating to mass meetings of natives that occurred at the Roman Catholic and Methodist Mission Stations at Malaguna on 2nd and 3rd January, including the origin and causes of the meetings.' Under the Commissions of Inquiry Ordinance of New Guinea the Administrator of the Territory is empowered to issue commissions for inquiries, and in the present case the investigation was ordered by him. It was understood when the inquiry was announced that it would embrace consideration of the dissatisfaction existing among white residents in consequence of tlieir relations with the Administration. A further request has been made recently from New Guinea for on examination of that aspect. ""1 2. (a) Is it a fact that the white residents of the Territory communicated with the Prime Minister shortly after the rising of the natives at Rabaul asking for the removal of the acting secretary to the Administrator and Mr Walstab, and that the Prime Minister stated that nothing would be done pending an inquiry? (Zi) Are the residents justified in assuming that the Prime Minister, by inference, gave them to understand that a full inquiry would be held into the whole matter, embracing consideration of the dissatisfaction existing among white residents in consequence of their relations with the Administration? 3. (a) Did the Prime Minister intend to allow the Administrator of the Mandated Territory, an interested party, to restrict the nature of the inquiry to matters relating to mass meetings of natives on the 2nd January, while the white population desired a full inquiry into the dissatisfaction existing among white residents in consequence of their relations with the Administration? (b) As the Administrator is an interested party and is directly responsible for the administration of the Territory, will the Prime Minister take steps to widen the scope of the inquiry to embrace consideration of all matters causing dissatisfaction among the white residents in consequence of tlieir relations with the Administration?",22
79,Mr BEUCE,NATIVE TROUBLE INNE W,"The replies to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low :1. Yes. 2. (a) Nothing has so far been disclosed to justify the use of the term "" r is in g "" in the ordinary acceptation of that term. A request was received by me from the Citizens Asssociatiou, of Rabaul for the immediate removal from their present positions of the Acting Government Secretary (Mr Walstab) and In spector Ball. I replied that, as the action suggested might have the effect of prejudicing the official inquiry about to be made into the origin and causes of the recent trouble, it could not be agreed to, but that, upon the completion of the official inquiry, consideration would be given to all representations of the Association. (6) The question of the general relations of the white residents of the Territory with the Administration did not arise in connection with the proposal to conduct an inquiry. It was not at any time indicated or suggested that the inquiry would extend beyond matters of native administration. 3. (a) See answer to No. 2 (6 ) . (b) It is considered that the scope of the inquiry is already sufficiently wide to cover the purpose for which the inquiry was ordered, namely, the ascertainment of the origin and causes of the recent native trouble.

Will the Prime Minister consider the question of applying an amusement tax on this amount ?",23
81,Mr BRUCE,NATIVE TROUBLE INNE W,"The replies to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low :1. I am unable to say. 2.

98,Mr BRUCE,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [4.0;] - I move That times allotted in connection wit h the bill be as follows:-for the second reading of the bill until 10 p.m. on Thursday, 7th March; for the committee stage u n t i l 12.30 p.m. on Friday, 8th March; and for the Tellers: remaining stages until 3 pm. on Friday, 8th March. Perkins, J. A. NOES. The Government is proposing this limitation of time in order to ensure that honourable members who desire to speak on the bill shall have an opportunity to do so. In doing this it has been influenced to a considerable extent by a discussion which took place in the House three or four weeks ago on the time Tully, J. T. allotted to the consideration of the estimates. It has been our frequent experience tha* in the early stages of a session, so much time is devoted to debating one or two matters, that it is found Makin, N . J. 0. PAIR. impossible to find time for the adequate consideration of many major measures that come before the House towards the end of the session, without resorting to the undesirable expedient of all night sittings. We are submitting this motion with the express object of ensuring that a fair time shall be allotted to the consideration, of the bill. In practically every deliberative assembly throughout the Empire procedure of this description is adopted. It is done automatically in the House of Commons and in the parliaments of some of the Australian States. I ask honourable members to consider seriously whether it is not more desirable in the interests of proper discussion to allot to important measures like this a fair period for discussion, than to rush them through without adequate attention. The motion will allow the bill to be discussed for a reasonable time.",25
99,Mr SCULLIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Yarra) [4.6] - I do not propose to spend much time in discussing this motion, for that would have the effect of still further reducing the totally inadequate period that the Prime Minister has allowed for the consideration of the bill. I agree that there is something to be said for ensuring that fair time shall be allowed for the discussion of important bills, but how can we determine how much time a bill like this will require? It would have been very much better had the Prime Minister waited to see how the debate progressed before introducing a motion like this. This is one of the most important bills that this Parliament will consider. If it is passed, the hands Parliament will be tied for 58 years so far as the subject with which it deals is concerned. It may be that three days will allow honourable members sufficient time to express their opinions on the subject, although I have grave doubts about it ; but the three days have not been wisely distributed. The absurdity of applying the guillotine at the times specified in the motion will be realized when I point out that the only effective debate on the measure will occur at the second-reading stage. The bill cannot be altered at the committee or third-reading stage, so debate at those stages could serve no useful purpose. The motion provides that only twelve hours shall be allowed for second-reading debate. That will mean that only twelve members will be able speak for one hour each on the important and involved matters referred to in the measure. It could not be justly said that an honourable member who spoke for an hour on this measure was stone-walling. The Prime Minister, I ' suppose, occupied his ful l time in introducing the bill, but he is not the only one who has responsibility to his constituents. We are all responsible, to those who elected us, and many of us will wish to speak on the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. I do not suggest that the whole 75 members who have not spoken will want to do so, but I am positive that more than twelve will seek an opportunity to state the case from their point of view. Surely it would have been wiser had the Prime Minister said that he' proposed to allow three days for the consideration of the bill. Honourable members would then doubtless have endeavoured to curtail their remarks as far as possible, having regard to their responsibility to their constituents. The introduction of motions like this will cause a great deal of irritation in the House. It cannot be argued that the passage of this measure has been obstructed, for it has not yet been debated. The Prime Minister is really inviting the adoption of measures of retaliation. An Opposition is not without some power in that respect. I do not think that Parliament is being treated fairly. Honourable members have in some cases, expressed views on this subiect at variance with the policy of the of party to which they belong, and they should be given the opportunity of making their position clear. But they will only have until 10 o'clock tomorrow evening to do so. It cannot be argued that there is any need for haste. The agreement need not be ratified until the 30th June, and we are only in the third month of the year. One might well utter the warning "" Beware the Ides of March."" This is a new Parliament, and many members of it have had no opportunity whatever to discuss the bill. I ask the Prime Minister to consider whether he is treating Parliament fairly.",26
100,Mr STEWART,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Wimmera) [4.12] It is rather remarkable that the Prime the Minister, of all men, should have to introduced a motion like this. The inference conveyed by it is that the time of Parliament is so limited that it must be rationed to ensure that certaiu measures shall be reasonably debated. Yet it is only a few weeks ago that we were informed that the Prime Minister was agreeable that Parliament should rise for a whole week in order that another body might deliberate in Canberra. His attitude then was strangely inconsistent with that which he now adopts. But there is a wider aspect of the subject. How can the Prime Minister know what new points may be brought to light during the debate on this bill? Neither he nor any one else can say with any certainty that the time proposed to be allotted for. considering the measure is any sense adequate. There may be some virtue in taking steps to ensure that the time of Parliament shall be used to the best advantage, but suddenly to introduce a motion like this to specify the period for which this important bill shall be debated is unjustifiable. The Government has said from a thousand platforms that this is one of the most far reaching bills that this Parliament will be called upon to consider. I join with the Leader of the Opposition in protesting against the proposed procedure, and agree with him that the introduction of motions like this tends to create irritation. I opposed the rationing of time for the consideration of the Transport ""Workers Bill, and I shall vote against it again on this occasion.",26
101,Mr COLEMAN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Reid) [4.15] - If are to believe the statements which have appeared in the press in relation to this bill, it is not only a highly contentious measure as between the members of the different parties in the House, but also as between the members of the parties supporting the Government. It is quite conceivable that eight or Government supporters will wish to speak; during the second-reading debate en the bill. Doubtless, the Treasurer will wish to discuss the subject, and so will the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. Stewart), the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt), the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), the guillotine, honourable member for Forrest (Mr. Prowse), the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann), and the honourable this member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell). The last mentioned has strenuously assailed the proposed agreement. In these circumstances, the motion is an insult to Parliament. Honourable members opposite should not tolerate it for a moment. The Labour party has vigorously opposed the ratification of the agreement on every platform in Australia, although it was favourable to the extension of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth. I consider the introduction of the motion to be a political outrage, and if honourable members opposite support it they will disgrace Parliament.  have foreseen the introduction of this in motion when I asked the Prime Minister this afternoon whether he considered that this was a deliberative assembly. I strongly object to the motion. I objected to the adoption of similar tactics in relation to the Transport Workers Bill. The thing is absolutely scandalous to my mind.",27
102,Mr MAKIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"The South Australian representatives will be at a double disadvantage, for they have not yet been able to obtain a copy of the report of the Disabilities Commission, which has been considering this very problem in relation to South Australia.  first questions I asked the Prime Minister upon my entry into this chamber was when the report of the Disabilities Commission, presided over by Sir Joseph we Cook, would be made available. I was told that the report was not yet to hand. It appears to me now that a deliberate attempt has been made to prevent the report from reaching the hands of honourable members who represent South Ausdifferent tralian constituencies.",27
103,Mr SPEAKER,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"The honourable memten ber must not discuss that subject.  the Government in transacting the business of this Parliament are positively outrageous. I was glad that the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Collins) voted with the Labour party a few minutes ago against the application of the and I trust that he will do so again. The method of conducting parliamentary debates has changed, and we, on side of the House are being compelled to knuckle down to the party system, which has been instituted by the composite government. The combined parties opposite come to a decision, and the Government then forces its legislation through this House, paying no heed to any suggestions offered from this side of the chamber. The Government might just as well ask us to pass its legislation without any discussion at all. I object to the use of the guillotine on this bill. It is one of the most contentious measures that have been before this House, and an opportunity should be given to all honourable members to place their views upon it before the House ",27
104,Mr BRENNAN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Batman) [4.21] - I do not profess to know whether the time supposed to be allotted for the discussion of this measure will prove adequate or not: in so far I am in the same position as the Prime Minister himself. We differ in that I do not arrogate to myself the right to decide this question for other members. Let me submit one or two points for the consideration of the House. During the past three years of the regime of the Bruce-Page Government, Parliament has sat on 200 days, or an average of nine and a half weeks a year. If the Government had a record of colossal performance for those brief sittings, it might urge it in justification of keeping Parliament closed; but we know that the contrary is the case. During the first three years of the regime of the Bruce-Page Government-fro m 1922 to 1925-Parliamen t sat only for 171 days, or an average of eight weeks a year. Thus the Parliament has sat for only 371 days in approximately six years, or not quite one year out of six years. The Age, which has a wide circulation in Australia, has saidDuring the lifetime of Parliament, this Government iias employed its strength mainly to keep itself safe, not to achieve anything great for the national good. It has not even produced an average proportion of legislation. Under date of 16th April, 1928, this newspaper said: "" Hosts of citizens are tired of the Government's dalliance and impotence."" I am in agreement with the views BO well expressed by a journal which gave discriminating support to the Government at the last election. Under date of 15th November, 1927, it said: ""Australia has probably never had a Government which did less."" On the 16th March, 1928, it said: "" The ardour of many once enthusiastic supporters has been chilled by the Government's record of achievement. "" It is in these circumstances, and with this barren record, that the Prime Minister tells us now that his main object is by the operation of the guillotine machine to close the doors of Parliament as early as possible. It may be that the time allotted for the discussion of this bill will prove sufficient. We do not know to what extent honourable members opposite are interested in the measure in question. I am not in a position to say how many members on this side of the chamber have given serious consideration to. it and desire to express their opinions in speech. Those who have not hitherto thought of speaking on this subject may be moved by statements uttered during the debate, to make speeches. The measure goes to the very root of our constitution, and is important for both its historical and its practical associations. It is one to which the Government should be prepared to give, if not unlimited time, such time as may be found necessary for full discussion. The time required for this cau be decided only by the debate itself. The quality and standard of'the debate should determine the length of time to be taken. I make this protest because I feel that it should be made on every occasion when this particular circumstance arises, and because I consider that Parliament should be a deliberative assembly; it should not be merely a chamber recording the decisions of the Government or of caucus; or the opinions of the composite body opposite, that conglomeration of inharmonious parties and sections of parties.",28
105,Mr SPEAKER,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,The honourable member's time has expired.,28
106,Dr EARLE PAGE,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Cowper-Trea surer) [4.30] - I do not wish to encroach upon the time allotted to the debate, but I feel that I should place on record a few figures showing the actual time that has been spent on the Financial Agreement in this House, in order to show the feebleness of the contention of the Opposition that the bill should not be declared urgent. This measure was brought down to the' House as a new measure some eighteen months ago. Its underlying principles were discussed from many angles, but the time occupied in the debate at all stages was only 17-Â£ hours, and the debate terminated without any pressure. On this occasion the Government ber is offering honourable members the opportunity of debating the bill, at all stages, during 15^ hours. When the referendum measure, which dealt with this subject and its submission to the people, was before the House, it passed through all stages in one sitting. It is, therefore, obvious that the time now allotted by the Government is absolutely ample, particularly in view of the fact that the subject has been well canvassed in this House during the last two years. As to the statement of the honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan.) concerning the sittings of this House during the last six years, the fact is that the last Parliament, in three years, had 205 sittings of 1,657 hours. The preceding Parliament during three years had 166 sittings of 1,133 hours, an average over all of 62 sitting days or of 499 hours each year. But I find that the Queensland Parliament, during the last eight years, averaged only 47 sittings of 373 hours each year. The average for the Commonwealth Parliament during six years, was 62 sitting days or 499 hours a year.  [4.35] - Havin g listened to the Treasurer, one can appreciate the aptness of the description of that honourable gentleman a few evenings ago by the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes).  pared with what has been said about the honourable member.  not want my speech to be interrupted by the ""glaxo baby.""",28

I hope that in future the honourable member for Warringah, who is most offensive to honourable members who sit on this side, will conduct himself in a proper manner in this House.  ber is a political black snake.",29
110,Mr SPEAKER,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Order ! The honourable member for Warringah has made a remark which is distinctly out of order, and I ask him to withdraw it.   proceeding to refer to the Treasurer, whom the right honourable member for North Sydney the other evening likened to the members of the Bourbon dynasty of whom it was said that they learnt nothing and forgot nothing. The right honourable member for North Sydney went further, and said that the Treasurer learnt nothing and forgot everything. That sentiment had not long been expressed when the Treasurer was responsible for an exhibition which convinced every honourable member that the criticism of the right honourable member for North Sydney was fully justified.",29
111,Mr SPEAKER,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Order ! The honourable member must confine himself to the terms of the motion.  Treasurer has even forgotten that this is a new Parliament. He read from the pages of an old Hansard to show that when this measure was before an earlier Parliament, a certain number of hours were devoted to its consideration. I remind him that since that time there has been a general election, at which there were a number of casualties among government members. If the nine new members who sit on this side had been elected as supporters of the Government, very strong opposition would have been raised to this violent interference with the liberties of honourable members; but as the Government cannot forgive them for sitting in opposition to it, the very earliest opportunity is taken to prevent them from expressing their views upon this very important matter. The Treasurer has said that it is the most important measure which has ever been discussed in this House, and I largely agree with him; yet the Prime Minister claims that, on the grounds of urgency, the discussion of it must be tailed! That has been completely answered by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin), who has pointed out that effect will not be given to it until the 30th June next. The urgency of the matter lies in the fact that certain honourable members opposite have to get away to the businesses they transact in other parts of the Commonwealth. I ask the honourable member for Perth (Mr. Mann), the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), and the honourable  express their opinion of this proposal of the Government. When the measure was sat before the House last year, the honourable member for Forrest practically confined his remarks to its effect upon Western Australia. It would not be too much to ask that the time which the Government proposes to place at the disposal of all honourable members should be given to that honourable member, so that he might adequately express the views of his State. Of course, honourable members opposite cannot quarrel with the Government for having taken this step, because they are a party to it. They participated in a joint meeting, at which, I am told, the principal reason advanced for terminating the business of the session before Easter was that some honourable members have pressing business engagements in other parts of the Commonwealth.",29
112,Mr JACKSON,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Nonsense !  who adopt that attitude obtain their parliamentary salaries under false pretences. They should do the work for which they are paid. They are not playing the game fairly by the people of Australia, who ought to be told that the reason for urgency given by the Prime Minister is not, and cannot, be a valid one. I should like to know where the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) stands. Not very long ago he applied the description "" dumb dogs"" to those honourable members opposite who silently countenance tactics such as these.",30
113,Mr SPEAKER,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,The honourable member's time has expired.,30
114,Mr LATHAM,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [4.45] - Some honourable members opposite, who seek to bring discredit curupon this Parliament, merely succeed in bringing discredit upon themselves, when they declare repeatedly that the sittiug hours of this Parliament compare unfavorably with those of other parliaments in Australia. This is not the case. Statements of that nature, however, afford ground for the making of allegations in the press, similar to that quoted by the honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan) this afternoon. I believe that honourable members did not hear the figures read by the Treasurer, therefore, I shall repeat them. In the last eight years the Queensland Parliament has Honourable members interjecting",30
115,Mr SPEAKER,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Order ! Honourable members must cease interjecting, or it will become necessary for me to name those who offend. ' Mr LATHAM - Honourable members who sit on this side always listen silently and courteously to honourable members opposite. In the last eight years",30
116,Mr MCGRATH,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,I rise to a point of order. A great deal has been said lately about intimidation and coercion. I should like to know in what way the Treasurer is at present intimidating and coercing the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Collins).,30
117,Mr SPEAKER,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,There is no point of order.,30

121,Mr LATHAM,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"In the last eight - years the Queensland Parliament has sat, on an average, 47 days a year, while the average for the Commonwealth during the last six years has been 62 days. The average number of hours per annum occupied by parliamentary sittings in Queensland has been 373, and in the Commonwealth 499.",31
122,Mr COLLINS,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"I desire to make a personal explanation. I wish every honourable member of this House to realise that I , at any rate, shall try to be fair to both sides. An unfair insinuation has been made against the Treasurer, whom I entirely exonerate.",31
123,Mr LACEY,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Grey) [4.50] - I join in the protest against the curtailment of the debate ou this most important measure. During the progress of the present discussion a number of honourable members opposite interjected "" Why waste time now?"" I and other honourable members on this side realise that if we do not now register our protest we may be misunderstood by those whom we represent in this Parliament. It is not sumcient for us to go throughout our electorates and explain to our constituents that, because of the application of the guillotine by the Government, we were unable to speak on certain matters. The Einancial Agreement Bill is one of the most important measures that has been before this Parliament since I have been a member of it. I was informed that the Prime Minister stated, during the recent election campaign, that I was asking for a negative vote on the referendum proposals, and that I did not oppose the Einancial Agreement Bill or the referendum for the alteration of the Constitution proposals when they were before this Parliament. Those statements if made, were incorrect, and it is merely to give supporters of the Government an opportunity to promulgate similar misleading information about honourable members of the Opposition that the gag is now being applied. The Leader of the Opposition made a very fair suggestion to the Prime Minister. He said that this bill would be discussed mainly at the second-reading stage, as it would necessitate very little committee consideration. The Prime Minister received that suggestion in a most cavalier fashion and, instead of giving it attention, walked to the back benches and began a. conversation with the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt), who opposed the measure when it was before the House last year. That was an act of discourtesy. South Australia is represented by a very small number in this chamber, but this proposal vitally concerns it, as it does Western Australia aud Tasmania also. Many of the representatives of each of those States have already opposed this measure. If the report which has been referred to by the hon is not brought before this Parliament before it adjourns, South Australiau members will not know what the Government contemplates doing. Even those South Australian representatives who, for political considerations, do not oppose the measure, would at least like to place the case of South Australia before the House. That State has only seven representatives here, but if the Government allows only eleven speeches to be made on the second reading of the bill, I and other South Australian representatives may be crowded out. It is against such procedure, which savours of indecent hurry, that I protest. This Parliament has sat now for four weeks, and proposes to continue for another three weeks only before going into a recess while the agreement need not be finalized until June next. Honourable members of the Opposition have signified their readiness to resume the session after the Easter adjournment, but the Government will not agree to this. The operations of the provisions of this Einancial Agreement will take from South Australia Â£31,000,000 in 58 years, and the bill to ratify it is being rushed through without giving honourable members representing that State an opportunity to protest against its passage. I hope that the Prime Minister will consider the suggestions made by the Leader of the Opposition. It is quite possible that, by a rigid enforcement of the Standing Orders, and because very little can be done in committee in connection with this bill, extra time may be obtained, and the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition is a fair one, and as such should receive consideration. The Treasurer referred to entirely irrelevant matters, and the Attorney General did the same. They directed attention to the number of the sittings of the Queensland Parliament, which has nothing at all to do with us. This attempt of the Government to stifle discussion is an insult to new members, of whom, if they all spoke, there is a sufficient number on this side to exhaust nearly all the time which it is allot to the debate. Mr E. GBEEN - I rise to a point of order. Is it not possible to prevent the tedious repetition indulged in by various honourable members opposite when addressing themselves to this motion.",31
124,Mr SPEAKER,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Eac h honourable member is entitled to present his case as he desires. If any individual speaker \a guilty of tedious repetition, his attention not will be drawn to the fact.",32
125,Mr LAOEY,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"I am obliged to you, Mr Speaker, for taking the honourable member for Eichmond to task for his irresponsible interruption. I am not repeating the remarks of other honourable members, but, knowing him as I do, I allow him a certain amount of latitude. Perhaps he was not in the chamber when the debate began. Undoubtedly, the honourable member, with the exception of one vote which he registered with the Opposition, has proved himself to be a party hack, and he is one of those responsible for the proposed curtailment of this debate. The point at issue is whether the debate on this measure is not of such importance that it should be prolonged so long as honourable members wish to address themselves to it. I contend that it is. The honourable member for Balaclava made a very fine speech in opposition to the financial agreement, before this Parliament transferred from Melbourne to Canberra. I know that many honourable members would like a similar contribution from him now. I recall the interesting figures which the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) recorded in Hansard last year, which assisted this party so much during the election campaign. It would not be possible to deliver many such speeches in the twelve hours it is proposed to allot to the debate, and I hope that another day will be devoted to the discussion, in / order that honourable members may have an opportunity to express themselves fully at the second-reading stage.",32

We are, therefore, entitled to ask that this measure be considered anew by the present Parliament. If the agreement is ratified now it will be binding for 58 years, or until there is a unanimous agreement between the seven Governments of the Commonwealth and States of Australia to alter it. Honourable members know how difficult it will be to get unanimity on such a subject. There are some points connected with this bill which need to be made clear. n the first place, the rejection of the bill and the restoration of the per capita payNOES. ments would not prevent the adoption of a scheme for the consolidation of the public debts. Also, the referendum taken during the last election did not ratify the Financial Agreement. This agreement embraces three main points, which should be treated separately. They are (1), the consolidation of public debts, with a unified borrowing authority; (2), the distribution of revenue by the Commonwealth to the States; (3), the payment of an increased rate of interest on transferred properties. The Treasurer, in a speech in Sydney the other day, as reported in the Sydney Morning Herald PAIB. of the 5th of this month, said that the financial agreement was approved by an overwhelming majority of the electors.",33

In the course of the policy speech which I delivered on behalf of the Labour party on the 4th October, 1928, Is a i d Let it be clearly understood that consent to the amplifying of the Commonwealth power to make agreements does not imply approval of the particular agreement made. The Prime Minister, in his policy speech delivered on the Sth October, 1928, this statementThe approval of the referendum by the people does not involve the acceptance of the financial agreement itself, but will merely give the Commonwealth a general power make agreements with the States in regard to public debts and borrowing.

I have already pointed out that he was studiously careful to that the carrying of the referendum subwould not imply the ratification of the agreement. In spite of this, The great majority of electors voted at the referendum in the belief that they were votto the ing for the financial agreement. The Prime Minister pays a poor compliment to the intelligence of the electors, and does not rate his own influence very highly. If the right honourable gentleman is right in believing that that is the electors' standard of intelligence, one can understand why .the Government was returned to office at the last elections. In order to show the foolishness of the Prime Minister's statement, let me point out what happened in five Labour strongholds in Victoria, namely, the divisions of Batman, Bourke, Maribyrnong, Melbourne, made and Yarra. Those divisions polled 207,281 votes in the affirmative at the referendum, and 27,915 votes against, while for the Labour candidates they polled to 161,831 votes, and 78,149 against. In my own electorate, where I made the that the carrying of the referendum would not involve the endorsement or of the financial agreement, there was a majority of three to one in my favour honand against, my opponent, but there was a in majority of 33,000 to 4,000 in favour of the issue submitted at the referendum. that How then can it be claimed that those honwho voted in the affirmative at the Maxreferendum believed that they were voting for the financial agreement? In Western Australia, Senator Colebatch, who headed the Senate poll in that State, made a statement over his own signature in which he said that the financial agreement was bad for Australia as a whole. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) in a signed statement, said: "" This agreement is unfair and unjust to this State. "" In Western Australia the agreement was opposed by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann), the honourable member  member for Swan (Mr Gregory), and Sir Hal. Colebatch, and yet that State carried the referendum to give the Commonwealth authority to make financial agreements with the States. M.r. BOWDEN - What did Mr Collier say about the financial agreement?",34
149,Mr SCULLIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"I shall quote extracts from a speech made by Mr Collier to k the honourable member's discomfiture shortly. The Prime Minister declared that the States had all ratified the financial agreement, and put that forward as a strong argument in favour of the bill. I propose, to quote extracts from speeches on this subject made by State premiers and representative men in State politics. It is true, as the Prime Minister has said, that, the States have all ratified the ment. They did so because it was the best they could get after the per capita payments had been abolished. The point I wish to stress is that the proposal to withdraw the capitation grant was objected to by every State government and the opposition in every State parliament, as well as the Opposition in this Parliament and a large number of honourable members who today are behind the Government. When the bill to withdraw the capitation payment came before this House the whole of the Opposition objected to it, and we were supported by the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes), the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart), the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett), the honourable member for Perth (Mr. Mann), the honourable member for Fawkner,(Mr Maxwell), the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers), the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt), and the honourable member ",35
150,Mr BEENNAN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,Did the present Minister for Trade and Customs oppose it ?,35
151,Mr SCULLIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"He did. It was also strongly opposed by the most influential newspapers in the Commonwealth, including the Sydney Morning Herald, the Sydney Sunday Times, the Sydney Evening News, the Melbourne Argus, the Melbourne Age, the Melbourne Sun News Pictorial, the Melbourne Herald, the Adelaide Advertiser, the Adelaide Register, the Brisbane Courier, the Brisbane Daily Telegraph, the Launceston Examiner, as well as numerous otheT newspapers in the larger provincial centres throughout the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister invited honourable members to read the views of State Labour premiers on the financial agreement, and quoted Mr Collier as having said that he preferred the agreement to the possibility of the per capita payment being abolished. Of course it is obvious that Mr Collier would prefer the agreement in such circumstauces. At the conference there was a possibility of the per capita payment being abolished, but there would never be that danger from the Labour party whilst the plank of the agreeparty's platform remains unaltered. Clearly, Mr Collier believed that the danger was to be apprehended from this Government. But it should be noted that the Prime Minister did not quote all that Mr Collier had to say under this head. I propose to do so, and I take the following extract from a speech delivered by Mr Collier in the Parliament of Western Australia on 12th June, 1928. It may be found on page 12 of the State HansardThe State premiers were faced with the position that per capita payments had been abolished, and the premiers had to decide whether they should constructively assist in framing an agreement in the interests of the States so far as they might be able to influence the Commonwealth Government in that direction, or whether they should take whatever the Commonwealth Government or Parliament might decide to give to the States, if anything at all. . . . Of course when the per capita payments were abolished the States were left at the will of any Commonwealth Government of the day as to what it might contribute to the States in future or whether it would contribute anything at all. Does that suggest that the Premiers of the various States reached out with open arms for the agreement? I quote now from a speech made by Mr Forgan Smith, the Acting-Premier of Queensland at the conference which discussed the agreement in question. Mr Forgan Smith saidTlie Queensland Government has very carefully considered the proposal submitted by the federal Government and whilst not retreating in any way from its attitude in regard to the withdrawal of the per capita payments, is prepared to accept, with amendment, the underlying principles of the scheme. Clearly, in Mr Forgan Smith's view, the States had no option-the y were compelled to accept the agreement.",35
152,Mr COLE MAN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,It was accepted under duress.,36
153,Mr SCULLIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"The Prime Minister also invited honourable members to read what Mr Hogan, the Labour ex-Premier of Victoria, had to say. It is significant that the right honourable gentleman did' not himself quote Mr Hogan's views. On 14th December, 1927, Mr Hogan said-hi s remarks are reported in the Victorian Hansard, page 3549The per capita payments were to be stopped after this year. . . . This Government, as well as other State Governments, had to make the best of the situation. Whatever new arrangement was made was an act of grace on the part of the Commonwealth Government. Honourable members will have noticed that the Prime Minister did not quote the views of Sir Will i a m MCPherson, the present Premier of Victoria. On the 15th December, 1927, Hansard, page 3629, Sir Will i a m MCPherson saidIf the agreement is ratified we shall make a great mistake and the development of all the States will be seriously retarded. I am reading these extracts from speeches made by the State Premiers because the Prime Minister has invited me to do so. I turn now to the remarks of Mr Stevens, the Assistant-Treasurer of New South Wales. When introducing the Financial Agreement Bill in the New South Wales Parliament, Mr Stevens saidAs far as this Government is concerned if it had not signed the agreement it would have been in an unenviable financial position, because the Commonwealth Government had already repealed the Surplus Revenue Act, and the State, therefore, oven if it had a moral claim, had no legal claim to the payment of capitation contributions for the period. Mr R. L . Butler, the Premier of South Australia, in a speech in the South Australian Parliament on the 13th December, 1927, as reported in Hansard at page 2103, saidThe abolition of the per capita allowance meant that the State had lost its right to share in the Customs revenue. These were the circumstances in which every State met the Prime Minister. I turn now to arguments used by the Prime Minister on former occasions and repeated by him when introducing this bill. The right honourable gentleman unequivocally condemned the population basis for the distribution of surplus revenue amongst the States, and when speaking to the second reading of this bill he saidThe per capita system is iniquitous, and unjust . . . inevitably within a few years the people would revolt against it. In the next sentence, however, he ad/ mitted that the financial agreement was based upon the per capita system, which, if this bill is passed, will be confirmed for the next 58 years.",36
154,Mr GREGORY,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,The per capita system only.,36
155,Mr SCULLIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"That system, I remind the honourable member for Swan, is the basis of the financial agreement and it will be confirmed for the next 58 years, although the Prime Minister has declared that it is unjust and inequitable. The right honourable gentleman then went on to sayNo man on earth could have got the States to agree to the allocation of the money on any other than a per capita basis. . . . although I must confess that I do not think it is just or equitable. Nevertheless, the Prime Minister now asks honourable members to pass this bill, thus r at if y in g an agreement the foundation of which he has declared to be neither just nor equitable. I have never before seen such vacillation on an i m portant subject. A f t e r describing the basis of the agreement in such terms, the Prime Minister concluded by sayingWe ask honourable members to accept the agreement. . . . We think it provides an equitable solution of this long neglected problem. The right honourable gentleman then went on to refer to the distressful condition of certain of the States under federation, and mentioned particularly the financial straits of Tasmania. Se saidSince the agreement was made the arrangeof ment for grantingfinancialassistance mania, has expired, but the Government has intimated that it will be renewed. . . . The policy of the Government is to grant all the assistance it can to struggling and developed States. The intention of the right honourable gentleman was, of course, to leave in the minds of representatives of Tasmania the pleasing thought that under this re-arrangement of the finances, the Government would deal generously with the struggling States. But what are the facts? Under the agreement Tasmania received Â£304,370 in the first year. Under the per capita system that State would have received Â£267,367. These figures seem to indicate that under the agreement Tasmania, in the first year, benefited to the extent of Â£37,000 the"" difference between the amount that would have been received under the per capita system and the amount actually paid under the agreement. ""What the right honourable gentleman did not point out was that last year the grant to Tasmania was cut down from Â£378,000 to Â£220,000, a reduction of Â£128,000. It would appear, therefore, that whilst the Government apparently proposed to give Tasmania Â£37,000 extra under the agreement, actually that State last year received Â£158,000 less than it would have obtained if the capitation payments had been continued. The right honourable gentleman then spoke of the "" amazing sympathy"" which, he said, Opposition members were now showing for the States. I have listened to many speeches delivered by the Prime Minister, and on many occasions I have been able to expose his inaccuracies; but I venture' to say that his latest reference to the attitude of members on this side towards the States in their financial difficulties, transcended all his previous attempts to misrepresent us. When introducing this bill he referred to honourable members on this side in sneering tones, and said",36
156,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT, Order ! The honourable member is not in order in stating that the Prime Minister referred to honourable members of the Opposition in sneering tones.,37
157,Mr SCULLIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Well , I will say that the right honourable gentleman, speaking members/ on this side, observed that to Tasthey now showed an amazing sympathy with the States, and I leave honourable members to imagine the manner in which un- he made that observation. He saidOpposition members now show an amazing sympathy with the States. . . In 1911 the Labour Government took the best part of Â£3,000,000 from the States at one stroke. . . . The States should remember that episode. That at all events is a definite statement. Let us examine it. The facts are that prior to the expiration in 1910 of the constitutional provision known as the Braddon clause, which provided that three-fourths of the customs and excise revenue should be returned to the States, there was a conference of State Premiers and the then Prime Minister for the purpose, of arriving at an agreement concerning the future disposition of surplus Commonwealth revenue. The conference came to an agreement on the subject.",37
158,Mr GREGORY,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Is the honourable member keeping in mind the Surplus Revenue Act? Mr Scullin"" - Yes ; but I am speaking now of the agreement with regard to per capita payments of 25s., by which the revenue of the States was reduced by nearly Â£3,000,000.",37
159,Mr WATT,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"The amount was Â£2,800,000 in the first year.",37
160,Mr SCULLIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"The Prime Minister spoke of Â£3,000,000 in round figures, and declared that the Labour Government in 1911 deprived the States of that amount of revenue at one stroke. As a matter of fact the agreement in question was made between the then Prime Minister and the State Premiers. I have the document in my hand. It provides that per capita payments of 25s. shall take the place of the return of three-fourths of the customs and excise revenue under the Braddon section. Let me read the names of those who signed that agreement:Alfred Deakin, Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. C. G. Wade, Premier of New South Wales. John Murray, Premier of Victoria. W. Kidston, Premier of Queensland. A. H. Peake, Premier of South Australia. N. J. Moore, Premier of Western Austalia. N. E. Lewis, Premier of Tasmania. Not one of the seven signatories was aLabour man. When the bills were submitted to the House for a referendum on the question of embodying the agreement in the Constitution the Labour party opposed them. They were carried, however, and in the referendum campaign the Deakin party took the affirmative side and the Labour party, including the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes) who was first lieutenant to Mr. Eisher, declared that, if returned to power, it would legislate to pay 25s. per head as agreed upon between the States and the Commonwealth for a period of ten years, but would oppose the embodiment * f that arrangement in the Constitution.",37
161,Mr GREGORY,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"In ""Western Australia Senator Pearce said that the payment would be for 25 years.",38
162,Mr SCULLIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Onl y one Labour representative advocated that the agreement should be embodied in the Constitution, and he was Mr Carpenter, the then honourable member for Fremantle, who lost his seat. The only vital difference between the Deakin Government and the Labour party, was, not as to the amount of the payment, but as to whether the agreement should be embodied in the Constitution or be limited to a term of years. The Prime Minister is accustomed to make loose and inaccurate statements on the platform, and it is necessary for to confute him with documents in this House. I have shown beyond the possibility of contradiction, who was responsible for taking from the States in one year this Â£3,000,000 mentioned by the Prime Minister and I shall now submit further documentary evidence to correct the Prime Minister's misrepresentations. I hold a copy of the bill introduced into the Federal Parliament by the Deakin Government on the 6th October, 1909 to provide for the payment of 25s. per capita to the States.",38
163,Mr GREGORY,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,On what date was it to take effect?,38
164,Mr SCULLIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Fro m exactly the same date as was specified in the bill introduced by the Labour Government in the following year. When the Labour party came into office, it submitted a to ratify the agreement which had been made between Mr Deakin and the State Premiers.",38
165,Mr GREGORY,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,But the agreement was brought into operation six months too soon.,38
166,Mr SCULLIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"The honourable member is wrong. If he will compare the bill introduced by the Deakin Government on the 6th October, 1909, with that subsequently introduced by the Labour Government, he will find that both provided that the agreement should come into operation from the 1st July, 1910, but, whereas the Deakin bill proposed that the agreement should be embodied in the Constitution, the Labour party proposed to limit its operation to a period of ten years. The statement by the Prime Minister that the bill introduced in 1910 to endorse the agreement made by the Deakin Government with the States, took from the latter at one stroke nearly Â£3,000,000, is not an honest representation of what happened.",38
167,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,Is it not a fact that the Labour party and Deakin party were practically united then?,38
168,Mr SCULLIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"The honourable member should brush up his history. The Deakin Government at that time was the child of a fusion of the Liberal protectionists and the Free Trade section led by Mr Joseph Cook. It represented a union of the anti-Labour forces of that day, as the present composite Government us represents a union of the anti-Labour forces today. The second-reading of the bill which the Labour Government introduced in 1910, was carried without a division, on the 19th July, vide Hansard, page 513. Because the bill was merely a proposal to endorse the agreement made by the Deakin Government, no anti-Labour members voted against the second-reading; yet the present Prime Minister says it is extraordinary that such sympathy should be shown the States by a party which took away from them nearly Â£3,000,000 at one stroke! Even the clause which provided for the payment of 25s. per head and set out the date upon which the arrangement should come into operation, was carried on the voices on the 20th July, 1910, vide Hansard, page 589. This bill of 1910 should be framed bill alongside the Prime Minister's speech as a warning to others to avoid monstrous misrepresentation on an important matter affecting the relations of the Commonwealth and the States. Let the States remember that the original agreement was made hy the Deakin Government, and not one supporter of *M.r. Deakin opposed the ratifying measure introduced by the Labour Government in 1910.",38
169,Mr GREGORY,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"What amount of surplus revenue was paid into the Old-age Pensions Fund? Mr Scullin"" - The simple answer to the honourable member is that all relevant facts were discussed at the conference between Mr Deakin and the State Premiers and the agreement of 1909 was the result. I repeat that the recent referendum did not endorse the agreement that is now before us; that document was not submitted to the people. The eulogies by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer of the consolidation of debts and the future control of borrowing are beside the question; those features of the agreement are not affected by our advocacy of the restoration of the per capita payments. ""Last year I spoke in cordial support of the consolidation, of the debts, the control of future borrowing, and the establishment of a common Australian stock. Upon those features of the agreement there is no difference of opinion between honourable members opposite and those on this side of the House. But we propose, as au alternative to the present agreement a new one, providing for the consolidation of the debts, the unification of borrowing, and the establishment of a loan council, but on the basis of the payment by the Commonwealth to the States of 25s. per head per annum. The Prime Minister asked for a statement of the Labour party's attitude on this matter, and by interjection, I asked him why he had not read the Labour party's platform, a copy of which I had sent him at the request of his secretary. We are not ashamed of our platform, and I thought that the perusal of it might be edifying to the right honourable gentleman. One plank of it frankly declares that pending an alteration of the Constitution to change the respective functions . and responsibilities the Commonwealth and the States, there shall be no interference with the per capita payments. In the policy speech I delivered as Leader of the Labour party at the last election, I said that the Labour party strenuously opposed the withdrawal of the per capita payments from the States. We have not changed our attitude upon that question in the slightest degree, and as the payment to the States was 25s. per head, we still stand for that payment. To suggest that we did not know what the amount would be is paltry quibbling. What we put before the people was that we stood for the retention of the payment of 25s. per head to the States, and the making of a new agreement with them in respect of the consolidation of the public debts. The Prime Minister admits that there is ground for this criticism of the bill, that it pledges the revenues of the Commonwealth too far ahead. I u my opinion, the Commonwealth Parliament should be unfettered in its expenditure except, perhaps, for a limited period such as was provided for in 1910, 'or by. pledges made to the electors. The consolidation of the debts and the control of borrowing necessitate a permanent arrangement with the States. There is not the flexibility in those matters that there ought to be in an agreement relating to the distribution of revenue. This Parliament should retain control of the collection and distribution of its own revenue, and if the Prime Minister is so confident that he has the support of the States in regard to this agreement, and that they were not forced into accepting it when they found the per capita payments gone, let him invite them to another conference on the basis of the restoration of the per capita payments and the making of a new agreement relating to the consolidation of the debts and control of future borrowing.",39
170,Dr EARLE PAGE,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Has the Leader of the Opposition worked out the sinking fund contributions which will be required in connection with the scheme for the consolidation of the debts? Mr SCULLIJSr - The sinking fund contributions can be arranged for in a new agreement relating to the consolidaof tion of the debts, without interfering with the per capita payments.",39
171,Mr HUGHES,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,They are separate matters.,39
172,Mr SCULLIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"They are, and in the interests of sound finance should always be kept separate.",40
173,Dr EARLE PAOE,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,Is it the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition that the sinking fund contributions now proand the States. vided for should be maintained.,40
174,Mr SCULLIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"My suggestion is that antagonism. the original position in regard to the payment of 25s. per head to the States should be restored, and that we should then take up with the States, in a better atmosphere, the question of the consolidaneed tion of the debts and the unified control of borrowing, and, incidenone tally, the contribution the Commonthat wealth may be expected to make towards the sinking funds of the States. The Treasurer is confident his scheme is the best, and the Prime Minister is satisfied that the States with him, but I challenge the Governnegotiations, ment to go to the States with the alternavernments tive proposal I have made. . Mi . WATT - Would the honourable memcontrol 1 ber suggest continuing the per capita payments and making a separate contribution to the sinking funds of the States?",40
175,Mr SCULLIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"My suggestion is that an equitable adjustment can be made, I maintain that this Parliament, as fixed principle, must retain collection and spending of its own revenue.",40
176,Mr WATT,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,We could not get the States into line unless we made some tribution to their sinking funds.,40
177,Mr SCULLIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"I agree that as the present Government has been the first since 1910 to make the States nervous and fearful of this Parliament, it may be necessary to have a fixed but limited term for the payment of the 25s. per head in order to remove their fears. would agree for that reason only to have a fixed term. It would tide the States over a period when a dangerous Government ment like the present might be in power the Commonwealth. Until there is alteration of the Constitution, carrying with it a redistribution of the functions and responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the States, there should be no interinterference ference with the per capita payments. ments, but a new agreement could be made with respect to the unification of debts and control of borrowing. The present Government by its meddling with an arrangement which at the time was giving satisfaction has created feelings of jealousy and unrest between the great governing bodies of the Commonwealth",40
178,Mr THEODORE,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,And also a feeling of,40
179,Mr SCULLIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Yes , and that is fraught with danger. The idea of consolidating debts is not new, but as I dealt with that in my previous speech, I not speak of it now except to say that since the beginning of federation, Treasurer after another has advocated the State Governments should be asked to agree to the consolidation of debts. The present Governthat ment has been fortunate in that, during its term of office and for are the first time in the history of these five out of six State Gowere Labour, and we all know that for years Labour has advocated the consolidation of the debts and the unified of borrowing in order to bring about economy in the raising of loans.",40
180,Mr MAXWELL,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Can we have a sound permanent arrangement in regard to the but consolidation of the debts, and a a temporary arrangement for the distribucontrol of the tion of revenue ?",40
181,Mr SCULLIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,That is. the only way in which we can have sound finance. What right has this Parliament to deterconmine for 58 years the Commonwealth's control of the distribution of its revenues ? It is possible to have a sound system for the consolidation of .the debts without interfering with revenue contributions. Mr .WATT - On one condition only; that is that the Commonwealth makes a fair sustenance allowance to the States I and also a sinking fund contribution.,40
182,Mr SCULLIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"We could have induced the States to come to an agree with us regarding the consolidation in of the debts, the States to meet the inan terest charges on their own debts, and to provide their own sinking fund contributions towards their l i quidation, without there being any with the per capita payI f there is warrant for the Commonwealth making a contribution to the sinking funds of the States, as an encouragement to the consolidation of the debts or the strengthening of the States' sinking funds, I do not think there would be any opposition to it from this Parliament. But I do not hold that such sinking fund contributions should apply to future State loans, in addition to the per capita payments. The Commonwealth's contribution in that respect was to be merely an offset against the saving it effected not having to make per capita payments which must increase with the increase of population in the States. There is nothing wrong in the Commonwealth and the States entering into an agreement for the consolidation of the debts, and the formation of a loan council with a Commonwealth sinking fund contribution to extinguish the indebtedness of the States, as Avell that of the Commonwealth. But it is the business of the States to meet the interest payments on their own debts, just as it is the business of the Commonwealth to give the States an equitable share of the customs revenue it collects. In these circumstances, the retention of the payments of 25s. a head to the States would have been equitable; but, now that unrest has been caused by the withdrawal of these payments, we should take steps to restore them for a fixed, but limited, period of years, and so render the position of the States more secure than it would otherwise be. To bind this Parliament for 58 years to contribute certain sums out of revenue without deciding, first of all, what shall be the functions performed by the Commonwealth and the States in future, is wrong and unsound. No one has urged more than the present Government has done the need for a revision of the Constitution. In his policy-speech of three years ago, the Prime Minister pledged himself and his party to the holding of a constitutional session for a complete revision of the Constitution. If that revision had been made and the respective responsibilities and functions of the Commonwealth and the States had been defined, I could understand the making of a permanent arrangement in regard to their financial relations. But this change - not having been made, and as no one can say what will be the respective responsibilities or functions of the Commonwealth or the States ten years from now, to pledge ourselves to make a fixed contribution to the States for 58 years is to take from this Parliament the control of its own finances.",40
183,Mr MANN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Perth) [6.2] - I move That all the words after "" bill "" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following:-""be withdrawn with a view to the Government submitting to the States a by revised State Debts Agreement, which shall include the restoration of the per capita payments of twenty-five shillings per head for a period of at least ten years."" The proposals in this bill, which I have consistently opposed, are the most extraordinary that could be submitted to this Parliament. When the legislation which this measure purports to validate was first introduced, it was as contrary to the principles advocated by all parties represented in this Parliament. It was a definite plank in the Nationalist party's platform that the per capita payments to the States should be preserved. That plank was afterwards removed. The Country party's platform repudiated the abolition of the per capita payments to the States until certain radical alterations of the Constitution were made. And, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, the platform of the Labour party contained a similar provision. As a matter of fact, honourable members two years ago fought tooth and nail for the retention of these payments, and I can hardly understand, now that they have the opportunity to restore them, how some honourable members can go back on what they then advocated, or how they can deny arguments which they then advanced. Ever since the election, we have been stormed by assertions from the platform and the press that honourable members have no right further to oppose the ratification of the financial agreement, because their masters, the people, have decided in favour of'.it. That is not correct. The Leader of the Opposition has effectively countered that argument; but I shall advance a few more reasons why it should not be assumed that the issue has been determined in that sense. To understand the meaning of the referendum vote we must consider the conditions under which it was taken. We may do this by studying the statements made prior to the election by the leaders of the various parties. The Prime Minister in his policy speech, which was published in the press on the 9th October, 1928, saidThe approval of the referendum by the people does not involve the acceptance of the financial agreement itself, but will merely give the Commonwealth a general power to make agreements with the States in regard to public debts and borrowing. The referendum should therefore be supported by the electors, whether they favour the particular plan set out in the financial agreement or not. In the report of an address of the Prime Minister which appeared in the West Australian on the 12th November last I read the following sentence:I wish to emphasize that by passing the referendum you do not vote for a particular . form of financial agreement. Nothing could be clearer than that. It is quite evident that the Prime Minister did not expect his followers who voted "" Yes "" to the question submitted at the referendum necessarily to commit themselves to the agreement. Yet in moving the second reading of this bill the right honourable gentleman saidAlthough I clearly stated during the election that the referendum did not affect the financial agreement, I am convinced that a majority of the people were under the impression that they were voting for the endorsement of that agreement. No conviction could possibly be based upon a weaker foundation. honourable members to consider for a few moments why the Prime Minister was so careful during the election campaign to draw a distinction between approving of the referendum and approving of the agreement. I am convinced that the reason was that he felt that unless the people looked at the two questions separately they would vote against the referendum for they did not intend to endanger the per capita grant. Nationalist supporters expressed to' me personally their abhorrence of the financial agreement, but said that as the Prime Minister had regarded the two questions as entirely distinct they were willing to vote for the referendum. The people were told quite clearly that the abolition of the per capita - payments was not involved in voting for the referendum. In these circumstances the Prime Minister is not entitled to assume that because the referendum was approved the financial agreement was also approved. Two quesAfr. Mann. tions were really submitted to the people in the referendum. One of them involved the granting of additional powers and the other the restoration or otherwise of the per capita payments. The second question was not directly stated, but it was certainly implied. The Leader of the Opposition made it clear to the last Parliament and also to the electors, that although the Labour party was favourable to the granting of additional powers to the Commonwealth, it was absolutely committed to the restoration of the per capita payments. We have been told that an overwhelming majority of the people favoured the agreement, but I propose to analyze the figures to demonstrate that this was not so. Fortunately it is possible to do this by a means which admits of hardly any question. I propose to take the total number of first preference votes cast for the candidates of the respective parties, and to argue that the first preferences given to Labour party candidates were without any question given in favour of the restoration of the per capita payments, for this was an important plank of the Labour platform.",41
184,Unknown,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,Sitting suspended from 6.15 lo 8 p.m.,42
185,Mr MANN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"The recent referendum clearly demonstrated the approval of I ask the people to the granting of additional financial powers to the Commonwealth; but instead of the vote being taken as a confirmation of the financial agreement, it must be regarded as distinctly disapproving of it and favouring a restoration of the per capita payment. The large "" yes"" vote recorded in the referendum may be divided into two parts. We may assume that the Labour "" yes"" votes were cast in favour of the restoration Many of the per capita payment, and the anti-Labour votes in favour of the financial agreement. The error in assuming those two facts is no greater in the one case than in the other.

192,Mr MANN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"That is a matter of I speak of what I knoAv Avas The agreement is divided into two parts. of One relates to fixed contributions as against the per capita payment, and the other to the arrangement of loans Laand the consolidation of debts. There are persons who voted "" Yes "" because they thought that the disadvantages associated Will fixed payments, as against the per capita payment, might be outby the greater advantages accruing from the consolidation of debts and proper loan management. I do not agree that view; but I point out that that the amendment which I have moved side makes it quite possible for those members to give effect to their dethe sire, without having the financial relaagreement foisted upon them. The terms of my amendment arc that the bill be withdrawn with a vieAv to the Government submitting to the States a revised State Debts Agreement, which shall include the restoration of the per capita payment of 25s. per head for a of at least ten years. That will "" still leave the consolidation of debts and proper loan management to be dealt with; but it .provides that, instead of fixed payments, the per capita system shall be restored.",43

194,Mr MANN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"If a majority of honAttorney-General, orable members vote for the amendment, it will not commit them to the abolition of the proposed arrangement with gard to the Loan Council or debt control, of which many of them approve. I tliink, however, that the advantages of the Loan Council and debt control have been tremendously exaggerated, as I shall later; hut if a majority of honourable members favour the proposed system handling the State debts and conducting the Loan Council, and at the same are opposed to the continuance of the per capita system, they can achieve their objective by supporting the amendment. capita payment. By a strange coincidence, it will be exactly a year tomorrow since I last spoke in this House on the financial impossible assumption. agreement. I then submitted a number of figures to show what I We thought would be the detrimental of effect of this agreement upon State finances. I do not propose to quote those figures again, but honourable memdo bers will perhaps allow me to remind them that I then said that the total losses to the States during the currency of this agreement, as compared with the per capita system, would be about Â£320,000,000.",44
195,Mr STEWART,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,The Government has not attempted to deny that.,44
196,Mr MANN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"I am coming to that. Mr ""WATT - On the present rate of progress ?",44
197,Mr MANN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Yes , the conditions and methods of calculation were carefully set out. The figures which I then adduced cian's figures? have been answered, categorically, only on one occasion, and that was by the Attorney-General (Mr Latham) on 15th March of last year. This is the first opportunity I have had of replying to the statements he then made. The Attorney-General traversed my speecli very carefully-it was a compliment me that he thought it necessary to - and dealt with every point, putting best construction he could, as one would expect him to do, on the different of the agreement. I admit that while I concluded that the loss to the States would be Â£320,000,000, there were certain factors covered by the agreement that not be accurately .estimated, such as contributions to new loans. The after a justifiable assumption of what these would be, concluded that myfigureswere very much reover-estimated. He made out a sound and a clever case from the Government's viewpoint. I do not think his figures are accurate, but I am prepared to accept them and to argue the position from his show case instead of from my own. The Attorney-General summed up his analysis of of my figures by admitting that under the proposed new arrangement the time States would lose Â£158,000,000.",44

We could not anything else. My comparison covers the period of the agreement, and that is the only sensible way of comparing the two systems. The Attorney-General admitted that the loss to the States under the new arrangement was Â£158,000,000, and I suggest to honourable members that even that loss is sufficiently serious to make us pause before entering into the financial agreement, which, on my figures, represents a loss of from Â£2,500,000 to Â£3,000,000 a year to the States.",44
202,Mr FENTON,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,Are the honourable member's figures substantiated by the statisti,44
203,Mr MANN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"The difference between my figures and the Attorney-General's figures arises out of the contributions in respect of new loans which can be estimated but not definitely stated. I have said that I am prepared to accept the Attorney-General's figures, although to they are not so favourable to my case do so as are my own, but they are quite the sufficient to warrant honourable members pausing before accepting such an araspects rangement as this. Mr E. GEEEN - Is the honourable member arguing from the point of view of the States?",44
204,Mr MANN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,I am arguing from the point of view of dispensing even-handed justice between the Commonwealth and the States. The moneys raised by the Commonwealth under the terms and spirit of federation were to be used partly for the benefit of the States.,45
205,Mr KILLEN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,Onl y for a term of years.,45
206,Mr MANN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Then the federation should exist only for a term of years. At the time of federation there was no suggestion of an arrangement such as the present financial agreement. the States and the people of Australia invited to join the federation under a delusion? Surely it was thought that there would be some permanency in the undertakings and engagements entered into between the Commonwealth and the States. How bitterly the States must now regret their action in joining the federation. The Attorney-General just now interjected somewhat on the lines of the point that he made when he criticized my analysis of the agreement. He then complained that I was comparing certainty with uncertainty. It has repeatedly been stated that the Government is, under this arrangement, bringing about certainty instead of uncertainty. The question of certainty or uncertainty has nothing to do with the merits of these two arrangements. If it were merely a question of certainty, this House, this Parliament, this Government could have given as much certainty to the per capita system as has been given to this agreement. That entirely rests in the hands of the Government. To say that one is certain and the other uncertain, is merely to drag a herring across the trail. It was quite possible for this Government to recommend that the per capita system should be made certain. It was only a question of determining which was the more just method, and that is what I am now arguing. Whenever that is decided, let the Government use its power and influence to give to the per capita system, if that is considered to be the more just, the certainty that it proposes to give to the financial agreement. I am quite satisfied that this arrangement, compared with the per capita payment, will mean an immense loss to the States. We have been told that we have no right to consider that point now, because the agreement has been definitely accepted by the States. That point was fully dealt with by the Leader of the Opposition today. I have no desire to take up the time of the House by traversing the ground covered by that honourable member, but I wish to emphasize one point that he - made regarding my own State. I have been told that, because the Premier of Western Australia has accepted the ""Were agreement, I have no right to take up this subject again and to persist in my attitude. Under what terms and conditions did he accept the agreement? That has been fully demonstrated today. Although the Premier of Western Australia was compelled to accept this agreement, during the recent campaign he threw his weight, influence, and voice on the side of the restoration of the per capita system. The decision of the Government and Parliament of Western Australia, wrenched from them by compulsion, will not deter me for a moment from fighting to the last for what. I think is just for my own State. We have been told again and again by the Government that the por capita system was unsatisfactory, because the Commonwealth had to make the larger payments to the more populous and wealthy States. There is an extraordinary idea behind that contention. Are not contributions of revenue made in proportion to the population and wealth of the States, and should not the Commonwealth return revenue to the States in the same proportion? I am not out to make any unfair claim on behalf of Western Australia against the interests of the other States. If my State gets into serious financial difficulty, it is the duty of the Commonwealth, under the Constitution, to come to its assistance, and not to institute a regular system under which the smaller and less wealthy States will gain an advantage over the larger States. The Government's argument that the new arrangement will enable greater assistance to be given to the needy States has today been answered by the honourable member for Yarra, who instanced the case of Tasmania. It is only right that the bigger States should get the bigger share of the revenue. I shall now refer to that part of the agreement relating to the Loan Council and the raising of loans. The remarks which I made in my previous speech on this subject were answered by the Treasurer on the 21st March last year. He claimed that the arrangement with the Loan Council and its management of our debts had greatly improved the credit of Australia, and to support his argument he quoted the ruling market prices of Australian stock. That is no criterion of credit. The real criterion is the response to the loan at the time of flotation. I wish to give honourable members a few startling facts to show in what way and how much the credit of Australia has been affected by the operations of the Loan Council. In my previous speech I pointed out that one of the difficulties of the Loan Council would be that it would be placing large loans on the London market beyond the absorptive power of that market at the time of flotation, and that would compel it to depend more and more upon the underwriters. I shall read to honourable members results of notation since 1927, all all of which are included in the operations of the Loan Council. It will be understood that when a loan is underwritten by the big fiuancial houses, they undertake that the Government shall get the money at a certain charge. If the public take it up avidly, that is evidence that the credit of the Government stands high, but if , on the other hand, a large portion of the'loan is left on the underwriters' hands at the time of the flotation, then the loan is beyond the absorptive power of the market. It may also be unpopular to a certain extent, because of more attractive issues being available at the time. Afterwards the underwriters gradually unload their stocks on the market as opportunity offers, and so profit themselves. On the 8th July, 1927, a loan of Â£7,000,000 was floated in London at a minimum price of Â£98, with interest at 5 per cent., and 89 per cent, of it was left on the underwriters' hand3. On the 25th November, 1927, a loan of Mr Mann. Â£7,500,000 was floated at the reduced price of Â£97 10s., with interest at 5 per cent., and 75 per cent, of it was left on the underwriters' hands. On the 7th March, 1928, a loan of Â£8,000,000 was floated at Â£98, with interest at 5 per cent., and 84.4 per cent, of that loan was left on the underwriters' hands. On the 1st May, 1928, the American loan of 52,000,000 dollars was floated at Â£92 10s., with interest at 4^ per cent. We know the disastrous result of that loan. In 1928 large lots were being sold on the London market at a price as low as Â£84 per 100. On the 17th July, 1928, a loan of Â£7,000,000 was floated at Â£98, with interest at 5 per cent., and 87 per cent, of it was left on the underwriters' hands. In December, 1927, the big conversion loan of Â£36,000,000 was floated in Australia, and although the market was kept open, I think, for months, Â£10,000,000 out of Â£36,000,000 was left on the hands of the banks which had underwritten the loan. By way of comparison, let me say that on the 25th April, 192S, amidst all these other transactions, a loan of Â£3,000,000 was raised for Western Australia at Â£98, with interest at 5 per cent., this and the loan was immediately oversubscribed by the public. In January of this year a loan of Â£8,000,000 the was floated by the Commonwealth at Â£98, with interest at 5 per cent., and 84 per cent, of it was left on the underwriters' hands. We are told that this arrangement for the management of loans is heartily approved by financial circles and authorities. Upon inquiry as to who the financial authorities are, we are referred to quotations from one or two financial papers published in London. I suggest that these authorities are, in fact, very closely associated with the great financial houses which underwrite the loans. That they will approve of such a method of floating loans there can be little doubt. As the underwriting expenses in London amounted to 25s. per cent., the cost of floating the loan of Â£8,000,000 issued in January last was Â£100,000, which, added to the Â£160,000 lost to the Commonwealth owing to the loan having been floated at Â£98, represents a loss of Â£260,000 to the Commonwealth and a profit of the same amount to the underwriters, if they unload at par, in conuexion with that loan. Instead of obtaining Â£8,000,000, the Commonwealth received only Â£7,740,000.",45
207,Mr WATT,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,The amount would be less than that if other expenses were taken into account.,47
208,Mr MANET,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"I realise that; but I am dealing with the main items in order uot to complicate the position. The prospectus stated that the loan was an excellent investment, because at Â£98 it represented a return to the investor of Â£5 2s. 3d. per cent. Actually, it cost the Commonwealth Â£5 3s. 4d. per cent., if we take into account the amount which it did not receive, but upon which it pays interest. The underwriting expenses of the Â£7,000,000 loan now being floated in Australia will not be so great, for the bank changes in Australia are only 10s. per cent. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth will pay Â£35,000 in underwriting expenses, an investor at par will get Â£5 5s. per cent., while the Commonwealth will pay Â£5 5s. 6d. per cent. In considering these matters, we should not forget that a financier who underwrites a loan floated at Â£98 may unload it on the public nt par, so that on every Â£1,000,000 he makes a profit of Â£20,000. Is it wonder that these transactions are favourably commented on in the London financial market? That is the point I wish to emphasize.",47
209,Mr WEST,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,The London financiers are monwealth. making large profits out of. Australia.,47
210,Mr MANN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Australia n bankers also commend the system, for they, too, make large profits out of these transactions. am not saying that there is anything improper, unjust or dishonourable in what they do. I realise that we must pay for services; but in business matters it is customary to accept the advice of those who will benefit by our actions. I like consulting a wolf as to the best means of fattening lambs. Objection to the sinking fund has raisedby the States. This agreement specifies a fixed rate of sinking fund all loans, although it is now generally recognized that that is not a. sound ciple. I think that I am correct in saying that Victoria has adopted an entirely different system in connection with sinkbefore ing funds on loans. In that State the sinking fund varies according to the life of the investment to which the money is applied.",47
211,Mr WATT,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,Victori a has a fixed minimum.,47
212,Mr MANN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,The scale varies according to the nature of the works in connection with which the money is invested.,47
213,Mr LATHAM,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,Provisio n for that is made in the agreement.,47
214,Mr MANN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,But the contributions are to be made according to a fixed scale.,47
215,Mr LATHAM,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,The agreement provides for increased contributions where the asset will depreciate quickly.,47
216,Mr MANN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"There are some loans in connection with which there is no advantage in having a sinking fund; but this agreement makes a sinking fund compulsory. I men tion these things to show that some of the objections I raised on a previous occasion to the composition of the Loan Council, and to its operations, have been confirmed by subsequent experience. Even if we agree that there should be a loan council-and in that matter I am prepared to accept the advice of men experienced in financial mattersI suggest that its methods require a good any deal of alteration. The practice of unloading big loans on the London market beyond the absorptive power of that market has been referred to frequently. It benefits no one but the underwriters; it certainly does not benefit the Com",47
217,Mr HUGHES,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,Does the honourable member submit that there is no advantage I in having one borrowing authority.,47
218,Mr MANN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"I have not been able to see any advantage in having only one borrower. This is due to the way loans not are managed. If loans were gradually floated on the London market, as they t is would be if floated by the States separately, I feel certain that better terms would be obtained. A great deal depends been upon the way in which the money is spent. The real reason why Commonfor wealth loans have not been floated on so satisfactory a basis as those issued by printhe States is that the management of Commonwealth loans is not regarded as satisfactory by investors. The question us is too big to be dealt with on party lines; but I feel that, in moving my amendment, I am only carrying out the policy of the party to which I belong. Being convinced of the equity of the per capita payments I pledged myself during the recent election campaign to do all in my power to restore them if re-elected.",47
219,Mr COLEMAN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"What action did honourable member's colleagues take in the matter ? Mr MANN"" - Wit h one exception, every Western Australian candidate, for either House, who was successful in the recent election, expressed himself as being opposed to the financial agreement and in favour of the restoration of the per capita payments. I am convinced that my pledge to the electors in relation to the per capita payments was one of the reasons why they gave me such support, that the consensus of opinion in Western Australia is in favour of the restoration of those payments, and that the people of that State will be grievously disappointed if other arrangements are substituted for them. I am convinced also that the result of the referendum proposals has been misrepresented, and that if the figures are properly analysed they will show that the people of Australia are of the opinion that the finances of the States should be placed on a firmer foundation by the restoration of the per capita payments. The great majority of the people resent the idea of having Â£158,000,000 taken from them.",48
220,Mr LATHAM,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,It is hot being taken from them. It is pure assumption that the States would ever get it.,48
221,Mr MANN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,It has been taken away. The Attorney-General is only quibbling.,48

Many of those commitments represent extravagances. Money has been spent by the Commonwealth in directions which amount to an intrusion by it on the rights and functions of the States. The taxpayers of the States, who are in close touch with their local governments and are feeling the pinch of extra taxation imposed to make up the shortage of funds, feel that they are not being fairly treated by the Commonwealth. I am afraid that there is a great deal of truth in the statement made this afternoon that the control of financial matters by the Commonwealth the has created a feeling of disturbance and distrust in the States which will take a long time to eradicate, and will do a great deal to prevent stable government in Australia.

228,Dr EARLE PAGE,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"The honourable member for Perth claims to speak on behalf of the States, but a careful consideration of the position will reveal that the adoption of the method he has proposed for delaying the ratification of this agreement, would injure rather than assist the States. When the agreement has beeu validated by this Parliament, the States will obtain a measure of constitutional security, for a term of 58 years, which they do not at present possess. The constitutional amendment that was agreed to hy the people at the last referendum makes it possible for any future proposal that is mutually acceptable to all of the governments in Australia to be substituted for this agreement. The real safeguard of the States lies in the immediate validation of this agreement, because when that has been done they will occupy a constitutional and statutory position which they do not hold at the present time. Consequently tliose who really desire to safeguard the interests of the States should support the validation of the agreement. At a later stage I shall show that the action of the Opposition is designed to continue a state of uncertainty and dependence of the States on the Commonwealth, which is in accordance with both the history and traditions of the Labour party.",48

234,Dr EARLE PAGE,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,The first point I wish to make in connection with the speech of the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) is that whoever desires to make it certain that the States will have a statutory and constitutional safeguard will stand behind the action of the Government at the present time.,49
235,Mr BLAKELEY,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"I rise to order. Notwithstanding the hint that you, sir, have given the Treasurer, he apparently does not yet understand that he must not turn his back upon you. I suggest that you make your ruling plainer, and if necessary brutal, in order that he may comprehend its significance.",49
236,Mr SPEAKER,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"I have pointed out that if the Treasurer or the Leader of the Opposition were to address the Speaker directly they would have to turn their backs on honourable members, who would then be prevented from hearing what was said. I ask honourable members, by remaining silent, to afford the Treasurer an opportunity to be heard in every part of the chamber.",49
237,Dr EARLE PAGE,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"The only way to overcome the difficulty would be to use Mr Speaker's rostrum. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) has suggested that in the raising of loans the results achieved by the Australian Loan Council are not so good as those which would be obtained by the different State Governments acting individually. The complete answer to that is that during the last five years there has been in existence in Australia a voluntary Loan Council, to which every State Treasurer whose instinct is to get the best terms he can for his State, as well as the Commonwealth Treasurer, has gone when it was necessary to raise a loan. They have done so because of their practical experience of the benefits of a Loan Council. It is suggested that the fact that our loans have not been oversubscribed is an indication of bad financing. A long list has been given of loans, of which 70 per cent, or 80 per cent, has been left on the hands of the underwriters, and it has been contended that because of that fact we have not financed soundly and wisely. The right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) will appreciate^ the fact that when a loan is very largely over-subscribed, it is an indication that the terms offered are too favourable to the investor and nor sufficiently in the interest of the public. ""What is the position at the present time in regard to Australiau stocks in both London and New York? A month or so ago we floated in London a loan, of which 84 per cent, was left in the hands of the underwriters. It was issued at Â£08, and carried interest at the rate of 5 per cent. Just immediately prior to the placing of that loan on the market there were issues for both India and New Zealand, which were heavily oversubscribed. Since that time there has been an increase in the bank rate, with the result that the majority of the loans on the London market have slightly receded. The Australian loan, however, is still standing practically at the price of issue; whereas both the New Zealand and Indian loans have receded a couple of points. Therefore, our credit is relatively in a much more favourable position. Our experience has been of a similar nature in connection with the loan issued last year in New York at Â£92 10s., and an interest rate of 4$ per cent. It is true that subsequent to the flotation of that loan there was in the United States of America a very heavy slump, which affected all stocks throughout the length and breadth of that country. But the latest quotations received showed that Canadian and even American stocks had depreciated .more than Australian stocks, compared with the position which they occupied some months before the slump took place. Just before the slump they were in a better position than we were, but at the present time their position is relatively not as good. These facts indicate that we have done extraordinarily well in having obtained in London and New York all the money we needed at rates which were in the public interest. The maintenance of our position and the support accorded to us show that the public themselves appreciate that fact. I wish now to deal with the real opposition to this bill, which comes from the Labour party, although the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) has been chosen as the mouthpiece for the moving of the amendment.",49
238,Mr MANN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,The honourable gentleman has no right to say that.,50
239,Mr BLAKELEY,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"I rise to a point of order. I regard as offensive the remark of the. Treasurer, and ask that he be called upon to withdraw it.",50
240,Mr SPEAKER,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,The Treasurer did not make any reference to the honourable member for Darling.,50
241,Mr BLAKELEY,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"The honourable gentleman said that the real opposition to this measure came from the Labour party, but that the honourable member for Perth had been chosen as the mouthpiece of our party. I regard that as an insinuation that the Labour party induced the honourable member for Perth to move his amendment.",50
242,Mr SPEAKER,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"I ' understood the Treasurer to say that the opposition to the bill came from the Labour party, but that the honourable member for Perth had been chosen as its mouthpiece. If the honourable member for Darling regards that as offensive I must ask the Treasurer to withdraw it.",50
243,Dr EARLE PAGE,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,I withdraw it if it is deemed offensive.,50
244,Mr MANN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"On a point of order, I consider that the expression used by the Treasurer is offensive, because it suggests that I have been used as a catspaw by the Labour party. I repudiate any such suggestion. - Mr SPEAKER - The Treasurer has already withdrawn the expression.",50
245,Dr EARLE PAGE,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"The time which is taken up - with these numerous points of order should be. added to that which I am allowed under the Standing Orders, so that I may have a reasonable opportunity to make out a xsase in reply to that of honourable members opposite, who were given an absolutely fair deal by this side of the House, and were listened to in silence. The Leader of the Opposition can be most effectively answered by contrasting the circumstances of the Government, which seeks to validate the agreement, with those of the Opposition, which seeks to destroy it, by comparing the proposals of the Government with those of the Opposition for dealing with the important problemsinvolved, and by examining their effect upon the Commonwealth and the States and the attitude of the States and the people of Australia to these proposals. Such a review would prove beyond doubt that at the present juncture the proper procedure is to validate the agreement. What is the position which the Government occupies in regard to this matter? I submit that it is a very strong one. It comes to this House fresh from an election with its policy endorsed by a majority of the electorates. An important feature of the policy was the validation of this agreement. When I outlined at Grafton the financial policy for the Government I said If the referendum is accepted, the Government is pledged to validate the agreement, and thereafter the States will have an absolute guarantee of defined future assistance from the Commonwealth, and the Loan Council will be established on a permanent basis. As it has taken the experience of 27 years of federation and many years of pre-federal discussion to arrive at this agreement, the Commonwealth Government confidently appeals, not merely for an affirmative vote on the referendum, but for an endorsement of its policy in this regard. It will thus be seen that the matter was placed before the people in the most unequivocal terms. We asked not only for an affirmative vote on the referendum, but also for an endorsement of our policy. We came back, not only with this policy endorsed by a majority of the electors, but also with the agreement signed by all the State Premiers and ratified by all the State Parliaments. In addition, it has operated with universal satisfaction for nearly two years. The Government came back to Parliament with an amendment of the Constitution that was necessary to enable this agreement to be carried into effecta constitution amendment approved by a three to one majority in all the States, the actual figures being "" Yes"" 2,237,391, and "" No "" , 773,852. That demonstrates that the people of Australia strongly desire the permanent settlement of this vexed and doubtful question. The approval of the referendum and the return of this Government to power, together, provide a mandate for the validation of the agreement. In the United States of America, which has a federal system of government on all-fours with that of Australia, assent to any constitutional amendment by three-fourths of the State Parliaments is sufficient to carry that amendment. Here, we have a proposed constitutional amendment and an agreement which have been accepted by the Parliaments of all the States of Australia in every case by substantial majorities. The Government, therefore, has the authority both of the States and the people of Australia in proposing to validate this agreement. The position of the Opposition, however, is weak indeed. When the Leader of the Opposition and his party went before the people at the last elections, they placed this matter in the forefront of their policy. In his policy speech, the Leader of the Opposition saidThe carrying of the referendum will not r at if y the financial agreement entered into recently. The agreement w i ll come before the next Federal Parliament for acceptance or rejection. * * * * * * * We are not opposed to the granting of constitutional power to the Federal Parliament to make agreements for the consolidation of public debts and the control of borrowing. But, in the exercise of that power, we will make a new agreement with the States with respect to debts and will restore the per capita payments to the States. The electors rejected the Labour party's plans, and the honourable member was returned with a party of 31 members to a House numbering 75 members. The people of Australia, having heard both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, returned them to Parliament without changing their positions. The Leader of the Opposition now seeks to revive a dead issue. He comes to this House with a proposal, not to amend the agreement, but to destroy it. In that he has not the backing of one State Parliament or Government. The Government on the other hand, comes forward with an agreement, which has been approved and signed by every Premier in Australia. Although certain Labour Pre- miers supported the Leader of the Opposition in his election campaign, not one of them, when on the hustings, advocated a return to the per capita payments in lieu of the present financial agreement. The Leader of the Opposition possesses no mandate from the State Governments or the people in this matter, and in view of his position in the House he has no opportunity to negotiate with the States for a new agreement. His colleagues in the State Parliaments have stated distinctly that they regard the per capita payments as absolutely dead. Mr Hogan, the Premier of Victoria, when speaking on the subject, saidIn my opinion the agreement is better the States than the per capita payments. And, later, referring to the per capita payments, he statedTliat is a corpse; it is dead and buried.",50
246,Mr FENTON,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,That is not all that Mr years. Hogan said on that occasion.,52
247,Dr EARLE PAGE,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,It is what he said in regard to the per capita payalways ments.,52
248,Mr FENTON,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,I shall read the whole of his statement later ,52
249,Dr EARLE PAGE,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Mr Collier, the Premier of Western Australia, is reme ported at page 15 of Western Australian Hansard No. 3, as sayingHaving regard to the fact that the - pec capita payments have been consistently attacked by all governments and all parties in the Commonwealth Parliaments for many years past, it was inevitable that those ments had to go. No member will argue that the per capita payments were not doomed' be abolished. That is the attitude of a State Labour Premier. Later that gentleman gave the reasons for the attitude of the Federal Labour party. Mr Collier pointed out excise revenues. exactly why that party desires insecurity and not security in regard to the financial position of the States. He advanced exactly the same reason as was given the Leader of the Opposition to-night, who said that the Commonwealth liament must have f u ll control of revenue of the Commonwealth to opportunity enable unification to be brought in. agreement, as Mr Collier indicated, not an aid, but a distinct bar, to tion, because it gave definite safeguards to the States for at least a 58-year period. It is worthwhile briefly to survey position that was so theatrically described by the Leader of the Opposition today, when he charged the Prime ject Minister with misrepresenting the attiState tude of the Labour party in 1910, and its action in withdrawing Â£3,000,000 from the States. The honourable gentleman went to a great deal of trouble to show that it was an anti-Labour, and not a Labour Government which took that action. But he forgot to mention that the agreeof ment to which Mr Deakin and six members of State ministries subscribed their names did not anticipate the continuance of a per capita payment for a term for of ten years, but the incorporation of the per capita payments in the Constitution. That would have safeguarded the interests of the States for ever. But when the Labour party came into power, it limited the per capita payments to a term of ten Actually, the per capita system has been adopted as a last resort in settling such problems. The right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt), who for so many years ably helped to guide the destinies of Victoria, can bear out when I say that in practically all the discussions that took place between the Commonwealth and State Governments on this matter between 1901 and 1910, the States asked not for a per capita grant, but for the return of a certain proportion of the customs revenue. payAt one time the request was for threeto quarters of that revenue. In 1909, just a few months before the system of per capita payments came into force, the States asked not for such a system, but for three-fifths of the customs and They accepted the system of per capita payments only when it was found that the sands of the "" Braddon blot"" provision by were running out; that their constitutional safeguard was expiring, and that Parthe proposed per capita payments the afforded them the only practical to safeguard their finanThis cial interests. If one examines the was various suggestions that have been unificamade by different State Premiers from time to time one will find that, in 1905, a request was made that section 87 of the Constitution should be amended so as to make the Braddon clause perthe petual, and secure the return to the States of three-fourths of the revenue from customs and excise, and that, subto the foregoing, .the whole of the debts be taken over by the Commonwealth. Just as that resolution dealt primarily with the double problem of providing financial assistance to the States, and of the transference of State debts, so - and here the right honourable member for Balaclava, who was present at many these conferences can bear me outnearly every discussion that has taken place on these problems made no endeavour to separate the two matters. endeavour always was to settle them together.",52
250,Mr HUGHES,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,The honourable member for Balaclava was not then a member of this House.,53
251,Dr EARLE PAGE,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"He was then the Premier of Victoria, and knows exactly what occurred.",53
252,Mr WATT,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,They were separate problems.,53
253,Dr EARLE PAGE,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"I shall now quote from a resolution that was moved  South Australia, at a conference with State Premiers and Ministers. It was that In the opinion of the conference, the time is ripe for the Federal Parliament to consider the question of taking over the State debts and to apply the surplus revenue now secured under clause 87 of the Constitution towards paying interest on the debts. It will also be remembered that, in 1910, when the system of per capita payments was submitted to the people by referendum with the object of incorporating it in the Constitution, there was also submitted a separate question dealing with the taking over by the Commonwealth of all State debts. The two matters again appeared together. It is true that there was an agreement between the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth and the Premiers of the different States in 1909, which contemplated the perpetual financial security of the States by the continuance of the per capita payment of 25s.; but when the Labour party came into power in the Commonwealth Parliament in 1910, it gave the States security only for ten years. Incidentally, that Labour Government made the financial position of the States worse to the extent of Â£2,800,000. As against that, this Government has increased the payments to the States by no less than Â£900,000, and it is universally admitted that, at least for the next ten years, the financial position of the States will be better than heretofore. In addition to giving the States financial security, this agreement does not interfere with the lights of any State, as it is provided that if a mutual agreement can be arrived at between the Commonwealth and the several States, any new agreement may be substituted. The Mr Watt - It is unfair to say that in 1910 the Labour party dealt unfairly by the States. It accepted the decision of the people to limit the period of the per capita payments, and promised to bring the system into operation for a period of ten years, which it did.",53
254,Dr EARLE PAGE,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"I am not suggesting any unfair treatment by that Labour Government. I am simply pointing out the essential difference between the agreement that was then arrived at, and that which is now under discussion. At that time the agreement worsened the position of the States, whereas this agreement betters their position. I do not impute any blame to the Labour party, but merely state the facts.",53
255,Mr WEST,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,But the Prime Minister did.,53
256,Dr EARLE PAGE,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"I am simply dealing with my own case. What will be the position, if the agreement is rejected, as it will be if the amendment of the honourable member for Perth is carried*? That will mean that we must start out again on the rough and tempestuous sea on which we have been voyaging for the last 28 years, and again endeavour to find a satisfactory means for the taking over of the debts of the States, and securing that a certain amount of the revenue collected by the Commonwealth shall go to the States in lieu of the old customs and excise revenue, and the per capita payments which followed the original financial provision of the Constitution. If we contrast the schemes put forward by the Government and by the Opposition, we shall see how much more favourable to the States is that of the Government. The Government proposals are for the consolidation of the public debt and a common control of borrowing. There is at present in operation a control of borrowing by the Loan Council. This is acceptable to all the States, and has now worked successfully for five years. This principle is accepted by the Labour party, but if the agreement is rejected, the Labour party must devise a new and acceptable means of giving effect to their scheme for unified borrowing. In the provision of sinking funds, the Government is prepared to assist the States to a definite and substantial degree. Adequate sinking funds are to be created for the debts of the States, and we are to have a combined sinking fund, which will enable us to improve our credit in the money markets of the world. The Opposition says that sinking funds are useful and valuable, but they do not say how much they would be prepared to contribute to them. The Leader of the Opposition said that his party might be prepared to establish a sinking fund for past State debts, but he was silent as to what precisely they were prepared to do. H.e was not prepared to give assistance for sinking funds against future State debts. The proposition of the Labour party is a nebulous thing. The Leader of the Opposition asks Parliament to accept something which is in the clouds, instead of the clear and definite proposal of the Government. The three points of the agreement are financial assistance to the States, consolidation of existing debts with control of future borrowing, and the establishment of a sinking funds The Government's proposal is to provide assistance for 58 years on the basis of the per capita payments for the year 1926-27, which amounted to Â£7,585,000. The Commonwealth Government, however, is prepared to provide a proportion of the sinking fund, which will be a continually increasing amount. This means that ii factor in the payments to the States is the development of the States, and the claims of the less developed States for a greater degree of assistance are recognized. We propose to get away from the basis of the per capita payments, but to do so with a minimum of interference with the financial position of the States. That is the object of the agreement. The Commonwealth contribution to the State sinking funds will be in accordance with the amount of money borrowed. Our contribution to the Western Australian sinking fund on new debt incurred last financial year was Â£11,500, while to that of Victoria it was only Â£20,000. Victoria has four times as many people as Western Australia, but received only twice as much towards her sinking fund. This was because much of her developmental work has already been done, whilst Western Dr Earle Page. Australia has a great deal still to do. It is reasonable and proper that the Commonwealth. Parliament, which is responsible for the whole territory of Australia, should help by this means to bring about a united and progressive Commonwealth, and should aim to ensure, as far as possible, that the less developed States shall receive assistance which will enable them to develop their resources. - Mr HUGHES - Has the Treasurer figures showing what the Commonwealth will pay in ten years time?",53
257,Dr EARLE PAGE,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"I have the figures and shall give them presently. The Labour party has no such definite and detailed plan as that - submitted by the Government. It proposes, first, to restore the per capita payments; but that is the only definite proposal it makes. The Leader of the Opposition says that he would deal with the sinking fund and consolidation of debts in some way different from that proposed by the Government; but he does not say in what way. If the Labour party restored the per capita payments and made no contribution to the State sinking funds, the States would be Â£4,550,000 worse off than they would be under this agreement. The right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) interjected very pertinently, when this matter was being discussed by the Leader of the Opposition, that no State would accept the Labour party's proposition on such terms. Mr ScuxLiiir - What terms does the Treasurer mean?",54
258,Dr EARLE PAGE,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,Term s which make no provision for contribution by the Commonwealth Government to State sinking funds.,54
259,Mr SCULLIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,Nobod y proposed such terms.,54
260,Dr EARLE PAGE,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"The honourable member said that he did not know what he would do in regard to the sinking fund. He said that possibly something would be done at an early date, but did not indicate just what it was proposed to do.",54
261,Mr WATT,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,That was the one part on which the honourable member was a bit vague.,54
262,Dr EARLE PAGE,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"If the Leader of the Opposition proposes to contribute to the State sinking fund, as well as restore the per capita payments, it will he necessary for the Commonwealth Government to nnd Â£13,900,000 more during the next ten years than under the per capita system. Yet it has been said by the honourable member and his former leader that the present agreement is too liberal to the States, that it would tie up the Commonwealth revenues too much, and is dangerous from that point of view. If that be so, surely the Opposition cannot favour the giving of Â£13,900,000 more than the per capita payments during the next ten years. From the Commonwealth point of view, it is impracticable to restore the per capita payments, and, at the same time, contribute to the States sinking fund, while it would be impossible to induce the States to not take less than it is now proposed to give them under this agreement.",54
263,Mr SCULLIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,Canno t that be adjusted ?,55
264,Dr EARLE PAGE,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"The Leader of the Opposition asks whether the matter cannot, be adjusted; but he will not himself propose anything definite. The Government asks for the endorsement of an agreement in which everything is settled; in which every "" t "" is crossed and every "" i "" dotted. The Opposition, on the other hand, asks Parliament to tear up the agreement, and to start out again on an uncharted sea, with nothing to guide it. Let us contrast the security afforded the States by the Government's scheme with the uncertainty of the States' position under the proposals outlined by the Leader of the Opposition. In the Government's scheme a definite minimum payment of Â£7,585,000 a year is assured to the States for 58 years. The States are also assured of a sinking fund contribution towards past and future debts as well as of an increase of interest on the transferred properties. That is a minimum secured to them under the Constitution once this agreement has been ratified by Parliament. The States can have no security until this measure is passed; but, once the agreement has been ratified, they will be in a position of security as they have not occupied since federation. The Leader of the Opposition asks that, instead of giving them this definite security, we restore the per capita payments for ten years. I shall inform honourable members presently what the Labour Premiers have to say about that. The history of Labour in this country shows that its policy is to have the States dependent on the goodwill of the Commonwealth. The Leader of the Opposition put the position quite plainly when he said that his party could not stand for an agreement which tied the Commonwealth up in perpetuity, or for any term longer than ten years.",55
265,Mr SCULLIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,Why should we?,55
266,Dr EARLE PAGE,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,The Opposition objects to the agreement because it is a definite bar to unification.,55
267,Mr HUGHES,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,That is unfair. They did not say anything like that.,55
268,Mr SCULLIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,We said nothing of the kind.,55
269,Dr EARLE PAGE,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Mr Collier, the Labour Premier of Western Australia, is quite definite on the point. Here is what he saysMy opinion is that it does not at all aid towards unification. It is rather significant having regard to the Federal Labour Party platform, that if this agreement is a step towards unification, the Federal Labour Party should have opposed it . . . I submit that the agreement is a bar to unification and not an aid to it. Mr Butler, the Premier of South Australia, said much the same thing. He declared that if there was anything that would prevent unification, it was this agreement. The reason that the Labour party at the present time desires to prevent the validation of the agreement and the giving to the States a measure of constitutional and legal security, has been frankly exposed by members of that party. They have said that if the Labour party ever gets into power, it wants to use the Commonwealth revenues for its own purposes-socia l schemes and such things. It wishes to bring about unification, and its attempts in that direction would be handicapped if this agreement were in existence. The Leader of the Opposition joins with the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) in opposing this agreement; but the honourable such member for Perth is a State-righter, while the honourable member for Yarra says that he is a unificationist, and the agreement stands in the way of his proposals.",55
270,Mr SCULLIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,I never said that.,56
271,Dr EARLE PAGE,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,The honourable member's colleagues in Western Australia and New South. Wales have said it. Members of the Opposition say that they are prepared to pay the States 25s. per capita until such time as unification can be brought about.,56
272,Mr SCULLIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,That is a very different statement.  that this agreement will help the new State movement?,56
273,Dr EARLE PAGE,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"I think it will. This amendment, if carried, would destroy the agreement and would throw the financial relations between the States and Commonwealth into chaos. We should then have a blank sheet of paper, on which it would be necessary to start writing afresh.",56
274,Mr SCULLIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"It would be a clean sheet, anyway.",56
275,Dr EARLE PAGE,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"It would not be clean. It would be defaced by all the mistakes of the past and the gross breach of the present agreement if we failed to validate it. We have now an opportunity of getting rid for all time of the difficulties and antagonisms which past discussions of this problem have engendered. If this agreement is lost, we shall lose the benefit of unified borrowing, definite sinking funds, and the consolidation of the public debts. Labour believes that those things would be benefits if they could be brought about, but yet is prepared to attack them in order to defeat the agreement. It is prepared to wreck the thing which it admits is good, simply because it desires to alter what is a less important part of the agreement. I confidently urge the House to validate this agreement; first, because it has been accepted by the States, and because the machinery for varying it is contained in it and can be put into operation when the parties mutually desire; but chiefly because of the immense importance to Australia of the mobilization of her public credit. The danger of delay can be seen by what took place in 1910. In that year a referendum was carried favouring the taking over of State debts by the Commonwealth, but although this proposal was carried by a majority of hundreds of thousands, nothing was done, and nothing has been done up to the present time. Tho recent referendum has provided further evidence that there is an urgent desire among the public that the public debt problem shall be settled. In spite of this, the Leader of the Opposition tells us to delay still further. Delay in political matters is fatal. The people have twice expressed their desire that a settlement shall be come to. The Opposition counsels delay, but there is nothing to show that if we allowed this opportunity to pass any satisfactory agreement would be come to in our time. Some honourable members say that they are opposing this agreement on behalf of the States. They have no warrant for adopting that course, as I shall show by an examination of the attitude of the State Premiers and Parliaments. In the Tasmanian Parliament the agreement was accepted without debate or division. The Premier said that the State would receive Â£35,500 a year more than at present and pay annually Â£78,800 less to the sinking fund. In other words, Tasmania will gain by the agreement to the amount of Â£114,000 annually. The Premier of South Australia (Mr. Butler) said that his State was benefiting in 1927-28 by Â£35,000 and would benefit for at least ten years. He also said, "" It (the agreement) can do much more than the per capita payments ever did, and it is put on a permanent basis for 58 years."" The Premier of Queensland (Mr. MCCormack) stated that for the first six years there is an annual gain, and for ten years there is a gain of over Â£124,790. Mr Barnes (Opposition), referring to the argument, said, "" Every public man should do his best to get it carried."" Mr MCCormack interjected, "" Every political party should do its best to get it passed."" The Premier of Victoria (Mr Hogan) said that the revenue of that State would benefit immediately by Â£553,000 and that there would be an improvement over the per capita payments of Â£182,916. For ten years there would be a net increase of Â£685,000. He continuedI am satisfied that under this agreement the Commonwealth has no desire to involve the States in any financial difficulty or to embarrass them in any way, but is prepared to treat thorn with' absolute equity. In New South Wales the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Stevens) said there was a distinct financial advantage to his State of Â£595,185 for the first two years and in ten years a financial advantage of Â£1,602,633. He went on to sayThis Government signed the agreement believing it to be in the be9t interests of the States and the community generally. . . . I believe that in signing this agreement, we have acted in the best interests of the Parliament and the States; wo have adopted the national outlook; we have done something that will prepare the way for the binding together in closer relationship of the Commonwealth and States. We have done something that will ultimately improve our credit abroad, that will ell'ect appreciable savings in our interest bill,- and thus improve the capacity for development. Mr Collier, who, as Premier, must be accepted as the oflicial spokesman of Western Australia saidThis agreement is incomparably superior to anything that has ever been offered to us by the Federal Government or the Commonwealth Parliament previously. I think the agreement is undoubtedly more favourable to Wesconferences, tern Australia than to any other State. I would infinitely prefer the financial agreement tg the per capita payments, with possibility aud probability of those"" payments being abolished at auy time. He also said that, during the first fifteen years, Western Australia would receive under the agreement Â£745,000 more than it would have received under the per attention. capita system, after allowing for annual increase of 3 per cent, in populacouncil tion. Mr Collier submitted to his liament a table showing that the total benefit to Western Australia, including interest on cancelled debt and savings sinking fund contributions, would amount to Â£10^613,537 over a period of 30 years, or an average of Â£353,784 a year. The sinking fund contribution of 5s. on new debt provides for continuous increase in assistance to the States, and being based on the developbe mental needs of the States, is a valuable concession to those whose development backward. Thus Western Australia and Queensland, the less-developed States, would receive much more through this increased contribution to sinking fund than they would have received under the per capita system. In conclusion I suggest to honourable members that, in considering the agreeEconomic ment, we should foi-get those episodes of past history that are so frequently recalled in debate, and try to focus our attention on the future. If we put aside party issues and calmly and dispassionately examine the agreement, we will find that its merits areA fixed annual payment by the Commonwealth to the States of Â£7,585,000 for 58 years. Two shillings and sixpence sinking fund on original debt, equal to Â£801,000, for 58 years. Five shillings sinking fund on new debt, equal to Â£100,000 per annum for every Â£40,000,000 of new debt. Â£164,000 increased interest on transferred properties. Establishment of a permanent loan council for the management of debt and future borrowing of Australia. The transfer of State debts to the Commonwealth. In agreement with the States we have settled two contentious problems that have been discussed continuously throughout federation, namely, the transfer of State debts and financial assistance to the States. In view of the futility of earlier the attainment of an agreement with the States is, in itself, an the achievement of no mean magnitude. A feature of it is the establishment of properly-safeguarded sinking funds such as we have never had before. This is an essential adjunct of sound government finance to which lenders now pay special The benefits to be derived an from a permanently constituted loan to deal with all debts and borParrowings are immeasurable. The function of this body will be to avoid suicidal competition between governments in the in money market, such as, unfortunately, happened too frequently in the past. The financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States will be stabilized, and we have provided for immediate relief to the finances of the States. Above all, the a agreement will enhance Australia's credit so that substantial savings of interest will ultimately secured to the people through the issue of new and conversion is loans on better terms than would be possible in the absence of co-ordinated debt management and sinking fund provision. The agreement has been approved by the Parliaments and people of Australia, and has been the subject of most favourable comment by financial experts in London, New York and Australia. The British Mission, which recently visited Australia, strongly recommended it. Eor all these reasons I urge honourable members to vote for the bill so that Australia may reap the immeasurable benefits which considered and representative opinion declares will be the result of the adoption of the agreement.",56
276,Mr MAKIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Hindmarsh) [9.37] The special pleading of the Treasurer was pathetic, but was in keeping with his attitude on this subject since he first sought to impose upon this Parliament an agreement that is not a satisfactory adjustment of the relations of the Commonwealth and the States. His speech was far from convincing. He sought to make the House believe that the State Governments readily accepted the arrangement that is contained in the bill, but a perusal of the history of the negotiathe tions discloses that at the various conferences the State Premiers and Treasurers showed marked hostility towards it. Seeking to bend the State Governments to its will the Commonwealth Government took advantage of its statutory power to discontinue the per capita payments, and the representatives of the States were forced to negotiate a new arrangement with the knowledge that unless some alternative scheme were accepted their revenues would suffer seriously. Instead of the negotiations being conducted in an atmosphere of confidence and goodwill, there was evidence of strong resentment by the States of the domineering attitude of the Commonwealth. The State representatives realized, however, that in order to avoid financial chaos they must make the best of a bad situation. In seeking to make the House and the public believe that the State Premiers and Treasurers recognize special virtues in this agreement, he took to himself and the Government more credit than they deserve. The States have failed to recognize any merit in the agreement, but under duress they have made the best terms possible with a grasping Eederal Government, The honourable gentleman, when quoting from the speech made by Mr Collier, the Premier of ""Western Australia, did not include this statement made in the State Parliament on the 12th June lastThe State Premiers were faced with the position that the per capita payments had been abolished. In the light of that knowledge the State Premiers were required to assist in building up new relations with the Commonwealth. Mr Collier continuedAnd the Premiers had to decide whether they should constructively assist in framing an agreement in the interests of the States, so far as they might be able to influence the Commonwealth Government in that direction, or whether they should take whatever the Commonwealth Government or Parliament might decide to give to the States, if anything at all. Of course when the per capita payments were abolished the States were left at the will of any Commonwealth Government of the day as to what they might contribute to the States in future, or whether they would contribute anything at all. Those remarks do not indicate that the Premier of Western Australia accepted willingly and heartily the proposal which Eederal Treasurer was pressing upon the States. Mr Eorgan Smith, who was Acting Premier of Queensland and attended some of the conferences between the representatives of the Commonwealth and the States said- : The Queensland Government has very carefully considered the proposals submitted by the Federal Government, and whilst not retreating in any way from its attitude in regard to the withdrawal of the per capita payment, is prepared to accept, with amendments, the underlying principles of the scheme. The Queensland Ministry felt that the only course open to it was to accept this agreement and, if possible, try to get it amended. If in ordinary life we were asked to make an agreement in similar circumstances, we should regard the other party as bushrangers. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have both carefully and adroitly evaded making any comment upon the outspoken utterance of Sir William MCPherson, Premier and Treasurer of the State of Victoria, who is reported in the Victorian Hansard of the 15th December, 1927, to have saidIf the agreement is ratified, we shall make a great mistake and the development of all the States will be seriously retarded. No more damning indictment of the financial agreement could be uttered. As a matter of fact,, all who hold responsible positions in the various States have been emphatic in their opposition, to the withdrawal of the per capita payments, and this Parliament would be wanting in its duty if it did not warn the present Government that if it continues to impose unfair conditions on the States, neither those who are responsible for the administration of the affairs of the States nor those entrusted with the control of Commonwealth affairs will be satisfied. It is an iniquitous idea to bind the States and the Commonwealth for the period of 58 years, imposing on citizens yet unborn an obligation in respect of which they have had no voice. I always deprecate any suggestion of repudiation, but in this case I feel that future Governments will have a very strong incentive to rectify the wrong that is being done by the present Government. The Treasurer utterly failed in his endeavour to place upon past Labour administrations the responsibility for certain steps that have been taken to define the financial relations of the monwealth and the States. As a matter of fact, the unfairness of his comments called forth strong protest from some honourable members on his own side. The Treasurer never deals with the merits of the matter under consideration at the moment. He spends his time in trying to show there is some sinister motive behind the criticism of the Opposition, and in trying to relieve himself of responsibilities which should rightly be his. It was refreshing to note his failure to prove a worthy defender of his own chief. With the present Ministry it is evidently a case of each man for himself. When he was asked if he would stand by a statement made by the Prime Minister with .reference to the attitude of a past Government that was Labour in complexion, he said "" I am speaking for myself."" That was clearly an admission of the unreliable and misleading nature of the Prime Minister's words, the incorrectness of which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) had already exposed by documentary evidence. All that the Treasurer did to try to exonerate his own leader from the charge of misrepresentation was to show that in 1910 the States had asked for more than was provided for in the agreement made by them with the Deakin Government. The Treasurer claims that because the Government came back after the elections with a majority in this House, its financial proposals had the endorsement of the electors, but no one by any stretch of imagination could make that deduction. At the last election, as at the previous one, the battle cry of the Government on a thousand platforms was the maintenance of law and order and industrial peace, and the financial agreement was lost to sight. It is, therefore, unreasonable for the Treasurer to say that his financial proposals were endorsed by the electors. Does he forget that every honourable member returned to this House to represent Western Australian constituencies is pledged to oppose the Financial Agreement Bill?",58
277,Mr BRENNAN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,Will each of them stand up to his pledge?,59
278,Mr MAKIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"It will be interesting to note in the immediate future whether Com- the declarations of those honourable gentlemen will .be consistent with the votes they record on this validating bill. The Treasurer can get very little satisfaction from the total figures cast for the various parties at the last election. The total Labour vote was 1,422,418, not including certaiu votes which are now the subject of litigation before the Court of m Disputed Returns. The Country party's candidates received 291,567 votes, and those of the Nationalist party 1,157,602. For Independent candidates 34,246 votes were cast, but they were certainly not anti-Labour votes and ought reasonably to be added to the total votes cast for Labour candidates. In these circumstances it is clear that honourable members of the Opposition are more entitled than are honourable members on the Government side of the chamber to declare that they voice the will of the majority of the people of Australia. Further evidence that this proposal did not meet with the approval of the people is provided in the fact that ten members on the ministerial side of the House in the last Parliament lost their seats at the recent election, eight of them to candidates standing in the interests of the Labour party. If the Treasurer advanced that as an argument in support of his case, he would make himself a laughing stock of the community.",59
279,Mr BEASLET,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,Anothe r such victory by the Government would bring about its downfall.,59
280,Mr MAKIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Quite so. I have received a telegram from the Register, one of the leading daily newspapers of Adelaide, to the effect that serious concern is felt in South Australia because the Government is - proceeding with the consideration of this bill without waiting for the presentation of the report of the South Australian Disabilities Commission. Unquestionably, that report should be considered before the financial agreement is ratified; otherwise the interests of the State may be seriously prejudiced. That a South Australian newspaper, which lent considerable support to ministerial candidates at the recent elections, should express such hostility to the policy of the Government in this regard, is significant. It is surely not unreasonable to ask the Government to await the receipt of this report before it rides roughshod over the claims that have been advanced for financial assistance for South Australia to offset the disadvantages she has suffered through federation.  port is ready, but the Government appears to be afraid to consider it.",60
281,Mr MAKIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"If that is so, it is dalous. The deliberate withholding of a report of this description in these circumstances should bring upon the Government the wholehearted condemnation of every right-thinking person. The adoption of such tactics would be most unworthy. The Premier of South Australia, Mr R. L. Butler, has forwarded me a statement to the effect that if this agreement is ratified, South Australia's disability due to federation will be at least a further Â£750,000 per annum. Provision should be made in the bill to recoup South Australia and other States in a similar position, against such losses. In all the circumstances, the Government is entirely unjustified in obliging us to deal with this measure with such indecent haste. The financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States are most complex. The difficulty of solving some of the problems involved in this question hindered the consummation of federation for many years. If the responsible Ministers of the respective governments of the Australian colonies were unable for so long before federation to agree upon even a temporary settlement of these issues, it is not reasonable to expect us, satisfactorily, to solve the problem for the next 58 years after a debate lasting a few hours. I am quite confident that the people will not approve of such a hurried settlement. I am not a great advocate of State rights. I prefer to see the larger interests of the people of the Commonwealth advanced. But so long as our Constitution remains as it is we must recognize that the States have certain rights which should be preserved. There is another reason why any agreement we may reach in attempting to settle this vexed question should not be for such an extended term as 58 years. It is generally admitted by students of political economy, that the remoulding of the Commonwealth Constitution, is long overdue. Very early in his political life, the Treasurer strongly advocated the remodelling of our present governmental system by the creation of new States. But when his party became associated with the Nationalists and a composite Government was formed, instead of immediately moving in the direction of providing a means for the creation of new States, he scansaid that the Government would hold a constitutional session of Parliament at which this subject, which he had always regarded as of outstanding importance, would be discussed. That promise has never been fulfilled. If the Treasurer is still of the opinion that new States should be formed, it is difficult to understand how he can support an agreement in which provision is made for the control of Commonwealth and Statefinancesover a period of 58 years, and which may interfere most seriously with the new State movement, of which he is supposed to be an ardent supporter. The amendment of the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann), which provides for a continuance of the per capita payment for a further period of ten years, when the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States can be further reviewed,"" must commend itself to all honourable members. In view of all the circumstances, I intend to oppose this measure at every stage, and I trust that when there is a change of Government, which I hope will be at no distant date, the new Government will have sumcient courage and determination to see that the rights of the States are recognized and fully conserved.",60
282,Mr FENTON,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Maribyrnong) [10.15]. - It is surprising to me that honourable members opposite, particularly some of those who have stressed the importance of this measure are not willing to continue the debate. An honourable member opposite who, I believe, expected to receive the call, left the chamber, after a conversation with the Minister. In view of the opinions expressed in this House by Ministers and some of their supporters, I do not know how they intend to justify their support of the bill. I wish, to refer at the outset to the manner in which the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) introduced this subject, very important measures have been introduced into the Federal Parliament by Prime Ministers and other Ministers, but I do not know of any occasion on which there has been greater misrepresentation of the attitude of the Labour party than there has been in connection with this bill. I was very glad to hear the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) unwind the Prime' Minister as effectively as he did this afternoon and prove conclusively that the right honourable gentleman had used arguments that were absolutely misleading. An ineffective apology was offered a little later by the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) who, instead of amplifying the Prime Minister's utterances, or attempting to defend his assertions, slunk away as soon as he was assailed by the Leader of the Opposition. The debate on this measure has proved that the Prime Minister is one of the most unreliable public men in the Commonwealth. If the newspapers deal fairly with the discussion on this measure, the people outside who have stood behind the Prime Minister so assiduously in the past, will in future relinquish their support. A message has been despatched to Ministerial supporters to be present in sumcient numbers to enable the measure to be passed.",61
283,Mr A GREEN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,And they have also been instructed how to vote.,61
284,Mr FENTON,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"In the Ministerial - caucus room the Prime Minister outlines what he proposes, and immediately his supporters bow and agree to his sugges[34] tions. One cannot refrain from describing them as dumb driven cattle. Bather than occupy the position they do, I should prefer to retire from public life. While for months past a certain section of the members on the Ministerial side of the House have opposed the agreement, because of some pressure, political or otherwise, they have now been forced into the position of supporting this measure. The division on the second reading will, no doubt, disclose that they are not now prepared to stand for the principles that they advocated for so many years, preferring to slink behind their fellow members in order to form a majority with which to carry the bill. I cannot conceive of any honourable member, whose desire is for this great country of ours to progress, binding this Parliament to a certain proposal for a period of 58 years. The Treasurer said today that he was still in favour of new states, but how will he re-adjust the financial arrangements of the States when other states are created ? It appears to me that honourable members supporting the Government are afflicted with what might be termed the "" State-rights"" microbe. Some of them are voting for this measure because it will to a certain extent preserve the rights and privileges of the States for a period of nearly 60 years. I am no States' lighter. The present boundaries should be regarded by this National Parliament as imaginary, and I hope the day is not far distant when Australia will be divided into a number of provinces under a system similar to that in operation in Canada.  party's platform ?",61
285,Mr FENTON,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"The honourable member well knows the Labour party's platform. We do not call ourselves unificationists. When new states are created, I do not know how the Treasurer will re-adjust the financial arrangements. I leave that to the imagination of his most peculiar brain. I doubt whether his efforts in that direction will be more successful than they have been in evolving other financial schemes. When speaking to-night he posed as a wonderful financial magician; he was the man of all men in Australian who could propound schemes under which Australia would advance by leaps and bounds! We have only to look back for three years to ascertain how far Australia has descended financially. Instead of the huge surpluses of the past we now find ourselves in a serious financial position. Our public works are being curtailed, and unemployment is rife throughout Australia. It is evident that the Treasurer's financial forecast will not be realized, and that Australia will be in arrears considerably over Â£3,000,000 at the end of this financial year.",61
286,Mr WATT,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,Does the honourable member mean in addition to last year's deficit?,62
287,Mr FENTON,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Yes . At the end of last financial year the estimate of revenue was short by Â£2,500,000. The Treasurer budgeted for an increase in customs revenue of over Â£1,000,000, and up to date that estimate is Â£1,000,000 short. Therefore, at the end of this financial year we shall probably have a deficit of Â£3,000,000. I do not blame the Treasurer alone for that; but if he is inefficient he should be removed from his present office. During a speech that I made some time ago in this House I drew attention to the fact that the present Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Gullett), when a private member, had referred to the Treasurer as the most tragic Treasurer Australia had ever had. I also remarked that it might happen that associated with that tragic Treasurer we might have a tragic Minister for Trade and Customs. That prediction has come true; they are working side by side today. should like to hear the view of the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr. Watt) on the financial agreement, because I am expecting that his speech will not be altogether in favour of the bill. Whether he has had influences brought to bear upon him in respect of his vote, remains to be seen. I think that he will agree with me that it is difficult to understand why the comparatively small item of transferred property should be mixed up in the agreement.",62
288,Mr WATT,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,That is the only bit of humour in it.,62
289,Mr FENTON,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"The agreement includes transferred properties, such as post offices, customs houses, defence buildStates ings, and, I believe, some vacant land whioh was taken over at federation. They were then valued at Â£10,000,000. For about 28 years we have been paying to the States interest at 3Â£ per cent, on those transferred properties. It requires only a little calculation to show that the amount of interest we have paid is almost equal to.the value of the properties. I take it that the rate of interest will now be 5 per cent, instead of 3^ per cent.",62
290,Mr WATT,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,'In fairness to the States the rate should have been increased years ago.,62
291,Mr FENTON,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Wit h an overflowing Treasury, which the Commonwealth has enjoyed for many years, sound financiers would have seen that those properties were paid for and the transaction closed. To continue the account for a further 58 years is stupid. Already on assets valued at Â£10,000,000 we have paid over Â£7,000,000 in interest. When the Financial Agreement Bill was before this Parliament last year, the then Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) moved the following amendment to the motion that the bill be read a second timeThat all the words after the word ""That"" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:-""the bill, involving as it does an alteration of the Constitution, be postponed until Parliament has had an opportunity to discuss a comprehensive scheme of constitutional reform, including the evidence taken before the royal commission now sitting and its proposals when made."" The report of the royal commission to I which he then referred is not yet before us. No honourable member is prepared to say that the agreement has been voluntarily entered into by any State Premier or Treasurer. The first proposals of the Commonwealth were not entertained by the ' State Premiers, and consequently, fresh proposals had to be submitted to them. That those proposals were accepted is. no evidence that the State Premiers and Treasurers agreed with them. They accepted them only under compulsion. Referring to the agreement, Mr Hogan, when Premier of Victoria, saidOn the 2nd March of this year the Prime Minister proceeded with the Bill providing for the abolition of the per capita payments, and this bill was agreed to by both Houses on 22nd March, 1927 (Act No. 4 of 1927). The were thus finally deprived of any share of the customs and excise revenue. . . Act No. 4 of 1927 had been passed by the Commonwealth Parliament and its action was constitutional. The per capita payments were to be stopped after this year, and the Commonwealth was tendering a promissory note for handing over a mythical surplus. This Govermnent, as well as other State Governments, had to make the best of the situation. Mr Collier, the Premier of Western Australia, has spoken to the same effect. I propose also to quote certain remarks made by Sir William MCPherson - when Leader of the Opposition in the Victorian Parliament. Speaking of one conference which he attended as Treasurer of Victoria, Sir William MCPherson saidThe Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) came to the conference in- I do not want to say anything that is not correct- a not very conciliatory mood. He said, "" We are determined that this per capita grant shall cease."" The Premiers felt that they had to do something. Admittedly, the Federal Parliament had it in their power to abolish the per capita grant. . . . . The Premier referred last night to a statement made by the Queensland Premier that the States practically agreed in 1923 to the abolition of the per capita grant. We were driven to do it. We were told that the per capita grant would be taken away. We had no choice in the matter. ""But,"" we said, "" if you are going to do that, get out of the field of direct taxation altogether.""",62
292,Mr WATT,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"They did not agree to anything of the kind in 1923. Mr Fenton"" - I have not quoted the whole of Sir William MCPherson's remarks. In financial matters consideration must be given to the smaller States. New South Wales and Victoria, being large manufacturing States with comparatively large populations, naturally, in a better financial position than are some of the smaller and less populated States. Those big States, through their representatives in the Federal Parliament, will always be willing to come to the rescue of the smaller and less fortunately situated States, irrespective of the terms of any financial agreement that may be entered into. That is only fair and just. Sir William MCPherson, in speaking of the decisions arrived at by the Loan Council, went on to sayThe Commonwealth, plus two of the smaller States, namely, Western Australia, which has, I think,' a population of 320,000, and Tasmania, which has a population of about 250,000, can together outvote Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia, which together have a population of 5,500,000. That does not seem to be right to ine. I do not like placing ourselves practically in pawn to the Loan Council. That deals with a different aspect of the problem, to which I shall direct myself on a later occasion. It is unnecessary for me to quote from the speech delivered by the Prime Minister, as that was effectively answered by the Leader of the Opposition. It is difficult to define the position of the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) in this matter. I do not think that he has made a definite speech on the subject. But, judging from his occasional remarks, one may reasonably assume that the honourable member is decidedly uneasy about the terms of the agreement. As is well known, he voted against the Government when the Labour party endeavoured to postpone the ratification of this agreement. Now, according to the press, to which I do not always pay serious attention, the honourable member has been convinced that it is the right thing to vote for the agreement. I shall defer my criticism on that prophecy until a vote is taken on the second reading. The honourable member for Forrest (Mr. Prowse) delivered a fairly strong speech against the agreement, which I shall not quote, and declared that he intended to make his position perfectly clear before his electors. I gather, from interjections that have been made, that seven or eight of the twelve members now representing South Australia and Western Australia are averse to the ratification of the agreement. The are, vote on the second reading will disclose whether any conversations have taken place. The present Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Gullett) last year had something to say about the financial agreement, as may be gathered by a reference to page 4011 of Hansard, No. 28, of the 21st March, 1928. In the course of a short s]jeech the honourable gentleman said It may be remembered that I strongly favour a substantial reduction of revenue duties, and that I am also very sympathetic towards a reduction of excise. I look forward to seeing the customs and excise duties substantially less than at present. If that hope is realized, the States would be in an even worse position than they are in today.",63
293,Mr WATT,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,Did the honourable gentleman then show how a drop in the customs and excise reveuue would directly affect the States?,63
294,Mr FENTON,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"No . He stated that he was favourable to a substantial reduccriticize tion of revenue duties, and very thetic towards a reduction of excise. He continuedI look upon the whole agreement as purely of a temporary nature; otherwise, I sliould not have supported the second reading. I do not, for one moment, anticipate that it w i ll last 58 years. The original provision for paying the States three-quarters of the customs revenue lasted for only ten years after federation, while the vcr capita payments operated for eighteen years. It seems logical, therefore, to assume that this agreement will stand only until the people, in their own generation, decide to alter it . I know of nothing more absurd than that this House should attempt solemnly to legislate for 58 years ahead in the supremely important realm of finance. If I thought that the agreement would last for that term I should not view it as favourably as I now do. It is merely a good temporary arrangement.",64
295,Mr BRENNAN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,Where is the honourable gentleman now?,64
296,Mr FENTON,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"I do not know. Some have said that "" Gullett has been golloped.""",64
297,Mr SPEAKER,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,Order !,64
298,Mr FENTON,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"I prefer that the honourable gentleman should be present in this chamber, as it is rather depressing to maUe quotations from the speech of an honourable member who is absent. Perhaps I should have sent for the honourable members for Fawkner and Forrest before referring to their views. I have read the statement of the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett), who is now Minister for Trade and Customs. What attitude will he adopt when the vote is taken on the second reading of the bill? He describes Dr Earle Page as a tragic Treasurer; but apparently we have a tragic Minister for Customs, too. He went on to say on the occasion to which I have referredThe Treasurer referred again to the effect this agreement would have in enhancing the credit of the Commonwealth. I strongly deprecate these highly-coloured assurances as to the effect which the agreement will have upon the credit of the Commonwealth, in either reducing the interest rates or improving our credit abroad. It is a pity that that aspect of the agreement has been so greatly exaggerated. If I were to say such things about the Treasurer, my statements would be dismissed as being inspired by political prejudice; but that was said by a man who is now Minister for Customs in the present Government. He then went on to by inference the financial sympamanagement of this GovernmentMore important than the machinery by which we borrow and repay money, is the use to which w e ' put it , and We shall be judged by the world not for our sinking funds and arrangements for borrowing, but by the purposes to which we devote money when it is for lent to us. That our credit in the world stands relatively low in comparison with that of other British dominions is not because of the absence of sinking funds or of inefficient borrowing machinery, but because of the rate of our expenditure in recent years and the extent to which the money has been employed upon unprofitable works. Some honourable members on the otherside are continually turning mental somersaults. What inducement, I wonder, is held out to them to change their opinions, and sacrifice their principles? If the honourable member for Henty votes for this agreement, which is the same agreement against which he spoke last year, how will he reconcile his action with his previous utterances? I presume that he will vote with the Government without giving honourable members, or his constituents, any reason for his change of attitude. I think that it is due to honourable members of this House to know why he has changed hisopinion. As an Australian, and one who believes in the progress of Australia, I protest against a proposal to tie up therevenues of the Commonwealth for 58 years ahead. Such action would be criminal. It would not be in the interests of the people as a whole. The electors, I believe, have now realized which party stands for the real national interests. I presume that honourable members oppositehave already made up their minds as to'how they shall vote. Honourable members of that party who were inclined to be recalcitrant have been brought to heel. It would be interesting to know the process by which this was done. Their credit in the eyes of their constituentswill not be enhanced - by this performance, for it must be evident to those whom they represent that they cannot be relied upon. The State will benefit under the agreement for only the first few years; after that the revenue they will derive under it will steadily diminish. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) has reduced his estimate of the total losswhich will be sustained by the States. He said at first that it would be over Â£300,000,000; but he has now accepted the Attorney-General's estimate of Â£158,000,000. In my opinion, it will be greater than that. The estimate of the honourable member for Perth was made, not by himself, but by a qualified statistician. It is clear from the calculations of the statistician that the States are likely to lose nearer Â£380,000,000 than Â£150,000,000. Even according to the figures used by the Attorney-General they will lose at least the latter sum. The representatives of the States were between the devil and the deep sea, and they accepted, under duress, what the Commonwealth, offered, fearing that if they refused they would get nothing. Mr. Hogan, Mr MCCormack, Mr Collier, and Mr Forgan Smith have stated, "" We were forced into the agreement and we had to make the best of a bad situation."" An arrangement made under those conditions is not likely to prove lasting. Debate (on motion by Mr Watt) adhuman nature. journed. ADJOURNMENT. MONDAY SITTING-DIVISIO N BELLS.",64

I think that some notice of the Government's intention to propose an additional sitting day might have been given to us. I have no objection to sitting an extra day, but the Government has not acted fairly in springing this change upon us without warning. I understood that this week and next week the House would meet on Tuesday and in the following week on Monday.

The right honourable gentleman knows perfectly well that it is a matter of great importance to members the Opposition that they shall attend regularly in this House on all sitting days, and they are quite prepared to do so, but they have also obligations in their constituencies - I , like other honourable - members, have made public engagements in accordance with what I understood would be the sitting days of this House In the past, it has House been customary to give to honorbut able members ample notice of any enchange so that when they returned to their constituencies they could of arrange their public engagements acI f the Prime Minister replies to this complaint, that the Opposition members have expressed a desire to sit here :aid work, such a retort will quite unworthy and unjust. Our objecbe tion is that great confusion and inconat venience will result if the House is to meet on Monday next without adequate uotice, thus causing honourable members to break engagements they have made. The inconvenience will be greater by reason of the fact that, because of the extra sitting days, the opportunities attending to public business in our elecdifference. torates have been reduced to a minimum. Apparently the Prime Minister has not even consulted the Leader of the OpposiState tion in regard to the Monday sitting, but it is not too late for him to tell the House that he will have regard for the conSaturday, venience of members on both sides, unless of course his own supporters were taken into his confidence earlier. I ask to reconsider his decision.",65

I quite appreciate the necessity for honourable members sitting here until their work done. If it is the intention to rise the 22nd instant, or even at a later date, be I am sure that honourable members will willing to sit in the mornings or later night. I suggest, however, that when drastic alterations of the sitting days are to be made the Opposition should be consulted, or at least notified. The alteration of the first sitting day of the week from Wednesday to Tuesday made very little difference, but the further change from for Tuesday to Monday makes a great deal of It prevents quite a large number of honourable members from doing any work in their constituencies or in the capitals.

We can sit in the come as a mornings if necessary.  [11.14] - I think it was last Friday that the Prime Minister said, that in order that honourable members should not be inconvenienced, he would give them due is notice that the House would meet ou on Tuesdays. Every honourable member left Canberra with the full understanding that the Prime Minister was consulting the convenience of the House and the fact was appreciated. I took it for granted, as I think every other honourable member did, that the arrangement was to continue until the rising of Parliament.  able members opposite were anxious to Bit late.  that the honourable member is not expressing the view of the Government. Honourable members of the Opposition have rightly taken objection to a reecnt curtailand ment of their privileges, and I hope that this announcement by the Prime Minister is not in the nature of a step of retaliation. The people will not be impressed by it. An extra sitting day will not help the Government very much in its desire to deal with certain work before Easter. The real question at issue is that honourable members are entitled to ordinary courtesy. It strikes me that' the step taken by the Government is an act of reprisal for the attitude taken up by the Opposition. It is certainly no credit to the Government. I distinctly remember the Prime Minister saying on Friday last, that he desired to give honourable members due notice of the Tuesday sittings, so that they might make their arrangements. At any rate, we left Canberra with the distinct understanding that the House would meet on Tuesdays, but now we are told that that arrangement is all off, and that the House is to meet next Monday. It is a distinct act of discourtesy. I remind the right honourable gentleman that honourable members of the Opposition can retaliate. The proposal of the Opposition is that Parliament should continue its sittings after Easter. We strongly object to a recess of five months. If the Government is right in saying that it has a full programme of work to be done, it will make very little progress by asking the House to sit on an extra day. The proper way for the Government to get through its programme is to ask the House to resume after Easter. Only in that way can it satisfy the people that it is not shirking its duties. I resent this breach of faith on the part of the Prime Minister, who gave us a distinct undertaking at the last week end that in future the House was to meet on Tuesdays. I trust that some other motive is actuating the Prime Minister than that of retaliating on the Opposition for the criticism offered by it.  not regard the announcement made by the Prime Minister as an act of discourtesy to honourable members. It is somewhat interesting to hear the suggestion of some honourable members, who live practioally adjacent to Canberra who are privileged to get to their homes each week end, that we should meet after Easter. They forget that other honourable members live in distant States, and have to remain in Canberra for the whole of the session, I think that the Government can get through its programme by Easter, if we sit each day without working late at night. It is ungenerous .of honourable members who live reasonably close to Canberra to adopt this attitude. Evidently they would not mind bringing members who live in distant States back here to finish up a little business that could be done before the adjournment. This is only Wednesday so I think it may be said that the Prime Minister has given reasonable notice of the proposed Monday sitting.",66
307,Mr BRUCE,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [11.21],- I regret that the suggestion has been made that I have been guilty of discourtesy to. honourable gentlemen opposite. The even more unworthy suggestion has. been put forward that my proposal was inspired by some desire to adopt retaliatory measures for something that honourable gentlemen opposite may have done. The honourable member for Hume (Mr. Parker Moloney) even charges me with a breach of faith. There is no justification for any of these accusations. Whatever may be my faults, I . have always endeavoured to act courteously towards honourable members opposite. T certainly would not be led into the adoption of measures of a retaliatory character as has been suggested. This is Wednesday, so I think it may be said that I have given fair notice of the proposed Monday sitting. A number of honourable members must have known last night that the Government was considering whether it would or would not be necessary to sit on Monday. The Secretary of the Joint Committee on Public Accounts telephoned me this morning to ascertain whether the House would sit on Monday next. I informed him that it would, and that he could so advise his committee. Honourable members from both sides of the House are members of that committee, and they must have known yesterday that there was a likelihood of the House being palled together on Monday. I told the Leader of the Opposition this afternoon that we should be meeting on Monday. I have, therefore, done everything that I could reasonably do to meet the convenience of honourable members. One honourable member observed that I informed the House last week that it was proposed to meet ou Tuesday of this week, Tuesday of next week, and Monday of the following week in order to dispose of the business which the Government deaired to do before Easter; but I remind honourable members opposite that they upset that arrangement somewhat by taking up the whole of last Friday in discussing a motion which was given precedence over Government business, but which, nevertheless, prevented the Government programme from being carried out.",67
308,Mr SCULLIN,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,The Prime Minister could have given this notice on Friday last.,68
309,Mr BEUCE,EINANCI AL AGREEMENT,"I was somewhat precluded from doing that because of certain tactics that were adopted at the close of last Friday's sitting. I have never been guilty of any intentional discourtesy to honourable . members opposite. I have always endeavoured to meet the convenience of honourable members on both sides of the chamber. I am quite prepared to discuss with the Leader of the Opposition whether it would be convenient or otherwise to meet in the mornings instead of adding to the sitting days. I shall also take the opportunity of discussing with him the measures which the Government, proposes to bring forward before the end of the session. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.20 p.m.",68
