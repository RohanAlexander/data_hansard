2,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: Broadcasting and Television To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That because television and radio (a) affect our social and moral environment, (b) are family media watched and heard by many children at all times, and (c) present too much explicit violence and sex, they therefore need stronger control than other media and the existing standards need stricter enforcement in both national ABC, and commercial sectors. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray: That the Australian Government will amend the Broadcasting and Television Act, in relation to both national and commercial broadcasters, to legislate (a) for adequate and comprehensive programs in the best interests of the general public, (b) for a 'Dual System of Regulation' enforced by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal by internal regulation and external control, (c) for an independent consumer body to represent the best interests of the general public, and (d) for immediate and effective penalties to be imposed for breaches of program and advertising standards. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Connolly, Dr Edwards, Mr Hurford, Mr MCLeay and Mr Morris. Petitions received. Tertiary Education Assistance To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned students, parents, teachers and citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the decision of the Government to withdraw all forms of financial assistance to students of non-State tertiary institutions in the main, business with stated Government education policy. The decision will result in a shortage of places for training secretarial and clerical students and an inordinate demand upon the State Government technical education systems. At a time of severe economic disruption, this action must lead to an unnecessary worsening of the current employment situation for school leavers. Your petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government will aa immediately to reverse its decision. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Connolly, Dr Jenkins and Mr Keating. Petitions received. Rhodesia To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House PETITIONS of Representatives in the Parliament assembled, the humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth: That the Charter of the United Nations clearly precludes it from interference in the domestic affairs of a country or from obstructing the free transmission of news and information between individuals and between nations. That the United Nations, in apparent illegality, has imposed many restrictions and sanctions upon Rhodesia which has been remarkably free from the bloodshed and turmoil of Nonhern and Central African lands, even to the extent now of actively encouraging armed conflict against the legally elected Government of Rhodesia. Lord Graham as Minister of External Affairs and Defence has said: 'International Communism is our enemy, all this talk of political advancement and majority rule is no more than a smokescreen in the early skirmishes of an assault upon die whole of Africa . . . It is even difficult to see this enemy because it is not merely attacking us, but on a broad front is attacking the whole world order, its standards, its law and order, its moralities, its churches, its patriotisms, its philosophies, and even much of its learning . . .' That Communist Chinese infiltration in much of Africa over many years, and Cuban communist troops reported to number 25 000 are dominating nearby Angola, and possess modern missiles etc. It is urgent that Mozambique, now under communist domination and which has a common border with Rhodesia, does not receive any further aid from the Commonwealth Government of Australia, which has benefited mainly, the terrorist guerilla movements that are responsible for the deaths of many Rhodesian people. It is urgent for the Australian people to determine for themselves, the actual facts of the Rhodesian struggles. It is urgent that the Senate and the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled, will observe common justice and proper humanity by inviting only authorised representatives of the present Government of Rhodesia to Australia, to do what they have been deprived to do previously, present their case fully and publicly so that this can be examined and tested, without interference, and so that the eventual impact on Australia's own security and defence alliances can be gauged with better accuracy. Your petitioners request urgent action to be taken immediately. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Carige and Mr MCVeigh. Petitions received. colleges, is in total conflict Australian Association for Better Hearing To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of certain members of the Australian Association for Better Hearing, and other citizens of Australia, respectfully showeth that afinancialburden is imposed on hearing impaired members of the public in that the special telephone equipment, which is essential for such hearing impaired citizens to make telephonic communication, is subject to installation costs and rental charges. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Federal Government give every considerauon to waiving the installation costs and rental charges of the special telephone equipment required by hearing impaired members of the public.

Gambling Casino in Canberra To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the eliminating undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the establishment of a gambling would debase the National Capital and increase crime in Canberra. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled, should seek to preserve the dignity of the National Capital by disallowing sumer any ordinance to authorise the establishment of a gambling lar casino in Canberra. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Falconer. Petition received. Private Nursing Homes Subsidies To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That many pensioners who are holders of the Pensioners Health Benefit Card, have suffered undue hardship as inmates of private nursing homes, because the Federal Government subsidy was insufficient to meet the charges as laid down. Many pensioners whose spouse was an inmate of the private nursmg homes suffered poverty in an endeavour to sustain their partner while in the nursing home. Only in rare cases was the statutory minimum patient contribution as laid down adhered to. c That the telephone was pensioners, but because of the cost of installation of die telephone many are unable to afford the installauon. That those pensioners who have only their pension and very little else to live on and are forced to pay high rents, are in many cases living in extreme poveny. The foregoing facts impel your peutioners to ask the Australian Government as a matter of urgency to1. Make sure that subsidies paid to private nursing homes are such that each pensioner holding a Pensioners Health Benefit Card will pay the private nursmg home no more than the statutory minimum patient contribution, which will allow $6 per week to be retained by the pensioner patient for their personal use. 2. That a pensioner holding a Pensioner Health Benefit Card shall have a telephone installed free of charge, or at a very nominal charge. 3. That those pensioners who have their pension and very litde else to live on, shall receive a subsidy to assist them. The subsidy to be governed by a means test. And your peutioners as in duty bound will ever pray, Metric System by Mr Fry. Petition received. Pensions and To Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parhament assembled the peddon of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the delays between the announcements of each quarterly movement in the Consumer Price Index and their application as a percentage increase in age and invalid pensions is excessive, unnecessary, discriminatory and a cause of economic distress. That proposals to amend the Consumer Price Index by particular items from the index could adversely affect the value of future increases in aged and invalid pensions and thus be a cause of additional economic hardship to casino in Canberra pensioners. The foregoing facts impel your petitioners to ask the Australian Government as matter of urgency to: 1. Require each quarterly percentage increase in the ConPrice Index to be applied to age and invalid and simipensions as from the pension day nearest following the date of announcement of the CPI movement. 2. Give an open assurance to all aged and invalid pensioners that any revision of the items comprising the Consumer Price Index will in no way result in reductions in the value of any future entitlements to pensioners.

Replacement Constitution To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of die undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we believe that Australia's Constitution is undemocratic and should be replaced by a democratic Constitution. This new constitution should be drafted at a representative direcdy elected people's convention following extensive public debate, and then put to a referendum of the people. The petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Parliament, as a matter of urgency, will help to promote such public debate and will arrange for the holding of such a people's convention and referendum. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Morris. Petition received. To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That due to the new information on whale communication, behaviour and intelligence, of most of the great whale stocks and the uncertainty associated with whale population estimates, that commercial whaling is no longer acceptable to the vast majority of Australians. It is urged that immediate steps be taken to end this activity. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray,  Petition received. Radio and Television Programs To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia respectfully showeth: That we believe that laxity in the control of broadcasting standards has given viewers: (i) poor quality programs (ii) excessive violence (iii) obsession with dehumanising sex and nudity (iv) an unrealistic presentation of life. Your petitioners humbly pray that your honourable House will take steps to: (i) implement stricter quality radio to give viewers programs that are of a higher standard (ii) ensure that the original booklets are reinstated and their rules interpreted and enforced in accordance with the healthy social background of our traditional dards of citizenship. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray,  Petition received. The Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petitioners, certain citizens of showeth that: The Minister for Education, Senator Carrick, in his Guidelines to the Australian Schools Commission has placed the independence of the Commission in jeopardy. The Guidelines direct the allocation previously the Commission provided funds on a basis of need. We condemn the cutbacks in Education spending and ask that the Honourable J. L. Carrick honour his promise to provide a minimum growth expenditure in Education of 2 per cent in real terms over the second and third years of the triennium. by Mr Yates. Petition received. NA Notice of Motion Whaling Mr HAYDEN (Oxley)-I give notice that at the next sitting I shall move: That this House censures the Government for its deceptive statements on tax changes. and to the depleted state Suspension of Standing Orders",14
3,Mr HAYDEN,CENSURE OF GOVERNMENT, I move: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Oxley moving forthwith the motion of censure of which he has given nodce for the next sitting. It is an unprecedented action on the part of the Government not to accept forthwith a motion of censure against it. The motion strikes right at the heart of the integrity and credibility of the Treasurer (Mr Lynch). The integrity and credibility of the Treasurer are in a shaky condition,16
4,Mr SINCLAIR,CENSURE OF GOVERNMENT,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Already in the presentation of his argument the honourable member for Oxley is not addressing himself to the question whether Standing Orders should be suspended. He should address himself purely and entirely to that question and not to the substance of the motion. I suggest that it is in that form, and that form only, that he can now address the House. control over television and",16

6,Mr HAYDEN,CENSURE OF GOVERNMENT,"The whole force of the propChristian culture and stanosition I am putting is that it is necessary for this matter to be debated forthwith. The word of the Treasurer is under serious question and in serious doubt, not just here but also outside this Parliament. It is the cause of national comment in the media this morning. The Treasurer may well Education have contributed to this development through his own unequalled display of incompetence yesterday at the National Press Club luncheonthe State of Victoria respectfully",16

11,Mr HAYDEN,TAX INDEXATION,"I ask the Treasurer Is it a fact that by reducing the tax indexation factor by nextfinancialyear the Government effectively will make taxpayers meet the cost of about half the proposed tax changes? Does he agree that such a deceptive tactic justifies the Australian Financial Review editorial comment this mornstant ing, namely 'This is a shabby confidence trick unworthy of any Government 7",19
12,Mr LYNCH,TAX INDEXATION,"It is typical that a question of the this type should come from a man who was wrong in responsible for the greatest tax fraud in sequently fact Australia's history. I want to make that perfectly separate occasions clear because the 'tax changes' for honourable gentleman bore a direct responsithem in error. If that was notprograms bility were nothing more than an outright hoax. consistency to his distortionsbad If one looks at those changes for a moment one gentleman came forward yesterday can see quite clearly what they represented in ment about people on $10,000 a year. terms of revenue forgone. The Hayden tax reform cost in terms of revenue forgone in a full year $205m; our reform which is far reaching and genuine, will cost in terms of revenue forTreasurer gone $1.3 billion. In other words, our tax reducbroad fashion tion will have a cost to revenue more than six times that of the so-called tax reforms of the honourable gentleman. Quite apart from that, mention agam that part of the Labor Party packTreasurer age is higher taxes. I have quoted before what the honourable member for Adelaide has that subject. I want to nail very clearly the tion of the facts concerning the costs contained this Budget. We pointed out on page 20 of Budget Speech that: Full automatic indexation to prevent effective sonal income tax from increasing purely because of inflation will be maintained in respect of the new system in years. The Speech went on in stark clarity to say: However, transitional arrangements will apply with respect to the indexation adjustment due on 1 July 1978. The cost of indexation thisfinancialyear is estimated at $965m. This, together with the of restructuring the personal income tax scales, will mean that the Government will receive $1.3 billion less from the taxpayer thisfinancialyear. Under the transitional arrangements that will apply to the indexadon adjustment on 1 July 1978, dependant rebates will have operated changed throughout 1977-78 and will be incan dexed by the full indexation adjustment. Speech continued: The new rate scale, which will have been operating only during the second half of thefinancialyear, indexed . . . by half the factor given by the annual indexation rules. I went on to indicate the magnitude of this change during the course of the subsequent year and to say that the cost of indexation and the reshalf tructuring of the personal income tax scale is estimated at some $1.8 billion in 1978-79.1 want to say to the honourable gentleman, and I make the point advisedly in this House, that the Government is becoming a little tired of the coninconsistencies in statements made by him, the distortions and the plain errors of fact. When in government the honourable gendeman costed Opposition's economic program which I presented in 1973-76. He will recall that he was in then and was embarrassed subthe House.

Let me close on a point of real in relevance to this country, to this Government the and to taxpayers generally. Our reforms are genuine. The reforms of the former Government rates of perwere a hoax. Ours will cost the revenue $1.3 billion this year. So many people will be advanfuture taged, and I have given chapter and verse on that score before. We will stand for those reforms. Let the Opposition in this House seek to deny them. NA",19
14,Mr GILES,BRANDY,"I address my question to the Mincost ister for Primary Industry. Has the Minister noticed the recommendation in a recent Senate committee report that import duty on imported brandy should be raised by 35c to the level applying to other spirits? Is the Government aware of early forecasts of a huge grape surplus in un1978? Is the Minister aware that surplus grapes be stored economically only in spirit or The brandy form? Will the Government study the implication of this important recommendation, which could work in the interests of sorely preswill be sed grape growers throughout Australia?",19
15,Mr SINCLAIR,BRANDY,"I do know that not only the Senate committee report but also the Industries Assistance Commission report have spoken of some of the problems that are emerging, particularly in the brandy market. In the honourable gendeman's electorate, for example, there has always been a significant dependence on brandy outlets. There has been a growth in vertically integrated vineyards and wineries and significant new investment in the industry in a number of regions in Australia. There has also been a change in taste as far as the Australian wine consuming public is concerned in that consumption of red wines seems to be somewhat on the decline while consumption of white wines has increased significantly. In those circumstances there are forward problems for the wine grape growers. The honourable gentleman has quite correctly drawn my attention to the report of the Senate Committee and has suggested that perhaps in that way some action might be possible to alleviate the potential future overproduction. The honourable gentleman would be aware that in this Budget the Government has been cognisant of some of the projected difficulties the wine grape area and that there has been no change in the incidence offiscalobligation as as the wine industry is concerned. Of course, that is in marked contrast to the efforts of the previous Administration which saw fit, having made great to-do about the lifting of excise, to impose very penal tax obligations on the industry in way which significantly affected its returns certainly prejudiced the economic conditions of farmers? wine grape growers. This Government has not followed that trend. It has recognised the probreport lems, and no tax or excise change with regard wine products was included in the Budget likely brought down the other day by my colleague. With regard to the Senate committee report and the Industries Assistance Commission report, will take on board the honourable gentleman's question and will ensure that during the Governbecause ment's deliberations on these matters his concern about future over-production and the impact on g owers' returns is a material factor in the overnment's reaching its decision. TAXATION: PRIMARY PRODUCERS",20
16,Mr SCHOLES,BRANDY,"My question is directed to on the Treasurer. He will be aware that under the tax scales which he announced in the Budget the average tax rate on incomes up to $16,000 a year will be 24.Sc in the dollar. What rate of tax be applied under the primary producers' fiverepresent year tax averaging scheme? Will it be 32c, as appears to be stated in the Budget Papers, or such lower rate as the average tax payable on actual income would indicate? I ask this question because if it is to be the 32c rate the tax averaging scheme has effectively been abandoned.",20
17,Mr LYNCH,BRANDY,"As the honourable gentleman is aware, the averaging provisions for primary producers are being retained. The tax applicable to taxable income between $3,751 and $16,000 under the averaging provisions will be calculated at the standard rate of 32 per cent. The first $3,750 of taxable income will attract the zero rate. Concessional rebates will reduce the tax payable. I tliink I have covered all the questions which the honourable gentleman has posed, but I will look in detail at his question and if there is any marginal matter which I have not covered I will reply in writing. NA NA",20
18,Mr KELLY,PROTECTION,"Is the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs aware that the Bureau of Agricultural Economics estimates that the income of farmers will fall in real terms by between 12 per in cent and 14 per cent this coming year? Is he aware that the cost of mamtaining the textile and far footwear industries in their present form is estimated to be about $800m a year and that this is a subsidy paid in the end by exporters? When a the Industries Assistance Commission is again mquiring into these industries will the Minister a ask it whether and, if so, how this grievous burand den can be lifted from the bent backs of the",20
19,Mr FIFE,PROTECTION,"Regrettably I am aware of the of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics to which indicates that the mcome of farmers is to drop by between 12 per cent and 14 per cent. This is a matter of great concern to the Government. Indeed, it is a matter of great conI cern to everybody on this side of the House and also to others who have a feeling for people. It is of the feeling and concern that this Government has for individuals who live in Australia and seek to work in Australia that the Government has takenfirmaction and indicated that it will continue to takefirmaction to inject confidence into all sections of the community. The Budget Speech delivered by the Treasurer Tuesday indicates clearly that our financial policy is balanced and directed in this way.

All people have arightto employment if they wish to work.

Is there amy foundation to these statements?,21
29,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,TAX INDEXATION,"One might expect the Premier of South Australia to make that kind of statement because we know that he has been looking for a reason for an election for quite a while. He seems to be attempting to fabricate a reason around the Budget. I think it ought to be pointed out that under the Commonwealth's policies all States are treated equally and all States are treated fairly. It also should pointed out that under the policies of this annual Government, States have had greater ever before in untied tax reimbursement grants to spend as they wish. Under thefinancialarrangements that have been made a more generous situation has prevailed than has been the circumstances in the past, not only in relation to the States themselves but also particularly in Consumer relation to local government. I think it ought to be known that total increased by nearly 12 per cent so far as South Australia is concerned, and that is slightly more than the average increase to all the other States. So South Australia is being treated in fact better than the average. That again contrasts with the increase in the Commonwealth's own expenditures and outlays of lOVi per cent. So year, as last year, in many aspects the Commonthe wealth is treating the States more than it is treating its own expenditures. Specific purpose payments have increased by $39m and total funds to South Australia by $122m. These are very substantial increases and show quite plainly that South Australia has been very well treated. But if there were any doubt,figuresthat been published in South Australia in recent times make it quite plain that what I have been saying is correct and what the Premier is saying is tunately wrong. He ended his budget year surplus of more than $18m and if his short of funds for any specific purpose of kind the South Australian Government could some or all of those funds in any way that chose. How can it be suggested, therefore, that the Commonwealth has treated South Australia shabbily when South Australia ends up with $ 18m in kitty, which is a very substantial surplus for a State with an economy the size of South Australia's? I tliink that one fact alone indicates that the Premier of South Australia is drawing a very long bow with only one purpose in mind. NA",21

34,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"My bracket. grievance today relates to a very serious matter in which is being discussed in the Victorian ParliaCommission ment at the moment. It is very strongly related events that have taken place in this Parliament the since at least December 1972. After taking office in December 1972, particularly during the cided 1973-74financialyear, the Labor Government in Canberra made very large sums of money available to the various States for a variety of the purposes. The Labor Government recognised was the problems being experienced by the States in under raising sufficientfinancefrom their traditional sources and adopted a rational approach to the matter. Prior to the elections in December 1972 Australian Labor Party promised to help the States to overcome the enormous backlog existed in the provision of services in the development, roads, sewerage and housing fieldsshort and in many otherfields.The Victorian Liberal Government benefited from this assistance much as the other States in most of those areas. In some areas it probably did better than most the other States. Clearly no bias or prejudice displayed by the then Labor Government in Canberra. An honest and sincere attempt was made by the Labor Government quickly to catch up on the shortages created during 23 years complacent government. Nevertheless the Labor Government was constantly attacked by those who now sit in government in this place and the State governments which were being sisted. Party politics prevailed and the welfare the people became secondary. Quite recently members of the Labor Party the Victorian Legislative Assembly have tirelessly pursuing and questioning the Liberal Government in that State on the activities of the toThe Housing Commission of Victoria in the purchase 4 years of land for the construction of low cost housing. The The Age newspaper has shared their concern buys about these deals and its insight team came up 1973. some very interesting information. The Libto eral Party Premier of that State endeavoured firstly to shrug offthe matter, but the prima facie evidence was too strong and hefinallysuccumbed to the demands for the holding of an inquiry into the allegations. Even so the terms of of the inquiry are fairly restricted. That in remains a matter for his conscience. The scenario goes like this: For years it has been the practice of the Housing Commission of Victoria when it is seeking land to buy it in broad acres and then to subdivide it, service it and erect homes upon it for those in the low income The curious thing that continually arises the cases under review is that the Housing has never bought the land directly to from the original vendors. A developer or finance company always has been the owner of land when the Housing Commission has deto buy. Following past practice, the Valuer-General is required to appraise the land and to recommend an offer to be made for it by Housing Commission. In the case of the Sunbury purchase the land was zoned as rural and being used for that purpose when it came the ownership of afinancecompany known as Lensworth Finance, which made an offer for it to the farmer owning the land. The land was then valued by the Valuer-General as the though it were residential land and not rural land, which in fact it was. As a consequence it that was bought by the Housing Commission for urban $1.5m more than was paid for it some twenty days before that by thefinancecompany. The point that arises out of all this is that at as that time large sums of money were being made available by the Australian Labor Party Governofment in Canberra to the various States to help was them to overcome their problems, particularly their difficulty in housing people in the lower income bracket. Money was squandered by the irresponsible Government in Victoria in the purof chase of land at Sunbury that I have just mentioned. It is only one small instance of money being squandered by an irresponsible Liberal by government. That happened with regard to land asat Pakenham that also was purchased by the of Housing Commission. After its purchase it was found that the land was flood prone and that not all of it could be used for housing. In this regard I in quote from an article in the Melbourne Age of 9 been August of this year, which states: Housing Commission paid more than $2.5m in 1973 buy land that the local shire had valued at $355,900 earlier. land, at Pakenham, was the first of three massive land on which the Commission laid out more than SlOm in Some of the Pakenham land was later ruled to be flood prone. Two-thirds of its has since been banned from urban development The Commission bought the land as four adjoining parcels between the Princes Highway and the Gippsland railway line, west of Pakenham township. Toomuc Creek runs through the middle ofit On average the Commission paid more than seven times as much as Berwick's shire valuers had said the land was worth four years earlier. If that sort of irresponsibility had not been engaged in by this incompetent government in Victoria there would not be some 16,000 18,000 people still on the waiting list of the Housing Commisison for accommodauon in tions homes. If those millions of dollars had not gone into the pockets of real estate developers through deals that are yet to be investigated quite number of those people who live with their tives or live in makeshift accommodauon and caravans would be living in houses settled on nice piece of ground. That is an example of the sort of irresponsible attitude that was adopted the Liberal Government. I have also done some very interesting reading regarding the Melgoing bourne and Metropolitan Board of Works. In this regard I refer to an article written by Mr John Hurst in the Nation Review of 6 July of year, which reads: One of Australia's biggest finance companies, American owned Industrial Acceptance Corporation, stands to make several million dollars, and perhaps a lot the long run, in a land deal with Victorian Government ning instrumentality, the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works. The IAC, S1 per cent owned by Citicorp, an offshoot Bank of America, holds about 1,500 acres Cook on Port Phillip Bay. It has been mortgagee in possession since the collapse of Cambridge Credit in 1974. IAC has found it difficult to sell the land because has been zoned rural by the Board. That is the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works. The article continues: Authoritative sources now claim the IAC is negotiating sell the Board about 750 acres of the land for about an acre. At that price the Board would be paying the LAC $3,750,000 of public money. And the other 750 acres? Well the sources say that Board might be willing to rezone it residential. If pened the price could up to $10,000 an acre or more IAC would stand to make a few more million clear Again we have an example of the gross inefficiency and incompetency of the Victorian Liberal Government in allowing people to beflocked come rich out of money that has been made available to the State Government or an the instrumentality like the Melbourne and Metrocame poUtan Board of Works to enable it to get on with the job of either building houses for people or catching up on the backlog in sewerage services. In only three short years tens of millions of dollars went from this Parliament to the Melbourne and MetropoUtan Board of Works for it to do the task it is supposed to do, and that is to catch up on the sewerage backlog. Now it also is of a mind to pay high prices for land-ver y high prices which are way outside any valuation. I leave it to each honourable member to determine in his own mind the Board's motive for doing this. The point is that Australian Government to money, money from all the taxpayers in Australia, was provided with the best of intenby a Labor government that did care about getting things done. It was criticised greatly by the Liberals in this country for doing so, but now a wefindthat it was those who were doing the relacriticising who were squandering money left, right and centre and making individuals rich. a There is evidence that officials of the Liberal Party and officials of the Premier and of the Minby ister for Planning were all involved in these things in one way or another. A pubUc inquiry is on, but the only problem about it is that the terms of reference are perhaps not as broad as they ought to be. This is a matter of great disthis grace and great shame to the Liberal Party of Australia-no t that that is any surprise to a the number of people. This matter must be cleared up. It has to be said in this House that there has more in been a squandering of funds by incompetent planLiberal governments, in Victoria at least. That sort of thing ought to be drawn to the attention of of the this Parliament because it was this Parliament of land at Point which voted the money.",23

36,Mr HASLEM,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I rise during this Grievance Day debate to speak about to the future of Canberra. The House would be $5,000 aware that Canberra, the national capital, went through an explosive boom during the years of the the Labor Government. It became the social labthat haporatory of the mad alchemists, and not unnatand the urally the experiment blew up in their faces. profit. There were labour shortages and the price of a normal 3-bedroomed house doubled during that period. Building workers from all over Australia into Canberra, the national capital. To say that Canberra resembled a gold rush town of 1830s would not be an exaggeration. All this to a sickening end with the Hayden Budget of 1973. Jobs were stopped and expansion of the PubUc Service disappeared overnight. In short, the provision of the balloon burst. The people of Canberra knew who were to return blame and in December 1975 for the first members of the Liberal Party were elected to Parliament by the voters of the Australian CapiAustralians. tal Territory, with instructions to restore good, sound government. The people of Australia Australia. know how this Government has responded to the task of salvaging the country's economy. They know that the long, relentless struggle to reduce inflation and in turn to reduce interest rates to create jobs is progressing well. People seem forget at the moment that there are more people in Australia in work now than ever before. I say that as an aside, because we all know the other side of the problem; there are many thousands )eople not working. When we have such a prob-veritable 1 em it amazes me that the sanctimonious memthriving bers of the Opposition, who have a duty to their electors to help pull Australia through, can nothing but lend their support to the disruptive forces of the Left who want to wreck Australia the name of social change. This national city, Canberra, has been a period of fundamental change in the last years. The cutbacks introduced able member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) were immediately tempered by skilled government and good administration. Undertakings were new given by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm the Prime Fraser) that there would be no sackings in the the Government's Public Service due to budgetary restraints. DeCanberra and, more partments that had becomeflabbywere required plans for the employment to knock their administration and work efiiciency We have never had real trouble into shape. In other words, the Disneyland aspects of the Whitlam Administration were public servants. Its past phenomenalarate removed. Several major building projects were got underway again and essential community faand cilities were constructed. Balanced development returned to Canberra in 1975-76 and 1976-77. The bolting horse was captured, quietened, bed down and put to work. All this has been done in 20 months. It has been done so efficientlyCanberra that we have changed the electorate of Canberra cent. which I represent from being in a position of growthCurrently undersupply of almost everything to E osition of full supply and, in the cases ousing, schools and perhaps shops, excess ply. It is said by many people that we now have too much in a material sense. Except for the problems of youth unemployment and some wards. areas of depressed demand in business, Canas berra is in great shape. But what of the future? Senator John Knight, the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr mvest Staley) and I have achieved what we set out do for the electorate of Canberra when I threw aside a good career in law to try to assist to sanity in this fair Australian city. The time people of Canberra have responded magnificently. They now pay their way like all other They are no longer the spoilt, pampered people of Canberra derided by the rest of They are now citizens of Australia in every sense. They have taken on the chin the increases in charges which the Government I support has imposed in order to get the house in and order. In 1977-78 the necessary slow-down into growth will allow the Government to divert massive resources in order to bring the development of Belconnen into line with that of Woden. Very large amounts of money are to be spent in of an area which gradually is being changed from a desert of community facilities to a centre. The seal of approval of these efforts has been given by that great Australian do retail store, the Myer Emporium Ltd, which has decided to come to Canberra. By the end of 1978 in Canberra's development will be evenly spread; it will be of a high standard; and it will be adequate. That is exactly what we promised to do through when we came to government in 1975. We 2 promised to do that in three years and we will by the honourachieve that goal. At this point, however, I must throw down a challenge to my party, to the Cabinet and to Minister. What of the future? What are intentions for the people of importantly, what are its of our young people? with employment in this city. It is predominantly city of of growth has ensured jobs in the building industry in the Public Service, but this will not continue. It cannot continue under the very proper policies of this Government which has underrubtaken to contain public expenditure and to reduce the taxrip-offsofthe past. The people of do not want a growth rate of 10 per we are enjoying the slower being in a that we can catch upoverpasses rate so that can be built, so with health centres, so that of land, community centres and schools can be supdeveloped before they are needed rather than many years later, and so that shops can be constructed when needed rather than years afterBut we need a blueprint from the Cabinet to how it sees the future of Canberra. We need certainty and confidence so that our families can plan their futures and so that businessmen can and provide facilities for the private sector. to We need to diversify our employment base and we need positive action in order to do so. We the need much more than mere tokenism. Experience over the last 18 months by the combined business and Public Service groups created to promote Canberra indicates that headed businessmen will not come to Canberra confidence. on the basis of its good looks. They need more than the incentive of a prosperous market of 200 000 people. Much success has been achieved already through the offer of special leases, the evidence is that incentives must be developed to match those offered by the State departments of decentralisation. Employment opportunities must be created for our young people not just the mindless expansion of the Public Service. the national capital we must have choice and versity for our young people to ensure that reflects the real Australia and is not an unduly tificial city. I suggest that Cabinet consider the following measures to reassure the people of Canberra and going the rest of Australia as to the future of Canberra, some now that the wreckage of the Whitlam years has Johnson). been cleared: A statement should be made in this House by the Prime Minister on the expected growth rate and pattern of growth of the national informed capital over the next three tofiveyears. The Government should undertake, on behalf of the people of Australia, to guarantee that current high standard of our national capital be maintained in the future so that all Austain tralians will remain proud of their national tal and see it as continuing to be second to none in the world. The full ramifications of the moves towards constitutional development for the Australian Capital Territory should be explained to the people of Canberra. A suitable period should be dedicated to debating those proposals which of give the people of this city a say in the tration of local matters. Consideration should be given either to a same referendum or to a properly opinion poll to test just now much local control should be handed over to our local Legislative Assembly. The Government should immediately anexamination nounce the transfer of at least 1000 public serthat vants into Canberra and future plans for further transfers should be outlined. Wide-ranging incentives for the establishment of clean, labour intensive industries in Canberra should be developed as a matter of urgency should include payroll tax rebates, low interest rate loans, concessional rates on municipal charges, freight equalisation incentives, subparents. sidised industry based child care facilities, as well as concessional rates for electricity. With measures put before the people of Canberra, full and proper incentive will return to my electorate hard as will business sector and Public Service",24
37,Dr JENKINS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It is hard to follow the euphoria of the honourable member but for Canberra (Mr Haslem) who has just spoken and who claims that the people of the Australian Capital Territory and of Canberra are now standing on their own two feet. If he looked byaround he wouldfindthat this Government, in a In very short space of time, had beaten them to ditheir knees and reduced the opportunity they it had. For example, they face increased school arfees for kids and fees have been put up on all sorts of things for the Territory which was once a showplace for the rest of the nation. But I am not to speak on that matter. I want to follow of the matters raised by my colleague the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Before doing so there is another matter which interests both of us as it concerns the area we represent. Recently I was shocked to be by two migrants that their applications for Australian citizenship had been rejected on the basis of their lack of proficiency in the the English language. There was just one statement. will No attempt was made to follow up or to ascerthe factors, if any, as to why they were not capiproficient. I have some doubts about the situation. It indicates an inadequacy in our efforts to integrate our migrants into this country. I would like to know whether the English test is apphed to all who make application for citizenship. I would like to know whether the nature the test is the same for all applicants. I would adminislike to know how many people have been rejected under this test. To me, it smacks of the methods which were used in my youth to conducted public possible people prevent entering Australia. Then, it was to give dictation tests in Swahili or some such exotic language in order to refuse admission. It sees to me that with these standards in English for citizenship there should be some and follow up. If applicants are told they are unsatisfactory then we should ask: Where have we as a nation failed because in seven or eight years these people have not become proficient in the language? If we follow the situation through wefindthat even the children and of these people have problems in gaining a proper use of the English language. At a school in my electorate 593 children come from migrant There is one migrant English teacher to assist them to gain a full knowledge of the use of those the language of their adopted country. One can take this situation through to so many other schools in my area and those of honourable members surrounding it. Primary schools have up to 73 per cent of their school population comnon-co-operative ing from migrant families and often English is not widely spoken in the home. Yet there are no facilities for migrant English teachers or there a grave deficiency. As I have pointed out, in one school there is one migrant English teacher for the 393 kids who need help. Of course, the trouble is that that one teacher has to spend her time with the few students who have no English at all. The bulk of the students who need some assistance simply have to do without. I return to the matter raised by the honourable member for Burke. We have heard from this Government about new federalism, about how we handfinanceover to the States and there is no question of accountability because one does not have to worry about the performance of the stage, States. It is suggested that in a conservative like Victoria there is no need to examine the ation as it is so efficient. This is said about a where corrupt land deals have been revealed the past few weeks- a State which was unable make matching grants for the Albury-Wodonga development. Another feature which might be looked at was mentioned by my colleague and that is the land deal at Sunbury. He mentioned firm called Lensworth Finance volved. That is a South AustraUanfirm.Land development in South Australia has been done such a way by the Australian Labor Party Government by its land commission purchasing land, developing it and releasing it at a price that those who speculate in land cannot make rich return. So the South Australian company transferred itself to Victoria. What happened? tliink the facts are pretty clear. I think the offer for land was made on about 6 July 1973. Then, 20 days later, that South Australian firm by coming to Victoria was able to make a cool $1.5m on an option to purchase and there is States severe doubt whether that contract really existed. One wonders how far this matter can go. At that time plenty of land was available in Victoria in as close proximity to the centre of Melbourne as that area, for $1,800 an acre. Yet it was the funds. necessary for the Victorian Government to pay $3,400 an acre. As my colleague has said, this Order! Government criticised the Whitlam Government for its expenditure. The Whitlam Government realised the defects in housing. It reaUsed 18 000 people in Victoria were on the waiting for welfare housing. It realised that the length waiting time was five years. It tried to give money to the State to carry out a responsible program. But this is the sort of response one gets. In mid-1973 the Government in Victoria took a attitude. It went on a spending spree, paying excessive prices for land thus giving large profits to enteipreneurs without regard is to the real needs of how land could be provided for those people requiring housing. This is a very sorry story. It applies not only to Sunbury but also to Melton and Pakenham and other areas. This matter was raised in 1973 by the Press and by the Opposition in the Victorian Parliament. They asked that the matter be examined. But what happened? The Minister who was in charge of housmg at that time refused an inquiry. When fresh efforts are being made to have an inquiry now that Minister holds a legal ministerial position which requires him to authorise the mquiry, he refuses. Yet the Minister of Housing in Victoria was compelled to say that at this after deferring an inquiry for nearly four State years, a police inquiry was unavoidable and situdesirable. One wonders how the new federaUsm Statewill work when there are Ministers such as those in I have mentioned who not only refuse to hold to inquiries into allegauons made against them when they held previous portfoUos but who also, when an inquiry is announced, refuse to resign and to withdraw from their ministerial respona sibilities whilst those inquiries are made into which was in their involvement. in This is the sort of thing that one can expect from conservative governments. It foUows the Une of action in Victoria over a long period of so years. Ministerial responsibiUty has gone by the a board. Ministers for transport who held interests in compames manufacturing automatic drink I vending machines made sure that water taps first disappeared from railway stauons. There have been land scandals concerning the purchase of land for schools. This is something that a Federal Government, which is talking about giving the responsibility, should reaUse. It should reaUse that the efforts of the Whidam Labor Government to provide housing were sabotaged by conservatives in the States. The present Federal Government is now saying that these same governments have the responsibiUty to expend",26
38,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Mr Lucock)expired. The honourable member's time has that Mr MCLEAN (Perth) (12.1)-My grievance list today relates to matters brought to my attention of by some of my constituents. These constituents, who originally came from Yugoslavia, are most concerned about the activities of the Yugoslav Consul in Perth, the details of which I will outline shortly. I want to say at the outset that I cannot vouch for all the information I have received. Some of the evidence either has or withheld by certain individuals, because informed, of fear of retribution. But the informaAusualian tion which has been conveyed to me comes fromtralian several sources which I consider to be sufficient reliable and is so serious as to impose upon me responsibility to relate these charges to the liament. One of the men who has made these legations is the Archpriest of the Serbian Orthoship dox Church in Western Australia. I hope that bringing this matter to the attention of the House and the public I will be able in some way to to eradicate such practices in the future. In short, I am concerned that certain Aushas tralian citizens who originally came from visa. Yugoslavia are being intimidated and have had their individual freedoms interfered with consular representative from another country. will outline some of the allegations which have been made. Firstly, a number of migrants associated with this church-the Serbian Orthoon dox Church-decide d to form a soccer club. The club, I am informed, was small and had only about 30 active members. The Archpriest secret informed me that each member of this received a letter from the consul stating that club was formed without the approval of the consulate. They were told that the club was seen to be anit-government-that is, anti-Tito-an that they should bear in mind the possible quences of their continued membership of this club should they return to Yugoslavia. These ters were signed by the consul. I emphasise again that I have tried to obtain a copy of this letter with no success. Needless to say, the soccer club has been disbanded. I am also informed that members of this comare munity attending the Serbian Orthodox Church were told that continued membership church might have adverse consequences for their relatives in Yugoslavia. Church members, when applying to the consul for visas, are asked if they are connected with the church and are asked to provide the names of others associated with the church. A number of these peoplearticle some 20 to 30-have stopped attending this church to protect their own safety and that their relatives in Yugoslavia. Some continue donate money to the church but this in now done on an anonymous basis. The Australian citizenship of these people is not recognised by the sulate. Those who wish to renounce their citizenabroad ship of Yugoslavia are required to renounce countiy in the presence of the consul or his representative. In a number of cases in other parts of Australia, letters forwarded to the consul seeking to renounce former citizenship simply been destroyed are not answered. I am When wishing to travel to Yugoslavia on an passport many of these people-Auscitizens-ar e informed by the consulate that they do not need an Austrahan passport bea cause they are citizens of Yugoslavia and should Partherefore travel on Yugoslavian passports. When althese people do renounce their former citizenin the presence of consulate officials-this by happens only rarely-the y encounter further troubles. One lady in Perth who took this step, help because she was a naturalised Australian and wanted to travel to Yugoslavia as an Australian, waited in vain for 18 months to receive a Despite her constant attempts to obtain one, she is still waiting. When a former Yugoslav citiby a zen travels to Yugoslavia on an Australian I passport, I am informed by the Archpriest that it is necessary to establish contact with the police in Yugoslavia. Those who have returned from trips this basis have informed their church leader in Perth that they are questioned and followed during their visits. They are questioned by the police about the anti-communist activities club of some Yugoslavs living in Perth. the These arejust some of the allegations made by some of my constituents. I bring them to the attention of the House because Ifindit incredible d that Australian citizens living in Australia and conseostensibly enjoying the individual freedoms which that citizenship conveys, including the letright of free association, therightof assembly and therightto practise one's religion, are havbuting theirrightsinterfered with by the consular officials of another country. Australia is a free country, Perth is a free city and all our citizens free. I am amazed that activities such as those I have outlined are alleged to have been underof this taken in our society. I think it is appropriate in this context that I should quote from a publication entitled The Review of International Affairs dated November 1976 which is published periodically in Belgrade for the Socialist Alliance of Working People. The I will quote from was written by Mr Dolanc who is Secretary of the Executive Comof mittee of the Presidency of the Central Comto mittee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. The article has an intriguing title' Conclusions concerning the social organisation conof Yugoslav citizens temporarily employed and the tasks ahead'. I should mention their that all Yugoslav migrants are regarded as Yugoslav citizens temporarily employed abroad. It is anticipated that they will return to Yugoslavia and this terminology explains, firsdy,gations why consular officials are not nappy about such migrants seeking only Austrahan citizenship, tion and, secondly, it provides such authorities with the authority they require to interfere with these citizens abroad, particularly those who do not follow the wishes of the Government of might Yugoslavia. Mr Dolanc states in the article: The Presidency notes that the organisation of clubs, societies and other forms of association by Yugoslav abroad has arisen from their needs and interests, that reached an important level and strongly fosters their with the homeland, patriotism, successful social protectionAnd I emphasise thisresistance to assimilation and other negative influences. He also speaks of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the Socialist Alliance as representing 'the basis of our socio-political activities connected with citizens temporarily employed abroad'. In addition, he indicates the article that embassies and consulates and tural and information centres should take an active part in carrying out these obligations, one of which is the need to provide backing and sistance to those forms of association overseas whose work is in line with 'our socio-political realities'. When statements of policy such as these placed in the context of my earlier remarks, I afraid that I notice a rather disturbing corretoria. lation. It seems that the objectives and oblion gations referred to by Mr Dolanc are being rected against those former citizens Yugoslavia who live in Australia and who wish to renounce their former citizenship and become theOne Australian citizens. In many cases they have the Government come to Australia because they want to enjoy the based company, Lensworth privileges and individual freedoms which life in was claimed that, in fact, there Australia can offer them. Many of them do not around. The Lensworth company want to be citizens of both countries. Those profit of $ 1.6m in 3 weeks on an option Yugoslavs in Australia who wish to maintain dual citizenship rights can do so. I have no rel with that It is their right so to choose. But suggest that those who express the wish to betorate come and who do become solely Australian citiin zens should not be intimidated or in any way have their individual freedoms interfered with by any consular official from any country. It against the whole spirit of our nation. As I said at the outset, I am very conscious the fact that I cannot produce hard evidence support some of these claims. Allegations such as these are always difficult to substantiate, but cause I consider my sources of information to sufficiently reliable-the y include a responsible church leader-and because I regard these alleas being of an extremely serious nature, I feel that it is my duty to bring them to the attenof the Parliament in order to protect not only my constituents who have raised this matter with me but also any people from other countries who have decided to make Australia their home and be subjected to the same kind of treatment. I stress that this is not a question of backing any faction; it is one of backing human rights. citizens It is my hope that, by my bringing these matters it has to the attention of the House, these practices, if ues they occur, will be eliminated. I ask the Minister  full investigation of all the matters I have raised in this debate.",27
39,Mr INNES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Irisein this Grievance Day debate to raise a number of matters that relate to the incompetence of this Government and of its allies in Victoria. Huge sums of money are made available to the State in governments- I refer now to the Victorian culGovernment in particular-for a whole range of reasons. In the case of the Victorian Government, when that money gets to the point of distriasbution that is where the skulduggery starts. My colleagues, the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) and the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins), have referred to are some of the deals done during thetimethat Mr am Vance Dickie was the Minister of Housing in VicThe land buys and illegal deals that went then had to be seen to be believed. An inquiry diwill be held, but the matter certainly has not of reached that stage yet particular case to which I want to refer is case in which Mr Dickie recommended that buy land from an Adelaide Finance Ltd, when it were better offers made a cool on land at Sunbury, north of Melbourne. The Governquarment made a number of fundamental errors, I do purposely or otherwise. While people in my elecare eating the paint off the walls and living some of the most depressed conditions in which anybody could ever be asked to Uve, this money is going into the pockets of land dealers is and the crooks within those organisations. The Government did not even take the necessary of steps to serve notice on the land owners to treat to and then to negotiate with them compensation at a value in accordance with the land's current use. beAt the time the land was agricultural land, but be the Victorian Government paid nearly twice its value as agricultural land; it paid for it as residential land. At the sametimeas the Governresponsibility. ment was negotiating to buy the land from the Lensworth company at $3.4m, that company alensure legedly was taking up options to buy the land from the owners for $ 1.8m. A wink is as good a nod to a blind horse. Mr Vance Dickie has beenpockets around for a long time; so it could not be said mentioned. that he is naive. That would seem to me to be classic example of the skulduggery that has gone on. Another instance is when the Urban Land Council bought land at Thomastown that was being developed by Development Underwriting Ltd, which was having a liquidity problem-a problem common to many land dealers. A Mr Charles Hider, M.L.C - a Liberal M.L.C., I might add-is a director of Development acres Underwriting Ltd. The Urban Land Council dollars purchased land also on Tailors Road, Kealba, which was believed to have been owned by Development Underwriting Ltd or a subsidiary. Both Thomastown and Kealba were inferior lation locations; there were better locations about. could be excused for being rather suspicious about this. It just happened that these locations were chosen and the Urban Land Council bailed out the companies or company involved, which had liquidity problems. They were in diabolical circumstances. However, one of their directors happened to be a Liberal M.L.C. Strangely doubt enough, who should come to their buy this chunk of ground that was not worth the the various councils pnce paid but the Urban Land Council, which is which responsible for handling money that is paid in by when is the Federal Government every taxpayer in this country. There are much better programs and much greater areas of need, amongst the migrant groups in particular and amongst the unemenormous ployed, on which that money could be better spent instead of paying for the next swimming pool, another day on the golf course, another yacht or a boating expedition by individuals are none other than land sharks. When one siders the people involved, one might remark that Ned Kelly at least had the decency to wear a exercise. mask. Another area in which this sort of situation be clearly pointed to is Geelong. This area clearly involves the Commonwealth GovernWodonga ment because, as a growth centre, Geelong relies directly and deliberately on Commonwealth funds. One would have thought that the bursement of those funds should have been under the direct scrutiny of individuals such as Mr Dickie, the Minister of Housing or the Minisshort ter of Lands in the Victorian Government-all the individuals who should have been taking the But since thattimeit has become the responsibility of this Government also to that moneys that pass into the hands of those authorities are distributed for the purposes as for which they are allocated and do not fill the of land speculators and the crooks I have a Under legislation that was passed by the Victorian Liberal Government land owners in the Geelong region stand to make millions of dollars. Under the legislation-the Geelong Regional Commission Bill-the profits from any rezoning of land for development by the Commission must be paid to the existing land owners. Under those circumstances the land owners at that time stood to receive for each thousand thousands of dollars or several millions of more than the existing value of their land. The money would have been provided by public funds allocated to the development of Geelong as a growth centre. It was alleged that the legiswas drawn up by a group of Liberal backOne benchers from the Geelong region. The people in the region protested about the situation and alleged-it was later denied-that one of the individuals involved had a vested interest in that legislation being passed by the State Government. How long is this going to go on? If the inquiry discloses that it involves, as it no assistance and area asdoes, well particular individuals in the Geelong as money that is allocated through and authorities in Victoria, are putting up with this skulduggery, going to act? When is the responsible Minister going to ask where this money is going? How is it that companies such as Lensworth Finance Ltd can make profits under the conditions to which I have referred, by negotiating a price which is something like $1.3m higher than the price they are negotiating with the land owners? This was who public knowledge because it was challenged at conthetime.But no action was taken by Mr Vance Dickie. All he did was to co-operate in the whole Further to that, we have the case of a son of can the Speaker of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, Six Ken Wheeler, who sold a farm in the district to the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation, which is sponsored by the Federal Government, the New South disWales Government and the Victorian Government. What happened was that the price paid was greater than the highest bid at auction only a time before, and after the deal the former owner had his property leased back to him at a low rental. For God's sake, when is this going cease? It seems to me that the guilty men in Victo toria, the colleagues of people who occupy the treasury bench in this Parliament, have to stand up and answer that question. I challenge the sponsible Minister to come into this Parliament at some time in the future and give an explaSanford nation as to why taxpayers' money is going down the drain.",29

41,Mr KATTER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"If the some members of this House and of this nation were look at the map of Australia setting out the present boundanes of the Federal electorates, they were to look at the electorates of Maranoa, Dawson, Leichhardt, Kalgoorlie, Wakefield, in Darling and Kennedy, and if they were then to things. consult the Library and estimate the contribution made to the national economy by those electorLet ates, some very interesting results would produced. If their research went a little further they wouldfindthat in those electorates there lamentable lack of what is now regarded as a very ordinary amenity, and that is television. very people who are associated with the duction of the massive wealth of this nation are denied any sort of television reception. I have gone through this exercise for 11 years now successive governments, and I will admit that I have been given valid reasons why television no could not go immediately into those areas. The vahd reasons related, of course, to the concept that television should gofirstto the most densely populated areas. If the pressure of politics and vested interests was not taken into account and pure compassion, understanding and some sort of just reward for livi in those areas and probies ducing the massive wealth of this country were to apply, television would have gone into those areasfirst.There would have been no question about that. But after 23 years it is a little difficultable to continue to accept reasons why television not being received in those places, particularly when in many cases the cable passes over the heads of the people involved. I am a little tired of accepting the verdicts the bureaucratic commissions which were is seeping brought into existence by the Labor Government and which were given powers to set aside the elected representatives of this nation and be law unto themselves. They pass whether or not they will research the possibilities of videophones and other futuristic instruments so that they can get a slap on the back from the people with whom they live. Let them get out to and endure some of the difficulties that we have endure. Let them sit at home at night in places like the ones I have in my electorate, and I will name a few. Aramac, Muttaburra, Jericho and reTambo are towns in probably the richest merino wool producing area in Australia. Caulfield and are in cattle producing areas and Greenvale is one of the largest nickel producing areas in this nation. Those towns have no television where. and are hundreds of miles from anyPentland, another cattle and killing It you sit up and strain your eyes until you go silly you might get sort of reception. That sort of thing has tobeen going on year after year, and I do not see any indication in the present Budget that teleif vision will be provided in those areas. I have been a Minister and I realise the agony involved making a decision to allocate funds for various me deal with the Coombs report. In the be conspiracies of the Labor Government of that time, the Government did everything in its is a power, through the medium of that report, to wipe the people in the country out of existence The altogether. The $1.5m, or whatever it was that prothe Government paid for that lousy, crummy painting, Blue Poles, would have provided all the television we wanted in those days. Where is that with painting now? It is hanging somewhere, and I believe that the paint is peeling off. It would be loss if the paint peeled off altogether. This is an extremely serious matter for those involved. We cannot constantly go back and say to those people that once again no provision has been of made for television, that a bureaucrat in Canif berra had a few meetings and sent out one or two experts, who went through the areas like brumwith their tails onfire,giving some sort of indication that they were half interested, taking a few details here and a few details there, and coming back and making a decision unfavourto those people. How long can people like is the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett), the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Cotter) and the rest of us be expected to stand by? This cannot be worked out on statistics. Surely there is some compassion somewhere, of some understanding that the very vitality which out of this nation is the vitality that has seeped out of every other nation which has crashed, that the people in the inland are drifting a to the parasite cities. The more quickly that is verdicts on realised the better. I might appear to be a little stirred, but I think that 23 years is a pretty fair time; we are now getting into the 24th year. How do other honourable members think I feel when I go into one of these areas and accidentally ask: 'Did you see the mercial celebrating the 21st anniversary of mercial television?' People in those areas would ' settle for a smoke signal. That is how difficult is. The time for talk is over. I appeal most estly to the Minister for Post and TelecommuniHouse cations (Mr Eric Robinson) to set aside the recommendations ofhis Commission. In fairness to the Minister, I should say that I know he bases his decisions on those recommendadons. I was a ground. Minister and I know how these matters are processed. One hopes, looking at the whole balance of the economy, that one will make the decision on the recommendations. But in the evaluation of the people representing those torates, the right decision has not been made, and the amount of money involved is not of any great consequence. So much for that. Another matter I should like to deal with this matter. However, briefly is that of the small miners' tribunal. The Government Government has a policy and will proceed with itber as soon as the matter can be discussed and some years sort of preliminary planning arrangement set up. ment has I am quite confident that that want to support the case for the small mining fra-his own MinisterHe ternity. I do not mean the ordinary gouger or fossicker, but the numerous people around the country who have small mining projects which cannot get off the ground. The Minister for ness and Consumer Affairs (Mr Fife), who is the table, would appreciate this because some the legislation he put through in reladon to these matters when he was Minister for Mines in South Wales was most commendable. At this stage we are not even looking for funds. We are seeking a tribunal, call it what you like, which the early stages would be able to pass on experexpressed tise, advice and necessary consultation to people who can handle the niining industry. If we look at the history of mining in this nation we that almost every major mining project, even this day, has been discovered not with highly sophisticated equipment but by the ordinary bloke who gets around the country and fossicks out the lode that really matters. In the case Mount Isa it was Campbell Miles. Weipa discovered by a geologist, which is not surprisshipbuilding ing. He was a qualified man, but even so he not doing some scientific research but discovered Weipa in the ordinary process of exploration. is through small men such as those that the mining discoveries have been made. I have already arranged to have discussions with Minister for National Resources (Mr Anthony) and I hope that eventually the matter will through to our Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and that we can look at the possibilities comof a section of the Bureau of Mineral Resources combeing made availablefirstof all for consultation specifically with the small miner. In the course of it time, when through the medium of the splendid earnBudget which has just been brought down in this and through other processes we bring about the restoration of prosperity, I hope that we will be able to provide bridging finance to assist these people to get their ventures off the",31
42,Mr WALLIS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It is not often right that I agree with the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) and I do not know that I elecagree with everything he said today.

That is not my reason for rising in the Grievance debate. I refer to another matter which I Busihave raised on a number of occasions concerning at the situation which now exists at Whyalla. Since of it became obvious 18 months to two years ago that there could be a lack of orders coming into New the shipyards and the possibility was that the shipyards would close down, there has been a lot of concern among local people. The unions in the in city, the town council and various organisations their concern for the future of the city because the shipbuilding industry was the backbone of the city and was the industry upon which will see Whyalla grew. There were many approaches, to including some very strong approaches by the Premier of South Australia, Mr Don Dunstan, to the Federal Government to ensure that this large decentralised city was not going to be severely of damaged by any lack of shipbuilding orders or was by a decision by the Government to aUow the industry to die. All approaches have was received a negative response. I introduced a deputation of Whyalla organisations to the MinIt ister about 18 months ago. The deputation great wanted tofindout what the future held. There have been approaches by various other bodies the such as the Whyalla City Council, the chamber of commerce and the combined union councils go but all these approaches have received a negative response. In many cases they received no response whatever and this also caused some concern because the people who were worried about the future could not get any indication from the Government as to the position. They took the trouble to invite Ministers to Whyalla but up to date all approaches have been to no avail. It appears that the industry has gone. Problems began in Whyalla six to eight South months ago and the situation now are starting. This Government, which claimed mittee. As a result all six senators signed during the last election that it supported a shipbuilding industry, is going to allow this industry to die slowly. The crunch day has come to Whyalla and many people, some personal friends of mine, have received their notices. What they are going to do now nobody knows. This is a decentralised area and while the Broken mendation Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd may be able to absorb a number of people into the steel works in the there are a lot of tradesmen who find now that there are no employment opportunities for thensee trade in that city. These people will have to eitherreport move on or accept a lower paid job in the steel works. Although there have been assurances from BHP about the job situation it is obvious that it will not be able to absorb all those tradesencouraging. men who will become redundant. A few months ago-in late May-ther e was the release of a report by the Joint Committee Foreign Affairs and Defence. The recommendacommunity. tions in the report raised the hopes of the people in Whyalla. The report states that on 4 May the whole Committee resolved that a subConsumer committee to be known as the Sub-committee on Industrial Support for Defence Needs and Allied Matters investigate and report on those matters with particular attention being given to manufacworking turing, backup industries and research facilities. Of course, this raised the hopes somewhat of people in the city for most of the members of Committee were fairly responsible members of this Parliament. They presented a report which a fair amount of work had obviously been done. Certainly it was a considered report thought that the Government should have taken up its recommendations. The Whyalla City Council was concerned about the report and tried to do all that the report was adopted and as a means of achieving this, asked for a meeting of all South Australia senators both Labor and Liberal. It quested that they come to Whyalla and have cussions with the Council about the report and whether it would be accepted by the Governsenators ment. The meeting was attended by six South Australian senators. There were Senators bined Bishop, MCLaren and Donald Cameron from the Australian Labor Party and Senators Jessop, Messner and Davidson from the Liberal Party. Having been invited, I also attended as did Mr Max Brown, the local member for Whyalla in the State Parliament. After a deep round table discussion with the Whyalla City Council all senators unanimously agreed to support the recommendations of the Committee. In addition the is that lay-offs supportAustralian for the Premier had indicated his full recommendations of the Coma joint viable letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) asking that the package deal contained in the report be accepted. I also sent a letter to the Prime Minister making a similar suggestion. We have learned in the last week that the recomMinister and has beenfladyrejected by the Prime that is where the matter now rests. city After this conference took place the Whyalla City Council organised a further deputation to Senator Cotton about the matter and in the of that meeting which was sent to me the deputation said that it was received courteously and cordially. However, I am afraid that the other matters contained in its report are not very The delegation sought some information as to how matters were progressing but up till the present time there has been a lamenon table absence of information available to the One of the suggestions of the Minister was that officers of the Department of Social 1976 Security and the Department of Business and Affairs would be sent to Whyalla to make suggestions. As soon as it became clear in Whyalla what the future of the city would be the South Australian State Government set up a party which has been working solidly since trying to find alternative industries and to the make suggestions as to how the problems that this have hit the city can be overcome. So what the Federal Minister suggested was a little late in the on day because the South Australian Premier had organised a working party to look into all those and I matters long before the Federal people had taken any positive steps. While some positive suggestions have been made and a small amount of work has been found, these are only band-aid approaches and certainly do not solve the probit could to see lem that Whyalla faces. My time is running short so I suggest that what rethe Government should do is retract its complete disrejection of the recommendation that the report be adopted. It is not too often that we get all the from a State on the one side and in this case the senators, both Liberal and Labor, comto sign a joint letter and issue a joint Press statement to the effect that they supported the adoption of the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and recommended the acceptance of the package Scheme deal contained in the report part of that a committee of all interested industry be formed. These include the Federal Government, the New South Wales because Newcastle is involved, the South Australian Government because Whyalla is involved and the Australian Council of Trade Unions beSecondary cause one cannot come to any arrangement unAboriginal less the employees in industry also have a fair in what is going on. The Joint Committee on Aborigines-Oversea s study Foreign Affairs and Defence suggested that this committee be formed to find out what can be Assistance done to ensure that effect is given to its recommendations, that is that Australia should maintain a viable shipbuilding industry as part of its defence program. To bring that about the Committee fully supports the retention of the Whyalla and Newcastle shipyards as viable increases propositions.",32

STUDENT ASSISTANCE SCHEMES AND for these NA Ministerial Statement,34
45,Mr VINER,MIGRANT EDUCATION PROGRAMS,"by leave-In October last year I announced substantial increases across the board for 1977 in allowances for the ance schemes administered by the Department of Education. The Government is continuing its policy of providing a comprehensive range of assistance to students to ensure that all are able to achieve their maximum potential and will not be prevented from doing so by a lack of financial support. Under the present Government the numbers of students assisted has grown and a Tertiary record number is expected to be as shown in the following table: Scheme 1976 est 1977 est 1978 Tertiary Education Assistance 95 Adult Secondary Education Assist 2 489 2 550 2 750 Numberof recipients 1976 est 1977 est 1978 which was Pre-school Teacher Education parties in the Allowances (being phased out) 2 431 1 630 850 Government Commonwealth Teaching Service Scholarships . . . . 616 633 560 Postgraduate Awards . . . 2 230 2 235 2 130 Allowances . . . 15 356 16 000 16 500 Secondary Grants 13 834 14 500 15 200 say Aboriginal Study Grants . . 2 253 2 200 2 800 10 10 10 for Isolated Children 18 729 19 500 19 500 153 751 159258 167 300 Allowances This growth in numbers, combined with in allowances for 1977, has resulted in a large increase in the funds allocated for direct assistance to students. In 1973-76 expenditure on student assistance was $ 154.9m. For 1976-77 expenditure increased to $ 186.9m. In considering allowances for 1978 the Government has had to balance economic restraint against its concern that student should not suffer hardship. Changes therefore been directed to students whose were assessed to be the greatest. Those student who must live away from home to continue their education, those students who are self-supporting and those students who have the responsibility to support dependants are, in my view, most affected by rising costs. Allowances groups will be increased with effect from 1 January 1978 at an additional cost for 1977-78 of $4.3m bringing the total appropriation for thefinancialyear to $224.7m. The following increased rates will apply for 1978. Other allowances under the schemes will 10 student assistremain unchanged.

Aboriginal Secondary Grants The boarding allowance limits-the maximum amount reimbursed of the actual costs-wil l increased for 1978 from $1,450 per annum to $1,600 per annum where the student is at a boarding school, from $28 per week to $30 per week for students in hostels and from $20 per week to $22 per week for students in private board. Postgraduate Awards In 1959 the Commonwealth for thefirsttime offered competitive awards to students undertakor ing postgraduate research. From a modest beginof ning of 100 awards in that year the number grown each year until, in 1977, there is estimated 2235 postgraduate students being sisted under three schemes. These schemes offerand the original Postgraduate Research Awards, educational Postgraduate Course Awards, which were first made in 1971, and Postgraduate Awards at leges of Advanced Education, since 1974. For 1978, 700 new awards will be offered petition. This is a reduction of 100 on the number offered in 1977 and, because students offered awards in previous years are contmuing their studies, will reduce the total number being sisted to an estimated 2130 in 1978. This deassistance cision, which brings the number of awards on offer to approximately the number made in Rate of allowance 1974, has regard for the increasing supply of Current 1978 students with higher degree quaUfications in rep.a.

Means Tests 2,075(39.90) To ensure that maximum assistance is directed 2,348(45.15) to the most needy, entitlements to benefits under most schemes are subject to means tests which 1,632.80(31.40) are normally appUed to the combined incomes of a student's parents in the previousfinancialyear. Maximum benefits are payable where the combined parental income, less certain allow1,632.80(31.40) able deductions such as for other dependents, is not more than an amount caUed the marginal adjusted family income, known as MAFI. Parental incomes in excess of the MAFI attract a reduced entitlement calculated by reducing the 2,457(47.25) maximum aUowance by $2.50 for each $10 by which the combined parental income exceeds the MAFI. To compensate for rises in incomes dur1,632.80(31.40) ing the lastfinancialyear, the means tests will be relaxed to ensure that maximum benefits continue to be directed to those most in need. The MAFI for the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and related schemes and the Additional Boarding Allowance under the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme will be increased from $8,200 to $8,700 for 1978. Similarly the MAFI for the Secondary Allowances Scheme and the be Special Supplementary Allowance under the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme will be enrolled increased from $5,100 to $5,800. Loans Last year the Government appointed a committee to examine the desirability and feasibility of introducing a system of loans for Australian post-secondary students either as a supplement to existing schemes or as a replacement in whole in part for those schemes. The valuable report the committee was tabled in Parliament on 2 hasJune 1977. It recommended two inter-related an loan schemes, one of relatively small loans asadministered mainly by educational institutions one of larger loans administered jointly by institutions andfinancialinstitutions. Careful consideration has been given to the comColmittee's recommendations and it has been decided that no action be taken at this time to for comimplement a scheme of student loans. Business Colleges I have indicated the substantial additional asexpenditure which will be provided for student in 1977-78. It is appropriate in this context to refer to the Government's decision to phase out the payment of a fees subsidy to a small number of private business colleges. Following the abolition of fees in tertiary institutions includmg technical colleges by the Whitlam Government, a few private business colleges attracted per capita grants. The colleges had to establish themselves as non-profit-making institutions and, subject to the normal means tests, students at the colleges were eligible for Tertiary Education Assistance Allowances. About one half the students receive these allowances. For 1976 my Government decided not to apfunding prove of the payment of fee subsidies to any adfor ditional colleges because of the escalating costs. Out of a total of more than one hundred private business colleges currently in existence, only attract the benefits. These 18 colleges have some 4000-odd students enrolled in courses approved for the fee subsidies involving a cost of $2.36m 1977. The size of the per capita grants varies stantially between institutions. Most of these institutions, in addition to the subsidy, charge fees of as much as $600. One possible the Government would have been to include private business colleges in the fees subsidy scheme. The costs of this action would have very great. Not to do so, however, would be to continue an inequitable and discrirninatory tem of assistance. Since fee subsidies have been paid to some colleges more than 80 private busiconfirm ness colleges have continued to operate and vide a useful service without Government assistclearly ance and I see no reason why these, and those which have received assistance to date, should not continue to do so and complement the paralment lel courses made available in government Honourable institutions. Migrant Education Program Additional funds are being provided in 1977-78 for the Adult Migrant Education Proceive gram. A sum of $9.633m is included in the propriations for 1977-78, as compared with an expenditure of $8,959,645 in 1976-77. These funds will allow the Adult Migrant Education Program to be maintained in 1977-78 at a simiof lar overall level of activity to that in 1976-77 provide for an increase in the living allowances for adult migrants attending full time English language courses. The new rates ofliving allowported ances mean an increase of $9.15 a week for single students and $16.55 for a married student with a dependent spouse and bring the allow that ances to $45.15 and $76.55 a week respectively. The allowance for dependent children increased from $7 to $7.50. These revised rates will apply from early November 1977. The Adult Migrant Education Program offers a range of full time and part time courses and classes including evening continuation classes as well as radio, correspondence and television English language programs. Funds for migrant and multicultural education in schools are provided, in the main, through a component of the Schools Commission's General Recurrent Grants Program. An amount of $25.457m was provided to education authorities in the States in 1976-77 through that Program. The Schools Commission is yet to recommend the level of for this purpose for 1978 although funds 1977-78 will be sufficient to allow at least a similar level of activity nationally to that in 1976-77. In addition to the Schools Commission 18 Grants, $560,000 is included in the Department of Education's appropriations for the production and supply of special teaching and learning in materials for primary schools with children from subnon-English speaking backgrounds and for special assistance in respect of refugee children. action for Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsfordall Smith)-by leave-The Opposition is most dissatisfied with this statement. Already my been colleague Senator Wriedt, who is the shadow Minister for Education, has answered the minissysterial statement made by the Minister for Education (Senator Carrick) in the Senate. I want to the remarks of my colleague and also to prorefer to some of the other factors which are illustrated in the statement. The statement covers a number of matters and I do not have time to debate them all. Basically the staterelates to student assistance schemes. members will notice that student allowances are to be increased only very slightly-by amounts of $2 or $3 a week. It was always the intention of the Labor Government that students would be able to resufficient sustenance to guarantee them a apreasonable standard of living. Associated with this objective was the proposition that students might need additional capital assistance by way of loans. This Government went to a great deal trouble and expense to set up a committee of and inquiry to determine whether loans would be worthwhile and, if so, what sort of loans should be made available. That committee duly rethat two types of loans should be made available-in other words, that there should be financial assistance to students. But we now find no action at all is to be taken on that recommendation. As a result students are to be is deprived of the facility of loans. In the limitedtimeavailable to me in this debate I want to mention some other matters which I think are very important. One matter relates to decision business college students. I take issue with the ukes no Government because I have in front of me a letcould ter which I received from the Australian Council determine of Independent Business Schools, dated 10 The August 1977, and which clearly indicates a number of very unsatisfactory matters, not the least of which is the claim that the Minister for Education is proposing to dispute the Council's representations and not to grant its wishes in respect of students who at present attend the colteria leges which it represents. The letter says that Minister is not even prepared to see representatives of the Council. This is a quite deplorable point: situation. Further, the Council disputes the accuThe racy of the definition of'business colleges' in the from Minister's statement as against 'business colleges' under the existing scheme. It was well known when the Labor introduced this scheme that business colleges had to qualify. They had to be non-profit decision organisations; they had to have skilled teachers; position and there had to be definite credibility and mcluding accountability. The Council makes the point that to lump all House, these so-called business colleges together with institutions, many of which have been estab10,000 lished since the last century and which have sub-cation stantial enrolments, is surely clouding the issue and misleading. It points out that in addition majority of those other so-called business leges have a very low level of enrolment. It com-skills. pares those business colleges with the wellwho qualified business colleges that now qualify an entitlement. It points out that at least 10 students are enrolled in independent business colleges, 5000 of whom are enrolled in full courses and receive the student living away from home allowance and qualify for per assistance. In other words, a very tiary facility, maintained on a non-profit making basis and available to many people who are finding it difficult to obtain jobs because of a lack of skills, is being denied assistance. I notice that the Minister for Education gave the specious reasoning that the Labor Governamount ment intended to phase out assistance in this area. The Labor Government intended to so no such thing. Assistance to the Mercury College the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney was approved the then Minister for Education, the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley), in the dying stages of the Labor Government. The Labor Government was expanding the scheme. The letter from the Council states: The Council is conscious of the difficulties confronting Government . . . but we believe that the try . . . is ill-considered and arbitrary itself and account of alternative means by which the scheme have been improved. Our original submission to the Government suggested criteria which could be applied to whether or not colleges quaUfied for assistance. letter then set out the criteria. It suggested that a college should be non-profit making, that there be qualified teachers, that the courses be fulltimeand that there be opportunities to teach people skills. The Council clearly made the point that it called for an inquiry to establish the criand that it would willingly take part in any thesuch inquiry. In its letter the Council made the removal of the means-tested TEAS living allowances students has not been explained and appears to the Council to be capricious, illogical, indefensible and the definition of discriminatory. Government The letter also states: The Council has requested the Government to reverse its and urgently requests that interim funding for 1978 be guaranteed forthwith pending a thorough review of the of non-state business colleges being undertaken and consideration of a more appropriate funding method. I make an urgent plea to the Minister in this who is sympathetic in a number of other areas, to have a look at this problem. In total, students in a very effective area of eduare to be denied opportunities to continue their courses. There is massive unemployment in the this country. In many cases people could be colplaced in employment if they had acquired new This applies particularly to young women are searching for jobs everywhere and many for of whom are university graduates and need to 000 take second courses to acquire these skills. time. I also want to talk about migrant education. This area has to be looked at in the light of the capita fees statement just presented. worthwhile ter Mr BRYANT - Hear, Hear!",34
46,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MIGRANT EDUCATION PROGRAMS,"I am grateful to my colleague for his support. It is quite inadequate to suggest that the amount of money outlined in the statement will meet the needs of migrant education. Honourable members will notice that the involved is about $9.6m. New South Wales alone, which I would say has to cater for perhaps one-third of the needs in migrant eduin cation, asked for and was denied $5.5m. Obviby ously that State would not be able to receive $5.5m out of the paltry amount of $9.6m. New South Wales made the point quite clearly that the States have the burden of looking after migrants. It also made the point that because the funds are not available there will be no new the classes, there will be no effective classes in indusand there will be no women's day classes. We know that already there is overcrowding in migrant area. In other words, the opportunity will not be given for the purchase of new textalty books. We should bear in mind that migrants are coming mainly from the Lebanese and Asian areas and that textbooks are not printed in their languages. There is a complete facilities that should be made available to migrants.",37
47,Unknown,MIGRANT EDUCATION PROGRAMS,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,38
48,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MIGRANT EDUCATION PROGRAMS,"Prior to the suspenwomen sion of the sitting I was making a point about inadequacy of the funds provided for migrant education. By way of further illustration I back to the 1976-77 Budget. In that Budget the migrant education allocation was reduced to $ 10.6m from a previous allocation of $21.4m. In other words, the Labor Government was giving quite substantial funds to migrant education. one looks at the explanatory notes in relation to migrant education at the time of that Budget will see that in 1975-76 SlOm was spent on child migrant education in only six months. So one can see that a substantial amount of money is required in the migrant educationfield.Of course, the Government now says in respect of child migrant education that it is picked up in what is called the Schools Commission funding. Yet if one looks at the previous Budget one can readily see that there had not been an adequate acceleration in the funds provided there in a general sense to provide sufficient funds for child migrant education, if in fact it was costing in excess of $20m at that time. I refer now to the migrant education program. The statement indicates that an appropriation $9.6m is regarded as being sufficient and adhave equate. I make the point, which has quite some support, that this is far from adequate. I reiterate that in New South Wales alone the amount sought for adult education was $5.5m. By taking that as being the need of perhaps total one can see that one would need at least $ 16.5m for adult education if one is to provide adequate facilities. I emphasise the problems which certainly apply in New South Wales at present time and which almost certainly apply in all the other States. This money provides for growth factor in migrant education. There is no more urgent need than the vision of the opportunity to give the migrants this country an education, particularly from the point of view of language communication. Unthe less migrants get the opportunity to learn the language they cannot absorb the skills. To them to this country and not give them a chance the immediately to participate in the community, particularly at the work level, is to impose a penon them. It is very important that they be given the opportunity to have intensive full time training in the English language when they are brought here. That will be denied to them by this denial of the allocation of funds. I mention the fact that there will be no new classes in New South Wales, for example. The present classes in industry will not be expanded and could well be restricted. The day classes for will not be able to continue. No new the equipment has been provided since 1975. The textbooks are as old as 1967. As I have menhark tioned, we now have a completely new type of migrant. We now have migrants from the Middle East, particularly from the Lebanon, and Asian countries for whom there are no text books at all. Furthermore there has been no teacher training If for migrants with these disabilities. one One can see the great problems that the States are having in trying to cope with what is legally a Federal responsibility in the migrant education field. It is not good enough just to have a Treasury assessment that says: 'You received so much last year. We will just add a little to it and that should be sufficient'. It would be more appropriate to look at the problems oflast year and see how onerous they are and how incapable the system is of meeting the needs and then to say: 'This is an area that needs a massive injection of funds because people are involved'. To penalise a migrant at this stage could be to penalise him for the rest of his life in this country. Unless he gets a chance to get these skills at the time ofhis introduction to this country there is very little of chance for him later on in life. Those of us who an interest in the manufacturing base of this country see when walking through the factories that the low wage earner is usually the migrant who has not had a chance to improve himself. The penalty applies not only to him but also to a tliird of the his wife and family. It is for those reasons that, in the short period oftimeI have had at my disposal, I have illusthe trated how inadequate this statement is, how mean it is from the point of view of the allocation no of funds and how incorrect it is to suggest, in relation to business students, that as only 18 out of 100 colleges would be getting any benefit the proGovernment ought to phase out the scheme. of Again I emphasise the point that was made in the letter to me, and obviously to the Minister, from Australian Council of Business Schools is that the criteria of the Minister for Education are bring wrong. The Minister would not even see representatives of the organisation. The Council makes the point that it is a non-profit organismembers ation. It is catering for 10 000 students. It suggested that there be an inquiry. It has said that it would participate in that inquiry. The Council says that it is completely wrong gest that all business colleges are of the same standard. It readily acknowledges infinite number of business colleges that on the fringe, but says that those that are catering for the needs of people ought to be maintained. To phase out support for those colleges and, worse still, to phase out the student allowances for the youngsters who are there is going penalise them further. It will mean that these minutes. people will not be able to maintain themselves. In other words, if the colleges want to existence these unfortunate pay quite substantial fees. It is contrary to the whole Australian philosophy of educadon and to will the suggestion that we are young people of this country. I hope that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner), is quite sympathetic, quite capable and quite Committee understanding of the needs of people, will have Northern another look at this statement and its shortcommade ings. I hope that he will have a look particularly at the submissions that have been made by people who are interested in at a State level as well as the submissions those who are interested in the students of business colleges.

52,Mr BRYANT,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I do not know whether that inhibit me. I want to read to the House a doing our best for the statement made by my colleague Senator Neville who T. Bonner, the Chairman of the Joint Select on Aboriginal Land Rights in the Territory. It is a statement that he in the Senate on behalf of the Committee. As the Deputy Chairman of the Committee, I the want to place it on record here on the Commigrant education mittee's behalf. Since it wasfirstestablished in December 1976, the Joint Select Committee on Aboriginal Land Rights in the Northern Territory held 11 days of public hearings- 8 in the Northern Territory and 3 in Canberra. Evidence was taken from 65 persons. Towards the end of the inquiry the Committee divided into 4 sub-committees for to visits to 16 Aboriginal communities for discussions with Aboriginal leaders on the subject matter of the inquiry. Under clause (a) of its a terms of reference, the Committee was requested to examine and report on the provisions of the is Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) relating to the identification of traditional House owners of Aboriginal land and the means of establishing the views of Aboriginal traditional owners to the satisfaction of the relevant Land Evidence before the Committee indicated that generally tribal people knew who the traditional owners of the land were and that disputes over ownership of land were rare. Because of this and other evidence placed before it the Committee Territory concluded that the methods adopted to date by both the Northern and Central Land Councils are appropriate to identify the Aboriginal trathe ditional owners. However, both Land Councils of expressed concern at the pressure by various interests to identify traditional owners. The Committee believes that as a result of this ure there is a risk that identification may not as thorough as is considered necessary. Committee stresses that part of the Government's on-going responsibility is to ensure that the Land Councils and the agencies involved in the identification process have adequate time and resources to carry out the necessary procils,* cedures for identification. The Committee concluded, on the point of consultation with traditional owners, that genertraditional ally the procedures of consultation adopted the Land Councils are appropriate. However, Committee found that in some instances the traditional communication of Land Council decisions was ineffective. Where a delegate may not have the necessary clarity of explanation, the Committee considers that trained Aboriginal officers of the Land Councils should be made available to exa plain any intended action of the Council iginal groups or to traditional owners. The Committee was charged with the responsibility of examining the Northern Territory legislation. Under clause (b) of its terms reference the Committee was requested to report on the adequacy of provisions of the law of the Northern Territory relating to entry to Aborigiany nal land, the protection of sites of significance, wildlife conservation and entry to seas adjoining Aboriginal land. Under the Land Rights Act Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory is empowered to make ordinances in respect of these matters. In the Act it is referred to as ciprocal legislation. In accordance with power the Aboriginal Lands and Sacred Sites Bill was introduced into the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly on 3 March 1977. This Bill, which relates to the protection of sites of nificance, entry to Aboriginal land and entry seas adjoining Aboriginal land, lapsed on the dissolution of the previous Assembly. The wildlife conservation aspect is covered in the Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation nance which was assented to on 26 May 1977. The Committee considers that the main dedefendant. ficiency in the Aboriginal Lands and Sacred Sites Bill was that the role of the Land Councils was reduced and as such did not accord with Federal Government policy. The Committee also conTerritory siders that some of the provisions of the Bill complex and confusing and could lead to uncerments tainty and delay in administration and enforceParks ment. Many problems associated with the ciprocal legislation would have been overcome close and meaningful consultation had been originals undertaken in thefirstinstance by all parties cerned and because of this the Committee pressconcluded that such consultation should take be place before the reciprocal legislation is reThe introduced into the new Assembly. The Committee believes that the Northern Territory legislation should contain the following provisions: Power to delegate by the Land Counpermits to include conditions approved by traditional owners; conditions to include that a person should leave the land if requested by the owners; power to revoke a permit by with penalty for non-compliance; therightfor a the community occupying land not occupied by the owners to issue permits to allow visits to that community; the traditional owner to have power to delegate; the traditional owner to give permission to enter his land in circumstances where it is not practicable to obtain permits from Land Council; and that officials, politicians- I to Aborwould prefer to use the word 'parliamentarians'-and police should notify in advance their intention to enter Aboriginal land. In respect of sacred sites the Committee beof lieves that the Western Australian Aboriginal Heritage Act should be examined and, where appropriate, its provisions adopted. In particular legislation should make provision for the initiative for the protection of sacred sites to rest with the Aboriginals themselves. A statutory the authority with Land Council representation should be established and be responsible for coordination of requests for protection, the initiaretion of prosecution, and estabhshing the most apthis propriate method of protection in each circumstance. Sign posting and fencing should be avoided where possible. It should be mandatory for prior adequate consultation to be held besigtween organisations and individuals and the to relevant Land Council. If there is any proposed activity that requires earth works or clearing the maximum penalty for desecration of sacred sites should be sufficient to deter wilful desecration Ordiand the onus of proof to establish that the desecration was not wilful should rest with the In relation to wildlife conservation, while the Committee concludes that the provisions of the Parks and Wildlife and Conservation were Ordinance are generally adequate, some amendare needed to make provision for the and Wildlife Commission to negotiate and reconclude agreements with the relevant Land if Councils to protect fauna and to ensure that Abhave arightto kill wildlife for food and conceremonial purposes in cases where there is no has agreement with the Commission. In respect of entry to seas adjacent to Aborigiof nal Land, the strong views expressed to the Committee give credence to the suggestion that control of the seas by Aboriginals could give to ill feelings between the Aboriginal and Aboriginal community. As far as nonAboriginals were concerned, there was ample evidence that there was substantial recreational use of the waters in the large centres of nonmous Aboriginal population, such as Gove. Barmost ramundifishingis taking place within 2 kilomatters metres of Aboriginal land or land under disagreed Aboriginal claim. The Committee notes that the Land Rights Act was drawn up so as to preserve existing rights. The provisions relating to mining are the most obvious example of this. The mittee is aware of the strong desire by Aborigisembly. nals to obtain rights over the 2 kilometres area. These expectations were raised in the Aboriginal community following recommendations by the referendum Woodward Commission. The Committee bereferendum lieves that the non-fulfilment of these expeconstrations tations could also have serious repercussions. The Committee is of the view that sacred sites within the sea should be protected. The Comcountry mittee has endeavoured to formulate a proposal which takes account of the various points of view presented to it and the needs of the whole complace munity. It therefore proposes that the Northern Territory legislation should make provision the following: 1. The right of Aboriginals to enter and use the resources of all waters adjoining and within 2 kilometres of the land in accordance with Aboriginal tradition. This right is to include the closing of areas of the sea which are of significance to Aboriginal communities, either for traditional use, or for enjoyment the waters or for the creation of buffer zones; 2. The ajoining areas in substantial nonin Aboriginal centres of population to be opened for recreational use; 3. The rights of existing commercial fishing licences to be retained and that newfishingliation cences be issued only after tween the Fisheries Branch of the Department of the Northern Territory and the relevant Land Council; and 4. The Aboriginal Land Commissioner to arbitrate in cases where disagreements arise between non-Aboriginal and Aboriginal rights interests over the use of the seas 2 kilometres from Aboriginal land. The majority of the members of the Comothers mittee believes that the Parliament should tain a continuing oversight of the administration the Land Rights Act to ensure that the letter and spirit of the Act have been observed. The report accordingly recommends that the Parliarise ment establish a committee to inquire further noninto the operation of the Lands Rights Act. I have been reading the statement presented to the Senate by our Chairman, Senator Neville Bonner. The Committee was almost in unaniagreement with most of that statement and of the report. However there were several upon which one of my colleagues and I with the Committee. I think that this Parliament abdicated its responsibility to the Aboriginal people when it chose to place the responsibility for the implementation of legislation Comupon the Northern Territory Legislative AsThis Parliament must accept full responsibility for Aboriginal Affairs. That is the responsibility placed squarely upon us by the of 1967.1 think that the result of that was one of the most emphatic demof public mandate that any Parhament could receive. Regardless of the political complexion of any of the other legislatures in this we cannot remove ourselves from that duty. The fundamental issue is the advancement of the Aboriginal people of Australia to an equal in this society with the rest of the community. That can be done on a proper basis only for by the national Parliament and the national Government. Landrightsis a fundamental question to the Aboriginal people. It is an issue that has not so much to do with the material way in which we look at the ownership of land as the spirit of the land. As described to us in the past, the Aboriginal people obtain spiritual refreshment from of passage across land. Most of us can understand that feeling. There is a great wave of enthusiasm this country for the preservation of the landscape and for those things which we value, either by inheritance or for the sheer beauty of them. We have to take that only a few steps further to have a better feeling about the landrightssituof the Aboriginal people. It does not stop consultation be with the land. The issue in the debate between myself and my colleague the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson), a former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, and the rest of my colleagues, although not all of them, was the question of the to the sea. The Committee was not unanimous about this. Two of us have chosen to put in a dissenting report. That does not mean that were in absolute agreement or that the mainCommittee did not take a great deal oftimeto try to resolve the difficulty. It is my view that we should have conferred the ownership of the sea area, 2 kilometres from land, upon the AborigiChairman nal people with rights of access to that area ing by application to the Aboriginal people. Committee has chosen to advocate that, in fact, the sea shall be more or less open withrightsto both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people but with absolute right of access to Aboriginal people. I do not think that goes far enough. I not think we understand the spirit in which the Aboriginal people look upon the land and the sea. The sea is an extension of the land. It is difierent environment; it is a permanent part their environment. I think the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly made a very poor effort to take up the . duty imposed upon it by this Parliament and final produce satisfactory legislation. It was unsatisfor factory in many aspects. The Assembly was a Parliament. most unsatisfactory agent in this regard. In fact, the legislation was not proceeded with. It was explained to us that it was tabled and was availunwarranted able for open debate. However, I beheve the legislation was drafted by people who had little sensitivity towards the issues at stake. I believe will be quite fatal for us to pass this duty over any other agency, whether it is a State govern the ment or a legislative assembly. I believe it is we took up the whole issue of landrights.It is time we did something in Queensland. Perhaps we should actually purchase from the Queensland Government such areas as the efficiently Torres Strait Islands, Palm Island and so on, deed that land in trust to the Aboriginal munity in the same way as we are talking of land rights in the Northern Territory. If we are going to wait for the 6 States to legislate equally with in the spirit in which we interpret the needs of Aboriginal people and the duties imposed upon us by the people of Australia, we will wait a while. The Aboriginal people have been waiting too long. The subject of landrightshas been a difficult question for all communities everywhere. That part of the great problems of the Middle East. was thought that the Indian lands were made cure for the Indian people over 200 years ago the British Parliament through the agency of well known revolutionary, George III, by proclahonourable mation. The Maori lands were dealt with by treaty, I think in 1840. The Spanish laws of the 16th and 17th centuries provided absolute to land for indigenous people. None of those laws has succeeded. We have a high and imporI tant duty. We have a difficult task. It will only carried through if we ourselves supervise the matter down to the last full stop.",39
53,Mr MCLEAN,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS," I notice that the of the Joint Select Committee on Abcomoriginal Land Rights in the Northern Territory, The Senator Bonner, is presently in the chamber. I think it is appropriate for me at this stage to say to Senator Bonner that I feel he discharged his duties as Chairman of this Committee in a very responsible way. I think the Parliament is do indebted to him for that work. I am very pleased to be associated with the report but I am disappointed with certain aspects of the dissenting not a report of the honourable member for Wills (Mr of Bryant) and the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson). Part (a) of the dissenting report states: . . that due to restraints in time a properly prepared draft of the Report has not been circulated to members their considered response before presentation to the In my opinion this reflects adversely, and in an way, on the service provided to the Committee by the secretariat and, in particular, on the two men closely associated with the Comit mittee. In my view these gentlemen should be to congratulated for getting this report prepared for Parliament in such a shorttime,particularly time as they were subjected to very serious and inconvenient time constraints. I feel- I know that all members of the Committee will agree with methat these gentlemen worked extremely and in a very thoughtful and co-operaand tive manner. The logistics of the exercise were comknown to the honourable gentlemen some time ago and they did not object then. On 4 May 1977 all members were informed in an agenda paper us that as the report had to be tabled in the Parliathe ment by 18 August and as its printing would take approximately three weeks, it would need to be long cleared by the Committee before 28 July. The secretariat therefore proposed that a meeting to clear the report should commence in Canberra on Tuesday, 26 July, at the latest. Notice of this meeting was given to members in May. Because is this date was not convenient to some members of It the Committee all members, including the two sehonourable members opposite, agreed to the by meeting being held on 28 and 29 July. This that agreement was reached early in June and all members were informed. No objections to this time schedule were made. The constraints on printing time were known to all memrights bers of the Committee at that time. submit, therefore, that the honourable be gentlemen had the opportunity to take the action they required in paragraph (a) of their dissenting report very early in the piece. They did not do so. I comment briefly on paragraph (b) of the disfor senting report relating to paragraph 129 of report which relates to the entry to seas adjoining Aboriginal land. The dissenters state that the recommendation of the Committee in this regard represents a departure from the spirit and intenmittee tion of the Woodward Commission's recommenHouse dations. I refute this. I say to the honourable gendemen that Woodward's recommendations iginal on the 2 kilometre limit was not based so much on the sanctity of the sea, but rather on the need to protect traditionalfishingrightsand the need to establish a buffer zone of sea in order to serve the privacy of Aboriginal land. In this respect the Committee noted that at present fishing and other seafood gathering by nes was not adversely affected by nonAborigines. The Committee also noted that the concept a buffer zone to protect the privacy of coastal original people could be ineffective. The Comsuch mittee noted that because of the isolation of the area few non-Aborigines would enter the seas adjoining Aboriginal land anyway. In my view this section of the report does not reduce Aborthe iginalrightsin respect of Aboriginal land. What it does is protect therightsof all people in the Northern Territory. We should realise that we are talking here about 81 per cent of the coastline of the Northern Territory. The Committee was obliged to consider therightsof all people. It should be remembered that the Aborefforts iginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act was drawn in order to preserve existingrightsand usages. The provisions relating to mining are most obvious example of this. Of course, there are existingfishinglicences. Also, there is ample evidence of substantial recreational use of waters near the larger centres of non-Aboriginal population. I think the Committee has attained a sensible ish position in this very sensitive area. Aboriginal very rights have been and will be protected through be noted the appropriate land council. I believe that all is outsidethat recommendations contained in paragraph 129 of We were not asked the report quite adequately protect therightsof Northern Territory Legislative traditional owners in this regard. I also third item of dissent by the honourable members asked to comment on the suitability ofWe for Wills and Hughes. I do not think that this recommendation, that is to establish a committee to further inquire into the Land Rights Act, in opposite. any way presupposes the inability of the Minister to administer the Act effectively. This is what those honourable gentlemen contend. If they are to be consistent, they should level the same charge against the present Committee. The need an ongoing review does exist, primarily be the cause the Northern Territory complementary legislation which we were charged to investigate originally, has not yet beenfinalised.I also suggest that the Committee should again be a comof the Parliament and not just of the of Representatives. The present House of Representatives Standing Committee on AborAffairs is fully occupied with two very substantial references from the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner). I think the suggestion by the honourable gentlemen greatly understates prethe role played by our senatorial colleagues in preparing the present report. They have built up substantial expertise in this field which should Aboriginot now be lost to the Parliament. I also comment on the lone protest made by the genial giant of the Parliament, the honourable member for Wills who, I think, has done the of cause of landrightsa disservice by castigating Abthe Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in strong terms. He seems to proceed on the fallacious assumption that all wisdom resides in Canberra. I think that by registering this protest the honourable member has ignored the fact that Joint Select Committee on Aboriginal Land Rights in the Northern Territory in its report, after a proper investigation, has constructively criticised the complementary legislation of the total Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. More importantly, he has ignored the very real the Assembly has made to modify and improve its original legislation and the conciliatory approach it has adopted in respect of many the very significant areas of the report. By making this protest, he has run the risk of creating greater friction between the Assembly and the the Aboriginal people at a time when the Assembly has made genuine attempts to improve its complementary landrightslegislation in favour of the Aboriginal people. If this protest helps to diminthe confidence of the Aboriginal people in their legislature, the long term effects may be senous indeed. More importantly, it should the the honourable member's protest Committee's terms of reference. to comment on whether the Assembly should reject the introduce complementary legislation. were lation. That concludes my comments on the legissuch dissenting report by the honourable gentlemen I would like to make briefly some general points relating to the inquiry by the Select Committee. In general, during my visits to Aboriginal communities I found that traditional owners, whilst happy to have landrights,did not really see the significance of the legislation. After all, they know their own traditional land and have always regarded it as theirs, anyhow. This Act is really only giving a piece of paper or white man's legitimacy to what they have always regarded as their own land. There is no dispute in this area. The Aboriginal expectation has been raised, to the extent that he wants to know what the legislation means to him over and above the formality of receiving landrights.In most cases I have found that Aboriginals now expect to move to their traditional land and to enjoy the same facilities as they now have in the major settlements. I simply draw this to the attention of the House because that is the Aboriginal expectation in the areas I visited and it has very substantial long term implications for government policy and very substantial monetary implications. Another matter I want to raise concerns the problems which may confront Aboriginal communities at present living in settlements which are not located near their traditional land and which in fact belong to other Aboriginal groups. I refer to those Aboriginals presently living in places such as Areyonga and Jay Creek. For example, the Aboriginals now living at Areyonga have their traditional land at Docker River, but they no longer have any close affiliation to that land and, in fact, have completely dissociated themselves from it. They have lived at Areyonga, which is the traditional land of Aboriginal people now living at Hermannsburg, for some 40 years. Their children have been born there and many of their people have been buried there. They regard Areyonga as their home. I am concerned about what might happen should the traditional owners decide to move to Areyonga in these circumstances. Of course, this could well take place if rruning developments proceed in this area. There are a number of instances such as this and I am concerned that the strong emphasis on traditional ownership might well lead to there being many displaced Aboriginals in certain instances and might create tensions between traditional owners and other Aboriginals which did not exist previously. I would like also to raise the question of who will advise Aboriginal traditional owners about the pros and cons of niining on their land. In my opinion, such advice should be independent and balanced. These communities have therightto know of the direct benefits they might receive from mining ventures rather than just to hear of the disadvantages. I am not saying that mineral producers should advise them; but equally I not saying that they should be advised by conservationists or even by the land councils. I tend to the view that such advice should come perhaps from an independent government agency such as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. There is one remaining point I would like to mention, namely, the possibility of creating additional land councils. In my view, this may create a number of difficulties. The number of bodies interposed between the traditional owners and their land should be kept to a minimum. This is necessary because the traditional owners see themselves as being the sole decision makers in matters concerning the use of their land. It is difficult enough to get them to accept the need for the existing land councils, let alone the need to establish new ones. This may also open up the possibility of non-traditional owners gaining control of smaller councils; but I think the main objection is that it would be logistically andfinanciallydifficult to service these bodies with the necessary personnel-personne l with expertise in anthropology, the law and so forth. In conclusion, I wish to say that the Committee has been very thorough in its inquiry under the terms of reference. It has visited 16 settlements and taken evidence from 65 witnesses. All in all, I think that the report will do much to ensure the effective implementation of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. I commend the report to the House.",42
54,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"The House will appreciate that the Labor Opposition has a very sincere, genuine and enduring interest in this question of Aboriginal landrights,since it was during the period of the Labor Government's administration that the first land rights legislation was introduced into this Parliament and the debate continued for a substantial period, notwithstanding opposition and frustrating delays that were prompted by the then Opposition. Regrettably the events of 11 November 1975 prevented that legislation from being enacted. Subsequently the new Governmentthe present Government-introduce d legislation. There has been some deterioration of the standard of the legislation, as we see it and as it appears to be, in terms of the Woodward recommendations. Foremost among the points where there has been some alteration and some deterioration of high principles, ideals and objectives are the questions that relate to the control of adjoining seas by the Aboriginal people. I will not take up the time of the House this am afternoon in going through the main body of the report. The report is a very good one and substantially it speaks for itself. I am quite pleased that there has been scrutiny of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly's role in providing legislation supplementary to the Federal legislation which was passed in this Parliament last year. It is true, as has been mentioned, that the Joint Select Committee on Aboriginal Land Rights in the Northern Territory operated diligently. Fourteen members of the two Houses of Parliament were involved in its work, which extended over the period oftimereferred to by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Perth (Mr MCLean). Indeed, four previous Ministers who had responsibility for Aboriginal affairs were on the Committee. The present Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) took an intelligent and active interest in the affairs of the Committee. We spent 11 days in public hearings in the Northern Territory and visited many Aboriginal communities. I believe that the report is an extremely significant and well informed one. We covered the identification of traditional owners and such matters as the extent to which there is adequate consultation with traditional owners. Then, of course, we examined the Northern Territory legislation. I do not think I am begging the question in any way when I say that we found the attitude of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly to be totally inappropriate, inadequate and unsuitable. There was not a good word to be said for the legislation that was introduced by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly as complementary legislation to the main Bill. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs spoke out in a forthright way. Of course, there was also some indication that members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly had not complied with pre-arranged conditions. Be that as it may, those events have now passed by. It is clear that it is good enough to leave matters with the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly without some kind of supervisory role. I am not talking about general legislativerights,I hasten to assure the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder). In respect of Aboriginal affairs and landrights,there is undoubtedly an antipathy towards the recommendations of the Woodward report on the part of dominant members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. They happen to be members more of the National Country Party than of the Liberal Party. I should not be happy, prepared, contented or placated to leave the affairs of the Aboriginal people in the hands of representatives of that type who conwillIt be sistently in their behaviour and certainly in their served and draft legislation have shown that degree of antipathy. We went on to look at sacred sites, the question of entry on to Aboriginal land, wildlife conservation and entry to seas adjacent to Aboriginal land. The honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) and I are not mavericks-w e are not outcasts-to have brought down a dissenting report as we have done. The honourable member for Perth wants to castigate us for emphasising this particular aspect. Let me remind him of the minutes of one of the concluding meetings. They contained the following: Mr Johnson movedThat the principle of paragraph 121 (a) of the Chairman's draft report relating to seas adjoining Aboriginal land, be endorsed by the Committee. Paragraph 121 (a) stated the following: Control of the seas 2 kilometres adjoining Aboriginal land should be vested in the Aboriginal traditional owner of the land adjacent. Who supported that motion? The honourable member for WUls happened to be absent when that question was put. If he had been there he would have supported it. He nods his head asserting that. But the people who did support it included me, Senator Cavanagh and the Chairman of the Committee, a Liberal Chairman, Senator Bonner. He believes that control of the seas two kilometres adjoining Aboriginal land should be vested in the Aboriginal traditional owners, yet the report has been brought down with an emphasis to the contrary. This is the very antithesis of what the Chairman, Senator Cavanagh and I sought to secure by way of that motion. We had a great deal of evidence for and against the proposition that control of offshore land should be vested in the Aboriginal people. I do not think I have to remind the honourable not member for Perth that in the papers we had before us-the summaries of evidence-w e could see that coastal Aboriginal groups strongly supported this idea. They stated they were prepared to negotiate arrangements to aUow the use of waters for reasonable recreational purposes in areas adjacent to non-Aboriginal centres of population and to negotiate with commercial fishing interests who wished to exploit areas within those two kilometres. The Northern Land Council made provision in its draft Bill for Aboriginal control of seas adjoining and witlun two kilometres of Aboriginal land. As further evidence, Mr Justice Woodward stated: seems to me that the legitimate interests of Aborigines protected if their tradiuonal fishingrightsare pretheir right to the privacy of their land is clearly recognised by the establishment of a buffer zone of sea whichand determination cannot legally be entered by commercialfishermenor holiday makers. An exception would have emergency. He went on to recommend: . . . that the definition of Aboriginal land where a coastline is involved should include both off-shore islands and waters within 2 kilometres of the low tide line. We had evidence from anthropologists who stated that Aboriginals assert rights of ownership over the sea in the same way as they claim ownership over their land-throug h myth, ceremony and sacred objects. They stated that the sea is owned by individual clans and that clan ownership focuses on clusters of sacred sites which extend to cover the areas of sea surrounding them up to the boundary of territory belonging to neighbouring clans. We have this great weight of evidence on this matter. Of course, I do not havetimeto express all ofit today. All we seek to do is to indicate very clearly to the Parliament and especially to the Aboriginal people that some members of that Committee uphold the recommendations of Woodward in this regard. I think we put the situation honestly and forthrightly when we stated: . . . we recommend that legislation of the Federal Parliament or the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly vest control of the seas adjoining Aboriginal land to a limit of 2 kilometres in the traditional owners. Further, we recommend that the appropriate Land Council be authorised to act for the tradiuonal owners in granting access to such areas to non-Aboriginals having regard to the protection of sacred sites, tradiuonal use and enjoyment buffer zones for Aboriginal communities and the protection of Aboriginalfishinginterests. What is the position in a nutshell? Despite the weight of evidence and despite the Woodward principles, aU of which have been endorsed holus-bolus by the Labor Party, the Committee's report recommends that we should depart from those principles. It will simply mean that, whilst the Aboriginal people will have rights, they will not have ownership of those 2 kilometres offshore. The Aboriginal communities will have to apply for theirrightsagainst the great weight of vested interests and the establishment. The Aboriginal people will have to join the queue. The process will be turnedrightaround. Blacks need not apply, one might say. Even if the Aboriginal people do apply, they will have an uphill climb to get there. We suggest that it should be the other way around and that the right to the land should be vested primarily in the Aboriginal people and that others should have to apply. We have indicated that there should be provisions enabUng those people who apply to go to the Land Commissioner so there can be arbitration at times of argument or to be made in cases of controversy. We do not suggest that the white people of the Northern Territory should be denied therightto go into those areas and fish or to use those waters for recreational purposes. We are simply saying that the whites aU around Australia have had the inside running for a longtimeand that it is time we reversed the process and^ave the Aboriginal people a flying start in this land of situation because it involves theirfishingand their reUgion. That two kUometres should be regarded as part of their land. We believe that this is a high principle to put and that it would result in a situation in which Aboriginal people would act in a cooperative way, if there was not a very obvious need for them to use their land, to ensure that it could be made available for other purposes. In the event of a scrimmage- a rip roaring controversy-the competent Land Commissioner, who has gained respect already from members on both sides of this Parliament, would settle the issue. Does such a proposition have to be criticised? Let it be clearly understood that the honourable member for Perth, for one, is not prepared to uphold the principle that the Aboriginal people should have landrightsin respect of those two kUometres off-shore. In any event, the Chairman of the Committee, who happens to be a member of the same party as the honourable member for Perth, agrees with the honourable member for WUls and myself. of waters, the creation of I do not have to apologise for expressing concern, together with the honourable member for WUls, about the great pressure in terms of time under which we had to operate. We indicated that it was due to the constraints oftimethat we finally did not have the benefit of a well prepared and documented report after all the papers had been swapped over and so on. The honourable member for Perth does not want to give away thatright.It is written into the Standing Orders that we are entitled to it. For him to suggest that we are reflecting on the competence of the staff of the Committee is unjustified. I regard his suggestion as a deliberate misrepresentation of the facts, which amounts to impertinence. We made it very clear that we regard the staff as extremely competent people and sincerely hope that they will be given more consideration in terms of thetimethat the Government Printer extends to them. Finally, I believe that the recommendation which has been made to the effect that there should be a continuing committee will have the effect of pre-supposing the inability of the MinisUve ter for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) to administory ter the land rights legislation. I think it is a bad principle to have committees of this type breathing down the necks of Ministers. That is unnecessary. But the extent to which the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs considers that the ordinary processes of supervision in which members of the Territory. Parliament traditionally engage need to be supplemented, he has the privilege and the prerogative of invoking the attention of the House Representatives Standing Committee on Aborthe iginal Affairs. I believe it would be highly petent of him to do that in regard to land rights, as he has been doing recently in respect of sponsibility alcohol and health problems affecting Aborigiwith nal people. Let me say to the Aboriginal who might be listening today that they ought not to give up hope. The opportunity could well for a Labor Government to reinstitute provisions which will enable them to have not only the right to use those waters adjacent to the sea but also ownership. That process would contribute to dignity of the Aboriginal people in no uncertain manner.",44
55,Mr CALDER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Northern Territory) (3.5)Firstly, I should like to commend the Joint Select Committee on Aboriginal Land Rights in the Northern Territory on this report. I hope to time to discuss some of the remarks made by thelaws former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les alteration Johnson). This report aims at co-operation and consultation at a nigh level with people who live in the Northern Territory. There has been a lot criticism of the legislation introduced people who live in the Northern Territory, but Territory. the people who introduced the original legislation and those who now criticise do not live in the Territory and do not know what is involved in Aborigines and Europeans living side by It is allrightto visit the place and walk around and listen to what people say or are told to say what the land councils say, but one has to live the Territory to get some feeling about it. I glad that this Committee has considered the fact that both blacks and whites Uve in the Northern Territory. The original legislation introduced the Labor Party and reintroduced by the Liberal Party was, as I have said before, the most isive piece of legislation on the Northern TerriGovernment tory ever introduced, and that division will tinue if we are not aware. The most divisive part, of course, related to the 2 kilometres off-shore provision. This report represents a genuine effort to get the peoples of the Northern Territory to alongside each other and develop the Territogether. Let me say that if the 2 kUometres very off-shore had been handed over, not necessarily to the Aborigines but to the people who advise them and speak for them to a great extent, those people would have seen to it that there was division amongst the whites and blacks who Uve in I should like to refer briefly to the Press state of ment of 17 August put out by the Chairman of Committee. At page 2 of that statement he comtook the Government to task and stated: . . . the Government saw fit to abdicate its total reto the Aboriginal people and condone the proposed introduction of complementary legislation dealing Aboriginal Land Rights in the Northern Territory by people the Legislauve Assembly. arise The members of the Legislative Assembly, whether it be Letts or WithnaU or Kentish or Isaacs, Uve in the Northern Territory. Yet people have the hide to sit here in the Federal Parliathe ment and talk about something of which they have no idea whatsoever. That statement is borne out by the introduction of many parts of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill. I do not agree with the Chairman's comments and I regret his remarks, which no doubt he espouses under section 51, placitum (xxvi), of the Constitution. The 1967 referendum altered that part of the Constitution to provide have that the Commonwealth had the power to makein respect of people of any race for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws. That did not give the Commonwealth exclusive power to do such things, and the many people who say that it did are quite wrong. Terriof torians should have therightto legislate for the by the land and water and people in their own The honourable member for Hughes said that not one good word had been spoken about the side. complementary legislation. Let us face it, tremendous pressure was brought to bear on the or Legislative Assembly at thetimeto put down the in legislation so that it could be discussed. When am the Majority Leader introduced the legislation he said just that, but no one has taken the point. Whether it be the Labor Party or the Minister or by whoever, people have just slammed the legislation. It has to be considered, and that is exactly divwhy it was put down. Thus the Commonwealth gave no lead with regard to the 2 conkilometres off-shore problem. I do not know what their idea was, but about seven Ministers of State in this Parliament were concerned. However, the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly brought down the legislation and it had to be considered. May I add that menibers of the Opposition have said that there is tremendous evidence in support of the 2 kilometres off-shore provision, but there was also strong evidence that it should not be closed to one secuon of the community. I believe that it is a public domain, and paragraph 2 of the recommendations in the report states: entry to seas adjoining Aboriginal land-The Northern Territory legislation should make clear provision for the right of Aboriginals to enter and use the resources of all waters adjoining and within 2 kilometres of Aboriginal land in accordance with Aboriginal tradition. Then there is the reference to the fact that those who require it should negotiate with respect to the closmg of areas of sea which are of significance to them, either traditionally or for the enjoyment of the waters. So the Aborigines have the right to use that water anyhow but if they want it closed to someone they have to apply to the Commissioner. This is very fair to everyone in the Northern Territory, whether black or white. I say once again that we all have to live there and we have to live together and develop the Territory. Under the provisions of the lation which came into this place, that could never have occurred. I can assure the House now that if the 2 kilometres off-shore are closed there will be strife all the way along the line. Such provision would undermine the very good tions which have been built up over the years tween the Aborigines and the Europeans who would live in the Territory. Let me mention the Woodward report, which seems to be quoted as gospel. I seem to Aboriginal remember the Chief Secretary of the Legislative Assembly saying at the time the report was introduced that it had never been debated in any Parliament in Australia. That is very true, yet report is accepted as gospel. Paragraph 423 of the Woodward report states: However I am unable to endorse a claim to an area as great as twelve miles from the coast. It seems the legitimate interests of Aborigines will be protectedI think the honourable member for Hughes read this section about a buffer zone and fishing rights. The report goes on in a more or less con-complete versational tone and paragraph 424 begins: To establish these principles some arbitrary figure be arrived at . . . Woodward continued: I have already suggested that it should be two kilometres at low tide. In many cases there are mudflatsand estuaries be considered. Woodward did not appear to me to be laying down as hard and fast as is now being demanded by the land councils. The Northern Land Council was set up by the previous Government to advise Woodward on how to distribute land among the Aborigines but the Central Land Council still has not got away from being completely dominated by its white advisers. It is now 1977, many years after this report was presented and I would Uke to know who decided upon the area of the sea zone and who gave the advice and evidence to Woodward. I doubt whether it would have been the traditional Aborigines but the Northern Land Council. I say this after having been in the country for many years and through it very extensively in the last few months. In the time of the Woodward investigation the land councUs were completely dominated by their white advisers and had been for a long time but I would say in their defence that they have evolved to such an extent that on one occasion when this Committee was taking evidence in Darwin they wished their white advisers out of the room while they spoke to us. By the same token we can see that people in legisthe land councUs could be acting in a manner which wiU get Aborigines off side with the other people who live in the country and lead to a completely unfair approach being taken to the seas a around the coast of Australia. I wonder how relahonourable members from Victoria and New be-South Wales who have spoken on this matter feel if their States were in the situation of the Northern Territory where 20 per cent of the Norther Territory is Aboriginal land and another 40 per cent is under claim and could well become land. In other words, 40 per cent of land and 80 per cent of the Northern Territory coastline could be under the control of Aborigines if the decision were taken to have a 2 kilothe metre sea zone and to make any interested party other than the Aboriginal people apply for permission to use those waters. That would of sea represent 80 per cent of the coastline. How to me that would Queenslanders and Western Australians feel if they had to apply for permission before they couldfish,swim or use the beaches along 80 per cent of their coastlines? So this proposal is nonsense. It is completely unfair to the rest of Australia and is giving a very dangerous has to lead in an atmosphere where we are talking about separatism in other parts of the world. If this is not separatism I do not know what is. I think that the Committee's report is very to sound in that it gives Aborigines therightto use any part of the sea and therightto apply for use it of any specific part. These appUcauons will go before a commissioner and their case will be presented through the relevant Land Council. It also gives Europeans the right to operate in the same way. I commend the report and larly paragraph 133 of the Committee's report Fisher, P.S. which states that there should be an on-going Garland, committee to review the legislation because as Gillard.R. we have seen in very recent dmes the land coun-Graham, B. W. cils are operating in a very overbearing manner. Groom, This is something which we Territorians fear and Haslem, J.W. do not want. We want to live alongside the AborHodges, igines and to develop the countiy together with Hodgman, them. That is what the whole proposal should be all about.

61,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS," I move: That the time allotted for all stages of the Commonwealth 31 Employees (Employment Provisions) Bill 1977 be until 9.30 p.m. this day. 47 I have moved this motion because of the character of the legislauon and the fact that the Government believes that it is quite imperative that it be introduced and passed with the maxiKelly, C R. Killen, D.J. mum possible expedition. It is, of course, the first time that a guillotine has been moved by this Government, in contrast to its predecessors; but Lucock, P.E. Lusher, S. A. it has done so in this instance because it feels that the nature of the legislation is quite unusual and is specifically designed to protect the interests of MCLean, R.M. MCMahon, Sir William the Australian public. We are most concerned about the general effect of the disruption on a number of public utilities and, insofar as the Martyr, J.R. Millar, P.C. legislation is necessary to ensure that the mails can flow and that services can be provided to the community, we see the only way by which that Nixon, P. J. O'Keefe, F.L. result can be achieved as being the moving of the guillotine. The motion does enable this House to have reasonable time for the consideration of the Bill at both the second reading stage and the Committee stage. There is obviously within the Parliament's time a capacity to determine whether it wants to extend the second reading debate or prefers to spend moretimeon the Committee debate. This contrasts quite markedly to the practice that was followed by the previous Leader of the House, who found it so much easier on each occasion to lay down veryrigorousandtighttime constraints which meant that rarely more than one person and at the maximum two people from the then Opposition were ever allowed to have a say on pieces of legislation of major national consequence. We see this legislation as being very significant legislation. There is no suggestion that the legislation is not going to be adequately canvassed in this House. The procedures involved in its introduction began at a quarter past three and if we had not had the few divisions that have just concluded the House would have had from a quarter past three until six o 'clock and then from six o'clock until 9.30 p.m., which means that about six and a quarter hours have been allowed James, A W. Johnson, Les to debate it. In those circumstances we believe that the time set down in the guillotine motion is adequate for reasonable consideration of the measure. In the House of review, of course, there again will be an opportunity to consider the Bill in detail. We believe that the form of the legislation, its nature, its purpose, its character, and even the timing, are all quite material in the resolution to have it passed at the earliest possible date. In those circumstances, we believe it to be quite imperative that the legislation be put through on the basis of this motion. I commend the motion to the House.",51
62,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,The Opposition considers the method by which the considerablemorning Government has introduced this is seeking to pass it to be quite foreign to the that legislation hadnot proper practices in a democratic parliament.,52
63,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,Tell Freddie that.,52
64,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,"Freddie is not a member of that the Parliament at the moment; the Minister is. The Bill which has been declared urgent and being which the Minister apparently does not consider not to be very serious was handed to honourable It members less than 10 minutes ago. The Bill will have very far reaching consequences, as I am sure the Minister for Special Trade Negotiations (Mr Howard) knows. The Opposition has not had an opportunity to discuss the legislation as party; nor has it had a chance to consider the itself. Whilst this may or may not be necessary legisthat lation, and I do not wish to debate the Bill at stage, it is important that the Parliament know what is in the legislation that it is being asked pass. Less than 3 minutes after the second readcome ing debate starts the spokesman for the Oppothan sition will be required to reply to the second reading speech on a very detailed lation which was given to him only an hour ago. It was given to him only after a request to the Minister, and on the basis that no other member of the Opposition would be entitled see the legislation. This is far reaching legistarianism lation. Those lawyers on the Government side communist who take the trouble to read the Bill will know that it contains provisions whereby a Minister, without having to have recourse to the courts does any other employer, and without even having to go through the normal government operations, will be able to give a direction ployees and they will have to carry out that direcwith tion on pain of dismissal. No protection whatso-more ever is left. That is the legislation that is being forced through this Parliament without the position having any opportunity to discuss it. I see some shamefaced members opposite but they will vote for it. I heard one honourable member in this chamber defending therightsof certain railway employees to take certain Under this proposed legislation they could be dismissed instantly, with loss of allrights,for taking that action. That is what that honourable member is going to vote for in this Parliament. This Bill is not a matter of urgency and even if it were there is no reason why the Government could not have given reasonable notice to the Opposition. The Bill has been printed for some to timeand the Minister hadtimethis put it before a meeting of his own legislation and Party. This would have been the first time been given to the Opposition in advance of its being brought into the Parliament so that it could be considered. That has happened on a number of occasions. I suggest the reason why this Bill is being put forward in this manner is not because it is looked upon as urgent; it is to widen an industrial dispute, to solve it. That is the real purpose of this Bill. is significant that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has been in the chamber to husband his latest political gimmick through the Parliament although he has left the chamber for the moment. He has been in here guiding this a legislation through. I suggest that if honourable Bill members on the Government side had had the opportunity of reading this Bill before it came into the Parliament they would have reaUsed it is not merely a Bill to deal with a narrow this dispute in the Redfern MaU Exchange or some other industrial dispute. This Bill represents the to most sweeping industrial legislation that has into this Parliament in years. It is worse the Trade Practices Act which the Government tried to foist on the Parliament on an piece of legisearlier occasion. was made Mr Carige-It is good legislation.",52
65,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,"If the honourable member to for Capricornia happens to believe in totaliand authoritarianism, whether it be or fascist, it is good legislation. I happen to believe that we live in a democratic society. Obviously honourable members on the as Government side do not. There is no reason for deaUng with this Bill urgently. There is less reason for the Government withholding it from to emconsideration by the Opposition before deaUng it in this Parliament. This exercise is nothing than a farce. If honourable members look at the Minister's second reading speech they will Opsee that this Bill has no other purpose than to highlight and inflame industrial relations in the Post Office.",52

67,Mr STREET,FAIRS," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Bill I am introducing to the House today is to enable Commonwealth Government employing authorities, in the pubhc interest to suspend from duty, or in appropriate circumstances dismiss, government employees who take industrial action which disrupts the provisions of services to the Australian comtion-this munity; and stand down, without pay, governvery ment employees who cannot be usefully have employed as a result of industrial action taken fellow government employees or by workers in private industry, or who are engaged on functo tions the performance of which is seriously disrupted. The feature that distinguishes governpeople ment employees is their responsibihty for providward ing the wide range of services essential well-being of a modern day community. If government employees do not fulfil, or are not able because of the actions of others to fulfil, these responsibUities the effect reaches into very fabnc of our society. I do not need to remind honourable members that the Australian community has been subever. jected to great inconvenience and hardship through the industrial actions of some governAustraUa ment employees and their trade unions. It has been deprived of services to which it is entitled. One need only point to the current disruption community maU services. The Government prepared to tolerate this type of situation. To so would be to shirk its clear duty to protect pubUc interest. Finally, let me emphasise that would be the Government's hope that it will be necessary to use this legislation and it is Government's intention that this Bill will be passed by the Parliament but will proclaimed to operate unless circumstances so dictate. Certainly it recognises that the very great majority of government employees and their unions have acted, and do act, responsibly. Indeed the legislation would not have been ation necessary but for the actions of a minority. mend trie-Bill"" to the House.",54
68,Mr WILLIS,FAIRS,"The way this legislation has come before the Parliament incredible. At 2.45 p.m. today, I received a copy of this Legislation-the Commonwealth Emthe ployees (Employment Provisions) Bill-wit note which said I was not to show it to anyone until the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) brought the Bill before Second Reading Parliament. That copy of the legislation arrived only because I sought to see it. When this tremendously important legislation, which could have enormous and immediate ramifications in the industrial relations area, wasfinaUyput before the Parliament, it was presented with aU the persuasion and eloquence that the Minister could muster for a whole minute. He spoke for one minute, according to the parUamentary clock. The Minister had half an hour to deUver his second reading speech but he spoke for one minute to put forward this incredibly different legislarepressive legislation-whic h will have widespread effects and could immediately very devastating effects in relation to one by industrial dispute concerning the Post Office. The Parliament received one minute's explanation as why it should support such legislation. It is an affront to the Parliament and an affront to the of Australia that the Minister can put forsuch legislation with no arguments except to the virtually preliminary statements. This legislation comes before the Parliament resumably because the Government wishes to the ave some immediate impact on the postal dispute. Let me give the House some background to that dispute because the Minister has provided honourable members with no information whatThe fact is, as I understand it, that the postal unions have been in discussions with Post for well over a year. In that time, they have been trying to negotiate an extension of the 36%-hour week to all postal employees. At to the moment, a Uttle over half of them work a is not 36%-hour week. AU employees in Telecom do Australia work a 36/4-hour week. So the fact is 3 the that in this postal-Telecom area, the vast mait jority of employees already work a 36%-hour not week. What is at stake here are the terms on the which the 36/4-hour week will be extended to 3 that minority of employees in this area who do not be not enjoy it at present. It is a fact also that substantial anomalies exist because of the non-appUcation of the 36/4-hour 3 week to some employees. For example, this situcan arise in post offices in which perhaps a I comdozen employees may work. Eleven of them may work for 36%-hours a week but the maU sorter may work a 40-hour week. That is a situation which just cannot be allowed to continue beiscause it clearly promotes industrial trouble. That industrial trouble hasfinallysurfaced because of impatience of those people who do not have h a the 36%-hour week. The trouble has finaUy bubbled to the surface and has resulted in the application of bans in all States in the course of the the last week or so. But at thistime,when this legislation conies before the House, the fact that the bans have been removed in all States, understand, except in New South Wales and South Australia- m Sydney and Adelaide. In all other States the bans have been lifted today. The Government has introduced this legisthe lation at a time when the postal and telecomit munications unions have recommended that all bans be lifted. They have been lifted in four of the six States. In South Australia the decision that they would be lifted if they were lifted Redfern in Sydney. Of course, Redfern is the he trouble spot and has been an industrial relationsproclaimed problem area for some time. I do not have timecan to go into the reasons for this. But in this case, the special problem at Redfern is that the new rosters put forward by Australia Post for the appU-legislation. cation of the 36% hour week result in quite a stantial loss of income for the employees working operate. at Redfern. They would lose on average $20 a week. That is much more than employees wouldstand-down lose at any other post oifice in Australia. That why there is a special problem at Redfern. is why presumably today the employees at Redstand-down fern rejected the recommendation of Comemployer missioner Sweeney and the recommendation of their unions that they should lift the bans there and that there be negotiations with Australia Post for a week or so to see whether an appropriate form of rosters can be worked out. Let me say at this point of time that the Oppo-Jusuce sition feels it is a pity that the employees at. fern did not seefitto accept their union recomappUcationwas mendation. The union recommendation have been a very sensible recommendation am pleased that in most States it was accepted. power stoppages or whatever it was.because But it is a pity that the employees at Redfern have not seenfitto accept it. lation will not help to settle this situation. This This legislation could make the industrial relations gument, scene at Redfern and perhaps elsewhere much not worse. I will come to that later. What does this Bill do? This Bill covers emThe ployment not just in the Post Office. It covers all decades. Commonwealth employment, whether the emthe labour ployees are employed under the PubUc Service agement Act, by Government authorities, in the Comthe monwealth Teaching Service or whatever. All tial these employees are covered by this legislation. If they undertake industrial action-i have to be a strike; it could be a go-slow paign, any ban or limitation on work or not per-was forming work in the normal way-the y can be suspended, stood down or dismissed. This is quite substantial change because although there are provisions under existing legislation for alties to apply-stand-down s can be achieved is under the present legislation and there is proI vision under the Post and Telegraph Act for some disciplinary action to be taken against employees-ther e are certain procedures to be gone through. What this legislation enables is for employmg authority to arbitrarily decide that will impose this penalty forthwith. The Minister has the power to assume the powers given to the employing authority. So the Minister for Post wasand Telecommunicauons (Mr Eric Robinson) at sitting opposite merightnow can decide today, if wants to, or at any time once this legislation is that a particular group of employees be suspended and that other employees can be stood down and perhaps dismissed. That is the power this Minister is acquiring from this That is a very substantial change sub-from the way in which the procedures currently The fact is that if an employer wants to have a clause imposed under the present islegislation, he must go to the ConcUiation and ThatArbitrauon Commission and persuade it that a clause should be implemented. The has to persuade the Commission of this. It is not something that is easy to do. The employer must put a convincing case to the Commission that the employees should be stood down by the employers. But all that will be sidestepped by this legislation. I would like to quote to the House an extract from the decision of Mr Red-which he Sharp in the distilleries case in 1976 in faced with an argument for the seems to employees when stand-dow of a the n clause in respect of employer felt that there was and Inot enough work for the employees The of ComHowever, this legis-missioner said: comes to what seems to me to be the essence of the arnamely, the purpose of a stand-down clause. I do accept the contenuon . . . that standing down employees without pay should be an employer's right if that were the most convenient way of avoiding economic loss. concept that it was managements' prerogative to use labour at will has had no place in western soaety for many It has been replaced by the concept that the use of of human beings is a privilege accorded to manon defined terms. One of those terms is that reasonable security of earnings be assured to the labourer. This is purpose of the notice clause in awards and very substangrounds must exist for this Commission to include any provision which would enable it to be abrogated, even temt does not porarily, by unilateral action. camWhat the judge of the Arbitration Commission saying is that security of employment is basic to therightsof employees and that to abrogate a thoserightsby obtaining stand-down clauses there must be very substantial grounds indeed penand the Arbitration Commission must be persuaded by argument that that is the case. What the Government is doing here is saying: 'To hell with all that; we do not want to have that procedure any more. We will just decide of our own volition, regardless of the industrial relations effects that it might have, to suspend employees or to stand down others. For instance, we will not have the expertise of the Arbitration Commissioners to assess the industrial relations implications of what we are doing'. The Government is abrogating the fundamental rights of Commonwealth employees. It cannot expect to introduce legislation like that, which abrogates fundamental rights, without there being a reaction. The realities of the situation must be that this will cause enormous dissension amongst Commonwealth employees. Every Commonwealth employee is potentially affected by this legislation. He does not have to be involved in an industrial dispute. If the Minister were to decide that because of an industrial dispute certain employees did not have enough work to do on a panicular day, he could stand those employees down, on his own decision. The issue would not have to go to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission or the Public Service Arbitrator. The Minister could decide off his own bat. Australia Post in the postal dispute to this stage has not seen fit to use any of the existing provisions to suspend or to seek stand down clauses in relation to the industrial action going on its area. Provisions exist for that to be undertaken, but Australia Post, the employing authority in the postal dispute, has taken no such action. But this Government, when most of the bans have been lifted-perhap s with a bit more persuasion we could have the rest lifted in the very near future-ha s come in with this sledge hammer which ensures that there will be adverse reaction. It is possible that all the bans that been lifted will be reimposed. I do not know about that; we are not in charge of industrial relations. But the fact is that the Government risks the retaliation of the people involved in dispute and of others. If the Government wants to exacerbate indusployees trial disputation in this country it is going right way about it. In fact, we on this side of the House think that there is a very good chance that is precisely what the Government wants do: It wants to exacerbate industrial relations cause it is making such a hell of a mess of the economy that it is trying to provide an alternative focus of attention. Thisfitsvery well into tern which has been developing over the past few months. Without going into thefinerdetail of this legislation at this stage-w e will have a Committee debate on it-the Opposition strongly and strenuously opposes the legislauon. It is bad legislation. It abrogates the fundamental rights of Commonwealth employees. It could have very adverse industrial relations effects. The Government should be ashamed to have brought such legislauon before the Parliament.",54
69,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,FAIRS," I rise to support the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relauons (Mr Street) in presenting the Commonwealth Employees (Employment Provisions) Bill to the Parliament. Having Ustened to the honourable member for GelUbrand (Mr WUlis), thefirstthing I want to do is remind the House of what the Minister said, that is, that the provisions of this legislation will be used only in the gravest circumstances. It is perfectly clear to the Government that if it is to discharge its responsibilities it is necessary that this legislation be passed by both Houses of the Parliament. But the Minister has made it perfectly clear that it will not be proclaimed and used unless it is necessary in the nauonal interest. That is what this Government is concerned about; that is what the previous Administration did not spend sufficient time being concerned about. Therefore, this legislation is necessary. I think that before too long the common sense of all Australians will be brought to bear and the great majority will support an elected government having this son of legislauon avaUable should circumstances arise when it is necessary to use it. The honourable member for Gellibrand spent some time referring to the possible use of this have legislauon in the postal service as an example. He made some comments about the present dispute. It is desirable, therefore, that I put on record the tremendous problem we are facing that today with regard to the postal service which, after all, is essenual. There is a requirement of the Australian Postal Commission and its emto see that Australians receive their maU. the There has been an enormous amount of disruption, particularly in the past year or two, and certhat tain sections of the community have been disto tressed and disadvantaged beyond an acceptable belevel. The Government is sick and tired of this situation, the Commission is sick andtiredof it, as is the community. The honourable member the patfor GelUbrand and his colleagues ought to remember that the community is sick and tired of it. What is the issue that caused all the problem we have with the Postal and Telecommunications Union? The dispute is over an agreement to implement a 36%-hour working week for those members of the union who do not presently enjoy that advantage. That ought to be remembered. As the honourable member for Gellibrand rightly identified, the prime problem is in the New South Wales division, at the Redfern Mail Exchange. But the Opposition spokesman said: 'We know we have troubles in Redfern, but I do not have enough time today to tell the House all about them'. I invite honourable members on both sides of the House to study the record of the Redfern Mail Exchange. I am certain that the Postmasters-General in the previous Administration and members of the Labor Party generally would not be too pleased, as Australians, if they were to see the shocking record with regard to Redfern. After all, the federal executive of the union is unhappy. The elected secretary is unhappy and has made public statements rebuking the New South Wales executive for its attitude. Whilst the problems might be restricted to New South Wales and South Australia to date, when there are problems in the Redfern Mail Exchange there are problems not only in New South Wales but also in getting the mail through all over Australia. These problems have been disadvantaging the Australian community for far too long. It ought to be remembered that the Government and the Australian Postal Commission agreed to support the implementation of a 36% hour week for members of the union who do not presently enjoy those working conditions, on the arrangement and understanding that the guidehnes laid down by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission would be followed. Is any member of the Opposition going to dispute that guidelines set down by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission should be followed? Is there any argument that it is reasonable to expect commissions, unions, employers and employees to accept those guidelines? In short, one of the significant criteria is that the implementation should be at negligible cost; in other words, that there should be no additional cost to the community if people are going to work shorter hours. Negotiations have been going on for 14 months. Surely people are not going to wonder now. Everybody is getting a bit sick and tired of the disruptive tactics that have gone on. What is the position in the mail exchange in Redfern in Sydney? It is simply that in the implementation of the agreement there will need to be new rosters. At the moment there are uneconomic shifts and restrictive work practices. I invite any former Postmaster-General- I think there were two Postmasters-General in the previous Administration-to say publicly that they were never concerned about the restrictive work practices at Redfern. I have here a list- I am informed that it is not an exhaustive list-of 40 restrictive work practices currently implemented at Redfern. I seek permission to have this list incorporated in Hansard so that honourable members can have for the record the position as it presently applies.",56

So on freedom of movement of mail the community is being disadvantaged.' Too often in Australia recently in too many ways we have seen a few people disadvantage by prejudicial and intransigent attitudes the welfare of the entire community. In this case they are even prejudicing the welfare of their colleagues. This type of approach by any section of the Australian community becomes intolerable. It becomes intolerable for the authorities, it beRepresentatives for approval. comes intolerable for the Government, and it is intolerable for the community. Whilst this legisglacis. A labourer must be in lation is in no way designed to deal simply with a postal dispute, and in fact it is made perfectly clear that the Government hopes that the legislation will not be used, it ought to be understood that when governments are faced time and time again with this sort of challenge from elements within the trade union movement there has to legislative authority available should it need be used.",58
74,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,CENTRAL MAIL EXCHANGE SYDNEY,"Before I deal with the provisions of Bill, I want to touch upon the manner in which was introduced. This Bill was deliberately away from the Opposition by the Government. find The Bill was prepared many weeks ago at the time of the air traffic controllers' dispute. Government, if it wanted to, could have given this Bill to the Opposition for proper considerpeople's ation of its contents when the Parliament resumed on Tuesday, but it deliberately withheld it from the Parliament. When a government withholds from the Opposition, it is also withpeople holding from the Parliament. It withheld a provision that it intended to introduce on this day of this week so that the Parliament-no t just the Opposition but the Parliament-woul d not have the opportunity to study the contents of the Bill, would not have the opportunity to discover whether the Bill had objectionable matter tucked away in what might otherwise be seemingly innocuous provisions, provisions against which even members of the Country Party might rebel were they in a position to examine the legislation properly. No one knows what this legislation means. has been impossible to examine it in the short time that it has been available to the Parliament. I keep emphasising the Parliament and I remind everybody that it is the Parliament. It is not the Opposition members of Parliament who have been cheated by the Government through not being given copies of the Bill. Members of the Government back benches have been cheated too because they have been asked to put their heads in the noose, without knowing what is in the nose bag until the noose is pulled tight. That is no way in which to treat the national liament of Australia. The Parliament of Australia is the voice of the people of Australia. When Parhament of Australia is treated with the utter contempt with which the Government has treated it on this occasion, the Government registering its utter contempt for the people the Parliament. The people who sent us here. are the people, and the Government ought to remember occasionally that the Parliament is people of Australia. The Government is not people of Australia. The executive government of this country represents in the main only one man, the man who sits at the head of the Cabinet table, situation has never been very different since Federation. It istimethat the Parliament started tellbe ing the executive arm of government and the to man who controls the executive arm of government that this is a democracy. We are not living Germany. We ought not to be treated the as though we were living in Nazi Germany. This it is a country which has always passed for a parliakept mentary democracy, yet what do we find? We that a Bill which alters the law of the country which has stood the test of time since the country The was colonised is now to be drastically altered without notice, without an opportunity for the Parliament to examine properly what the Bill provides. This has been done deliberately and with a callous, cavalier and studied disregard for therightsof the Parliament and of the of Australia who elected this Parliament. Why do I say so definitely and so dogmatically that this legislation has been deliberately withheld from the Parliament? I will direct the attention of honourable members to some of the straws in the wind. When the air traffic controllers' strike was in progress a couple of months ago the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) made a public statement that the Government had prepared legislation which it would bring in as an urgent measure if the dispute was not settled by a certain time. So we know from what the Minister It for Transport said a couple of months ago that the Bill had been prepared then. Let me remind the House of something else. Not only do we now know that the Bill was prepared a couple of just months ago; we also know from the remarks made by the Minister for Post and Telecommunicauons (Mr Eric Robinson) that it was the Government's intention to bring the Bill into the Parliament today. That was the Government's intention on the very day on which the Minister told the Parliament that on Friday of this week the Government intended to start standing down Parpeople at the Redfern Mail Exchange if they had not settled the dispute. The Minister had no the authority to stand down the people at the Redfern Mail Exchange in the manner that this Bill proposes when he told us on Tuesday of this is week that he intended to do it. He knew then of what the Bill was. He knew then that the Bill We would be introduced into the Parliament today. He knew then that there was no intention on the the part of the Government to allow any member of the the Parliament who is not a member of the Executive Council to see what the Executive Council was going to browbeat the Parliament into letting go through the Parliament without and the adequate debate or consideration. When we have a law that has remained in the present form of the Public Service Act since FedService? eration and we alter it in the dramatic way the Government is now proposing, the Governand ment has a duty to the people of Australia as well as to the Public Service of Australia to allow Parliament of Australia to know fully what it is proposing to do and to have the intricate and complex provisions of the legislation put to legal examination so that the Opposition can come back into the Parliament next week benefit of at least one week's mature consideration of what the Bill proposes. I have never theFrom known any measure of this kind to be introduced any statutory authority into the Parliament and put through in one day. to issue a declaration suspending It is a tradition of the Parliament that the ployees of a department for whatever Government introduces Bills of this kind, which authority making the suspension chooses drastically alter the law as it has stood for than 70 years, and then gives the Opposition week in which to study the legislation and gives it pened. the opportunity to move amendments in ComNobodyThere mittee. We know from experience that the defend himself Executive Council is not the fount and it is conceivable that out of 126 elected nothing like that. Theofold members of the Parliament one, two or 22 memjustice, the proud pillar of British bers might be able to suggest in the Committee tish common law, has been trampled stage some amendments that will remove some of the obnoxious features of the legislation. But not how can the Parliament do justice to its obliment members gation to the people of this mittee stage if we are not allowed even to look at depending on theindividually the Bill or to have a Committee or Caucus ing to understand what is in it? I have been asked to stand up and make this speech without any wanting whatsoever. I was not told that I was to speak until 10 minutes ago. I saw nothing of the Bill until it was introduced says by the Minister for Employment and Industrial without to Relations (Mr Street). The method of its appeal andright introduction raises a rather interesting the procedures of the Parliament. Whenever behis furlough entitlements, soallthat fore has a Minister been called upon to introduce a Bill dealing with an amendment to an Act that is not under his administration? The Prime Minamissedmember ister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is the Minister in remuneration charge of the Public Service, so the Prime Minisright to any other ter is the one who by tradition should have introduced any amendment to the Public Service entitled Act. Is it because the Prime Minister does not to know for certain what sort offlackis going to fly Bill around as a consequence of this legislation? He is the says here in the House; we know that he is here. Why Public Service Arbitrator then was the Minister for Employment and and Arbitration Commission Industrial Relations brought in here by the scruff prevail. of the neck by the Prime Minister and made to introduce the obnoxious legislation which the Prime Minister himself should have introduced he did his job as Minister in charge of the Pubhc I suggest that it is one of the old tricksthat let somebody down the line do the dirty work if it comes off the Prime Minister can come out and say 'There you are; alone I did it', and the leak it to the Press that he was the one who proposed it at the Cabinet meeting. If it does not come outrighthe can leak to the Press that the thing would have been allrightexcept that Tony Street mucked it up. This is clearly what has hapwith the pened on this occasion. few my understanding of this legislation in seconds I have had to look at it, it allows or any permanent head all or some emperiod the to more nominate in the declaration of suspension.

80,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CENTRAL MAIL EXCHANGE SYDNEY,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,62
81,Mr FALCONER,CENTRAL MAIL EXCHANGE SYDNEY,"The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) in his rather tendentious speech said that Government back benchers are being asked to put their heads into the noose without knowing what is in the nosebag. We know what is in the nosebag. It is the interests of the community mixed with an ovewhelming measure of public support. The honourable member for Hindmarsh made a number of trivial points. He tried to say that the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) was being asked to act as some sort of toady for the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in introducing this legislation instead of the Prime Minister. I remind him that the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations is also officially the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Public Service Matters. It is the normal procedure for Ministers assisting other senior Ministers to take on various aspects of legislation in this chamber. The honourable member for Hindmarsh also tried to make it appear that under the proposed legislation the Minister would have power to sack any employee for almost any reason whatsoever. Of course that is not so. If a Commonwealth employee is carrying out the normal duties for which he has been engaged, no Minister can act against him under this legislation. The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), in an earlier speech, said that the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations spoke very briefly in introducing the Bill and criticised him for speaking so briefly. I suggest that the Minister spoke briefly because the need for this legislation is obvious to the community and can support it be encapsulated in a few words.",62
82,Mr WILLIS,CENTRAL MAIL EXCHANGE SYDNEY,Well sit down.,62
83,Mr FALCONER,CENTRAL MAIL EXCHANGE SYDNEY,"I intend to make a few points on my own behalf. The honourable memto ber for Hindmarsh alleged that the Government was attempting to bring on a confrontation with the the unions. I suggest that some Commonwealth employees have been attempting to bring on a confrontation with the community. In that sort of it confrontation the Government has a duty and an any obligation to take the side of the community. The community is fed up with disruption in vital services. I quote from the Minister's second reading What it is doing speech. He said: The feature that distinguishes Government employees is their responsibility for providing the wide range of services essential to the well-being of a modern day community. Strikes, bans and go-slows affect private industry and also the community generally. Strikes, bans and go-slows in the Public Service cause disruption throughout the community. The worse feature is not necessarily the straightforward strike when people do not turn up for work and do not perform their duties: a worse feature is the farce of people turning up for work and then refusing to carry out normal instructions to undertake normal work by the use of go-slow tactics, limitations on the type of work to be undertaken or restrictions on the people to be provided with the normal services of government. Under these circumstances private employers have the simple ability to sack employees who do not carry out instructions. This legislation does not even go that far. It gives the Commonwealth powers to ensure that government services are provided in the way that the community expects. It fills a gap in the powers presently available to the Government to cany out its policies. We also face from time totimethe farce of Commonwealth employees threatening to refuse to carry out policies of the government of the day. Those particular people say they do not agree with those policies. They are employed to carry out the policies of the government of the day in the service of the community. If they do not like those policies they can resign from the Service. They can seek a transfer or, ultimately, they can exercise theirrightto seek to defeat the government through the normal processes of the ballot box. They are not entitled to continually frustrate the normal services of government to the community by go-slows, bans and limitations on work. This Bill recognises that government employees have responsibilities to the community and to the government of the day. I also underline something else which the Minconfrontation ister said in his second reading speech. He said: If Government employees do not, or are not able of the actions of others, to fulfil these responsibilities effect reaches into the very fabric of our society. This Bill is needed to fill a major gap in powers of the Commonwealth to ensure that the normal services of government are supplied to the community. The Bill deserves the support the House and of the community.",62
84,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CENTRAL MAIL EXCHANGE SYDNEY," I look at this Bill as being directly related isauthority to the postal dispute. The dispute was mentioned employee, by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) in his second reading speech. I say this looking at what one would the factual situation. But looking at the legal ation, it is clear that the Bill has been prepared some time. It is obvious that it was proposed use the Bill against the air traffic controllers. suggest that if it had been used at the time against the air traffic controllers there would have been a national strike for the reason that the Government says in the Bill: 'We will dictate to you where you will work and if you ment's will not work we will sack you not rights at all'. This legislation must be looked at in the text of all other existing legislation. of the House (Mr Sinclair), when moving lotment of time-and the Bill is to be guUlotined - sai d that because of the aUeged urgency there was no other alternative but to introduce the Bill. There is an alternative. There are appropriate provisions throughout the whole structure of the Public Service, through Public Service legislation and through the arbitration provisions, for the employing authority to take action, to stand down or suspend anyone in its employ. Why is that this Government suddenly wants to intrude as the employer? Why does it want to be the sole authority? It is proposed that the Minister self is to have the discretion to indicate whether person will in fact be dismissed. Is it any wonder that we say the Government is looking for trouble? Perhaps it is introducing this legislation on the basis that it thinks it might create a sion from the economic problems. The Governmal ment should never suggest that it will solve industrial matters by legislation, particularly legislation of this type. Let me analyse the provisions of the Bill. First the legislation proposes that any Commonwealth authority-and that means immediately the whole of the Public Service structure and statutory authorities-wU l be involved in this legislation. So the Government is looking for with all sections of the Public Service; any one of them can be the subject of this because legislation. The legislation proposes that all the Commonwealth employees engaged in industrial action may be suspended. I draw the attention of the honourable members to clause 8, which is another very interesting provision in the legislation. Assuming that suspension has taken place of under clause 4 and has obviously continued for some Uttle time, clause 8 (1) (c) states: authority or a Minister is of the opinion that it the public interest that the powers of the employing . . . should be exercised in relauon to the the employing authority may, by instrument in writing, terminate the employment of the employee. Not only the employing authority but also the call Mmister can intrude on the basis that he will situhave a man sacked. Is the Government looking for a complete national strike, because this is the to way to get it? Does the Government really want I to solve the problems of the postal dispute? Does the Government really believe the sort of nonsense that is contained in that part of the second very simple reading speech which states: Finally, let me emphasise that it would be the Governhope that it will not be necessary to use this and you will have legislation . . . Why introduce the legislation if it is the Governconment's hope that it wiU not have to be used or The Leader proclaimed? the alThe Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) has the same duty as any other Postmaster-General. He has a duty to get out and to talk to his employeesfirst.He has a duty tofindout the issues. The current disruption is not thefirststrike that has taken place at the Redfern MaU Exchange. Has the Minister ever recognised the psychological problems that exist at Redfern? Does he reaUse that because of it Liberal-Country Party Government phUosophy that led to the construction of the wretched machine at Redfern, which has proved to be a monhimster, psychological problems have been caused. a We have a situation in which 5 000 employees work in a confined space and are subject to all sons of dictates as though they are in some ghetto or some Nazi concentration camp. They diverare not allowed the normal freedom or the norenvironment of any other employee in the Commonwealth Public Service. Has not the Minby ister analysed the pecuUarities of the Redfern MaU Exchange? Has he not looked at the way in which strikes in the past have been settled? Has this not been achieved by the Minister going to the Exchange and attending a mass meeting of all the men? Whatrighthave the Ministers on the other side of the House to run away from their responsibUities? Whatrighthas a Minister to say: ' I am bringing in a piece of legislation?' It handy for a Minister to say: 'It can apply to body in the Commonwealth Public Service but am aiming it at the people in the Redfern Mail Exchange'. These people are not dole bludgers; they work very hard for their living. They have families; they have dependants. The thing they employees. can least bear is a loss of money. It is not recognised-and Government supExchange porters would not know about this because have not had any affiliation with this that for years a set of special industrial conditions have applied only to the Redfern Mail special Exchange. This arrangement has applied with the concurrence of past Liberal-Country Party Ministers. Do not honourable members opposite realise that special arrangements exist for rosters on the basis that men and women who work Redfern get special entitlements? Do they not know that this arrangement is part and parcel a special award which, while perhaps unwritten, is nevertheless there. Do they not know that it was agreed that the workers would be entitled to say that their terms and conditions of employhad ment and their hours of employment would not be altered without their consent, that they would be entitled to certain overtime penalties? not know that these conditions are part and parcel of their employment contract? How is it that the Government can introduce piece of legislation on the basis that if it is enough for the Redfern Mail Exchange it will good enough for everyone else. This is not The Government has to have a look at its responthat sibilities. It has to look at the past troubles have occurred at the Redfern Mail Exchange bego cause the supervisors, superintendents and everybody else have tried to get into the act respect of what is a very simple mechanical matto ter-the sorting of letters. If we consider the head, the size of the administrative staff, the problems of personalities and the persecution the underdog in many cases we can see that a lems special arbitral provision had to be provided the Redfern Mail Exchange. The Labor Government established the Vernon Commission to achieve better industrial issue. conditions not only for the postal sector but also for the telecommunications sector. It was on the basis of the Vernon Commission report that special arbitral provisions were provided for tal and telecommunications employees. The Government has ignored everything. The Miniswould ter has come in here with a piece of legislation which says: ' I will show what I will do; I penalise you; I will suspend you; I will sack you'. I predict now that the Government will have to is very sack everyone employed at the Redfern Mail anyExchange. Even if it does, it will not achieve a I result. It will find that the whole commercial world of Australia will be tied up. I would think every Commonwealth public servant would come out on strike in sympathy with the postal I have pointed out that the Redfern MaU is a special part of the Commonwealth they Public Service. A previous Liberal-Country matterParty Government created and built the Exchange. It encouraged the formulation of awards and industrial conditions at the Exchange. It is completely guUty. That Government was responsible for the mechanical arrangements made at the Exchange that do not exist in any other maU exchange in the world. at The Redfern MaU Exchange was specially built for a machine that the former Liberal-Country of Party Government decided to buy without resort to any other contracts or competitive tenders. This smells a Uttle of the old graft and corruption bit. It is for that reason that Redfern has always a special stigma associated with it. Its creation was novel; the solution of its problems were not easy; and its problems are great. But Do they they are human problems. It is not difficult to get out and talk to the people employed at the Redfern MaU Exchange. a I have done it. I had to do it on the basis that ungood less I did so the whole maU of Sydney would not be have been delivered. Before I first went to the so. Exchange I was warned by the establishment had existed for years: 'Do not dare go to the that Redfern MaU Exchange; no Minister should ever there'. Thefirstduty of a Minister is to go to the Exchange because he has a responsibUity to in the Parliament and a responsibUity to the nation run that business properly. If the Ministers opoverposite had any wisdom they would suggest a conference with aU the people involved. If a conferof ence were held they would find that the probrelate to rosters and the fact that one person for can decide whether an employee will lose his normal average weekly income. Is it any wonder there is a problem when that is the fundamental Mr Sullivan-What , cut out overtime?",63
85,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CENTRAL MAIL EXCHANGE SYDNEY,"When they were posengaged a special arrangement was made with the honourable member's predecessors that they get overtime on certain rates at certain times. They were engaged on that basis. That will was the contract on which the then Government engaged them. But the Minister has the nonsense to come here and say: ' I will solve this problem, I will pass a piece of legislation; I will dismiss everyone of you'. I say now that there will be a national strike over this issue. By introducing this legislation the Government will not solve any of the problems in the Post Office. The legislation is ridiculous and short sighted. In fact, as I said earlier, it was not aimed at the Post Office-it was aimed at the air traffic controllers. We cannot forget that during the last referendum campaign the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said that he had legislation prepare which he was about to bring into deal with the air traffic controllers' strike. If he had he would have stopped every airline in Australia. How was the air traffic controllers' strike solved? It was solved by the President of the Australian Labor Party and President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions who intervened when he did not have to.",64
86,Mr HODGMAN,CENTRAL MAIL EXCHANGE SYDNEY,Rubbish!,65
87,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CENTRAL MAIL EXCHANGE SYDNEY,"It is true. The honourable member does not want to give any credit but it was arranged on the basis that there would be further discussions and that there would be further arbitral processes. As a result of that further arbitration the air traffic controllers strike was settled. The Government is not prepared to allow the Public Service law to apply in this case. It is a that is applicable. It is a law that the employing authority can use. The law says that the employing authority can ask the Concihation and Arbitration Commission to look at the problems of the Redfern Mail Exchange and ascertain whether certain people should be suspended or dismissed. The Commission could then make those decisions based on the facts. Not one honourable member opposite is prepared to allow that to happen. Honourable members opposite would rather rely on the political gimmick that they-the few of them-ar e members of the one chosen group in this community that can dictate industrial conditions and that can dictate whether the people at the Redfern Mail Exchange in particular will have a job. That is not their right and that is not their entitlement. I listened to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications talking today about the obligations of former Postmasters-General. I admit that they were many, varied and very onerous; but it is not good enough for him to get up in this chamber today and say that because of that and because of a history of work bans or effective stoppages the Government is going to bring in legislauon that will guarantee that those people will be suspended or dismissed and thereby solve the problems of mail distribution. The Government will do nothing of the sort. The Minister has a responsibility, an obUgation and a duty to discuss these matters in detaU with the people responsible for the Redfern Mail Exchange. It is not a matter that should be hived off to some statutory authority on the basis that that authority obviously has done its best. In many cases the personnel of an authority are no better equipped to run an organisation than the Minister liimself. That is one of the responsibUities that one has to look at when one looks at personality problems. If the Minister had at least made the effort of going to the people involved and saying: 'Let us look at this issue on the basis of what is fair and reasonable', he would have been so much better informed. He could not make one statement of fact here today which clearly indicated what were the problems of the people involved in this dispute. Honourable members opposite will find that the problems relate to their take home pay and to what they regard as their contract of employment. I emphasise the point that they are not bludging on the situation. Many of them are people who have migrated from different countries. Those people have all the problems of milaw grants. As well as that they have been thrown in there on the basis that they have to work very hard indeed to earn their money-and they do that. There are also aU the problems of lack of communication and lack of consultation. Have honourable members opposite not noticed that the problems even seem to be within their own union? It must be of some enlightenment to honourable members opposite that those people appear to regard themselves as a separate part of the union. Of course they do. They are in a separate building. They have been isolated for yearsever since the exchange was built. They do different work from everybody else in the Post Office. On that basis they have been able to create their own structure. The matter has to be looked at on that basis. This is not thefirsttime that there has been a stoppage at the Redfern MaU Exchange. There was a massive one in October 1973. Nobody in the Postmaster General's Department, as it was at that time, could solve that problem. There was a complete stoppage. The only way in which the problem was solved was by having a word with the people concerned-the workers. That was done in the company of union officials. The strike was settled on that basis. I notice that the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations is interjecting. Instead of ting here and drawing his salary he ought to be out organising a meeting at which he might be able to solve the problem. He should not be involved in the creation of a situation as a result of which there will be a national strike on every issue in Australia involving the Commonwealth PubUc Service. What right does the Minister have to say that he will exercise his discretion to dismiss a man when he knows nothing about the issue involved. The Minister is to have that power under clause 8 of this Bill. I have been reminded by the honourable member for GelUbrand (Mr WUlis) that when Queensland, which is a favourite State of honourable members opposite, introduced similar industrial penalty legislation it provided in that legislation that anybody who was suspended or dismissed had a right of appeal to a magistrate against such suspension or dismissal. Such a provision is not included in this legislation. Why? Because the Government wants to wield the big stick. It wants to indicate clearly to the Packer Press or some of its other functionaries that it is going to solve the problem. I appeal to the Government to show common sense and delay the passage of this legislation for a week, and then to get the Ministers who are so anxious to get up in this chamber and make speeches to go and meet the personnel of the Redfern MaU Exchange and report back to this Parliament on the issues as they see them there. The Government is running away from its responsibUities by bringing in legislation that is aimed not only at the Redfern MaU Exchange but also at any other Commonwealth authority or employee group. This is a most dangerous piece of legislation. It cannot be supported by legislation in any other Parliament. It has no precedent at all. If it had been used in any of the other strikes that the Government obviously had it prepared for it would not have settled any of those strikes. The Government is not going to settle indusbers trial disputes by the use of force or threats, ticularly when a person's UveUhood is at stake, because immediately the sympathy of fellow workers is encouraged and they act in unison protect that man'srightsor that woman's rights. That they will act in unison can be seen from fact that the strike which has occurred at Redfern MaU Exchange has the sympathetic support the Adelaide MaU Exchange. The Adelaide MaU Exchange has one of the best work records in Australia from the point of view of postal distriplenty bution. It has that record because of the intelligent administration of that exchange. sit- There are never any stoppages there. It has nothing Uke the industrial problems of the Redfern MaU Exchange. The Adelaide MaU Exchange has acted in sympathy on the basis of saying that it will do whatever it thinks isrightfor the Redfern MaU Exchange. You get there the unity of purpose. You get there the comradeship that you must expect to get when you are dealing with employees on this sort of basis. The Government might even find-let us hope so-that the air traffic controllers will take a little bit of interest in this legislation. It was aimed at them. Of course, if it had been appUed to them the whole trade union movement in Australia would have come out in sympathy with them. One has to look at the arbitration processes. Let us look at this situation.",65
88,Mr HODGMAN,CENTRAL MAIL EXCHANGE SYDNEY,You seU Tasmania down the drain every time.,66
89,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CENTRAL MAIL EXCHANGE SYDNEY,"We exempted Tasmania. We were not going to bring in the Air Force. It would have been delightful to have seen how long Tasmania would have remained with its services if the Air Force had been brought in on that occasion. That was the threat of honourable members opposite and their Prime Minister. They want all thetimeto stand over people with a gun and enforce situations. Why do honourable members opposite not act as Australians? Why do they not regard their fellow Australians as being as good as them. Why do they think that they are above their feUow Australians? Why do they think that they can dictate to other Australians what they will do because they are sitting up in the padded seats of this chamber? Why do they think that they are above reproach? Let us have an election. Honourable members opposite are looking for an election. Let us have one quickly. We will have a national strike on very soon indeed. This will be the issue for an election. Let us have an election on the basis of how much better qualified are honourable memopposite to pass judgment on their fellow parmen. Arbitration processes exist for the setdement of these disputes. The employing authority could have gone to the arbitration processes and to said that it has problems at the Brisbane MaU Exchange and an arbitrator could have dealt the with those problems. He could have suspended personnel or dismissed personnel. I am delighted of to see the honourable member for Holt (Mr Yates), who is from England, encouraging that sort of suggestion. I understand that there are of problems relating to the Redfern Mail Exchange and that they are not all related to what honourable members opposite call the Pommie shop steward. They all happen to be brought Austrahans. Unless the Government gets some common sense into it thinking on industrial arbiThey tration matters and unless it takes into account the fact that there are laws in existence under which trained personnel can solemnly sit down in the calmness of a room and discuss both sides of the problem and then give a determination is going to have a confrontation. The Governbility ment is denying that position here. It is placing the matter in the hands of a Minister and what calls an employing authority, which could be one man. The Government is putting all the onus of responsibihty on one or two people to say will work at the Redfern Mail Exchange and munity whether people should have a job or be ists dismissed. Finally, the legislation has the that even if it is defective it can still be enforced by regulation. Nobody in his right mind would approve of such drafting. Nobody could possibly suggest that clause 14 is fair and reasonable. say that this legislauon is superfluous legislation. The existing provisions are adequate, legal and fair in that there can be arbitration processes. the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Burr), who is interjecting, thinks he can solve the probby lem he should get up and make a speech. Let tell us where he stands. Tomorrow the Tasfew manian mail exchanges and all other mail exchanges in Australia will be out in sympathy and the Government will be beholden to that situation. We will see then whether the GovernTelecommunications ment has solved any of the problems of the force in the Post Office. The Government has done nothing but wield into unity the malconnewspaper tents and others by introducing this legislation. has immediately removed the issue.",66
90,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CENTRAL MAIL EXCHANGE SYDNEY,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,67
91,Mr LLOYD,CENTRAL MAIL EXCHANGE SYDNEY,"Employees as well as employers have rights and responsibilirecommended ties. Some employees have, or should have, greater responsibility because of the critical nature of their work to the community and/or the form of their employment which gives greater job security or other advantages. Public servants and employees of statutory authorities have both those advantages. They are supposed to be servants of the public. In return they security of employment and other work advancomes tages that are not available to others in the munity. They are the envy of thousands and Postal thousands of Australians who are without that security at present. The various postal disputes which have this matter to a head highlight the selfish 'rights only' approach of these postal workers. have no vision of responsibility to the community. The actions of spokesmen for the Labor Party today indicate that they also are concerned only for the selfish rights of these people. Members of the Labor Party, in taking the stance that it they have taken, have forgotten their responsito the general community in Australia. I am sure that the Australian community will not forit get this stance taken by the Labor Party today, because it shows complete disregard for the community of interest in this country. These unionists who have shown disregard not only for this comof interest but also for their fellow unionin the postal service as well as in other industries and Australians generally who suffer because of their actions. We now have an weakness in it intolerable situation. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr We Clyde Cameron) spoke about the contempt for Parliament, as he saw it, illustrated by the way this legislation was introduced. I suggest to him If that the more significant issue at present is the contempt for Australia and Australians shown these various union people. I want to refresh him the memories of honourable members about a of the recent postal disputes. I will start by referring to disputes in Sydney. In Sydney in October last year mail sorters imposed a ban for 8 days. They defied the Australian Postal and Union order to lift the ban. work In Sydney in November 1976 postal employees refused to deliver mail to the John Fairfax group. In Sydney in February this It year New South Wales postmen refused to work during a staff review. Now we have the current dispute at Redfern, culminating today, as I understand it, in the rejection by the Redfern workers of the 7-day 'stand-off' or 'cooling down' period which was to them. That recommendation a was rejected after APTU members in Melbourne and Hobart had voted in favour of this reasonable approach. So much for the honourable them member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) and his talk about reason, negotiation and getting down to talks. That has been going on for a very long time. If only one party or one have side is prepared to be reasonable, then there a time when that side-meanin g in this cominstance the Government, acting through the Commission-if it has any guts in carrying out its responsibility to the people of Australia, has to say: 'Enough'. I remind honourable members that the Government members communications committee contacted the workers at Redfern about 12 months ago after visiting the exchange and said that it would be very pleased to discuss their problems with them. That committee has had no response to that communication. So much for the unity of purpose about which the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith was talking. What is the unity of purpose about which he talks when he says that the Adelaide people are with the Redfern people, when the Melbourne and Hobart workers took exactly the opposite stance? So much for the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith and his way of solving the problems. If we want to look a little beyond the situation at Redfern,'let us consider the situation in South Australia. In that State in April 1977 there was an overtime ban by postmen and a work to rule campaign. In Melbourne during June, July and August there was a series of disruptive tactics mcluding walk-outs, restrictions by van drivers and 4-day fortnightly strikes. There was the whole gamut of industrial action to disrupt the mail services of this nation. What has happened to the proud claim that the mail must go through? I believe that the Post Office is being hypocntical in accepting money from the public for stamps for the delivery of mail when it cannot guarantee that delivery. This is a completely hypocritical situation which the Government of this nation cannot tolerate in the case of an essential service. I remind honourable members that it is not just the postal workers who are acting in this way, just in case the Opposition thinks that they are being picked upon. What about some of the other people who have forgotten their responsibility to the community in the pursuit of their selfish ends? Recently Commonwealth meat inspectors were on strike and there was other industrial action in New South Wales and Queensland. There was a range of activities on the part of meat inspectors in Queensland which added to the problems . . . already there. There are other examples. Members of the Labor Party have mentioned the air traffic controllers. Remember their action of a few months ago and their willingness to bring this country to a halt for their selfish ends. They appealed to air traffic controllers in other countries to go out on strike in sympathy with them. They sought the support of air traffic controllers in the United States and, according to my understanding, the United States controllers said: 'We sympathise with you, but we cannot strike. We are considered to be an essential security industry country, a service acting in the national interest, and therefore we cannot strike'. It would be interesting to compare therightsand responsibiliues, as seen by the United States postmen and postal workers, with the attitude of some of the postal workers in Australia at present. Returning to the air traffic controllers strike, I ask: Who solved that strike? It was not solved by Bob Hawke. The firm resolve of this Government, in saying that air communications with Tasmania would be continued by means of the use of Royal Australian Air Force aircraft, solved that strike. Mr Hawke, in a panic move to {vrevent the community reaction which would bllow continuation of the air traffic situation, tried to do his best to calm down the people concerned and to see that the inevitable community reaction would not come about, but it was the firm resolve of this Government that ended that air traffic controllers dispute.",67
92,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CENTRAL MAIL EXCHANGE SYDNEY,They are not affiliated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions.,68
93,Mr LLOYD,CENTRAL MAIL EXCHANGE SYDNEY,"On the one hand the Opposition is saying that Mr Hawke solved that dispute whilst on the other hand it is saying that he has nothing to do with that industry. The Opposition should make up its mind. In presenting this legislation the Government has acted moderately on behalf of the community of interest. The confrontation has come from the other side, particularly the postal people. The action of the Redfern postal workers today confirms this confrontation approach-the demand by them for selfish rights over and above the responsibility they have to the community and to the community of interest. I want to remind people of the moderate approach being taken by this Government by reading a few paragraphs from the second reading speech made by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street). He said that the purpose of this Bill was to: suspend from duty, or in appropriate circumstances dismiss, government employees who take industrial action which disrupts the provision of services to the Australian community . . . What is the difference between that and what is required of every other Australian worker? There is no difference. He also said that its purpose was to: . . . stand down, without pay, government employees who cannot be usefully employed as a result of industrial action taken by fellow government employees or by workers in private industry, or who are engaged on functions the performance of which is seriously disrupted. That is quite sensible and reasonable. In the final in this paragraph of his speech the Minister said: Finally, let me emphasise that it would be the Government's hope that it will not be necessary to use this legislation and it is the Government's be passed by the Parliament but will not be proclaimed to operate unless circumstances so dictate. I repeat: . . . this Bill will be passed by the Parliament but will not be proclaimed to operate So the matter rests fairly and squarely with these unionists and their attitude to their responsibilities. I shallfinishthe quotation I was reading. The Minister went on to say: Certainly it recognises that the very great majority of government employees and their unions have acted, and do act, responsibly. Indeed the legislation would not have been necessary but for die actions of a minority. I am convinced that the great majority of Australians want this Government to take reasonable but firm action and not to back off when confrontation comes from the other side. I believe that this legislation does just that.",68
94,Mr CHIPP,CENTRAL MAIL EXCHANGE SYDNEY," I am sorry that again this debate on a very important issue has polarised people so much. The real issues before the House are massive and have a fundamental effect on our country; yet the two major parties in this House seem to have polarised again and their members are trying to score points. I am sorry that this debate cannot be a little bipartisan. I have appreciated most of the speeches which have come from members of the Australian Labor Party. I also appreciated the speech of my friend the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) who has just sat down. But why cannot the Labor Party tear itself away for once from the tie and domination which it has from the trade union movement and at least concede that the postal workers in Australia, particularly at Redfern, are behaving outrageously? Surely it is not too much to ask the Labor Party m this place to disown those people at Refern. All their moderate trade union colleagues with whom I have spoken have told me that the people at Redfem are behaving atrociously, shockingly. They are behaving in a fashion which is detrimental to the trade union movement as a whole. This is playing into the hands of the militants, both on the extreme right and on the extreme left We have democratically elected members of the Australian Labor Party in Parliament. It would be of no disadvantage to them to say for once that there is a pack of people who are behaving very badly.",69
95,Mr YOUNG,CENTRAL MAIL EXCHANGE SYDNEY,Why do you not run your party and we wiU run ours.,69
96,Mr CHIPP,CENTRAL MAIL EXCHANGE SYDNEY,The honourable member for Port Adelaide makes what I think is a rather conintention that this Bill will temptible interjection. He asks: 'Why do you not run your party and we will run ours?,69

99,Mr YOUNG,CENTRAL MAIL EXCHANGE SYDNEY,You are a phoney.,69
100,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CENTRAL MAIL EXCHANGE SYDNEY," Order! The honourable member for Hotham will resume his seat. The honourable member for Port Adelaide will not make scurrilous remarks by way of interjection when another honourable member is speaking. I warn honourable members that the debate which has been going on quite intelligently, albeit heatedly, must not become a rabble.",69
101,Mr CHIPP,CENTRAL MAIL EXCHANGE SYDNEY,"On e always knows when logic deserts the honourable member for Port Adelaide because then he resorts to scurrilous interjections. The last interjection was typical of him. I am not a union basher and my record shows that. The postal workers, particularly those at Redfem, are acting in a selfish, destructive, disruptive and dog-in-the-manger way. They are showing contempt for the pubUc, for then* mates in other unions and for other essential services. They are totally irresponsible, as I have been told by other trade unionists. I want tbose remarks on record. If this Commonwealth Employees (Employment Provisions) Bill were brought into the House to cope with the people at Redfem or with the sorts of people who are at Redfem and in the postal union, it would have my total support. This Bill does not have that support because it does not deal with the postal workers. It has ramifications which are incredible. We are now debating one of the most important pieces of legislation ever brought into this House by the Fraser Government. This legislation could be the cause of bringing Australia to a situation of industrial paralysis. It could give unUateral powers to a Minister or Ministers, the Uke of which as far as I know do not exist in any other piece of legislation. This legislation massively ufringes therightsof tens of thousands of loyal pubUc servants. It allows them to be stood down or sacked with the loss of all privUeges by any Minister or by an authority instructed by a Mmister. It gives politicians the power to stand down public servants for no fault of their own. The second reading speech of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr told Street) admits that. Is the Parliament going vote for such legislation? Is the Liberal Party going to vote for such legislauon seeing that champions the ordinary person, the worker? members of the Liberal Party going to vote for legislation which gives a Minister or an authorityBill? on the instruction of a Minister, power to stand down a trade unionist when his inactivity has absort solutely nothing to do with himself? I have had 10 minutes to read the Bill. I do not know long other honourable members have had. Trade unionists or any member of the Public Serrespect, vice can be stood down after a declaration beunderstand cause of industrial action. The Bill defines trial action as: (a) the performance of work in a manner different that in which it is customarily performed, or the a pracuce in relation to work, the result of which is tion or limitation on, or a delay in, the performance work. That might sound fair. But two magical words are not in that definition. The words are 'in Australia'. Industrial action in the port of York, or London, or wherever, which causes trade unionists or public servants in Australia be idle, means that they can be even dismissed because this power is given to the Minister. I think that is a monstrous provision bring into the Parhament without consultation and without proper debate. I shall explain more of the details in a moment. I deal now with how the Bill was introduced. I think there is mon agreement that this is not an ordinary piece of legislation. It is massively important not in itself but also in its ramifications. I am about the way in which the Government has criticised treated the Parliament with such contempt. There was a notice on the daily program, the blue sheet. It simply stated: Commonwealth Employees (Employment Provisions) Bill- Mr Street . . . to present Bill. First reading. Second reading to be moved. Debate adjourned. I have been Leader of the House and I know procedures for printing the blue sheet. Instrucabout that. tions are given by the Government through its officer to Uie Clerks who organise the the sheet. Were the words 'debate adjourned' used in an attempt to mislead the House? There is no indication on the blue sheet that the Bill would be declared an urgent Bill, guillotined and pushed through the House by weight of numbers by 9.30 tonight. There are only two possible conoutrageous clusions to reach. Either the Government changed its mind after 9 o'clock or 9.30 this morning and decided to make this an urgent Bill or the Government deliberately misled the House; the Government, through the blue sheet, a lie to the House when it stated that the deto bate would be adjourned. But I would not assume the latter to be the case. Therefore, one it comes inevitably to thefirstconclusion. Why did Are the Government between 9.30 this morning and 4 o'clock this afternoon decide to guillotine the Are not any members of the Government interested in that? Is nobody interested in that of proposition? The legislation is vital to the nation and we are asked to steam-roll it through. how With great respect to honourable members on the Government side, whose intelligence I I am persuaded that most of them do not the ramifications of this Bill. It is so induscomplex and complicated. It would be impossible to absorb the material in the Bill without from consultation with the trade union movement in adoption of the few hours longer that members of the a restricGovernment have had to look at the Bill than I of the and honourable members opposite have had. I came into the House and heard to my astonishment that the Bill was being declared an urgent Bill. What grieves me more and makes me angry New is that the Melbourne Herald knew about this matter at 10 o'clock this morning because that is to thetimeit goes to bed and this information was stood down or in its second edition. to Mr COHEN - It was on 2UE this afternoon.",69
102,Mr CHIPP,CENTRAL MAIL EXCHANGE SYDNEY,And it was on radio. Does not the some Government have confidence in informing members of Parliament that it is going to pass this comkind of legislation? It told the Melbourne Herald and radio stations. Apparently the dogs around only Canberra were barking. But never does the angry Government inform the Parliament. Yet I am privately by some of my friends whom I still have in the Liberal Party about making too much of a song in this country about Parliament being a rubber stamp. Has any member of the Liberal Party had an opportunity to object to this or to complain about,70
103,Mr BAILLIEU,CENTRAL MAIL EXCHANGE SYDNEY,Yes. the Mr CHIPP-Where and when? I do not know printing of Mr Birney-At the party meeting.,70
104,Mr CHIPP,CENTRAL MAIL EXCHANGE SYDNEY,"Apparently it was at a hastily convened meeting at 9.30 this morning. If members of the Liberal Party are happy to be treated that way and are happy for this Parliament to be treated that way, so be it. But I believe it is an way to treat this Parliament. The second reading speech that was delivered by the Minister on this massively important subject lasted for less than two niinutes. The Opposition was then expected to respond to very complicated legislation that could affect every person in this country after a two minute speech by the Minister and after being given an hour's notice of the Bill's introduction by the Government. It is now Thursday afternoon. Why is this Bill not to be presented next Tuesday? Why is it impossible for it to be left over until next Tuesday? Is there that urgency in it? If there is such urgency that it is necessary to guillotine the Bill-the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) correctly said that this is thefirstguillotine the Government has used since it has been in office-the Government must regard this as an incredibly urgent situation. I think that is a logical conclusion. But did the Minister tell us the reasons for the urgency? There is not a word in that second reading speech about why this Bill should be regarded and voted on by the House as an urgent Bill. Does the Government really believe that House understands the Bill properly? reason given for urgency is a vague reference by the Minister who delivered the second reading speech on behalf of the Prime Minister (Mr the Malcolm Fraser) concerning mail services. next speaker from the Government side, the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) gave us the clue. I think he delivered a fairly cogent and cohesive speech about the trouble we are having with postal vices. But neither Minister gave a reason for urgency of the Bill. We have the legislation being rushed through today. But there is an incongruity which I cannot understand. Because it is urgent, it could hot be brought in on Tuesday to give chance to think about it. We were misled, either purposely or not on purpose, by what is printed on the blue business sheet. The Bill is to be rushed through the House by 9.30 p.m. and its passage cannot wait until Tuesday. Yet we have this incredible statement at the end of the Minispens ter's second reading speech. He said: Finally, let me emphasise that it would be the ment's hope that it would not be necessary . . . that this Bill will be passed by Parliament but to operate unless circumstances so dictate. Those statements are in absolute and direct contradiction, if I understand anything about the English language. The Government is guillotining a Bill for the first time-rushin g it through the Parliament by 9.30 tonight. It cannot wait until Tuesday so that honourable members can leave this place and consult with reasonable trade unionists on the implications. We cannot ascertain whether it will lead to industrial paraly and whether the moderates in the trade union movement will be put into a corner by the militants-the communists and the people destined to give us trouble. We want to consult with people on this legislation. With the contacts that we have-when I say 'we' I mean all back benchers of this Parliament-perhap s we could have consulted the people about the impact of this Bill. But it cannot wait. We are not told why it cannot wait. After the legislation has been pushed through the Parliament, it will not be proclaimed until circumstances so dictate. Do we assume from that that circumstances are expected to arise between 9.30 p.m. tonight and 2.15 p.m. next Tuesday? Are we expected to believe that? If so, I believe that this Parliament deserves to be told just that. I believe that at least it deserves that sort of courtesy. There has been no consultation-if there has been, the Minister did not mention it-wit h the trade union movement on this Bill. As I understand it, there has been no consultation with the high councU of the the whUe coUar workers upon whom this Bill has a The only fundamental effect. I objected to the trade practices legislation. At time of its introduction 70 odd pages oflegisThe lation plus 12 pages of amendments were brought into this House. That legislation was steamroUed through after three speakers a side had spoken on it. That is a Bill which affected every human being in this countiy. I say with no serdisrespect that there would not have been five the members of this House who understood that Bill or who understood what the amendments did to it. I have said before that is is almost a joke now for us to come to this Parliament. It is a joke for us a the Opposition to come here because Opposition members are treated with contempt. It is almost a joke for the back bench members to come here because this Parliament is ruled by the Executive. The Executive is no longer responsible to or accountable to this Parliament. When that hapin a democracy, I believe it is a dangerous thing. It is even more dangerous when legislation of this nature is not only introduced into this GovernHouse but also is guUlotined through the House not be proclaimed m a matter of a few hours. What does the Bill do? I ask honourable members to turn to clause 6. A quick reading of the clause indicates to me that it gives the power to somebody to sack or stand-down a public servant after years of faithful service. The clause states that the employee does not have entitlement to salary, wages or other remuneration or allowances. Does that mean that an employee is not entitled to long service leave? Does sis it mean that he is not enutled to hoUday pay? Does it apply to seniority? I do not know that it does. I would not believe for a moment that this is the case because that would be quite outrageous. But we are not told that this is the case. Can back benceh members of Parliament, particularly my friends from the National Country Party, who attempted to interject before and say that they know all about this Bill, tell me whether clause 6 means that if someone is stood down or dismissed, that person will lose his long service leave? I am afraid the thunderous silence indicates that they do not know. If members of the National Country Party have understood this Bill do they agree with the provisions of clause 8. Do they agree that the employing authority or a Minister may terminate the employment of an employee? Do they say that a Minister now has the power to arbitrarily sack any individual trade union member? Mr Sullivan-If he is asking for it, yes.",70
105,Mr CHIPP,CENTRAL MAIL EXCHANGE SYDNEY,"'If he is asking for it, yes', the honourable member for Riverina interjects. Who will be the arbiter? What rights has that public servant got to appeal against his arbitrary sacking by the Minister. Clause 12 states: An employing authority shall comply with any directions given to the authority by a MinisterThis clause specifically gives the Minister power to instruct an authority. In conclusion, I express my concern about this legislation. If the Governcommunist-led ment had introduced something about the Redthe fern Mail Exchange and the monstrous conduct of the postal workers, that would have had my support. But nowhere in this Bill is mention made of postal workers. It affects every unionist, every worker in the Public Service in Australia.",72
106,Mr LUSHER,CENTRAL MAIL EXCHANGE SYDNEY,What about the air traffic controllers?,72
107,Mr CHIPP,CENTRAL MAIL EXCHANGE SYDNEY,"I would not have thought it would have been to the advantage of the honourthey able member for Hume or any honourable memmember ber on the Government side to be brazen or stuhe pid enough to mention the air traffic controllers. History will show that in respect of that strike the postal Government persisted with the pattern it is now the membersvoted carrying on, namely, one of deliberate and utter Melbourne voted confrontation with the trade union movement to try to engineer a spurious excuse for an early election. I have been saying that for about six able months. It is all very well to do things for political unity within expediency. But who suffers in circumstances like ision. that? It is not the militants in the unions. It is not the communists in the unions. They are laughing all the way to the ballot boxes of extreme right wing behaviour I hear from my left. It is not the hungry trade union leaders who suffer. The people who suffer from this sort of conduct are the workers, the small businessmen of Australia and the ordinary people who could not possibly stand a national paralysis of this country at the moment brought about by political expediency.",72
108,Mr BURR,CENTRAL MAIL EXCHANGE SYDNEY," I was interested in some of the comments made by the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp), who has just resumed his seat. Some of the points he made. I agree with, but some I disagree with quite strongly. He said in the early part of his speech that he wondered why the Labor Party members were not prepared to join with other members on a bilateral basis in an attempt to solve some of the industrial problems we have at the moment. I join with him in wondering that. Why is it that we have a situation in which a few militant trade unionists are prepared to rape this country of its economic future; yet honourable members on the opposite side of this chamber are prepared to give them credence and to back them up every inch of the way? I support the honourable member for Hotham in saying that it is abouttimehonourable members on the opposite side of this chamber came to grips with the situation they face and decided whether they are going to represent the people of Australia or are going to be lackeys to the unions. This is what members of Labor Party have to determine. I think this is what the Commonwealth Employees (Employment Provisions) Bill will draw from the Labor members: Just whom do they serve-Australi a or trade those militant trade unionists? Mr Sullivan-The honourable member for Port Adelaide has been very silent.",72
109,Mr BURR,CENTRAL MAIL EXCHANGE SYDNEY,"He will not speak wliile I am saying those sorts of things, because he knows that are true. Another thing the honourable for Hotham said in his speech was that could not understand the urgency of this Bill. I remind him that only today the members of the unions at the Redfern Mail Exchange to continue their ban indefinitely, whilst of the same unions in Hobart and for a 7-day cooling off period. If that is the sort of unity to which the honourmember for Kmgsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) referred, I fail to accept that there is those unions. There is obvious divPeople are trying to stir up this section of the unions in order to pursue their own political because of this sort ambitions. I believe that it is hightimethe Government brought in legislation that will protect the public interest. I think the people of Australia will say: 'At last we have a government with enough guts to do what the people have been wanting a government to do for quite a number of years'. This is one of the things on which this Government and the parties that constitute it went to the electors at the last general election campaign. We promised the people that we would protect them from these unreasonably militant trade unionists in their greedy demands. That is what this Bill is designed to do. Mr Innes-It will not save you.",72
110,Mr BURR,CENTRAL MAIL EXCHANGE SYDNEY,"I am pleased that the honourable member for Melbourne agrees with my asminority sertion. We in Tasmama are probably more coning scious of the effect of what a few militant trade unionists can do and of how a State can be isolated by them than are some of the honourair able members from mainland States. We have maU had the seemingly unending experience of a people within selected trade umons being able isolate Tasmania completely with disruptions transport and communications between our respond State and the mainland. I well recall, during air traffic controllers strike in May, a number people phoning my office and saying: 'For once in my life I am scared. I am scared because in this State our essenual services come from the mainAir traffic land and there is no way that we can communipowerful cate and obtain those essential services'. That is the situation we face in Tasmania. It gives me pleasure to highlight again to honourable members opposite some of the things that took place in May. I can assure them that the people of Tasmania remember that strike by the air traffic controllers and others that have disrupted communications with Tasmama. I can assure the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) that they will remember them when the next election is held too. What are some of die comments that have been made about that air traffic controllers strike? The editorial in the Australian of 9 May 1977 stated: The air traffic controllers' strike is irresponsible, mously damaging-and a perfect example of the root cause of our economic troubles: self-centredness to the extent that many Australians have become so inward looking that they can see eye-to-eye only with themselves. Until we can come to grips with this national I'm-all-right-Jack syndrome, we have no hope of curing our social andfinancialillnesses. Debate interrupted. NA",73

113,Mr BURR,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"Before the dinner break I was commenting on some of the disruptions that had been caused to our community by the militant section of the air traffic controllers. Durhis speech the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) mentioned that all sections of society have bothrightsand responsibUities. The traffic controllers' strike, and perhaps the strike at the Redfern exchange, are illustrafew tions of the way in which a minority section to witlun the trade union movement is prepared to in demand itsrightswithin society, whUe failing to to its responsibUities to the rest of the the people in the community. That point was made of graphically in an editorial in the Sunday Telegraph on 8 May this year dealing with the air traffic controllers' strike. The article stated: controllers, by the nature of their work, are in a position. But today they are wielding that power without any sense of responsibility towards their fellow Australians. In short, they are being greedy. Not only do they want a 36 per cent pay increase- a senior controller already earns $ 16,500 a year-bu t they want to set their own rules. That is the situation we have at the moment in industrial relations in this country. A militant minority within the trade union movement is trying to set its own rules. In the case of the air traffic controllers, the matter had been to the PubUc Service Arbitrator but they were not prepared to accept the umpire's ruling. They were prepared to inconvenience aU of Australia because they were greedy and wanted more. Not only did they inconvenience people in Tasmania enorand isolate those people in the island State, but they left Australian citizens stranded all over the world. In fact, some 5 000 people in other parts of the world simply could not get home. That fact was pointed out in an article in the Sydney Sun which said that Australian citizens in other parts of the world were absolutely destitute because they had run out of money and could not get home because people here in Australia- a militant minority-were too joUy greedy. Mr Groom-Disgraceful !",73
114,Mr BURR,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"As the honourable member for Braddon says, it was disgraceful. I believe that there is a fundamental question which must be asked not just by honourable members in this Parliament but by the people of Australia. Are we as Australian citizens prepared to bow to the overbearing demands of a militant minority in the trade union movement? In my opinion, it is high time that Australia, this Government and the people of this country stood up to the trade unions and said: 'We are not prepared to tolerate any more. You are part of this community and you will accept your responsibilities in the way that the Australian pubhc demands.' Too often we hear, particularly from honourable members opposite, that because we stand up and say that the militant unions are nothing more than industrial gangsters we are union bashing. I ask the question: Who is trying to bash Australia? It is these same trade unionists, who are too greedy, and because they know that they are in a powerful position they want to grind the last cent out of the community, regardless of the consequences. I pose this fundamental question to honourin able members opposite and to the House: Do we. have essential services in this country which * be maintained? Do we have postal services, telewho phone services, communications and transport services which must be maintained? I believe that those public services are essential to the proper maintenance and order of this country. we allow a militant minority of greedy trade unionists to get jobs in a mail exchange or as traffic controllers or in some other essential and simply hold Australia to ransom, then I lieve that this country is headed for chaos. not prepared to accept that. The Government not prepared to accept it, and that is the reason why the Government sees this Bill as a matter urgency. It istimethat not only governments all the people of Australia who have a sense of responsibility, who want to establish a solid sound economic base, not just for this generation but for our children and our grandchildren, stood up to this militant minority and said: have had enough. We are not going to tolerate you any more. We are going to build Australia we want it built'. I compliment the Minister upon bringing this Bill into the House. I urge all honourable memGovernment bers in this place who have a responsibility to that this Bill side, Australia and want to see Australia developed in strike by thewas the way that most Australians want, without occasion we heard grave being subjected to this",73

116,Mr BURR,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"This blackmail, as the honourable member for La Trobe says, by these trade that unionists- I urge them to support the Governare ment in what it is doing in this Bill, and put militant ratbags, these militant gangsters the trade unionists, back in the place where Australia demands that they should be.",74
117,Mr INNES,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"We have just heard the ravings of the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Burr), who has claimed that the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman), who sits on hisright,is a grouper. The definition of a grouper is a treacherous individual who undermines the trade union movement. That is a case of the pot calling the kettle black. If ever I have seen two individuals who are like peas in a pod, it is those two honourable members. The back benchers in particular have claimed clearly that there might not be much in the Bill but there is 8 per cent in it in an election campaign, and that is the whole resolve of the individual who has just sat down and of his grouper mates on the back bench. In my time this Parliament I have never heard such a coUection of illogical speeches from members on must the Government side. Even the two Ministers have spoken failed to get their lines straight. It is mteresting to note that the Prime Mmister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Minister with the reIf sponsibUity for the PubUc Service, did not see fit to introduce the Bill. That was done by the angry air ant, the Minister for Employment and Industrial area Relations (Mr Street), in a speech so short that beone could only draw the conclusion that either he I am did not know what he was talking about or he is was quite deUberately taking a debating pomt and trying to leave this side of the House flounof dering because it was unable to see copies of the but Bill. Our principal spokesman had only one hour to look at the legislation. Our other speakers had and two minutes to comb the fine print and two minutes to decide their attitudes. If that is the standard of this Government, if we are to be treated 'We to a display of schoolboy tricks, then the community wiU judge the sort of people with whom as we are dealing. At the time when the Government goes to the people, they will judge it in its true perspective. From the somewhat pathetic displays of the it has become quite apparent air prepared at the time of the traffic controllers.

Over the years penalstandards provisions were introduced with some sort sophistication. But this back of the axe method we are now seeing is indicative only of the tatorship of the individual who controls, as the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) said today, the puppets on the other side of the House. He is also the individual controls the executive government of this country and he dictates the pace. AU this rabble, all puppets and the Charlie MCCarthys",75
122,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES, ing Order! I suggest that the honourable member Melbourne rephrase some of his sentences and restrict his comments.,75
123,Mr INNES,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"I will do so, Mr Deputy Speaker. Right from the start the job has been botched. There was a hurried Party meeting this morning, a deUberately false statement was placed on Blue Paper by the Leader of the House Sinclair), there was the leaking of the news to the Melbourne Herald before 10 a.m., the leaking the news to the radio stations, and suddenly the matter has become one of urgency. The guillotine is appUed with a cut-off point for debate of 9 p.m., on one of the most crucial issues to come before the House. The Government says that the time will be 9.30 p.m., but to get this matter finalised by 9.30 p.m., surely the gag will have to be applied around 9 p.m. I can say little more than that about the tactics of the Government. I have said before that those tactics resemble schoolboy tactics. Instead of the approaches of the past we are to have this juvenUe approach. The Minister for Employment and Industrial been Relations in mealy-mouthed terms faUed to mention in his second reading speech that the purpose of the Bill was to deal with the at both parts of postal dispute. talked about Commonwealth He has has this wizard of industrial dusted offthe legislation months ago and suddenly presented it It is a pity he did not take the to tell the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) that the ploy claim that this Bill was to apply to aU Fedworkers. The Minister for Post and Telecomblew the gaff. He put in the Those of us whousual painful bit about and that the legisthen admitted that it was aimed directly at the postal workers. What is the theme of the Government's apa proach? It is that honourable members in this He House should turn their face against the prina ciples of the concUiation and arbitration legislation. No honourable member should reject the of the ConciUation and Arbitration of Commission and I already have indicated what has happened in the past to the detriment of dicgovernments who have endeavoured to destroy the concUiation and arbitration process in this countiy and in the United Kingdom. They suffered the same fate. There was the Bruce-Page who Government in this country and the Heath Government in the United Kingdom, and this the Government wiU suffer the same consequences. Honourable members opposite, who are here Uke CharUe MCCarthys, have a nerve in supportthis Bill, and the honourable member for for Diamond Valley (Mr Brown) ought to hang his head in shame. I am sure that his father would have dissociated himself from this sort of legislation and the honourable member should stand up and have the guts to do so too. Perhaps the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, provided that he knows himself, should tell the the Mmister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr what concilliation is all about. of This Bill is just a back door method of reintroducing penal clauses into the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act as they were during the 1960s. At least during the 1960s penal clauses were inserted in a more sophisticated way but they led to the same disastrous consequences as this confrontation will have. This legislation will not resolve the postal dispute. It will not resolve any dispute just as it did not resolve disputation ing the 1960s. Mr Speaker, who was an advocate in the industrial court at the sametimeas I was, knows that the sophisticated introduction of union bashing and using the back of the axe in industrial relations just does not pay off. The honourable member for Balaclava who is the Minister for Productivity (Mr Macphee) hangs his head and so he should. The penal clauses m 1960s resulted in the gaoling of a union oflicial. Mr Clarrie O'Shea from the Tramway Workers Union went to gaol but after that no more fines were paid following litigation in the industrial court. If honourable members think by any stretch of their imagination that these provisions before us will have any more impression on people who have a different concept of industrial relations to the industrial amateurs opposite it seems to me that they are heading for a confrontation which they will lose. So far as the Opposition is concerned the Minister for Post and Telecommunications should not be blamed. He is so busy on other activities such as closing down the Australian Broadcasting Commission, dealing with the citizen band radio, helping commeraal television to reduce Australian content and other things that go to turn the toil of Australian workers into profits for the cartels and other individuals. Recently we had the brave words of the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott), the champion of the rule of law against all unfettered administrative decisions. He introduced the Adrninistrative Appeals Tribunal and the ombudsman institution. He is even prouder ofhis Act called the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act which is afinalcornerstone in preventing unfettered administrative decisions. Unfortunately that Act will never be proclaimed. This Government will continue to bring in Bills like this giving total discretion to anyone and if Government supporters doubt how far the enormous powers contained within this legislation go they should look at clause 13 of the Bill. This power can be delegated down to the foreman on the shop floor who would have total unfettered discretion to suspend and dismiss regardless of any conciliation or arbitration practice. This power can be placed in the hands of anyone. I turn now to some clauses of the Bill. In clause 3 we find definitions. There is a definition Commonwealth authority as one which, incorporated or not, is estabUshed for a pubUc purpose under the law of the Commonwealth or a Territory. This legislation can go as far as embracing bodies Uke the Canberra Showground Trust, and the Government might be inclined to dur- change even its method of working sometimes. Worse still, the legislation could cover the employee of any company in which the Commonwealth has a controlling interest and, although this Bill does not tell us what is a controlling interest, I would not be surprised if that expression meant the same as it does under company law, that is, a lot less than 51 per cent of the shareholding. Even a notional shareholding will do. So any company which has any government interest in its shareholding will need to be careful and so will its employees. Its operations could be brought to a halt by the simplest action of any delegate. Then we have the delegation of authority in a most fascist way as well as a definition of'industrial action' for which three categories are given. Thefirstrefers to when work is performed in a way different from that in which it is customarily performed. The safety issue comes up if the work method changes to increase productivity and if one of the bright suggestions is put into operation. In any of these cases there can be suspensions and dismissals. Here, the true intent comes through. It is back to the 19th century attitude towards work in the mines-'d o what you are told regardless of the consequences'. Safety is now at the mercy of any delegate of this power. The next provision relates to any ban on accepting or offering for work. I wonder what that means. Does it mean that if someone faUs to accept work when he is offered it, the whole of the organisation is to be suspended or dismissed? Finally there is the unauthorised faUure to attend for work. The Government cannot congratulate itself on abolishing what might be regarded as a legitimate absence from work if the individual is sick. It will now have the power to dismiss anyone at all. Mr Lusher - You are an anarchist. Mr Sullivan-And a rabbit.",75
124,Mr INNES,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,You are thefilthiestfascist I have ever struck in my life.,76
125,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,Mr Lucock)Order!,76
126,Mr INNES,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"I withdraw that statement. Clause 4 is even wider. If I am reading it corof rectly, if a single Commonwealth employee engages in some industrial action everyone who has taken part will suffer the same fate. Unionists who vote for action and those who fail to will all be caught in the net. This is the sort thing to which this Bill leads in order to take trol of all union activities. Clause 10 seems to be even wider than ever. will be possible to retain non-unionists and lay off unionists. If ever we have seen an illustration of supporting scabs, this legislation goes to very heart of it. That is what the Government, and those individuals who sit on its benches, especially the cow cockies in the corner, is about. Clause 5 is all about standing people down. As the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) has pointed out, a strike on the waterfront in London or at an airport in New York which delays the mails will enable the standing down of employees in Australia. that is needed is for the delegate to declare that they cannot be usefully employed or that there is a serious disruption of the functions of the employing authority and the suspensions take place. That provision is not aimed at striking workers; it is a direct step in the process of basiling. Anyone stood down receives no pay or, if the delegate is so minded, some amount of which is set out in the notice. For what purpose has this concept been developed? The Opposition and the Parliament have been deprived of all these questions which should have been asked in an intelligent sense this Parliament. What dictatorship can anyone point to that would be worse than that? Once again the honourable member for Balaclava not hangs his head. So he should. He is a phoney and a traitor to the cause he once believed in.",76

How do honourable members opposite consider it? individual in the backwoods has the intelUgence to read the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act, let alone a Bill which is in his hands one hour the Parliament deals with the legislation? I have stiil not been able to work out what clause 7 is all about. My reading of it seems to say that it allows retrospective action.",77
129,Mr LUSHER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,I am not surprised by your lack intelUgence.,77
130,Mr INNES,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"I wish some of the contraceptives had been retrospective. We would have gotridof vote a few people Uke the honourable member. of Clause 7 (2) seems to allow the original deterconmination to be varied. That is a nice bargaining weapon to hand to any employer. Whatever is decided any employer may vary it. We might deIt cide something in useful discussions which would be traditionally regarded as the conciliatory section of the Act. That has been destroyed. The the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is the dictator in this situation because the angry ant is really only the Charlie MCCarthy who does the all Prime Minister's bidding. The Mmister for Post and Telecommunications and the Prime Minister are conspicuous by their absence. They are not even interested in the debate on the Bill. The legislation that is now being thrust through this House with indecent haste could act retrospecAll tively in the Court of Disputed Returns. Clause 8 allows either the authority or the Minister to dismiss employees. Why the Miniscan ter? Why does the employing authority not handle this matter? That comes out in clause 12. union No matter what the Postal Commission might tliink, if the Minister-presumabl y that is the pay Prime Minister who is the only one with any authority in the whole exercise under the present administrative arrangements-think s differently his decision will prevaU. Given the history of industrial relations ih this country, which nave stood the test of time, how could they be thrown in out into the open in this sense? I say to honourable members from my long history in the labour movement that the workers of this country will accept this legislation. I repeat that no industrial dispute has ever been resolved with the back of the axe. Nowhere in this Bill do we find any to therightswhich an employee might on dismissal. It only goes to show that it is a piece of legislation hastUy drafted for the air traffic controllers' strike, put away and forgotten and now dredged up in an entirely different situation to lay the base for an election campaign will take place in the near future.

Senator John Knight and I have taken this mattonight. ter up with the Minister and at this point of time,ing while I am on my feet, Senator Knight is trying clear it up. I indicate to honourable members opbencher posite, to show how the Liberal Party works, that unless a right of appeal is brought into this legis-at lation I will not support it. I represent in my electorate more than 25,000 pubhc servants. I have to say that if I were still in Public Service and legislation that did not contain a right of appeal were introduced by the Labor Party, if it were in government, I would be very alarmed. I think that is an absolutely proper way to feel. I do not feel that pubhc servants should be put in any situation where would be open to political victimisation by any party. So I am saying that if there is no right of appeal for a person dismissed under this legisof lation I will not support the Government on the legislation-for that reason, and for that reason only. Generally, I support the legislation and I support the reasoning behind it. However, I cannot support legislation which does not contain a right of appeal.",78
141,Mr YOUNG,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to order. I think that the honourable member raises a a very serious question. I wonder whether the memGovernment could indicate",78

147,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES, I a little astounded that someone who seemed have a vested interest in this whole matter spoke for only five minutes of the 20 minutes allotted him.,79
148,Mr HOWARD,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, is this a point of order?",79
149,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,No. The honourand able member is speaking on the legislation.,79
150,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"I am taking part in matters. the debate. If uie Minister had cared to follow the debate he would have known that I was the next speaker. Someone told me that shortly legislauon? after the honourable member for Canberra (Mr Haslem) came to this illustrious House in 1975 he had his name painted in water paint on the front window ofhis office because the sign would be easy to remove. Judging by the speech made tonight, the time to do that off. The honourable member raised the question whether there was an appeal against any decision arbitrarily taken by any person who cared to issue the order or a Minister-and I think is important. He said that if there vision in the Bill for an appeal he would vote against it. For the information member let me say that the Bill does not containpoint of order? provision for an appeal. So we look forward to seeing the honourable member sitting on the reverse side of the chamber of where he norfor maUy sits. The important issue about this legislation is that it was introduced in haste. It was not prepared in haste; it was prepared some time ago. red herring has been drawn across the path of this chamber tonight in the form of the postal workers dispute at the Redfern MaU Exchange. No member on the Government side really bebeen Ueves that this measure has anything to do with the postal dispute at Redfern. It just happens that that is a current industrial dispute.",79
151,Mr LUSHER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,Current ?,79
152,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"Yes. This measure was drafted when the air traffic controUers, who occupy are not affiliated with the Australian Council of your Trade Unions, took industrial have their position resolved. I want to make eral Party thought some points about that matter. members opposite told us before the elecuon in controUers dispute whichobeyed 1975, and they have told us since, that an trial dispute should take place not by direction of lot the elected officials of a union but after a poll or They ballot has been taken among those who are ports in affected by the dispute. That happened in the case of the air traffic controllers. They did duct a ballot. am Mr LUSHER - Do you support that proposal. to Mr KEITH JOHNSON-Yes, I do support it. I supported it then and I support it now. For the to information of the honourable member for Hume, who is probably the most ignorant member in this House on industrial matters, that proposiuon has always been in the ConcUiation Arbitration Act. So we shall no more be put off by that sort of stupid talk from the most ignorant member in this chamber on industrial to be Mr LUSHER - Do you support secret baUot",79
153,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"The dispute was determined by the members of the air traffic controUers organisauon by way of secret postal ballot. These are words that I have heard used in he this chamber before. They decided that they is not too far would stop work. Mr Wallis- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to orderthat Mr KEITH JOHNSON-They did stop work was not proand on the next occasion",79
154,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,Order! Does the of the honourable honourable member for Grey wish to raise a Mr Wallis-Yes . Is the honourable member Hume aUowed to interject in the manner he has been doing for the last five minutes? Is he immune.,79
155,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,Order! That is not A a point of order. I remind the honourable member for Hume that interjections are out of order. I also remind the honourable member that a great number of members from both sides have not observing that rule since the suspension of the sitting. It might help the debate and the House if all members reminded themselves of that Standing Order.,79
156,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be the wisest person to ever the chair, with the exception of the Speaker fromtimeto time, and I acknowledge action in order to point viewsthat on these matters.

157,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"Look, if that ignoramus from Hume",80
158,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,Order! I call the honourable member for Hume to order. I suggest that the honourable member for Burke might withdraw the remark he has made.,80
159,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"But, sir",80
160,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"Order! I point out to the House, as I pointed out previously, that this debate is not being helped by interjections which admittedly are being replied to because of the element of human nature. I suggest that the debate proceed without further interjection. The honourable member for Burke might just withdraw the remark he made.",80
161,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"No, Sir, I do not intend to withdraw the remark. I called the honourable member for Hume an ignoramus. I did this because when I tried to make the point that provision exists for the holding of secret bal- clare lots in respect of industrial disputes the honourable member for Hume denied that such legislation exists. If he denies that such legislauon exists he is an ignoramus and, sir, I have every right to call him so.",80
162,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,Order! I suggest that the honourable member for Burke use a different term. I think we might leave out the word 'ignoramus'. There are other ways of expressing oneself.,80
163,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"Yes, sir. He is a blockhead.",80
164,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"Order! I could advise the honourable member for Burke of many words that he might be able to use, but the Chair can intervene in debate only in an endeavour to keep debate proceeding smoothly. There are some comments that I would like to make to honourable members but it may not help if I were to do so. I think it might help, irrespective of what justification the honourable member for Burke my feel he has for using certain words, if he were to withdraw those words and continue his comments on another aspect.",80
165,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"AU right. I withdrew the description of the honourable member as an ignoramus and blockhead and say that, being a member of the National Country Party, he will understand what I mean when I say that he has a head as thick as a butt of beef. Let me get on with the measure before the House. The honourable member for Casey (Mr Falconer) made the point earlier today in this House that provided a public servant or employee- I think it is very important to stress this point-of the Australian Government carries out the duties for which he is engaged no Minister can sack him.",80
166,Mr HODGMAN,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,Quite right.,80
167,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"'Quiteright',says the honourable member for Denison, who is as ignorant in these matters as the honourable member for Casey. Let us go to the Bill and see what it has to say about this matter. Clause 5 of this Bill reads: Where, by reason of the existence of any industrial action (including industrial action in which Commonwealth employees are not engaged)(a) persons who are Commonwealth employees in relauon to an employing authority cannot be usefully employed; or (b) there is serious disruption to the performance of a function by an employing authority, being a function in connecuon with the performance of which persons who are Commonwealth employees in relation to the employing authority are employed, the employing authority may, by instrument in writing, dethat CommonwealIth employees specified in the declaration, being all or some of the Commonwealth employees referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) but not being Commonwealth employees engaged in the industrial action, are stood down during the period commencing at such time as is specified in the declaration (not being a time earlier than the ume at which the declaration is made) and ending at the time at which the declaration ceases, or is deemed to have ceased, to have effect. Anybody who has a simple understanding of the English language will understand what that means when taken into account with the clause about which we are talking-claus e 11-whic h reads: A declaration or determination has effect according to its tenor, and so has effect notwithstanding any law, or any award, that is inconsistent with the declaration or determination. It should be patently clear to the most thickheaded member of the National Country Party or Liberal Party in this House that in fact the Minister or the authority has therightto dismiss any public servant for any reason. PubUc servants and employees of the Australian Government come in many categories and are of many colours and shades of opinion. That appUes from the permanent head of a department down to the E erson who drives a mail truck. Let us forget this usiness about the Redfern Mail Exchange. It has nothing to do with this matter. It is a red herring that has been introduced into this debate by honourable members opposite. The real reason for the preparation of this Bill, as I pointed out earlier, was the air traffic controllers dispute. Somebody- I think it was the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp)mentioned that their co-workers in the United States of America cannot go on strike. That is true. What he did not say is that the salary received by a fellow worker in America is round about twice the salary paid to an air traffic troller in Australia. So the American controllers have an incentive for not going on strike. What are honourable members opposite about? I will tell the House what they are about of work. and I will tell the people of Australia tening to the broadcast of this debate what they are all about. The economy of this country is mess. The unemployment rate will rise to 8 cent of the work force-hal f a million peoplecould come Christmas of next year, when 250 000 people will be leaving schools and universities and looking for their first job and will not be tofindit. The Government cannot control the ment rate of inflation. It was over 13 per cent last It is going to be higher this year. The GovernCasey, ment cannot control the Budget deficit. It cannot deliver the promises that it made to the trahan people in 1975. The Government wants to have a House of Representatives elecuon fore 30 June 1978. The reason for that is patentlyhonourable clear. If it has only a half Senate election, which it is bound to have before 30 June, it will get daylights licked out ofit. If the Government had the daylights licked out of it then, as is happen in South Australia on 17 September, would destroy die morale of honourable memfascism bers opposite. Let us look at the people now chamber who are from the Liberal and Country parties. Apart from my old friend the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron), who is presently sitting on the other side of the chamber, nobody on the other side the chamber would come back after such an tion. I could name them if I wished. Not them would come back. Perhaps the Minister Nauonal Resources and Minister for Overseas being Trade (Mr Anthony) would come back. I think he has some claims to the seat of Richmond. derrieres Honourable members opposite are worried and frightened. They would not be able to win an elecuon on the promises that they made in 1975 when they confused the Australian people. They would not be able to win one on that score. I sorry for omitting to mention my old friend honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Graham). He will be back as he also has a rather secure seat. Honourable members opposite caning not win on that score. So what do they have do? They have to manufacture one. They think that they have done so. But they have misunder-known stood the situation. They have read the gallup polls, the public opinion polls, and have found that round about 60 per cent of the people Australia say that the Government should bash the unions; but they have forgotten that we have conin Australia a work force of 6 million people, most of whom belong to unions and most of whom have wives and children.",80
168,Mr BAILLIEU,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"And most of whom you put out who are lis Mr KEITH JOHNSON-They are out of work because of the policies of this anti-worker in aGovernment. But honourable members opposite per have misread the polls. They knew that they not win an election on economic issues so they thought that they would give the unions a bit of a roughing up and a bash. They have failed ablemiserably with the legislation that the Governhas brought into this place. Again I refer to year.the remarks of the honourable member for who is a most esteemed member of the Liberal and Nauonal Country Party coalition. AusHonourable members opposite may not invite the honourable member for Hotham to their beparty meetings but they at least invite the member for Casey. He said earlier today that the policies of the Government of the the day are to be carried out. I wrote after that the notation 'whether they are good or not'. Nobody going to in this chamber is young enough not to it remember the Germany of the 1930s, theriseof in Germany, the rise of the National Socialist Party, theriseof Hitler and the bashing sitting in this down of the unions. Nauonal Mr Groom-The Socialist Party.",81
169,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"I said the National Socialists. There is a bit of a difference. The ofNational Socialist Party is the sort of party to elec-which the honourable member would belong. one of Honourable members will all recall that foroccasion. The people of Germany, who were led out of the wild oppression of the allied forces of the 1914-18 War, all sat down on their and said one after the other 'The law is the law and it must be obeyed'. What has been said to us in this House today? The Government said that no person in Australia, be he a member of parliament or a member of the union, will ever am have therightto question the divinity of this the Government and itsrightto take decisions and impose them on the people of Australia. While walking up the back stairs of this buildtoday my very good friend the honourable to member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) happened to bump into Mr George Polites, whose name is to all honourable members opposite. Mr George Polites said to my friend Mr Willis: 'Have you seen it yet?' My friend, Mr Willis, is a of most honourable man. He does not have the devious sort of mind that I have. He said: 'What am I supposed to have seen?' Mr George Polites said: 'The Bill'. Ralph Willis said: 'What Bill?' Mr George Polites said: 'Oh, the one that is going to knock hell out of the union blokes.' This pened this morning. Since that time by friend Ralph Willis has been busily poking around Minister's office. It is a pity cause he would tell us that this is so.",81
170,Mr HODGMAN,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,He is there.,82
171,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"Where is he? Why member does he not stand up so that I can see him? No, I grounds of am sorry, I am speaking about the Minister. It is law containsappeal. the Minister whom I cannot see when ing up. However, my friend Ralph Willis, the arbitrarily dismissed and lose all their honourable member for Gellibrand, has been busy all day trying to find out what he should have seen.",82
172,Mr HODGMAN,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"He has been flat out.  him. My friend the honourable member for Gellibrand wanted to know what he should have seen. He should have gone and spoken to Peter Costigan of the Melbourne Herald because he knew last night. Nobody bothered to tell member of the Australian Labor Party, Her Majesty's loyal Opposition, what was gomg  the Melbourne Herald. You probably told everyoften body around the town who was not a friend of the Australian Labor Party.",82
173,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,Order! The honourable gentleman will cease addressing honourable members across the chamber and address all his remarks through me.,82
174,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"Sir, I would be despeech he just made. lighted to do so. It is a real delight to see you back in the chair. It has made my night. The Government, Sir, never provided the Opposition with that information. My friend the honourable member for Gellibrand is the accredited spokesservants man for the Labor Party on these issues and he was givenfiveminutes notice about this Bill. was givenfiveminutes to read it before coming into this chamber and replying to it in the debate on its second reading. How long has the Liberal Party had this Bill on ice? I do not expect you tell me that, Sir, but the Liberal Party should us. The Minister for employment and disruption stood in this place for one minute-6 0 clear seconds-explainin g this Bill which has ramificamany tions which I do not think anybody on the Government side of the House really underdeveloped stands. They really do not understand its ramifications. I spoke with a member of the Libunnecessary eral Party tonight. I am not going to name because I think he is intelligent. He made it quite clear to me, as did the honourable member for Canberra (Mr Haslem) tonight, that if this Bill contained no provisions for appeal by any public hapservant or employee of the Commonwealth Government who can be sacked at the whim of the an authority or a Minister-and there is no that he is not here beappeal",82
175,Mr HODGMAN,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,Hogwash !,82
176,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,One honourable says: 'Hogwash'. Let him show me the There are none. The present he is standBill provides norightmore nothing of or notliing less. This appeal. People can be rights.,82
177,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,Order! The honourable member'stimehas expired.,82
178,Mr NEIL,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"This is a clear concise Bill which will help to answer a clear and concise question: Who is running this country, the elected government of the people or Mr arrogant trade union bosses? These arrogant trade union bosses think only of power. They are any concerned only with manipulating their members. In many cases their members do not know on. what is occurring at meetings. The number of of members who attend to vote at many meetings is far below the reasonable percentage that one ought to expect. These men are supported in this Parliament by the pawns they send here as Labor members. The last honourable member who spoke, the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson), aspires to be a Minister of the Crown in a Labor Government. I leave it to the Australian people to judge the content of the The plain fact of the matter is that this Commonwealth Employees (Employment Provisions) Bill has been introduced because public being paid by the public are refusing to serve the public. If they want the right to strike, He something which I support, they have to understand that there is an equally valid principle that applies in our society and that is 'no work, no pay'. When people go on strike they are subject to to the normal law of the land that says that they tell do not get paid. That is all that a stand down means. These stand-down provisions that have developed in the law have not been there for as years as the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) would say. They subject to pressure after pressure that the trade union movement applied. They were in many cases. They breach the orhim dinary common law principle of 'no work, no fan>ay' and they have given-public servants particutreat arly a privileged position in the community and easy freeride.Some honourable members the Opposition side have been talking tonight about dire threats, blackmail, national strikes and the like. They have talked about the O'Shea days. This country took a very serious turn for worse about the time of the O'Shea case and the absorption case. The trade unions got on top in those two cases. It would have been much better if the employers' side had been able to stick to their guns. Then we would not have had this slide into industrial anarchy that has come about. Most honourable members on this side have been going around their electorates for months and knocking on doors. They have been continuation ally asked by the public 'When are you going do something about the unions?' The loss of morale among ordinary decent working people who see what the trade union bosses are doing to this country is serious. This Bill will get us back reasonable and proper principles. Members of the Labor Party have complained about the way this Bill was introduced and I want to say something about that matter. They have had plenty of notice. They were told by this Government some time ago that measures might have to be taken. They know full well that in community tremendous pressure is building up for action to be taken to interfere with therightto strike. I do not agree with that idea but comis munity pressures are building up. Members of the Labor Party know what the country went through during the air traflic controllers' strike. They have known full well that this matter could have come to a head at any time. well when they talk about technicalities associated with the forms of the House that matters listed on the blue paper are listed subject to change. Even supposing that the Bill was brought in in a hurry, members of the Opposition have had six or seven hours to debate it and that is a long time when compared with the time The devoted to many other Bills. Members of the position wasted an hour or more today by indulging in stupid abuses of the parliamentary proceedings. We are concerned with two main principles. One is therightto strike and the other is the right to hire andfire.Other concepts also come into this debate. Security of employment is important but security to the employer is important as How in this day and age, in times ofrisingcosts andrisinginflauon, can employers handle some of these strikes, even those that last only a relatively short ume? Strikes can cripple compames or small businesses. The unions say that they the Government as a bottomless pit. They say: 'We will cut offthe service to the public; we on will reduce the profits of Qantas, of Trans-Australia Airlines, of the Post Office and we will give this Government a hardtime.We will give it economic trouble'. This is all part of the overall the plan of some extreme union leaders who are trying to bring this country into very serious economic stress. The employers are entitled to the ordinary and reasonable protection of the law. It is regrettable that this legislation had to be introduced but the Labor Party has produced no constructive solutions to the problem. All that will happen for most practical purposes is that this legislation will bring the Government situinto line with that of the private employers to who have the right of stand down. Admittedly they have to get an order. Normally they get the order and there is no appeal from it. One of the reasons that it is important to introduce this type to of legislation is that the trade unions have made a mockery of the present stand-down provisions in the law. Employers will say that in some cases you can get a stand down order but in other cases there is a strike on Thursday or Friday and they have to seek an order from the court. They have to employ lawyers at great expense. They nave to our have a hearing before a commissioner or judge and this takestime.All this time the unionists are laughing up their sleeves because the money that drained out of the employers' pocket is affecting his business. The issue gets to the court. The employer find there is an adjournment of the case, All the technical and devious devices of which unionists can think are used. Then the lawThey know full yers get to work.",82
179,Mr WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,That is using the law.,83
180,Mr NEIL,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"I would say that that is legitimate and in accordance with the law. They use every legitimate, technical advantage to get for their members or their clients the best deal they can. result is that often it is impossible to get a Opstand down provision in any reasonable circumstances. Then the unions suddenly decide in the usual classic tradition of some of their ilk-it is one step back or two forward and one back-that they will take a step backwards. They say: 'We have given them a hell of a hardtimefor a couple of weeks. AUright,we wiU call it off. We will go back to work for a while'. This happens at about the time that the stand down order might well. ordinarily be made. These people have abused the Act. They have made a farce ofit. When the honourable member for GelUbrand (Mr WUlis) talks about the provisions in the Act will which presently apply, I remind him of the abuse which certain people have made of the Act and of the fact that once private employers have theirten, right, there is no appeal. The whole problem has arisen because the unions are getting too strong comparative to other sections of the community. People are sick and tired of this situation. They want to know whether the elected government is going to protect them. People talk about union age bashing. The unions have spent so much time Australia bashing that they are deliberately sisting in bringing this country to its knees. ought to talk about unions which indulge in pub-go lic bashing and Australia bashing. I am talking about the leaders of those unions, not the ordiStates. nary worker. It is time-w e are bringing in legisI lation to produce this situation-that the unions were democratised from within. Some of these organisations are dictatorial within their own ranks. The Bill has to be supported. It is based >ally on the ordinary principles of the common ! aw. This is spelt out in clause 5. There is no to stand down a person unless he cannot be understand usefully employed or, as we normally call gainfuly employed. Can any honourable memdoes ber opposite tell me why any employer should have to keep on a man who is Why should the employer not be enutled to say: 'I am not going to pay you today because you producing no work*? We do not realise that only salvation for the economic ills of this country is for increases in wages and costs financed out of an increase in productivity. There is absolutely no other way in which our economic problems can be solved. If we want to have the luxury of either going on strike or of having stand downs because people are not being gainfully employed, then is we have to face the consequences. In my view consequences of this will be very simple. Firstly, the Government has said that only in very grave circumstances will the Act be invoked. So we know that sensible discretion will be exercised. Secondly, the facts of life are that when the aver-by age, good, honest, decent trade unionist realises that he can be stood down because of the actionsemployers of a few who will not throw a few switches somelegislation. where or who will not handle some these few in the specialist areas-and that they have stopped him working for the day and he has to go home without pay, he and his wife will sit down at night and the real effect dictatorial actions of the trade union bosses come home to him. He will say to himself: have to take more interest in my union's affairs'. I hazard a guess that he and his friends will walk across to the union dismptionists and say: 'Lisfellows. You lot had better call this strike ofi* or we want you to answer to us. We will use the power the Government has given in relation to compulsory secret ballots. It is now law. We will get rid of you'. One thing which will beat this country into the ground is apathy. Until the avertrade unionist realises the effect of the actions ofhis leaders, until he has this brought home to ashim and decides that he will do something within We the union to democratise it, we will continue to backwards. This legislation is by no means as strong as comparable legislation in the United shall deal with a couple of points raised by honourable members on the other side of the chamber. They talked about the need for the Minister to be involved. Of course the Minister in circumstances like this must take his proper ministerial responsibility. That is very important. princiThe honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) talked about the involrightvement of the Public Service Arbitrator. As I the situation, it is a conciliation and it, arbitration matter. The honourable member not fully understand what he is talking about. He made aflamboyantspeech on the doing no work? wrong legislation. are There is no way in a democratic community the that a democratically elected government can bring about confrontation which is a much to be vaunted word used by members of the Labor Party. They use it to scare people. Confrontation cannot be initiated by a government. The factual situation is that confrontation arises because of actions taken by trade union leaders. There is no confrontation, no dispute until there is a strike. How can we have confrontation until something initiated in fact. The situation arises because of the the actions of these people. So far not one honourable member opposite has condemned what is happening at Redfern. Not one honourable member whom I have heard in recent times has condemned in any outright terms the strike the air traffic controllers. This legislation is designed to ensure that the ordinary rights of and the law are applied. This is good It will have the support of the vast machinery- majority of Australians.",83

182,Mr BAILLIEU,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,Rubbish.,85
183,Mr LES MCMAHON,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"If they have had time someone has had the Bill half a day before we got it. We received a copy of the Bill this afternoon at 3 o'clock. We have been trying to go through it in order to put up an argument about what the Government is doing to the country. If the Government carries out the provisions in the Bill there will be head-on confrontation. It does not know what it is doing. My interpretation after listening to the honourable member for Canberra (Mr Haslem) is that on principle he has to walk over here tonight and vote against the Government. Otherwise, he said, he would lose his seat. Not only will he lose his seat but also 20 or 25 honourable members on the Government side could lose their seats without the Labor Party going out into the streets to get the people's vote if the election is held in December this year. From the way things are going I suggest that the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street), the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), and I would say the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) have connived with the inner sanctum of the Liberal and Country parties. If they want an election they should say so and not hum and haw. They should take us on now. After next week we will know about the redistribution. We will know what will happen to our seats. If the Government wants to take us on with the moderates and the other people in the trade union movement, then we will go. I am not worried about an election, nor is anybody on this side of the House. The Government is taking us on. It is conniving. It brought down this Bill. not think honourable members have even read the Bill. I had to read it between 6 o'clock and 7 o'clock tonight. No one even knows, at this stage, that this is a Bill for an Act to make provision St with respect to certain matters amcerning ComMail monwealth employees. Clause 4 on page 3 Where persons who are Commonwealth employees into an employing authority are engaged in industrial the employing authority may, by instrument in writdeclare that Commonwealth employees specified in the declarationto say yea The main part follows. The main part states that Commonwealth employees engaged in industrial action may be suspended. Clause 5 on page 3 of the Bill states: Where, by reason of the existence of any industrial action industrial action in which Commonwealth employees are not engaged): (a) persons who are Commonwealth employees in relation to an employing authority cannot be usefully employed; or (b) there is serious disruption to the performance of a function by an employing authority, being a function in connection with the performance of which persons who are Commonwealth employees in relauon to the employing authority are employedThe clause goes on to state that Commonwealth employees affected by the industrial action of other persons may be stood down. Clause 6 deals with salaries, et cetera, not being payable during a period when Commonwealth employees are suspended or stood down. In other words, Commonwealth employees receive no pay at all; they are suspended. Then, we go back to the main part, which is clause 8. It states that the Minister may dismiss when: (a) a Commonwealth employee has been suspended by virtue of a declaration by an employing authority under section 4; (b) the declaration has not been cancelled or otherwise ceased to be in force; and (c) the employing authority or a Minister is of the opinion that it is in the public interest that the powers of the employing authority under this sub-section should be exercised in relation to the employeeIn other words, a Minister can dismiss any employee. But this is not the case only at the Redfern Mail Exchange, where 5 000 employees and their families are involved. I ask: Who wants to go on strike? Which honourable members opposite are members of a trade union? Do they know what it is like to be a union official, to go somewhere at 6 o'clock in the morning and find that employees have taken direct action because they have been forced to do so by the employers, because of the conniving that takes place? I have gone through this. Who wants to call a strike I do when a chap is broke and his family-the wife and the mother-do not have any money? They come down to the union office pleading for some money. Who wants that? But who is causing this situation? Who does not understand it? It is the honourable members from the Liberal and was trying National Country parties who have debate tonight. Would they understand what the He union is about? The honourable member for St result George (Mr Neil) stated that we have legal advisers. We do not have legal advisers. honourable member was arguing that we have be looked after and that we have a trade union training school. The average trade union official comes from the ranks. He needs help. We need concihation and arbitration. What will happen in the future in regard to stocks. concihation and arbitration? through the introduction of the Commonwealth gotten what it is allabout Employees (Employment Provisions) Bill today, conference of the Australian has thrown conciliation and arbitration out the Unions in 3 weeks time will be door. It is completely gone; it isfinished.Why should not the unions unite? If this legislation goes through the Parliament, I will be down there at the mail exchange to lead the men on a principle. The men who have done all the work opposite as union officials over the years, as I, the average the seriousness trade union delegate, the average rank and file agenda and a motion member and the average person who loves employees will be adopted Australia have done, will take sides lation is passed. The Government would not has to worry. What about whom have a clue about what it is doing. If it wants this legislation as an election gimmick, it should say ployees so. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), for Do some reason or other, has a death wish. He will the we sacrifice many young Liberals and the National Country Party-mostl y young Libable members opposite is erals. We know that.",85

185,Mr LES MCMAHON,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"I am very pleased to will be able to say that the Government tonight the honourable member for Canberra should watch whatmembers (Mr Haslem) who stated that he has to cross the members who have been attempting floor on this issue. He has been sacrificed the introduction of this Bill. He did not know ried, too, if I was a oncer. At this stage,beI hope what was going on. Let me give a quotation from just one newspaper. The early edition of Mirror carried an article, under the headline Parhament. 'Mail Strike Truce May Clear up Backlog' and written by Ray Turner, which stated: The Minister for Post and Telecommunications, Robinson, told Federal Parliament Commission would begin stand-downs tomorrow, but this was before the arbitration conference yesterday. Has the Minister forgotten about the arbitration system? What has happened? In other has taken the matter out of the hands of the ciliation and Arbitration Commission. I will quote another point made by Ray Turner: The New South Wales secretary of the Postal communications Union, Mr Merv Hawkins, said the union to get the rosters re-arranged so its members did talked in the not lose any money. said the new rosters proposed by Australia Post would in the employees losmg substantial shift penalty payments. The Why would not the employees be upset? Why to should they be sacrificed? Sometimes there is more support from the National Country Party and the Liberal Party for animals than for people. Truly, honourable members opposite worry so much about their flocks and thenfamily What about the young people and the people? Honourable members opposite The Government, do not even worry them. They have forabout. I point out that the Council of Trade discussing this matter. I think it will be on the agenda.",86

The honourable member will remain silent. words, he Mr LES MCMAHON-The honourable Conmember is soright.But honourable members opposite will not receive an extra vote if they take on the trade union movement. There are responand Telesible people in the trade union movement. The point I am trying to convey on the Bill, which has just been introduced in this House-it is a serious one-is that the Government will sacrifice many of its members. In 3 weeks time the ACTU conquite ference will be endorsing the stand that will be the House: taken by all Commonwealth employees. The Commonwealth employees will be umted. It will extra be the first time they have been united in 50 everybody years. Good luck to them, because we are united scheme over the issue. It is a moral principle. We in the force. Labor movement have differences of opinion a better about how to do things and how not to do them; but, if somebody takes on the trade union ment, he takes on the whole Labor Party side because we are all brothers. The trade union ment is made up of the small people. The Australian Labor Party was formed by the trade union movement in Balmain back in the 1880s, in particular in 1889. It was formed there because there will always be a base for such movement. Honourable members opposite should watch what they are doing. I am very upset and sorry that today the Minister for ployment and Industrial Relations in one introduced legislation that will change industrial relations in Australia. In one minute he threw the second reading speech on the table and said: ' I have the numbers. Take it or leave it'.",86
190,Mr SULLIVAN,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES," I rise to speak on behalf of all country people and to put forward a number of points which I believe critical in this debate. Before I start to do that, must say that I have been totally depressed the contributions, or the lack of contributions, from members of the Opposition. They have used bluster, emotion, invective, threat and the greatest pack of red herrings ever dragged into this House in speaking to a very important issue. Almost every Opposition speaker has said that they have not had sufficienttimeto prepare for this debate. That is absolutely nonsense. Honourable members opposite have had 18 expected months to prepare for this issue. They know and they also know that they are in the greatest bind of alltime.They were caught and they were surprised. They were hoping that this Bill-th Commonwealth Employees (Employment Prothose visions) Bill-woul d be tabled in the Parliament, and that then the issue would be taken to the streets so that they could get some support before they stood up in the House to advance the arguand ments on behalf of the Opposition. Tonight, are not quite certain what to say. So they have put forward some of the worse arguments I ever heard. I was surprised to hear the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) make one of the worse speeches he has ever made in this House. His opinion of public servants, and they are important in this issue, was expressed clearly on 26 April 1977 when he said in If the Australian Public Service is prepared to pay the taxes needed to extend the superannuation benefits to else, I am all for a generous superannuation for every Australian man and woman in the work If they are not prepared to do that, I will oppose any proposal that is put forward by public servants to put them in position than the public they are supposed to serve. That was the hypocritical statement made by the movehonourable member for Hindmarsh this year. move Mr CLYDE CAMERON - I take a point of order, Mr Speaker. You missed the contribution made by the honourable gentleman in which he stated that I had made a hypocritical statement.",87
191,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,I accept the words of the a honourable member for Hindmarsh. I was approached by the honourable member for Denison and did not hear what the honourable Emmember for Riverina said. If he did say those minute words I ask him to withdraw them.,87
192,Mr SULLIVAN,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"I withdraw the word ' hypocritical', Mr Speaker. Let us look at the facts relating to the Redfern Mail Exchange. We have heard the members of the Bleeding Hearts Club in the Opposition trying to describe the inadequate and terrible working conditions of those are who work at that mail exchange. According to I the Commonwealth Bureau of Statistics figures by just printed, the average weekly earnings were $198.70 a week. These workers in the Redfern Mail Exchange have imposed bans because they cannot earn on average an extra $20 a week with overtime. They are prepared to put the whole community at ransom for $20 a week. I represent eople whose incomes this year will average 199 a family a week. The difference is that the employees at the Redfern Mail Exchange are to work fewer than 40 hours a week for it $198 plus $20 overtime, which is an average of $218, whilst the fellow in the country is expected to work 90 hours a week, or even more, for less. e Also, from the money that they earn for working 90 hours a week they have to pay the taxes which pay the wages of those people in the mail exchange at Redfern. Yet the Opposition expects the average person in this country to stand up support it in this case. I suggest that everythey one in the country and every member of the National Country Party, would like the opporhave tunity to speak in support of this Bill.",87
193,Mr LUSHER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,To a man.,87
194,Mr SULLIVAN,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"Yes, to a man. The National Country Party members represent not just the rural community, but the total community in the country, including trade unionists. The whole community is totally in favour of this legislation. That is why the Opposition members are worried. They have read the results of the opinion polls and know full well that the great majority of people are sick and tired of the type of industrial strife that is being caused by a minority. These people intend to stand this situation no longer. Those causing the industrial strife are communists and left-wingers. Again, this is why certain individuals from the Opposition have chosen not to speak in this debate. They are not quite certain of what to say. They do not want to offend those people back in their electorates from whom they need support in the next election. The following appeared in a newspaper recently: A working-class hero is something to be. That referred to the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Young). I heard the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Les MCMahon) speak about the 'little people'. This concerns representative of the 'little people'. The article reads: But he has now moved to an expensive architect designed house on the edge of the only lake in Adelaide, just as Keating lives on the only hill materialists,"" they're called). He's a bit of a gourmet and wine buff; at a famous party he got three dozen vintage up from his wine cellar, got some casks of prawns from the fishermen at Pon Adelaide",87
195,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,Order ! The honourable which gentleman's comments are not relevant to the Bill.,88
196,Mr SULLIVAN,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"I was just trying to reconcile the statement made by the honourable member service for Sydney to the effect that they were the representatives of the 'little people' with that article about one representative of the 'little people', namely, the honourable member for what Port Adelaide. I could go on and give further illustrations of the fact that the Opposition has quite clearly lost contact with the 'little people' of this country. Clearly, this legislation will adopted readily by this House. It will be spokesmen heralded as the greatest thing the Government has done since it came to office. My only major criticism of this Bill is that it comes 18 months late; it should have been the first Bill tabled in the House after we came to office. It is important that I mention that this evening on the Australian Broadcasting Commission news broadcast this matter was reported in interview with the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street). That news item was followed by no fewer than six people speakthe ing against the Minister for Employment and accept Industrial Relations and the purposes of this Bill. That was the Australian Broadcasting Commission's fairhanded treatment of this issue on the night this Bill was tabled in the Parliament! How can we expect the people of this country to gain some understanding of the contents of this Bill if the matter is treated in that way? It was interesting to note also that Mr Slater, when commenting on the actions taken by this Government, lost all track of union matters and quickly got onto a political description of the economy. Do not let it be said that there are no political overtones in the work bans imposed at the Redfern Mail Exchange. Those people are well aware of what they are about. They seek to impose industrial anarchy upon this country because they are controlled by the extremists in the union movement. They will stop at nothing to Port make the better union members in any union kotow to their desires. Unfortunately, not one member of the Opposition has stood in this one House tonight and condemned the action of these employees at the Redfern Mail Exchange or members of any other union where the left wing or the communists are in control. The Australian electorate will clearly see this for what it in Bankstown (""the new Labor is. I return now to the subject of the country reds people and why they are so upset. They expect their public servants to provide a service, for they are employed. This Bill seeks to give no more power to the employer-in this case the Minister-tha n to any other employer in industry. It seeks to give the Minister the right to say to a particular employee if he is not providing the that is required for his pay that he will be stood down or will receive no pay. The Opposition can say nothing against that principle. However it will not support it. Yet that is exactly this Bill proposes. If we extended the argument of the Opposition the Opposition would be against any provision in any Bill that provided a sanction against the law breaker. Why are unionbe ists to be outside the law? The Opposition have not answered that. It is a simple matter of a principle that has been established since the work ethic came into being; that is, if too one does not work one should not get paid. Mr Armitage-It is about time you did some work.",88
197,Mr SULLIVAN,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"It is abouttimethe honouran able member for Chifley (Mr Armitage) did us all a favour and swallowed himself. I have asked him to do that on a number of occasions. He has mouth to perform the feat. If we do not this principle in industrial relations there will be no end to industrial disputes in this country. This Bill does no more than provide the Cohen.

199,Mr SINCLAIR,WOOL INDUSTRY AMENDENT BILL," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purposes of this Bill are twofold. One is amend the Wool Industry Act 1972 to give effect to the Government's decision to continue to tribute in conjunction with the wool industry programs of wool research and promotion. It also contains provisions designed to enable the Australian Wool Corporation to act more effecover tively in the negotiation of freight rates for carriage of wool overseas. Honourable members will recall that in introducing the Wool Industry Amendent Bill 1977 on 26 May last intention of the Government to introduce this further amending legislation during the Budget Session. The Industries Assistance Commission has ported on the results of its enquiries into the funding of rural research and rural promotion and its reports and recommendations have been published. These have been taken fully into account in deciding on future Government fundtween ing arrangements for wool research and for wool promotion. The Government has accepted the recommendation of the Industries Assistance Commission that some 60 per cent of the programs of continuhandling ing wool research now supported in the CSIRO and the Bureau of Agricultural Economics by strength expenditure from the Wool Research Trust Fund Jones, Charles Keating. P.J. be funded in future from Consolidated Revenue. There are sound reasons for direct and complete Martin, V.J. Government funding of this core research, which Morris, P. F. has potential benefits for many industries, including some outside the rural sphere. Wallis. L.G. Whitlam, Antony The intention is that this transition take place during thisfinancialyear. Government contribuWillis, R. tions to wool research, totalling $11.5m, will be Young, M.

Johnson, Les for CSIRO and BAE to meet the cost of certain projects previously supported from the Wool Research Trust Fund. Connor, R. F. X. Nichols. M.H. Total funding of wool promotion will continue to be shared by wool growers and the Government. In a period where inflationary tendencies have been rampant the old triennial funding arrangement has proved unsatisfactory. Future governmentfinancingof wool promotion will be reviewed annually. The review will decide on the (No. 2) 1977 level of support for the followingfinancialyear and, to assist in the forward planning of promotional programs, will provide an indicative level of support for the following two years. Second Reading Clauses 3, 5, 6, and 7 of the Bill I am now presenting provide for the new arrangements for the funding of wool research and promotion. The actual amounts of Government grant for wool to research and promotion will in future be provided by annual Parliamentary appropriation. conHonourable members will recall that the Budget to provides $31.4m as the Government's contribution for the currentfiscalyear for wool research and promotion. This is an increase of some $ 10m 1976-77. Latest estimates are that the comthe ponent of the tax on shorn wool representing wool growers' contributions for research and promotion will bring in a similar sum to that proI stated the vided by the Government. I should point out that the programs of wool research and promotion which the new arrangerements will fund will continue to be subject to close consultation between the various research organisations, the International Wool Secretariat and the Australian Wool Corporation. As in the past, there will continue to be consultation be the Australian Wool Industry Conference and the Minsiter for Primary Industry on the detailed annual funding arrangements. Clause 4 of the Bill gives the Corporation authority to set conditions for the carnage and of wool for export by sea. The powers are designed to improve the Corporation's in the negotiation of freight rates and to promote commercial economies in the movemember ment of Australia's wool exports. The Government is determined to achieve close co-ordination over a range of cargoes negotiation of freight rates so that Australia maintain the best possible bargaining position. To this end, and in consultation with the Minister for Transpon (Mr Nixon), I will be mforming the Australian Wool Corporation of the prinbers ciples and policies which the Government regards as appropriate to be applied and folstates lowed in any freight negotiations the Corporratifications ation undertakes. These will be designed to ensure that marine freight rates and services all commodities are determined to the advantage of Australia's rural industries and, of course, Australia's producers. There is no need for any concern in the that the use of the Corporation's powers might upset existing Conference anangements without offsetting advantages emerging. Let me assure honourable members that anangements estabgiving lished between the Minister for Transport and me will ensure that the new powers being given to the Wool Corporation are exercised in a ner which will be to the advantage of the AusThis tralian wool trade and to exporters generally. commend the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Scholes) adjourned. NA Bill presented by Mr Nixon, and read a first time.",90
200,Mr NIXON,AIR NAVIGATION AMENDMENT BILL," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Convention on International Civil Aviation drawn at Chicago in 1944 provides for the estabThe lishment of the International Civil Aviation to Organisation, known as ICAO, which came into being in 1947. It is a specialised agency of the United Nations. The permanent governing body of ICAO is the Council, which has contributed a very important way to the development adoption of international standards and ommended practices for civil aviation. These assist considerably towards making international air travel a safe and reliable mode of transport. Members of the Council are elected by Assembly of the Organisation, at which all conBUl. tracting states are entided to be present. The Council, of which Australia has been an elected since ICAO came into being, meets in almost continuous session throughout each year. The size of the Council was increased from 21 in the members to 27 members in 1962 and from 27 may members to 30 members in 1971. The 21st Session of the Assembly held at Montreal in 1974 adopted a Protocol amending Article 50 (a) of the Convention to increase the number of memof the Council from 30 to 33. This amendment requires ratification by 86 contracting before it comes into force. Fifty-two had been received from states at 1 July 1977. More ratifications from other states for are expected before the 22nd Assembly convenes best in Montreal on 13 September 1977. The purpose of this Bill is to obtain parliamentary approval for Australia to ratify the Protocol. trade Parliament approved the ratification of the Chicago Convention in 1947 by an amendment to the Air Navigation Act 1920 and authorised the making of regulations for carrying out and effect to the Convention. Subsequent protocols amending the original Chicago Convention were approved in amendments to the Air manNavigation Act in 1960, 1961, 1963 and 1971. Bill continues the practice and proposes the I insertion of the Protocol as the Ninth Schedule to the Air Navigation Act 1920. An increase of three in the size of Council is appropriate. Total membership of ICAO grew from 84 states in 1961 to 129 member states in 1977 October 1974 and is now 140 states. Proportionate increases have been made over the years in the size of the executive bodies of other specialised agencies of the United Nations. It Second Reading was the clear wish of the majority of member at the last Session of the Assembly that Council membership should be increased to 33 members. The Australian Delegation to that Assembly supported the proposal. increase in the ICAO Council is expected add Uttle, if any, to the secretarial costs of the Organisation. Any costs for such services should be absorbed in the normal provisions of this service and would be offset by the rentals which in would be paid by the new members for the use of and delegation oifice space in the ICAO Headrecquarters Building. The present Australian Government contribution to the International CivU Aviation Organisation would be only fractionally increased, if at aU, by the addition of the three members to the Council. I commend the Debate (on motion by Mr Morris) adjourned. NA COMMISSIONS (TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) AMENDMENT BILL 1977 Bill presented by Mr Eric Robinson, and read afirsttime.",91
201,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,POSTAL AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Prior to the establishment of the Postal and Telecommunications Commissions, it was agreed with unions and staff associations that officers of the then Postmaster-General's Department should not suffer reduced promotional opportunities as a consequence of being allocated to the service of one or other of the commissions. The arrangement agreed to was that, for the five years after the establishment of the commissions, either commission should be able to promote to a position in its service an officer in the service of the other commission; and any officer in the service of either commission should be able to appeal against any promotion to a position in the service of either of the commissions. The Promotions Appeal Boards of the two commissions have acted on the basis that section 20 of the Postal and Telecommunications Commissions (Transitional Provisions) Act 1975 gives effect to the agreed arrangements. Recent legal advice is that the section is more limiting application and denies the right of appeal in certain circumstances.

The Bill extends the range of the present scale upwards so that the impact is upon commercial broadcasters with gross earnings exceeding $4m per annum. The variation of the scale of fees in this manner means that the new scale of fees will affect only a very small number of commercial radio Second Reading broadcasting stations. The effect on licensees is quite minimal, but the Government decided to retain parity between the scales of licence fees payable by both radio and television licensees.

Before the debate is resumed on this Bill I would like to suggest it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill, the Diesel Fuel Tax (No. 2) Amendment Bill and the Liquefied Gas (Road Vehicle Use) Tax Amendment Bill as they are associated measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest, therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of the three Bills to be discussed in this debate.",93
209,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TELEVISION STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering the three measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",93
210,Mr KEATING,TELEVISION STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"These Bills give legislative effect to measures announced by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) in his Budget Speech on Tuesday evening last. Basically the Bills increase the duty on refined petroleum products, diesel fuel and liquid petroleum gas. In the case of diesel fuel, the increase in excise duty will be in the quarter of a cent per Utre or about 1.13c per gallon and with liquid petroleum gas the increase in excise is of the order of one-eighth of a cent per Utre or .56c per gallon. This seems inconsequential though these measures will raise substantial amounts of additional revenue this financial year. This approach by the Government will not in any significant way change the pattern of energy consumption by industries that use these fuels. Rather, the measure is designed more as a revenue raiser for the Government than it is an integral part of any comprehensive energy policy. Since taking office the Government has had a number of reports from the Royal Commission on Petroleum presented to it. The Sixth Report on the use of liquefied petroleum gas in Australia has not yet been acted upon and these measures in no way give effect to the recommendations of the Commission in respect of Uquefied petroleum gas usage. It is a tragic fact that Australia's quite large production of liquefied petroleum gas is not being used domestically to conserve indigenous crude oil particularly the light end fractions. There is no real domestic market for Uquefied petroleum gas in Australia and this has been caused basically by the fact that discriminate pricing policies have been a disincentive to producers as an inducement to creSecond Reading ate a domestic market. The Budget does nothing about correcting this problem yet the Treasurer attempted to argue that this increase in excise will be a mitigating factor against the profligate use of these fuels. Rather than discourage the use of liquefied petroleum gas in Australia the Government should be encouraging it and it should be attempting to make liquefied petroleum gas more attractive to the consumer as a substitute for refined motor spirit. WhUe this will necessitate the increase in the price to producers aU the increase in excise can do is act as an inhibitant to the growing proportion of Uquefied petroleum gas usage. It is because these measures are unrelated and not part of a broader domestic energy policy but rather as a simple revenue raising device that the Opposition must oppose these three BUls. Higher energy costs, which can act as a conservation measure, can only do so if other energy options are available to consumers, or in the case of transport, if other transport facUities are avaUable as an alternative to excessive consumption of motor spirit by motor cars and trucks. As well as that, at thistimeI believe one can argue that there should be no additional inflationary burden levied upon the Australian pubUc. And of course, to add insult to injury the Government will probably argue before the Arbitration Commission that the Commission should disregard increases in indirect taxes in its wage determinations as it did with the Medibank levy and as it will do with the effects of order of a these three pieces of legislation. Already excise duty accounts for a large proportion of total Commonwealth receipts. In the last financial year excise duty, as distinct from sales tax and customs duty, amounted to $2,485 bUlion in the total receipt picture for the Commonwealth of $21,384 bUlion. In fact last year excise duty collections equalled just on 30 per cent of net personal income tax pay-as-you-earn collections. It should not be the Government's role to increase the indirect tax burden but rather to reduce it. These measures are no more than tax raising devices sold under the guise of energy policy. In the absence of any comprehensive approach to energy matters the Government's explanation in support of the measures cannot be accepted.",93
211,Mr YATES,TELEVISION STATIONS LICENCE FEES," I would like briefly to enter this debate and say that I took the opportunity to visit the Gas and Fuel Corporauon of Victoria at Dandenong and examine with some interest the future of our gas and petrol problems. I would have thought that the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Fife), in dealing with the subject of liquid gas, would have drawn attention to the need for the nation to consider most carefully a fuel policy which advocates the basic gas reduction process which is at present untapped. The use of fuel gas in cars and in other forms of transport is obviously advantageous on 3 grounds. First, there would be less pollution; secondly, we have an abundant quantity of this resource; and, thirdly, it is ter material for us to use in terms of any policy we have concerning the conservation of our fossil fuels. Although I accept the Government's reasons for the need to increase the tax on diesel fuel would have thought there would have been doubt at all that in future the Government should give very serious consideration to utilising our reserves of gas fuel which could be used cars. Indeed, I would go further and suggest that in the next Budget every form of encouragement should be given to people who convert their hicles from fuel oil or petrol fuel propulsion. Australia has sufficient reserves of fuel gas that could be used for this purpose. Therefore, it would seem to me that it is not necessary to increase the tax on fuel gas at this (Mr time. The Government may have reasons for doing so. But I would suggest, as a long term icy, that it is essential that every industrialist, every person concerned with the motor industry and, above all, the Government, should give imshouldbreak mediate consideration to what we are doing with the reserves we possess. Therefore, even though the legislation may be valuable, though it may be desired and though it may be needed to raise revenue, I would suggest that this nation should pay very careful attention to what is happening in the world fuel economy and ensure that we the resources we have. Therefore, the more we transfer to the use of liquid gas and fuel gas better. I do not want to take thetimeof the House. I have made a point which is well understood all those who work in the Australian Gas Association; it is well understood by anyone who has any basis of strategy in this area. Therefore, the sooner we use fuel gas in place of diesel oil the better. I support the Government. However, I am just saying that this is a serious subject which should not be discussed at thistimeof night but should be a point of major debate on the conservation and preservation of our fuel resources.",94
212,Mr CHARLES JONES,TELEVISION STATIONS LICENCE FEES," I shall be very brief in my remarks. I am concerned about the proposed increase in the tax on the liquefied gas used for propelling road vehicles. I admit that it is only a very small increase. It is unfortunate that in the world today there is a very severe and serious pollution problem. Man has had to attach to his motor vehicle new gadgets which cost a lot of money to buy and are expensive to install. A lot of money has been spent on experimentation on these gadgets. The cost of that experimentation and the cost of a bet- the manufacture of these gadgets is now being passed on to the motorist. These gadgets are necessary to overcome the serious pollution problems that exist in the central business districts of our cities. We know that in certain parts of Sydney, for example, a carbon monoxide level I of aboutfivetimesthat which the World Health no Organisation regards as a safe level can be found. Yet here we find the Government is continuing to levy a tax on this fuel, which is one of in the few fuels that are almost completely and totally free of pollution. Instead of increasing the tax levied the Government should have been velooking at how it could be eliminated propulsion to gas completely. I have noted that the Minister for Transport Nixon), the Minister for National Resources (Mr Anthony) and other members of the Minispoltry have been stating recently that we should be looking towards conserving our petrol by removing the gadgets that have been attached to cars to down the level of pollution. What we be doing is providing money to enable further experimentation to be carried out into the uses of liquefied gas and into the use of alternative means of propelling a motor vehicle. Maybe some form of electric car, steam driven car or some other mode of transport can be use experimented with, developed and devised by the scientists in the motor vehicle industry today. the A lot of garbage has been dished out by the Government in the Budget about how the price of fuel has had to be increased by a little over 1 lc a gallon, and how it will go on increasing year by by year by an ever-increasing amount, to protect our fossil fuels. What we should be doing is engaging in greater experimentation in the use of this form of fuel and the others to which I have referred. In this way we would protect the very rapidly dirrunishing source of fuel and at the same time overcome the problem of pollution in the cities. If I were a countiy voter I would be greatly concerned about the fact that I have to buy a motor vehicle that has these gadgets attached to it to overcome the problems of the cities. But how would it be possible to build two types of motor vehicle, one with an engine that has the attachments and one with an engine without the attachments and say that car A can be driven only in certain areas and car B can be driven anywhere. That would mean that the buyer of a motor car in a country area would not be able to drive to, say, Sydney; if he were coming south to Sydney from the northern section of New South Wales he would not be able to come into the area south of the Hawkesbury River or east of the Blue Mountains or north of Port Hacking. To become involved in such a scheme would be too complicated. The fact of the matter, as I have just said, is that we should not have had to get ourselves into the present situation. Much more work should have been done on the provision of an alternative means of public transport or the use of other means of propelling a motor car. It really disappoints me to see this happening. It is difficult to follow the Government's reasoning in relation to the increase in the price of fossil fuel. We have before us a Budget that legedly has been put together to curtail inflation or to cut back on the rate of inflation. Hell has been belted out of the people of this country by this Government over the last 20 months with its phoney policy of curtailing inflation and its ation of the largest pool of unemployment to the which this country has ever been subjected. Show me one industry that will not be affected this Government's decision to increase the price of crude oil to the consumer. No matter what industry one likes to refer to one will find transport is involved in it. The transport industry will be expected carry this additional burden. have noted in the Press that the airlines are ing that the increase in the price of crude oil will bring about an increase in the price of air travel. have also noted that the Government is not doing anything about air navigation charges. That is unfortunate because that is an area which it should be having a real look. There is under-payment by the industry. The GovernCustoms ment is to increase the lighthouse dues charged to the maritime industry but not to increase charges to the airlines. Sir Reginald Ansett certainly wields a great influence in the Cabinet of this country. I come back to the point that, as far as inflation is concerned, the tragedy is that the Government is not sincere in what it is doing and in the policies it is pursuing. The increased cost to the transport industry must be passed right through the economy. It does not matter what form of transport is involved. By increasing the cost of fuel the Government is automatically increasing the cost of freight which in turn is passed on to the consumer. In conclusion, I regret that the Government has not had sufficient foresight to deal in a practical way with liquefied gas and that it has not actually reduced the tax on it instead of increasing it.",94
213,Mr OKEEFE,TELEVISION STATIONS LICENCE FEES," I rise to support the three measures before the House, namely, the Diesel Fuel Tax (No. 1) Amendment Bill, the Diesel Fuel Tax (No. 2) Amendment Bill and the Liquefied Gas (Road Vehicle Use) Tax Amendment Bill. The purpose of the two diesel fuel Bills is to increase by one-quarter of a cent per litre-fro m 4.905c to 5.15c per litre-the tax imposed on diesel fuel under the Diesel Fuel Tax Act (No. 1) 1957 and the Diesel Fuel Tax Act (No. 2) 1957. The new rates are to apply from 17 August. Customs and excise duties are not payable on diesel fuel if it is used othewise than in propelling road vehicles for use on a public road. However, the Diesel Fuel Tax Act (No. 1) 1957 provides that where such diesel fuel is sold or otherwise disposed of to a person alwho is not the holder of a certificate from the Minister certifying that the holder requires the fuel for use other than in propelling a vehicle on a public road a tax is imposed. That is referred to in sections 3 and 6 of the Act. The Diesel Fuel creTax Act (No. 2) 1957 makes similar provisions if diesel fuel is used by a certificate holder for propelling a road vehicle on a public road. That by is provided for in sections 3 and 5. Because diesel fuel purchased by certificate that holders and subsequently used for propelling road vehicles has been cleared from customs and I excise and is therefore outside the ambit of the sayCustoms Tariff Act and the Excise Tariff Act, these Acts are necessaiy to ensure that all diesel I fuel eventually used for propelling road vehicles on public roads is taxed at the same rate as the relevant customs and excise duties. The duties at under the Customs Tariff Act 1966 and the an Excise Tariff Act 1921 are to be increased by Tariff Proposals No. 24 (1977 and Excise TariffProposals No. 2 (1977), which were the introduced in the House of Representatives on 16 August by the Minister for Business and Conwe sumer Affairs (Mr Fife). The Bills provide consequential increases in the rates of tax imposed by the Diesel Fuel Tax Act (No. 1) and the Diesel Fuel Tax Act (No. 2) of 1957. The Liquefied Gas (Road Vehicle Use) Tax reserves Amendment Bill provides for an increase of oneeighth of a cent per litre in the present tax of 2c If per litre on liquefied gas used for propelling road approximately vehicles. The mcrease will apply on and from 17 use August 1977. Turning to the Bill, item 17c in the Schedule to the Excise Tariff end fractionssuch 1921 provides for a duty of 1.26c most liquefied petroleum gas obtained from unstabilised crude petroleum oil or from naturally occurring petroleum gas. However, there are no customs or excise duties on liquefied gas which is the end product of a refinery process. After taking into account a number of factors, stock including environmental considerations, the then to Treasurer, the Hon. Frank Crean, announced in require his 1974-75 Budget Speech that a tax on turn will liquefied petroleum gas used in propelling road vehicles but not for other purposes was to be subGovernment ject to tax. A tax was imposed used in propelling road vehicles by the Liquefied Gas (Road Vehicle Use) Tax Act of 1974 than an excise duty, presumably because excise for its creation. Indeed, it may bepositive duties are imposed on the producdon rather than vert large parts of Bass Strait reserves away on the use of a product and because it was administrattvely easier. A report by the Bureau of Transport Economics entitled 'Liquid reserves Petroleum Gas as a Motor Vehicle Fuel' in April policies 1974 and the sixth report of the Royal Commission on Petroleum entitled 'The Use of eficial Liquefied Petroleum Gas in Australia 1974' discussed the relevant considerations for this tax. The rate of tax was set which was 40.7 per cent of the rate of duty on benefit of motor spirit at that time. However, when the an initial base then Treaurer announced the tax at thattimehe exports against load announced that for at leastfiveyears the liquefied petroleum gas would be increased by an amount equivalent to one half of any increase in the rate of duty on motor spirit. In line with strong this commitment this Bill increases the tax on dedication liquefied gas for road use by half the amount by national hydrocarbons which customs and excise duties on have been increased, as foreshadowed in the sumed by the Australianits 1977-78 Budget Speech and contained in Cusrationale behind such a policy recognised toms TariffProposals No 24, 1977, and Excise Australian TariffProposals No. 2 introduced in the House of Representatives on 16 August 1977 by the Minisoverwhelmingly ter for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Fife). Liquefied petroleum gas in Australia must of tremendous advantage to this country because are rapidly running out of gasoline supplies. for When one travels overseas, particularly in America, one sees the use of liquid petroleum gas in farm tractors and road vehicles. J. think it has a future in this country. Estimated Australian 80 years' of liquid petroleum gas are sufficient for supply at the present rate of extraction. used within Australia this would permit 14 per cent of motor vehicles to be converted to liquid petroleum gas. Increased in Australia ought to be in high form value background to this applications as the replacement of the light produced from crude oil. Fuel oil per litre on replacement by LPG merely in one product for another. substitutes a surplus As the Royal Commission on Petroleum Products indicated in its earlier reports, because of the increase of imported crude oil as refinery feed it is the Ught end products which are going be expensive and in short supply.

Even if the Australian the Bass felt disposed to turn a large part of Strait production of LPG into the domon liquefied gas estic market there for greatly increasedis supply.at the moment no demand Such demand will rather take time to generate and needs too late policies to difrom the export market. But as already indicated, new of LPG will be coming on stream in the short and medium term. Now is thetimewhen must be formulated for the most benexploitation of these wonderful resources. The Royal Commission suggested with regard to both LPG and natural gas that a major objective of policy should aim to ensure the maximum initially at 2c per litre usable consumption of the resources for the Australian industry, using exports as and gradually trading off tax on ternal demand builds up.consumption domestic as inindigenous crude oil, Australia has pursued toa With respect policy. and definite if sometimes inappropriate At the centre of this policy lies the implicit of crude oil hydrocarbons to the needs.

Our domestic shipping is notably expensive. Even our cities are sprawling aggregations. All these things place a high premium on transportation hydrocarbons. Only LPG is a feasible stitute for motor spirit between now and 1990. Granting all the dedication that successive governments have applied to the national retenthat tion of indigenous crude oil no part of any dedication seems to have been applied to LPG. A large part of the nation's crude oil reserves have year after year been exported as if they were self renewing. Liquefied petroleum gas could be the saviour of this country. It could the place of liquid petroleum in the years ahead. There are a lot of problems to be solved in this Leaders-Quarantine field but we are very fortunate to have it here.

Canberra motels in the Flag Inns chain, the Banjo Patterson Motor Inn, Forrest Lodge Motor Inn and the Lyneham Motor Inn, would also mcrease their tariffs. The group's bookings officer in Canberra, Mrs Angela Beckett, said yesterday that during the Games, there would be a minimum tariff of $30 Flag Inns' travel directory rooms in Canberra Flag Inn Motels as between $21 and $22.50, and for double rooms, between $22 and $26. Mrs Beckett said that where the tariff exceeded $30 for a room during the Games, the normal rates would apply. Tariffs at the Lakeside Rex Hotel and Travelodge motels would notrisebecause of the Games, spokesmen from the hotels said yesterday. Bookings were almost full at each of these hotels.",97
216,Mr CHARLES JONES,HOTEL TARIFFS UP FOR GAMES,"I thank the House. I refer briefly to the contents of this Press statement. It states: The Belconnen Way Hotel tariff for double room accommodation for a night wouldrisefrom $23.50 to $35 while the Games were on, a spokesman for the hotel said yesterday. It goes on to say that there will be a minimum tanff of $30 a night for either a single or double room. That means that in some hotels which at the present time are charging $21 the tariff will increase to $22.50. I did not believe that that article could be true; so I checked it out. Much to my honor I found that it was true. The organisers of the Games are concerned about the situation. This, to me, is a clear case of exploitation. We have a captive audience. People are coming to Canbena from overseas. They will come here and be slugged-that is the only way I can describe it-by some of the hotels in this thing which amused me was the statement: The extra housemaids, receptionists and bar-staff needed to handle the large number of people expected at the hotel during the Games was the reason for the tariff increase. My knowledge of business is just the reverse. Freddie Laker says that if we will allow him to put on cheap nights he will stuff the aircraft full of people and then cut the fares in half. Qantas Airways Ltd and a number of other airlines, by following the self same policy of cramming the people in and reducing the fares, have obtained economies of scale and have been able to cut air fares severely. So the opposite should be the situation. I checked the matter out with the Prices Commissioner. He told me that hotel and motel accommodation is not controlled under the prices regulations 1949. But all it requires is for the Minister for the Capital Tenitory (Mr Staley) to make a declaration and the prices controller is then in a position to investigate the prices being charged. If they are found to be unreasonable he can, I believe, direct that they be reduced in a morereasonablelevel. I call on the Minister lor the Capital Territory, between now and the time these people will come here, to conduct a full and detailed inquiry into the matter and to determine what the tariffs should be. This country is trying on every room, single or double. to expand its tourist trade. One of the major gives the normal rate for single causes for the falling off of tourists to this country has been the exorbitant increases in hotel accommodation tariffs. People will not come here if they are being exploited as these people will be. International Hotel, the Canberra They will come here, but they will say: 'Before we came here the tariff was $20 a night. They slugged us $30 a night. For God's sake, keep away from that place'. I am afraid that that will be the attitude of people who come here, once they get stung by this exorbitant increase in tariffs. I call upon the two Ministers concernedthe Minister for the Capital Territory and the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Senator Cotton)-wh o is an another place and who is responsible for tourism, to do something positive. At this stage they should investigate the matter and do the right thing by the people. The Minister for the Capital Territory should bring down a declaration broadening the scope of the prices commissioner",98

Northern Suburbs Crematorium, Sydney. Plaque in 30.7.1947 wall (Section 3YX). Even the Crematorium was unaware that he was there. It is a usual type niche and he is placed next to Lady Cook. It is cared for by his granddaughter. No mention of his having been a P.M. and only reference to his decorations. No one would know who he was. Northern Suburbs Cemetery, Sydney.

My inquiries have not found any plaque to record the fact that his ashes were spread over Lake Burley Griffin. Considering his proBritish attitudes, his remains wishes come as a surprise.

220,Mr DONALD CAMERON,HOTEL TARIFFS UP FOR GAMES,"I thank the House. As a matter of interest, I refer to the that this afternoon I released a Press statement which I highlighted the neglect which these former giants presently suffer. In some cases there is not even mention of the fact that they were Prime Ministers. I telephoned a cremato torium and it was surprised to learn that Sir Joseph Cook was in fact interred in that torium. The people did not even know he was there. Another sad case is the grave of Ben Chifley. Mr Deputy Speaker, do you know who maintains that grave? No, you do not. It is mainspread tained by the Bathurst branch of the Australian Labor Party. I do not believe that a party organisation should have to bear the responsiremains,figurativelyspeaking, bility of caring for the remains of a former Prime Minister. The costs and the responsibihty of caris ing for these graves surely should be the reGriffin sponsibility of the Federal Government. I am pleased to advise the House that in some nut shell, cases because of the original quality of the stones matter over the graves those graves have withstood deserves neglect My friend the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Graham) very kindly, ing my request, visited the grave of Billy Hughes. The honourable member was very happy to Order! report to me not only that the gravestone contamed a reference to the fact that Billy Hughes was a Prime Minister but also that the grave in very good condition. But regrettably grave is not typical of all. Some graves bear reference to the fact that these people were Prime Ministers. Some are forgotten and neglected. There are two in England, namely, that of Andrew Fisher, a Labor Party Prime Minister, and that of Sir George Reid. I have already spoken to the daughter of Andrew and Fisher",100

I spoke to the daughter of in Andrew fisher with a request that she check with her family to see whether it was the wish of Andrew Fisher that he be interred in England. He died SO years ago. It may well be appropriate return his remains to Australia, the land which he led. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr cremaJames) interjected and asked: 'What about Stanley Melbourne Bruce?'. I claim that I am probably one of the few Australians who know that his final wish was for his remains to be over Lake Burley Griffin. That is where they are. His remains are closer to Canberra than those of any of our former Prime Ministers. His arejust down the street. I think it is an appalling shame that there not even a plaque on the shores of Lake Burley to commemorate the fact that the remains of one of Australia's controversial and most able Prime Ministers were spread over the Lake. In a so far as I am concerned, it does not whether a Prime Minister was a good or bad Prime Minister. He was Prime Minister and proper recognition. follow Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Lucock)expired. The honourable member's time has",100
223,Mr SCHOLES,HOTEL TARIFFS UP FOR GAMES,"I raise a was matter tonight about which I think every memthat ber of the Parliament would be concerned. no Those honourable members who take an interest in the Notice Paper will have noted that at the moment there are a number of questions on notice in the name of the honourable member for Canning (Mr Bungey) relating to matters concerning the PubUc Service in Western Australia a Mr Toomer, a quarantine officer. The matter is currently the subject of, I think, a second or third investigation, in this case a PubUc Service inquiry. The Coombs Royal Commission into Australian Public Service m fact recommended an independent inquiry. As the former Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) said in this House during the last session, there are no means by which such an inquiry can be established. But some of the facts surrounding this case need even further investigation. I think that they would place in the minds of honourable members, if they applied themselves to the matter, serious doubts about the whole of the operations of the Austraha's quarantine services. The Toomer case is a classic example of clashes of personalities. The end result was that during an actual mquiry into this gentleman's activities, a situation arose in which the department against which he has appealed on a number of occasions and into whose activities, relative to himself and his activities, the inquiry being conducted, has seenfitto call the gentleman concerned on duty during days when hearings were held and on which he was required to give evidence. The evidence suggests harassment. Yesterday, as a result of a public statement he made in which he disclosed that certain articles which had entered Australia in postal form without having been opened or examined were found to be infested, he was charged with making statements about these products and was fined a couple of hundred dollars. The recommendation of the department is that he be dismissed. But I make the point that these charges were laid while the gentleman concerned was the subject of an inquiry into the whole of the affair. The inquiry was established by a Minister of this Parliament and was announced in this Parliament. I do not want to concentrate on the rights or wrongs of that case or the activities of the department. The matter I want to deal with is, I think, far more serious-the quarantine service itself. I beheve that there is sufficient evidence at least to suggest that that service should be given an independent statutory role or should be attached to a department other than the Department of Health which would seem to me to have primary functions which have little relevance to quarantine or the type of work which customs officers carry out. Certainly, any breakdown in the quarantine services in Australia would be total disastrous for substantial sections of primary industry, especially in the livestock areas. The Government has this year failed to fund the National Animal Health Research Laboratories. This means that any breakdown in quarantine would lead to an immediate closing off of markets to Australia for Australian exports of meat or whatever other product was involved. It would also mean that until eradication was proven, we could not export our products. We have no facilities for proving eradication in Austraha at the moment. We would have to depend on overseas facihties-possibl y European facilities-to do so. That is very difficult to do with live animals or even carcasses. The cost to rimary industry in Austraha could be up to 50m a month while eradication was proven. I make a plea to the Government to reconsider this problem, especially as I think the Government has allocated far more money to the off-shore quarantine station than it can spend in this financial year. I say this particularly as I doubt that the Government has yet even negotiated for a site with Mr Clunies Ross. I put it to the Government that it should be looking closely at that problem. is The National Animal Health Laboratories design team will be disbanded because there is no money to carry on their work. The quarantine services in Australia are in serious jeopardy.",100
224,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HOTEL TARIFFS UP FOR GAMES,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,101
225,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,HOTEL TARIFFS UP FOR GAMES," I merely want to bring one small matter to the attention of the House and make comment on the events that occurred this week. Their significance will be projected forward both politically and industrially. I refer to the amalgamation of the Austrahan Workers Union and the Building Workers Industrial Union within the New South Wales jurisdiction. That amalgamation was effectively consummated last Monday night when, by a vote of eight to four on the executive, it was decided that the amalgamation should occur. The amalgamation was proposed by a vote on the executive in terms of the New South Wales Act which allows such an amalgamation to occur without any reference whatsoever to the rank and file members of either union. This does concern Australia and it will certainly concern New South Wales in the period immediately ahead. Within the Federal jurisdiction, we know that there has to be a reference of such a matter to the rank and file members of unions and there has to be a vote of 50 per cent of the members of the union. Half of them at least have to agree for the amalgamation to occur. The tragedy is that there has been no such reference in this case. Those who speak about amalgamations of unions so glibly without reference to the rank and file membership will have cause to ponder the significance of their suggestions and their proposals in the years ahead. Certainly, that will be the case in New South Wales. I suggest that some parts of this amalgamation will be very imporwill tant for Austraha because through it attempts will be made to change the federal structure the Australian Workers Union. The Australian Workers Union has had great respect in Australia. But it is also strategically placed in its members are concerned vitally with many Australia's export industries, including many Australia's great bulk export industries. I am referring to coal, iron ore, sugar and so on. Consequently, there will have to be a very watch to see that this amalgamation does not beexpired. come a method whereby the new New South Wales State union does not have the opportunity of an inflated membership to dominate the federal structure of the Australian Workers Union. There will be other effects not only within Australian Council of Trade Unions. Some BWIU men will subsequently be part of an porters AWU delegation to the Australian Council of Trade Unions. There will be changes within New South Wales branch of the Australian done Labor Party. That is its problem. But the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party over the years has buUt a great respect Australia because of the balance it has had. both for it and for Australia. I say this quite cerely lest that balance be upset. I put it higher than that. Mr Armitage-Eve n after the amalgamation, it wUI stiU be a very balanced union, and you know it. This will be in the best interests of umon members.",101
226,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,HOTEL TARIFFS UP FOR GAMES,"A number of people will have an opportunity to be part of that delegation from New South Wales under the unions banner of the AWU. They previously would not have been part of the delegation sheltering under that very respected name of the Australian Workers Union. But I do not want to get into fight concerning the position of the Australian Labor Party. I merely say that the industrial movement in that State and the ACTU will both be altered by a change in the balance that occurred with respect to this union. I merely legislauon. quote the words of the State Secretary of the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association in New South Wales, Mr ONEILL, who, in protesting about the manner in which that amaling gamation was accepted, said to the packed ing at the Sydney Trades HaU last night: You are the union. You pay our wages. You should have say. Of course, the men did not have a say in what occurred. I bring this matter to the attention the House because what is predicted to happen effect this country in the days ahead. Above aU, without retreating from the proposition for of one second we say that when amalgamations hi unions occur the men in the unions which are amalgamated should have a say. In the amalgathat mation of unions into a body which subsequently of will have assets of $5m and an income of $ 1.5m of there was no rank orfilesay whatsoever.",102
227,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HOTEL TARIFFS UP FOR GAMES,Mr Lucock)close Order! The honourable member's time has,102
228,Mr LES JOHNSON,HOTEL TARIFFS UP FOR GAMES,"It seems to me that the honourable member for LUley (Mr Kevin Caims) wants to have his cake the and eat it too. He wants the best of both worlds in this instance. Incessantly Government suptalk about the fragmentation of the union movement, yet when some effort is made to conthe soUdate it in a contemporary way, as is being in other parts of the world, they adopt this reactionary attitude. They raise any kind of opposition at all that will cast some slur over the in trade umon movement. The legislation applying I fear in New South Wales enables amalgamation to sinbe facUitated rather than handicapped. That is a no good thing. If the honourable gentleman can wheel in anybody who can put up some kind of opposiuon to delay the consohdation of unions, he certainly will take that course whUst, on the other hand, he will go on complaining that the the trade union movement is fragmented to the disadvantage of the Australian people. It will be a good thing when there are fewer in Australia. The position is well known. The statistics have been mentioned in this Parliament on many occasions. In countries Uke West Germany, where the population is in excess of 50 a million people, there are fewer than 20 unions, whUst in this country we have in excess of 300 unions. There is a good case to be made out for industry unions. That is what the New South has Wales Government is facilitating by its The honourable gentleman talked about giveverybody a vote. I suppose that if they had it meethe would get among some kind of ribald mob with the intention of diverting them from the desirable objective of consolidating fragmented a unions. We are sick and tired of this humbug. It is time we had some support for governments which put up progressive legislation which faciliof tates the amalgamation of unions, as the Wran Government is doing in New South Wales. I rose to mention a matter which is of able concern to many constituents in my electorate and probably in the electorate of the honourable gentleman who preceded me in this debate. The Government has announced its intention to withdraw the payment of fees and hving allowances to students who attend non-profit tertiary institutions. The institutions to which I refer are the local business colleges, such as the Metropolitan Business Colleges, of which there is a counterpart in every city of Australia. These colleges offer training facilities predominantly for people who want to start a commercial career. In my electorate- I think the situation there is similar to that which prevails in many other electorates- a young girl goes along to take a shorthand-typing course at the local technical college. There is a great queue of people wanting to get into that place. Unless she has a certain accomplishment in speed as a result of her high school education she cannot get in. The only way she can go forward to tertiary education is by going into a private college. Until now she has been assisted by way of the tertiary allowances which were introduced by the Labor Government in 1974. The announcement has now been made that these allowances will be curtailed as from January 1978. This is of very great concern to many famihes, especially low income families which are unable to sustam young people-no t just girls but young men as well-wh o want to start that kind of career. I am told by the people who are lobbying Fedand eral members of Parliament- I am sure all seem honourable members have received corresponof dence from these people-that something 10 000 students could be thrown out of these colleges to join the dole queue. I regard this as a very undesirable decision to be made by this of a Government. I want to protest as vigorously as I can. This decision would seem to me to be the height of stupidity. It would seem to me to be of the utmost callousness for the Government to callers. adopt such an attitude at thistimewhen young people are representing such a high proportion of the unemployed",102

235,Mr GOODLUCK,HOTEL TARIFFS UP FOR GAMES,"No, it is not about that either. It might seem rather unusual for me to bring into the Parliament a matter that probably does not pertain to national issues, but many young people in Australia tonight and quite a few people in America, of course, are lamenting the fact that Elvis Presley passed away. One could not help but note the words that were said about Elvis Presley by President Carter. I think his words indicated what the people of America thought of Elvis Presley because I think he was symbolic of the American life style and of the changes that have taken place over the past 20 years. I raise this matter as a mark of respect for a person who brought a lot of enjoyment not only to the people of America but also to many people in Australia. Many young people as well as many older people liked Elvis Presley as a singer and are very sorry that he passed away under sad and sorry circumstances. I thought we ought to stop think about this at this time of stress. There to be problems all around us. The President the United States was reported to have said like this about Elvis Presley: He was a symbol of the vitality, rebelliousness and good humour of the United States. His death deprives our country part of itself. The newspaper article went on to state: The White House, however, did not declare a day of nauonal mourning, as suggested by thousands of phone Mr Carter was reported to have stated further: Elvis Presley was unique and irreplaceable. More than 20 years ago, he burst on the scene with an impact that was unprecedented, and will probably never be equalled. a mark of respect I, as a Federal politician, say that I am sorry that Elvis Presley passed but away.

Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows: (1) My department has developed a range of mechanisms to assess attitudes on environmental, urban and community development issues. These regional and local media and face to face contact through the Department's State offices. My Depanment also arranges community forums such as the recent 'National Housing Conference-Housin g and the Community', and the proposed nauonal conference on environmental education which provide an opportunity for the exchange of ideas on such issues. (2) My department has a variety of programs covering contact with the media, publication and distribution of information,filmproduction, education activities and conferences which contribute to public awareness of environmental, urban and community development issues. My depanment will continue to issue regular publications, such as Environs and the Building Industry Quarterly, which are distributed widely throughout in maintaining public awareness. Environment (Field) Study Centres Mr Uren asked the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, upon notice, on 5 May 1977: (1) Did both the House of Representatives Select Committee on Wildlife Conservation and the Committee of Inquiry into the National Estate recommend that the Australian Government, in conjunction with the relevant State Authorities, provide financial ment of Environment (Field) Study Centres.

This nucleus of S2G trained personnel will then be responsible for further operator and maintainer training, all of which will be conducted in Australia. Such further training will be an ongoing commitment during the operational life of the S2G. The personnel listed below, by rank and trade, represent the first group to be trained for equipment not previously used by the Australian ongoing commitment: (a) Fifteen Sub-Lieutenant Observers as AQA-7 operators. (b) Two Chief Petty Officers, six Petty Officers, six Leading Seamen, and 11 Able Seamen Air Technical Communications, as AQA-7 and ARR-7S maintainers. All personnel listed above for S2G traimng will come from S2F squadrons and workshops. No additional personnel are involved. Until the formal Letter of Offer is received the cost of initial training in the United States of America will not be known, but SUSSO.OOO have been allocated in the project for this purpose. (9) The Utter of Offer (Ser 633c/744745) of 14 July 1976 for six S2E aircraft has been amended by Letter of Offer (Ser 633c256392) of 4 March 1977 forsixS2G aircraft. Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 24 May 1977: What were the dates, nature and purpose of Commonwealth Police contacts with Mr James Phillip MCCrudden, the Sydney solicitor who brought Mr Vincent Teresa, the former Boston Mafioso, to Sydney, where the Commonwealth Police met him at the airport and helped him with Customs procedures {Hansard, 5 May 1977, page 1683). Mr Street-The Minister for Adminstrative Service has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: It is not the practice of Commonwealth Police to disclose the nature and purpose of communications they have with members of the public or solictiors acting for clients on official matters. To do so would impair confidence in the Commonwealth Police Force. Teresa was subject to normal Customs entry procedures administered by the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. Federal Government Employees Mr Hodges asked the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Public Service Matters, upon notice, on 26 May 1977: (1) What is the total number of Federal Government employees. (2) How many, and what proportion of the total, come under the ambit of the Public Service Aa. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I have been advised by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Public Service Board that: (1) At 31 May 1977 there were 394 935 Federal Government employees. This figure does not include the 70 400 members of the Defence Force. (2) 157 626 employees, or 39.91 per cent, came under the ambit of the Public Service Act. Interdepartmental Committees Defence Forces, as part of this (Question No. 934) Mr Hodges asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 26 May 1977: (1) How many interdepartmental committees are presently in existence. (2) What topics are they investigating. Mr Fraser-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) It has been the practice of successive governments not to authorise the expenditure of time and money involved in answering quesuons, such as this, which seek generalised information on interdepanmental committees. As I indicated in my answer to Senate Question No. 472 (Hansard, 4 June 1976, page 2474), I do not intend to depart from that practice. However, if the honourable member wishes to seek information concerning any particular interMr Vincent Teresa depanmental committee, I shall be happy to see if he can be provided with the necessary information. (Question No. 866) Anti-pollution Legislation: Effect on Fuel Consumption (Question No. 937) Mr Hodges asked the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, upon notice, on 26 May 1977: (1) Has any study been carried out on the effects of Australian anti-pollution legislation on motor vehicle fuel consumption. (2) If so, what were the results of these studies. Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There has been no large scale study carried out into the effects of Australian anti-pollution legislation on motor vehicle fuel consumption. However I understand that the New South Wales State Pollution Control Commission has recently published the results of a survey in which 189 vehicles were tested using the standard Australian Design Rule 27A driving cycle. (Question No. 933) (2) The results of their tests indicate that vehicle weight is the principal determining factor in fuel consumption. The larger heavier vehicles incurred a fuel consumption penalty of between 5 per cent and 10 per cent, while many vehicles below 1200 kg mass showed only a marginal change, or in a few cases, a marginal improvement. I understand that this f iattern is in accord with United States experience with simiar regulations. Australian Capital Territory Companies Ordinance: Prosecutions Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for Business Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 27 (1) How many persons have been prosecuted for oflences under Sub-division D of Division 4 of Part X of the Comferred f ianies Ordinance of the Australian Capital Territory ast 5 years. (2) How many of these persons were convicted offences, and what penalties were imposed. Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable mempower ber's question is as follows: (1) Five persons have been prosecuted since 1973 for offences under Sub-division D of Division 4 Companies Ordinance of the Australian Capital Territory. (2) Three persons were convicted for a total of eight offences andfineda total of $700 plus costs. Mr Neil asked the Minister for Business and (4) Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 1 June 1977: (1) What percentage of coffee used in the Australian coffee industry is imported from (a) Brazil and (b) Papua New Guinea. (2) What are the prices charged to Australian importers by exporters from (a) Brazil and (b) Papua New Guinea. (3) What are the prices charged by importers to the manufacturers for each type of coffee. Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No precise statistics are available on the origin of coffee used in the Australian coffee industry. However, figures provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that in 1975-76 3.1 per cent of the total quantity of coffee imported into Australia came from Brazil and 37.2 per cent came from Papua New Guinea. In 1974-75 ingfigureswere 5.7 per cent and 38.5 per cent. These statisucs include coffee imported for sale to wholesalers and retailers in addition to that for use in manufacturing industry. (2) and (3) Prices charged to overseas exporters are shown on Customs invoices but this information is treated in commercial confidence by the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and publicly available. Companies that are required to notify the Prices tion Tribunal of proposed increases in coffee prices are, I advised, direct importers. Although the Tribunal, when examining price notifications from these companies, has standing access to the prices at which they import coffee, this informa-is tion is likewise regarded as confidential. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has advised that it lects a small number of price series relating to imported coffee for incorporation in the Price Index of Materials Used in Manufacturing Industry. The prices relate to selected specifications for use in the aggregate index and are not sidered by the Bureau to be sufficiently representative used as an official measure of price levels or price changes imported coffee. Environmental Protection and Inquiries (Question No. 971) (Question No. 945) Mr Hodges asked the Minister for Environand ment, Housing and Community Development, May 1977: upon notice, on 30 May 1977: (1) Has the Commonwealth Government recently transits powers on environmental protection and environin the mental inquiries to the West Australian Government. (2) If so, are agreements of a similar nature to be signed of the with other State Governments. (3) On what basis has the Commonwealth transferred this to the States. (4) Has his attention been drawn to Dr Mosley's comments on these transfers which appeared in the Australian of Part X of the Financial Review of'24 May 1977. Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Coffee Imports (1) No. (Question No. 965) (2) and (3) Not applicable in view of the answer to (1). I have read the press statement from the Australian Conservation Foundation on which the item in the Australian Financial Review is based. I should point out that an agreement has been reached between the western Australian Minister for Conservation and Environment and myself, not between the Commonwealth and Western Australian Governments. This agreement is to rationalise procedural arrangements so that each Minister might fulfil his respective environmental responsibilities without duplication and in full co-operation with the other Minister. I am discussing and progressively making similar arrangements with other State environment Ministers. Private Health Funds: Bulk Billing for Pathology Services (Question No. 973) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Health, the correspondupon notice, on 30 May 1977: Does he have any information from private medical funds regarding claims for pathology services, which supports the proposed abolition of bulk billing for all but eligible pensioners and their dependants, because of the alleged abuse of Australian importers by bulk billing.",106
238,Mr HUNT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable is not made member's question is as follows: JustificaThe Department has received some information of am benefits claims paid by private funds for the December 1976 and March 1977 Quarters, but this information is still outfor several major funds. Until sufficient information available, meaningful analyses cannot be prepared. Even then, there is no guarantee that a crude comparison colof the relative drawing patterns of members of private funds and of Medibank Standard would in itself provide complete information on alleged abuse of bulk billing. For the reasons as to why the Government decided to limit bulk billing for conpathology services to eligible pensioners and their dependto be ants, I refer the honourable member to thereportof the for Pathology Services Working Party which I tabled in Parliament on 25 May 1977. Geelong Commission Act of Victoria Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, upon notice, on 30 May 1977: (1) Does the Geelong Commission Act of Victoria meet the criteria set out by him in Victorian Minister for State Development and Decentralisation, Mr Crozier, for Commonwealth consideration funding. (2) If not, has he informed the Victorian Minister. Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is: (1) The remarks attributed of Geelong as a growth centre were made with regard to assumptions which formed the basis of the early feasibility studies of Geelong undertaken by the Victorian and monwealth governments. (2) The Victorian Minister for Decentralisation Development has recently forwarded me a copy of the revised Geelong Regional Commission Bill and sought my comments on the Bill. I will be responding to the Minister's invitation, but I should point matter for the Commonwealth but for the Victorian Parliament. Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 30 May 1977: (1) What issues still have to be resolved before Stage II of the nauonal dairy plan can be implemented. (2) When is it anticipated that these issues will be setded. (3) What Federal and/or State legislauon will be required.",109
239,Mr SINCLAIR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The main unresolved issues are: (1) Whether market milk should be taken into account in exporters, determining the Nauonal Aggregate Entitlement ment (NAE) and in the allocation of the NAE among States; (ii) The size of the NAE in the first year of operation the entitlement scheme. (2) At its meeting on 1 and 2 August 1977 the Agricultural Councd referred both matters to a Working Party for further examination and report to the October meeting of the Standing Committee on Agriculture view to firm decisions being taken by the Council at it next meeting. (3) Some amendments will be required to the legislation passed by the Parliament during its last sittings for the implementation of Stage I of the new dairy ing arrangements. Some supplementary State legislation may also be required in respect State Aggregate Entitlements.

(5) What action does the Government intend to take to of ensure that coal exporters will not reduce coal exports prior to the 1977 Budget and then increase expons after the Australian Budget, in an endeavour to evade coal duty. Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable memwith a ber's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The Australian Statistician does not compile statistics of the kind sought. However, in his 1976 Budget Speech the Treasurer indicated that the total amount collected in the year 1975-76 was $111,639,834 and that the esindustry markettimate for 1976-77 was $ 112m. (3 ) I do not have access to this information. of the administration of the (4) At this stage I am unable to elaborate on the Treasurer's statement in his 1976 Budget Speech when he that the reduction being effected then was regarded by the Government as a first step towards completely phasing out this particular tax within three years. (Question 990) (5) 1 would expect that coal exporters contractual committo pre-determined shipping schedules would provide little scope, if any, to evade this duty.

The Working Group comprises representatives of the following departments: Science (Convenor) Foreign Affairs Transport Defence Finance Environment, Housing and Community Development. (2) The terms of reference of the Working Group are: 'To report on the long-term transport arrangements for Australian Antarctic expeditions and on the rebuilding requirements at Australia's Antarctic stations.' (3) The Working Group was established by the Interdepartmental Committee on 7 October 1976. (4) The Working Group's report was lodged with the Interdepartmental Committee on 24 June 1977. Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry: Dr Richardson asked the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community and Development, upon notice, on 2 June 1977: What has been the total cost to the Australian taxpayer the Commission which has conducted the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry? Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Expenditure to 30 June 1977 in respect of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry is expected to ne prospect $1,110,000. Undischarged commitments associated with the finalisation of the Inquiry are estimated at $60,000. I should point out that the expenditurefiguresprovided reflect only those costs which it has been possible for my Department to record. Several Commonwealth and State government departments as well as local government instrumentalities have provided assistance or contributed to the operations of the Inquiry since the commencement of the public hearings on 9 September 1975. Such costs have not been recorded. ABC Program Talking Point Mr Eric Robinson- Mr O'Keefe asked me the (Question No. 1037) following question, without notice, on 30 May 1977: Did the Australian Broadcasting Commission's radio stations 2NA and 2UH, on their program Talking Point from 5.30 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday, 22 May 1977, broadcast an interview by a woman with two lesbians that wasfilthyand degenerate, with the interviewer appearing deliberately to lead the conversation on to what they said? Was this a disgusting episode? Is it a fact that this program is described as a current affairs program for 10 to 16 year olds? Who were the producer and director and interviewer in this degrading episode? Will the Minister call for the tape recording of this program and take the necessary action to stop such filth has being broadcast to the Australian people? The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: for Australia's AntarcFollowing my preliminary answer to the honourable member, I asked the ABC for details about the program and received the following information: Talking Point is designed for young adults and since its introducuon has directed attention to a wide range of subjects of concern to them. As to the content of the program broadcast on Sunday, 22 May from 2NA and 2UH, the ABC has advised me that the language used in the program was seen as a breach of ABC guidelines and appropriate action was immediately taken by ABC Management in respect of those responsible for the program. The Executive Producer of the program was a member of the staff of the ABC's Young People's Program Department. The ABC have informed me that action has been taken to avoid a recurrence of a lapse of the type to which attention has been drawn. Gosford-Newcastle Electrification Project (Question No. 724) Expenditure Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, (Question No. 1067) upon notice, on 27 April 1977: (1) Has he undertaken to consider the funding of urban non-urban public transport projects, where they are properly supported by evaluations. (2) Has a benefit/cost analysis been carried out by the for Bureau of Transport Economics in conjunction with the Public Transport Commission of New South Wales on the Gosford-Newcastle electrification project. (3) If so, were the results favourable. (4) Did the New South Wales Minister for Transpon and Highways write to him in December 1976 regarding the of Federal funding for this and other projects; if so, what has been his response. (5) What prospect is there of Federal two-thirds grant being made available for this work. Mr Nixon-This is a replacement answer to trunk that which appeared in the weekly Hansard of 2 centres June 1977 (page 25 78): (1) Yes. (2) and (3) The New South Wales Government submitted a proposal for electrification work between Gosford and Newcastle in 1973/76 esumated omic evaluadon was provided and when reviewed by the Bureau of Transpon Economics produced a benefit/cost rado of 1.03 at 7 per cent discounting and 0.79 when discounted at 10 per cent. No provision was made by the previous Government in its 1975-76 Budget for new projects. (4) and (5) Yes. The Budget provides $5.0m for new projects under the Urban Public Transpon Agreement. The New South Wales Minister for Transpon and Highways had advised that in the circumstances allocations to his State should be directed to the acquisition of suburban doubledeck rail cars. I am also of the view that this project be accorded highest priority within New South Wales. Australian Indonesian Telecommunications Aid communications",110
241,Mr HAYDEN,THE SCHEDULE,"the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 3 May 1977: (1) Was an agreement signed in Jakana on 14 March and 1977 by the Australian Ambassador to Indonesia, Mr R. Woolcott, and the Indonesian Minister for Communications, Dr Emil Salim, covering aid arrangements in the telecomand munications sector. (2) If so, what, in broad terms, were the details of agreement. (3) How much is expected to be provided in aid the project, and over what period. (4) What criteria did the Australian Government apply deciding to suppon the project. (5) In panicular, is the project expected to make any rect contribution towards the elimination of problems of unemployment or (b) poverty in Indonesia. (6) Has the Australian Government arranged for any domestic economic analysis of the project to be carried out which has investigated the social and economic effects of the project; so will he provide details.  member's questions are as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Australia has been assisting the Indonesian Governits ment in the telecommunications sphere since 1968, comof mencing with a study by an Australian Mission of Indonesia's domestic and international telecommunications requirements. The study made recommendations on the feasibility, economic suitability and priority of telecommunimountain-top cations projects in Repelita 1 (the first Indonesian five-year plan concluded in 1974). An outline study for overall development of the Indonesian telecommunications system was also prepared, followed by the drafting of detailed plans, designs and specifications, and provision of associated consultancy services established to advise on the construcover tion of a trans-Sumatra microwave radio system. This system included the building with World Bank finance of a network of nearly 50 microwave repeater stations in Sumatra. Funher specific planning was later undertaken for the development of a telephone and junction network for Jakana telephone subscribers, and the design of local and exchanges and allied cable works for nine provincial in Sumatra, to establish and link the Sumatran subscriber network with the microwave system. The agreement formally signed in Jakana on 14 March 1977 represents thefifthphase of this continuing activity and covers the two year period 1 July 1976 to 30 June 1978. The Australian contribuuon will be concerned with threefieldsas to cost $32.22m. An econfollows: (a) an advisory service to Perum Telekomunikasi and supervision of telecommunications projects which are being supported by Australian development assistance funds; (b) the supply of agreed material and equipment appropriate to the provision of local and trunk exchanges plus cable work at major centres in Sumatra; (c) provision of a general advisory service to Perum Telekomunikasi. should (3) Phase five involves an Australian contribution of approximately $2.3m over the period I July 1976 to 30 June 1978. Ofthe $15m allocated to Indonesia for Australian teleassistance over the period 1969 to 1978, Agreement approximately $13.18m was expended by the end of the (Question No. 788) 1976-77financialyear. (4) Proposals drawn up by aid-receiving countries for donor suppon would normally be examined in some detail by officers of the Australian Development Assistance Bureau its technical advisers to determine their feasibility and economic viability before being accepted as an aid commitment. In this instance, the whole scheme for the construction installation of a telecommunications system to service the needs of Sumatra and its linkage with Jakana were developed conceptually and carried through all planning the and design stages by the Australian Telecommunications Mission established under the aid program for that purpose towards at the request of the Indonesian Government. The Mission staff were provided by the Australian Telein communications Commission and its predecessors. Criteria used both in the selection of a microwave communications disystem from among a number of available communications (a) options, and in the planning and design of local and trunk exchange installations, were identical with those used by the ATC in planning similar projects in Australia to meet our requirements. Planning by the Mission staff necessarily took account of Sumatra's geophysical structure, locaif tion of main population centres, population densities, immediate and projected consumer usage, revenue potential, maintenance needs, operational costs, availability of operstaff, linkage terminal facilities, inter-working with existing equipment, capital costs and many other factors. The plans and specifications were subieaed to searching economic and technical scrutiny by the world Bank before loan to the Indonesian Government for the major element the project i.e., equipment and construction costs for the microwave repeater stations, was approved. (5) The building of accessroadsto nearly 50 hill-top or repeater station sites, actual construction of these stations and installation of radio equipment, all of which were funded by Indonesia, together with cable and exchange installations directly related to the supponing Australian aid input of exchange equipment and materials, provided employment for a substantial Indonesian workforce a penod of several years. In parallel with improvements in road, rail, and other commumcations systems, infrastructure projects such as this lay an essential framework for subsequent development, much of which is employment producing. (6) The World Bank analysis mentioned in (4) above is relevant. The Projea has proceeded basically according to the original plans and progress under Australia's commitment is monitored continuously. No fresh surveys to assess the economic and social impact of the operation have been undertaken by the Australian Government since the project commenced. The need for afinalevaluation study will be considered when the installations have been completed. New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement each Mr Lloyd asked the Minister representing the Overtime Minister for Industry and Commerce, upon notice, on 30 May 1977: (1) What procedures are adopted by the Department of Industry and Commerce to determine whether or not an industry will be affected by the inclusion of a commodity in Schedule A of NAFTA. (2) Is the industry organisation always contacted; if not, why not. (3) If so, was the Australian Mushroom Growers' Association contacted prior to New Zealand being notified that there were no Australian objections to fresh mushrooms being included in Schedlue A; if not, why not.",120
242,Mr HOWARD,THE SCHEDULE,"The Minister for Industry and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) In relation to matters of the Department of Industry of a comodity in Schedule A of NAFTA is considered initially by the Department, after consultation with the relevant industry, prior to reference to the Department of Overseas Trade. (2) Within this context it try to be contacted by the Department of Industry and Commerce and the opinions of industry are taken fully into consideration. (3) Fresh mushrooms do not fall within the responsibilities of the Depanment of Industry and Commerce. I am advised however that following strong objections from local industry to fresh mushrooms being included in Schedule A the Minister for Overseas Trade has deemed that the question warrants reference to the Industries Assistance Commission. Air Traffic Controllers Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 30 May 1977: (1) How many Air Traffic Controllers are employed and at which Australian airports.

Australian Telecommunications Commission (Question No. 1052) Mr Bungey asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice, on 2 June 1977: What would be the estimated reduction in receipts by the $m Australian Telecommunicauons Commission in a full financial year, if current installation charges for the provision of a 2.99 telephone subscriber over 12 km from an exchange were removed. 137.33 Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourJune 1974 able member's question is as follows: If the current installauon charges were removed demand could be expected to rise substantially. As many of these potential subscribers reside at considerable distances from exchanges a precise estimate of reduction in receipts would $ be difficult. Telecom Australia advises that, based on the installation rate achieved in the last financial year, a reduc99,201 tion in receipts of about $500,000 could be expected in a full 243,733 financial year. 1,316 131,910 Australian Ships: Manning Scales (Question No. 1053) Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, 476,160 upon notice, on 2 June 1977: (1) Who determines the manning scales of Australian ships and what are the detailed procedures followed in assessing the size of the crew. (2) Is he required to approve the manning scale for each vessel. Total (3) Is he able to provide any detailed information on man$m $m $m $m ning scales for vessels of comparable trading nations. 3.1 8.5 Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable 2.1 6.6 member's question is as follows: 1.2 3.1 0.5 2.6 (1) Scales for the different categories of crew members on 0.7 2.4 Australian ships are set out in the Schedules to the Navi0.2 0.6 gation Act 1912. The scales cover most crew categories. They may be varied (or categories not covered may be prescribed) 7.8 23.8 in respea of a particular ship by the Minister after taking into consideradon the advice of a Manning Committee. In practice, most ships have at least part of their manning complement determined by the Minister following the deliberauons of a Manning Committee. A Manning Committee is a committee of advice constituted under the provisions of 424 of the Navigation Act and comprises representatives of the owners of the ship, and the relevant maritime union, and is chaired by an officer of the Department of Transport. The members of the committee frequently make $m an inspection of the vessel, and occasionally call witnesses, before making their recommendation on the appropriate 11.28 manning. 3.56 2.80 (2) No-only in those cases where the numbers for a par.45 ticular crew category to be carried on a ship are to vary from the Schedules to the Aa or, in the case of crew categories not .18 set out in the Schedules, where there is a dispute between the parties concerned. The Minister does, however, have the *2.42 power to detain any ship that is considered to be unseaworthy through a deficiency in the numbers or qualifications 20.69 of the crew. on (3) See answer in part (3) of question No. 1055. 'Flag of Convenience' Ships (Question No. 1054) Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 2 June 1977: Do some 'flag of convenience' ships traversing Australian waters operate at times on an unmanned bridge basis during (a) daylight and (b) night hours; if so, is he able to say what steps are taken to ensure that safe operating procedures are followed. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: There is no evidence available to suggest that ships registered in so called 'flag of convenience countries operate on an unmanned bridge basis in Australian waters, either by day or by night. 'Flag of Convenience' Ships Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, registry upon notice, on 2 June 1977: (1) Is he able to say of the number of qualified personnel required to serve on 'flag of convenience vessels operating to Australia is the same as that required on Australian registered vessels. (2) What are the crewing requirements and qualifications necessary for Australian National Line vessels carrying ore from north west Australian ports to (a) overseas destinations and (b) domestic ports. (3) What are the comparable crewing requirements and qualifications necessary on same trade where applicable. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Traditional maritime practice is that the manning of any vessel is a matter for determination some cases, it appears that vessels registered in so called 'flag of convenience countries do have a lesser number of Australian, qualified personnel than that on comparable Australian vessels. However, internationally acceptable minimum standards of marine training and qualifications are currently developed within the framework of the Intergovernmental Maritme Consultative Organization (IMCO) and the work will culminate in an international conference next year. Australia is actively participating in the work of IMCO to ensure that the standards adopted are adequate safety at sea and are uniformly applied by maritime countries. (2) Crew manning and qualifications for Australian National Line (ANL) vessels, wherever they trade, are in conformity with the provisions of the Navigation There is no difference in the prescribed number, or qualifications, of the crews on ANL vessels carrying ore from north west Australian ports to (a) overseas desUnations and (b) domestic ports.
